the form required for final adoption. No ordinance shall contain more than one
subject which shall be clearly expressed in its title. The enacting clause
shall be "The City of Garden City hereby ordains..."

with a regular or special Council meeting and may be adjourned from time to
time. All interested persons shall have an opportunity to be heard. After the
hearing, the Council may adopt the ordinance with or without amendment or
reject it, but if it is amended as to any matter of substance, the Council may
not adopt it until the ordinance or its amended sections have been subjected to
all the procedures required above in the case of a newly introduced ordinance.
Ordinances may be enacted by the affirmative vote of not less than five members
of the Council. Following enactment, ordinances shall again be published within
ten days together with a notice of adoption.
   (C)   Effective date. All ordinances shall take effect ten days after their
enactment, or on such date thereafter as the Council shall declare, but in no
event prior to publication.

official form of electronic communication and shall be available in the office
of the City Clerk. All ordinances shall be published in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City at least once during its consideration.

extend a franchise, regulate the rate charged by any public utility for its
services, or authorize the borrowing of money except as provided in Article IX.
An emergency ordinance shall be introduced in the form and manner prescribed
for ordinances generally, except that it shall be plainly designated as an
emergency ordinance and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration
stating that an emergency exists and describing it in clear and specific terms.
An emergency ordinance may be adopted with or without amendment or rejected at
the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of at least
four members shall be required for adoption. After its adoption the ordinance
shall be published and printed as prescribed for other adopted ordinances. It
shall become operative upon publication or at such later time as it may
specify. Every emergency ordinance shall automatically stand repealed as of the
thirty-fifth day following the date on which it was adopted, but this shall not
prevent reenactment of the ordinance in the manner specified in this section if
the emergency still exists. An emergency ordinance may also be repealed by
adoption of a repealing ordinance in the same manner specified in this section
for adoption of emergency ordinances.
   (F)   Amendments. An ordinance may be amended only by an ordinance passed in
the manner provided in this section, and no such ordinance shall be amended by
reference to its title only, but the section or subsection amended shall be
reenacted in full.
   (G)   Traffic and parking regulations. Any ordinance regulating traffic or
parking of vehicles may delegate, subject to adequate standards to be set forth

forth in traffic control orders which shall be subject to the prior approval of
the Council.

ordinance passed in the manner provided in this article, except that the
ordinance to be repealed may be referred to by its number and title only.

   All ordinances and resolutions shall be recorded by the City Clerk in a book
to be called “The Ordinance Book,” and it shall be the duty of the City Clerk
to authenticate such record by official signature, but the failure of the City
Clerk to do so shall not invalidate or suspend its operation.
SECTION 5.05 COMPILATION OR CODIFICATION.
   Within three years after adoption of this Chapter and at least every ten
years thereafter, the Council shall provide for the preparation of a general
codification of all city ordinances and resolutions having the force and effect

and shall be published promptly in bound or looseleaf form, together with this

Charter, shall be in such form as the Manager deems desirable or the Council
may require. In organizing the budget the Manager shall utilize the most
feasible combination of expenditure classification by fund, organization unit,

summary of its contents; shall show in detail all estimated income, indicating
the proposed property tax levy, and all proposed expenditures, including debt
service, for the ensuing fiscal year; and shall be so arranged as to show
comparative figures for actual and estimated income and expenditures of the
preceding fiscal year. It shall estimate and take into account any anticipated
surplus or deficit as of the end of the current fiscal year, and provide for
elimination of any anticipated deficit. It shall indicate in separate sections:
   (1)   Proposed expenditures for current operations during the ensuing fiscal
year, detailed by offices, departments, and agencies in terms of their
respective work programs, and the method of financing such expenditures;
   (2)   Proposed capital expenditures during the ensuing fiscal year, detailed

for a public hearing on the budget.
   (B)   Hearing; amendment before adoption. At the public hearing Council
shall give all interested citizens the opportunity to express their views on
the proposed budget. After the hearing Council may make such amendments as will
add or increase programs or amounts or delete or decrease programs or amounts,
except expenditures required by law or for debt service or for estimated cash
deficit. However, no amendment to the budget shall ever increase the authorized
expenditures to an amount greater than the total of estimated income; nor shall
any amendment increase the property tax levy proposed in the budget without a
second hearing held thereon following published notice of the proposed change
in tax levy and reason therefor one week prior to the second hearing. Following
the making of amendments Council may adopt the budget.
   (C)   Adoption. The Council shall by ordinance adopt the budget on or before
the twentieth day of the May month of the fiscal year currently ending. If it
fails to adopt the budget by this date, the amounts appropriated for current
operation for the current fiscal year shall be deemed adopted for the ensuing
fiscal year on a month-to-month basis, with all items in it prorated
accordingly, until such time as the Council adopts a budget for the ensuing
fiscal year. Adoption of the budget ordinance shall constitute an appropriation
of the amounts specified therein for the municipal purposes indicated, and
shall constitute a levy of the property tax therein specified, which levy shall
not exceed the tax rate limit stated in this Charter.
SECTION 6.07 COUNCIL ACTION ON CAPITAL PROGRAM.
   (A)   Notice and hearing. The Council shall publish in one or more
newspapers of general circulation in the city the general summary of the

records, and shall be made available to the public at the city library, city
hall, or other locations designated by Council.
SECTION 6.09 AMENDMENTS AFTER ADOPTION.
   (A)   Supplemental appropriations. If during the fiscal year the Manager
certifies that there are available for appropriation revenues in excess of
those estimated in the budget, the Council by ordinance may make supplemental
appropriations for the year up to the amount of such excess.
   (B)   Emergency appropriations. To meet the public emergency affecting life,
health, property, or the public peace, the Council may make emergency
appropriations. Such appropriations may be made by emergency ordinance in
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 5.03 (E). To the extent that there are
no available unappropriated revenues to meet such appropriations, the Council
may by such emergency ordinance authorize the issuance of emergency notes,
which may be renewed from time to time, but the emergency notes and renewals of
any fiscal year shall be paid not later than the last day of the fiscal year
next succeeding that in which the emergency appropriation was made.
   (C)   Reduction of appropriations. If at any time during the fiscal year it
appears probable to the Manager that the revenues available will be
insufficient to meet the amount appropriated, he shall report to the Council
without delay, indicating the estimated amount of the deficit, any remedial
action taken by him, and his recommendations as to any other steps to be taken.
The Council shall then take such further action as it deems necessary to
prevent or minimize any deficit, and for that purpose it may by ordinance
reduce one or more appropriations.
   (D)   Transfer of appropriations. At any time during the fiscal year the
Manager may transfer part or all of any unencumbered appropriation balance
among the programs within a department, office, or agency and, upon written
request by the Manager, the Council may by ordinance transfer part or all of
any unencumbered appropriation balance from one department, office, or agency
to another.
   (E)   Limitations; effective date. No appropriation for debt service may be
reduced or transferred, and no appropriation may be reduced below any amount
required by law to be appropriated or by more than the amount of the
unencumbered balance thereof. The supplemental and emergency appropriations and
reduction or transfer of appropriations authorized by this section may be made
effective immediately upon adoption.
SECTION 6.10 LAPSE OF APPROPRIATIONS.
   Every appropriation, except an appropriation for a capital expenditure,
shall lapse at the close of the fiscal year to the extent that it has not been
expended or encumbered. An appropriation for a capital expenditure shall
continue in force until the purpose for which it was made has been accomplished
or abandoned; the purpose of any such appropriation shall be deemed abandoned
if three years pass without any disbursement from or encumbrance of the
appropriation.
SECTION 6.11 ADMINISTRATION OF BUDGET.
   (A)   Work programs and allotments. At such time as the Manager shall
specify, each department, office, or agency shall submit work programs for the
ensuing fiscal year showing the requested allotments of its appropriation by
periods within the year. The Manager shall review and authorize such allotments
with or without revision as early as possible in the fiscal year. He may revise
such allotments during the year if he deems it desirable, and shall revise them
to accord with any supplemental, emergency, reduced, or transferred
appropriations made pursuant to Sec. 6.09.
   (B)   Payment and obligations prohibited. No payment shall be made or
obligation incurred against any allotment or appropriation except in accordance
with appropriations duly made, and unless the Manager or his designee first
certifies that there is a sufficient unencumbered balance in such allotment or
appropriation and that sufficient funds therefrom are or will be available to
cover the claim or meet the obligation when it becomes due and payable. Any
authorization of payment or incurring of obligation in violation of the
provisions of this Charter shall be void and any payment so made illegal; such
action shall be cause for removal of any officer who knowingly authorized or
made such payment or incurred such obligation, and he shall also be liable to
the city for any amount so paid. However, except where prohibited by law,
nothing in this Charter shall be construed to prevent the making or authorizing
of payments or making of contracts for capital improvements to be financed
wholly or partly by the issuance of bonds or to prevent the making of any
contract or lease providing for payments beyond the end of the fiscal year,
provided that such action is made or approved by ordinance.

   Subject to the exceptions provided by and permitted by law, the taxable
status of persons and property shall be determined as of the thirty-first day

SECTION 7.05 PREPARATION OF ASSESSMENT ROLL.
   The Assessor shall make and complete an assessment roll of the city in the
manner and form provided in the general tax law of the state, not later than
the last working day in February of each year. On the first working day in

SECTION 7.06 BOARD OF REVIEW.
   (A)   Appointment and qualifications.  The Board of Review shall be
appointed by the Mayor, subject to the approval of the Council, and shall be
composed of three persons having the qualifications required by this Charter
for officers of the city, who are taxpayers of the city, and who during their
term of office shall not be city officers, employees, or appointees, or be
nominees or candidates for elective city offices. The filing by a member of the
Board of Review of his nomination petition for an elective city office or the
filing of a consent thereto shall constitute a resignation from the Board of
Review. The appointment of members of such board shall be based upon their
knowledge and experience in property valuation. The Council shall designate
three-year staggered terms and each term shall commence January 1. Compensation
of the members of the Board of Review shall be fixed by the Council. The
members of said board shall take the constitutional oath of office which shall
be filed with the City Clerk.
   (B)   Meetings. The Board of Review shall convene during the first week in
March of each year for the purpose of considering and correcting the roll. One
week after the first working day in March of each year, the assessment roll, as
corrected, shall be open for public inspection. Notification shall be given by
first class mail on or about one week before the meeting of the Board of Review
to owners of property according to the names of such owners and their addresses
upon the tax roll, when their assessed valuation is increased by the Assessor
or the Board of Review by 5% or more over the state equalized valuation for
said property as shown on the tax roll for the year preceding. Failure on the
part of the Assessor to give such notice or of the owner to receive it shall
not invalidate any assessment roll or assessment thereon. The Board shall
convene two weeks after the first working day in March of each year, for the
purpose of hearing the public, and shall continue in session for three
consecutive working days, provided that on the third day, the Board shall
remain in session until 9:00 p.m., and shall remain in session as many days
thereafter as may be required for the completion of its duties.
   (C)   Organization and functions. On the first day of its meeting in each
year, the Board of Review shall elect one of its members chairman. The Assessor
shall be secretary of the Board and shall attend its meeting with the privilege
of participating therein, but without the right of vote upon any decision of
the Board. It shall be the duty of the Assessor to keep a permanent record of
all proceedings, and to enter therein all resolutions and decisions of the
Board. Such record shall be filed with the City Clerk within 30 days after the
adjournment of the Board. A majority of the members of the Board shall
constitute a quorum. For the purpose of reviewing and correcting assessments,
the Board of Review shall have the same powers and perform like duties in all
respects as are by the general tax law conferred upon and required of Boards of
Review in townships. It shall hear the complaints of all persons considering
themselves aggrieved by assessments, and if it shall appear that any person or
property has been wrongfully assessed or omitted from the roll, the Board shall
correct the roll in such manner as it shall deem just. In all cases, the
assessment roll shall be reviewed according to the facts existing on tax day
and no change of the status of any property after said day shall be considered
by the Board in making its decisions. Except as otherwise provided by law, no
person other than the Board of Review shall make or authorize any change upon
or additions or corrections to the assessment roll.
SECTION 7.07 ENDORSEMENT OF ROLL; VALIDITY.
   After the Board of Review has completed its review of the assessment roll,
and on or before the first Monday in April in each year, a majority of its
members shall endorse and sign a statement to the effect that the same is the
assessment roll of the city for the year in which it has been prepared. The
omission of such endorsement shall not affect the validity of such roll. Upon
the completion of said roll and from and after midnight following the last day
of the meeting of the Board of Review, the same shall be the assessment roll of
the city for city taxes on real and personal property that may be authorized by
law and under the provisions of this Charter and shall be conclusively presumed
by all courts and tribunals to be valid and shall not be set aside except for
causes set forth in the general laws of the state.
SECTION 7.08 CERTIFICATION OF TAX LEVY.
   Within three days after the Council has adopted the budget for the ensuing
year, the City Clerk shall certify to the Assessor the total amount which the
Council determines shall be raised by general tax and all amounts of special
assessments which the Council required to be assessed or reassessed upon any
property or against any person or property.
SECTION 7.09 CITY TAX ROLL.
   After the last day for the meeting of the Board of Review, the Assessor
shall, upon receiving the certification of the several amounts to be raised, as
provided in the preceding section, proceed forthwith to spread upon the
assessment roll the several amounts determined by the Council to be charged,
assessed, or reassessed against persons or property; and shall also proceed to
spread the amounts of the general city tax according to and in proportion to
the several valuations set forth in said assessment roll. For the purpose of
avoiding fractions in computation, the Assessor may add to the amount of the
several taxes to be raised not more than 1%; said excess shall belong to the
city.
SECTION 7.10 CERTIFICATION FOR COLLECTION.
   After extending the taxes aforesaid and not later than the first day of June
in each year, the Assessor shall certify said tax roll, and the Mayor shall
annex his warrant thereto, directing and requiring the City Treasurer to
collect from the several persons named in the said roll the several sums
mentioned therein opposite their respective names as a tax or assessment, and
granting to him, for the purpose of collecting the taxes, assessments, and
charges on such roll, all the power and immunities possessed by City Treasurers
for the collection of taxes under the general laws of the state.
SECTION 7.11 TAX LIENS.
   The city taxes thus assessed shall become at once a debt due to the city
from the persons to whom they are assessed, and the amounts assessed on any
interest in real property shall on the first day of July become a lien upon
such real property, and the lien for such amounts and for all interest and
other charges thereon shall continue until payment thereof. All personal taxes
shall also be a first lien, prior, superior, and paramount, upon all personal
property of the persons so assessed from and after the first day of July in
each year and shall so remain until paid, which said tax liens shall take
precedence over all other claims, encumbrances, and liens upon said personal
property whatsoever, whether created by chattel mortgage, execution, levy,
judgment, or otherwise, and whether arising before or after the assessment of
said personal taxes, and no transfer of personal property assessed for taxes
thereon shall operate to divest or destroy such lien except where such personal
property is actually sold in the regular course of retail trade.
SECTION 7.12 NOTIFICATION OF TAXES DUE.
   The City Treasurer shall not be required to call upon persons named in the
city tax roll, nor to make personal demand for the payment of taxes, but he
shall give notice to the taxpayers of the city, by publication in a newspaper
of general circulation in the city at least once, which publication of notice
shall be made at least ten days prior to the first day of July in each year, of
the time when said taxes will be due for collection, and shall give such notice
of the time when said taxes will be due for collection by first-class mail
addressed to the owners of the property upon which taxes are assessed according
to the names of such owners and their addresses as indicated on the tax roll,
which notice shall be deemed sufficient for the payment of all taxes on said
tax roll. Failure on the part of the City Treasurer to give said notice shall
not invalidate the taxes on said roll nor release the person or property
assessed from any penalty or interest provided in this article in case of
nonpayment of the same.
SECTION 7.13 COLLECTION OF CITY TAXES.
   City taxes shall be due and payable on the first day of July of each year.
To all taxes paid after August 31, there shall be added a 4% penalty, and to
all taxes paid after said date, there shall also be added interest at the rate
of ½ of 1% for each amount or fraction of a month intervening between said date
and the date of payment, or the first day of March of the next succeeding
calendar year, which date shall first occur. The added penalties and interest
herein provided shall be a lien against the property to which the taxes
themselves apply, collectible in the same manner as the taxes to which they are
added.
SECTION 7.14 COLLECTION OF DELINQUENT TAXES.
   If the City Treasurer has been unable to collect any of the city taxes on
said roll on real property before the first day of March following the date
when said roll was received by him, it shall be his duty to return all such
unpaid taxes on real property to the County Treasurer in the same manner and
with like effect as returns by township treasurers of township, school, and
county taxes. Such returns shall be made upon a delinquent tax roll to be
prepared by the City Treasurer and shall include all the additional charges and
fees hereinbefore provided, which charges shall, in such return, be added to
the amount assessed in said tax roll against each description. The taxes thus
returned to the County Treasurer are collected under the provisions of the
general laws of the state and shall be and remain a lien upon the lands against
which they are assessed until paid.
SECTION 7.15 PROTECTION OF CITY LIEN.
   The city shall have power, insofar as the exercise thereof shall not
conflict with or contravene the provisions of any general law of the state, to
acquire by purchase any premises within the city at any tax or other public
sale, or by direct purchase from the State of Michigan, or the fee owner, when
such purchase is necessary to protect the lien of the city for taxes or special
assessments, or both, on said premises, and may hold, lease, or sell the same
solely for the purpose of securing therefrom, the amount of such taxes or
special assessments, or both, together with any incidental expenses incurred in
connection with the exercise of this power. Any such procedure exercised by the
city in the protection of its tax lien shall be deemed to be for a public
purpose.
ARTICLE VIII: SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS
SECTION 8.01 GENERAL POWER.
   The City Council shall have the power to determine the necessity of any
local or public improvement with or without a petition therefrom and to
determine that the whole or any part of the expense thereof shall be defrayed
by special assessment upon the property especially benefitted, provided that
all special assessments levied shall be in proportion to the benefits derived
from the improvement.
SECTION 8.02 PROCEDURE.
   The City Council shall prescribe by ordinance the complete special
assessment procedure concerning the initiation of projects, plans and
specifications, estimates of costs, notice of hearings, making and confirming
assessment rolls, and the correction of errors therein, collection of special
assessments, and any other matters concerning the making of improvements by the
special assessment method, subject to the provisions of this Charter. Notice of
hearings shall be given by first class mail to all affected property owners.
When the City may, by law, participate in intergovernmental improvements, the
cost of which may be defrayed in whole or in part by special assessment, the
procedure therefore shall be as provided by the law permitting such
participation. If such procedure is not so provided, the procedure established
by and under authority of this section shall govern.
(Amendment adopted by electorate, 11-4-14)
SECTION 8.03 OBJECTION TO IMPROVEMENT.
   If, at or prior to final confirmation of any special assessment, more than
50% of the number of owners of privately owned real property to be assessed for
any improvement, or in case of paving or similar improvements, the owners of
more than 50% of the frontage to be assessed for any such improvement, shall
object in writing to the proposed improvement, the improvement shall not be
made by proceedings authorized by this Charter without a unanimous vote of all
seven members of the City Council, provided that this section shall not apply
to sidewalk construction.
SECTION 8.04 INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS.
   The City Council may provide for the payment of special assessments in
annual installments, not to exceed 30 in number, the first installment being
due upon confirmation of the assessment roll and the deferred installments
being due annually thereafter, or in the discretion of the Council, may be
spread upon and made a part of each annual city tax roll thereafter until all
are paid. Interest may be charged upon deferred installments at a rate not to
exceed 6% per year payable annually. Under any installment plan adopted, the
whole or any deferred installments with accrued interest to date of payment may
be paid in advance of the due dates established.
SECTION 8.05 MODIFICATION OF ASSESSMENT.
   The City Clerk shall, within 60 days after the completion of each local or
special public improvement, compile the actual cost thereof and certify the
same to the City Assessor, who shall adjust the special assessment roll to
correspond therewith.
   (A)   Additional assessment. When any special assessment roll shall prove
insufficient to meet the costs of the improvements for which it was made, the
City Council may make an additional pro rata assessment.
   (B)   Refunds of assessments. Should the assessment prove larger than
necessary by 5% or less, the same shall be reported to the City Council, which
may place the excess in the city treasury or make a refund thereof pro rata
according to assessment. If the assessment exceeds the amount necessary by more
than 5%, the entire excess shall be credited to owners of property as shown by
the city assessment roll upon which such assessment has been levied, pro rata
according to assessment; provided however, that no refunds of special
assessments may be made which impair or contravene the provisions of any
outstanding obligation or bond secured in whole or part by such special
assessment.
SECTION 8.06 SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ACCOUNTS.
   Moneys raised by special assessments to pay the cost of any local
improvement shall be held in a special fund to pay such cost or to repay any
money borrowed therefor. Each special assessment account must be used only for
the improvement project for which the assessment was levied.
SECTION 8.07 LIMITATION ON SUITS AND ACTIONS.
   No suit or action of any kind shall be instituted or maintained for the
purposes of contesting or enjoining the collection of any special assessment
unless within 30 days after confirmation of the special assessment roll,
written notice is given to the Council of intention to file such suit or
action, stating the grounds on which it is claimed such assessment is illegal,
and unless such suit or action shall be commenced within 60 days after the
confirmation of the roll.
SECTION 8.08 ALL REAL PROPERTY LIABLE FOR SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
   All real property shall be liable for the cost of public improvements
benefitting such property, unless specifically exempted from special
assessments by law.
SECTION 8.09 COLLECTION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
   Upon the confirmation of each special assessment roll, the special
assessments thereon shall become a debt to the city from the persons to whom
they are assessed and, until paid, be and continue to be a lien upon the
property assessed for the amount of such assessments and all interest and
collection charges which may accrue thereon. Such lien shall be of the same
character and effect as that which is created by this Charter for city taxes.
SECTION 8.10 POSTPONEMENT OF PAYMENTS.
   The Council, in the case of any person residing in and owning a single-
family residence who, in the judgement of Council, is by reason of poverty
unable presently to pay an assessment levied against such property for the
benefit received from a public improvement, may provide that payment of such
assessment plus accrued interest at the rate of 6% per annum be deferred until
such time as the property passes out of the hands of such owner or until such
time as the inability to pay is absolved. The Council shall establish the
procedure for making this section effective, which shall include a provision
for execution by the owner of an instrument creating a lien to protect the
city's interest, and a review of poverty status on an annual basis.
SECTION 8.11 LIEN NOT DESTROYED BY JUDGMENT.
   No judgment or decree, or any act of the City Council vacating a special
assessment shall destroy or impair the lien of the city upon the premises
assessed, for such amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged against
the same, or as by a regular vote or proceeding might have been lawfully
assessed thereon.
ARTICLE IX: MUNICIPAL BORROWING POWER
SECTION 9.01 GENERAL POWER.
   Subject to the applicable provisions of state law and this Charter, the
Council, by proper ordinance, may authorize the borrowing of money for any

bonds of the city or other evidence of indebtedness therefor, and may pledge
the full faith and credit of the city for the payment of the obligation created
thereby.
SECTION 9.02 BORROWING LIMIT.
   The net bonded indebtedness incurred for all public purposes shall not at
any time exceed 10% of the assessed valuation of all the real and personal
property in the city, provided that in computing such net bonded indebtedness
there shall be excluded money borrowed for the following purposes: tax
anticipation notes; special assessment bonds even though they are also general
obligations of the city; and revenue bonds and any other obligations excluded
by statute or the state constitution from such limitations.
SECTION 9.03 SPECIAL ASSESSMENT BONDS.
   Bonds issued in anticipation of the payment of special assessments may be an
obligation of a special assessment district or districts and a general
obligation of the city. All collections on special assessment rolls shall be
set apart in a special fund and shall be used only for the purpose or purposes
for which they were levied and for the payment of the principal and interest of
any bonds issued in anticipation of the payment of such special assessments. If
there be any deficiency in the special assessment fund to meet the payment of
any such principal and interest, money shall be advanced from the general funds
of the city to meet such deficiency and shall be replaced in such general fund
when the special assessment fund shall be sufficient therefor.
SECTION 9.04 BOND ISSUANCE AND RECORDS.
   Each bond or other evidence of indebtedness shall contain on its face a
statement specifying the purpose for which the same is issued, and it shall be
unlawful for any officer of the city to use the proceeds thereof for any other
purpose, and any officer who shall violate this provision shall be deemed
guilty of misconduct in office. All bonds and other evidence of indebtedness
issued by the city shall be signed by the Mayor and countersigned by the City
Clerk, under the seal of the city. Interest coupons may be executed with the

Association; the cost of arbitration to be paid for jointly or shared equally

which such delinquency exists may be shut off or discontinued and suit may be
instituted by the city for the collection of the same in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

improvement by the employment of the necessary labor and the purchase of the
necessary supplies and materials with separate accounting as to each
improvement so made, or to do such work by contract duly let after competitive
bidding. Where competitive bids are secured, the city, or any city department
qualified to do the work, may enter a bid on an equal basis with other bidders.
The Council shall also have the power to do any public work or make any public
improvement under any legally constituted plan under which the labor is
furnished by any other governmental unit, department, or agency of the United
States or by the State of Michigan, or which is wholly or in part financed by
them or either of them.
SECTION 10.04 PURCHASING AND CONTRACTS.

specifying, if it is insufficient, the particulars wherein it is defective and

      (2)   An amount which if paid annually by the city over a period of
years, to be determined by the Council, but not to exceed 40 years, will be
sufficient together with applicable fund balances, to provide reserves at the
time of member's retirements for pensions based upon their accrued service; and

natural lifetime of restraints and beneficiaries will be sufficient, together
with applicable fund balances, to provide reserves for pensions payable to said
restraints and beneficiaries.

contributions as determined in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) above, and the city
shall pay such amounts into the pension accumulation fund during the ensuing
fiscal year.

all pensions payable as provided in the operating ordinance.

§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   Unless a violation of this Code or any other ordinance of the city is
specifically designated in the Code of ordinances as a municipally civil
infraction, the violation shall be deemed to be a misdemeanor.
   (B)   The penalty for a misdemeanor violation shall be a fine not exceeding
$500 (plus costs of prosecution), or imprisonment not exceeding 90 days, or
both, unless a specific penalty is otherwise provided for by the violation by
this code or any ordinance.
(‘83 Code, § 10.99)
   (C)   The sanction for a violation which is a municipal civil infraction
shall be a civil fine in the amount as provided by this Code or any ordinance,
plus any costs, damages, expenses and other sanctions, as authorized under
Chapter 87 of Public Act 236 of 1961, as amended, being M.C.L.A. 600.8701 et
seq. and other applicable laws; except as specified in division (C)(3) of this
section. (Ord. 97-008, passed 12-1-97)
      (1)   Unless otherwise specifically provided for a particular municipal
civil infraction violation by this Code or any ordinance, the civil fine for a
violation shall be not less than $20, plus costs and other sanctions, for each
infraction.
      (2)   Increased civil fines may be imposed for repeated violations by a
person of any requirement or provision of this Code or any ordinance. As used
in this section, REPEAT OFFENSE means a second (or any subsequent) municipal
civil infraction violation of the same requirement or provision committed by a
person within any six-month period (unless some other period is specifically
provided by this Code or any ordinance) and for which the person admits
responsibility or is determined to be responsible. Unless otherwise
specifically provided by this Code or any ordinance for a particular municipal
civil infraction violation, the increased fine for a repeat offense shall be as
follows.
         (a)   The fine for any offense which is a first repeat offense shall
be no less than $35, plus costs.
         (b)   The fine for any offense which is a second repeat offense or any
subsequent repeat offense shall be no less than $50, plus costs.
(‘83 Code, § 10.99)
      (3)   A defendant issued three civil infractions for a violation of the
same requirement or provisions committed within any six-month period shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor subject to the fines and penalties set forth in
division (B) of this section.
   (D)   A defendant who fails to answer a citation or notice to appear in
court for a municipal civil infraction, as defined in
§ 10.03, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and is subject to the fines and penalties
described in division (B) in place and instead of those prescribed in divisions
(C)(1) and (2) of this section.
   (E)   If a defendant fails to appear as directed by a municipal civil
infraction citation, or other notice, at a scheduled appearance before the
District Court, or at a scheduled informal hearing, or at a scheduled formal
hearing, the court shall enter a default judgment against the defendant.
   (F)   If a defendant defaults in the payment of a civil fine, cost, or any
installment as ordered by the court, upon the motion of the prosecutor or upon
its own motion, the court may require the defendant to show cause why the
defendant should not be held in civil contempt, and may issue a summons, order
to show cause, or a bench warrant of arrest for the defendant's appearance.
   (G)   If a corporation or an association is ordered to pay a civil fine,
cost, or damages or expenses, the individuals authorized to make disbursement
shall pay the fine, cost, or damages or expenses, and their failure to do so
shall be civil contempt unless they make the showing required in this section.
   (H)   Unless the defendant shows that the default was not attributable to an
intentional refusal to obey the order of the court or to a failure on his or
her part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for payment,
the court shall find that the default constitutes a civil contempt and may
order the defendant committed until all or a specified part of the amount due
is paid.
   (I)   If it appears that the default in the payment of a fine, cost, or
damages or expenses does not constitute civil contempt, the court may enter an
order allowing the defendant additional time for payment, reducing the amount
of payment or of each installment, or revoking the fine, cost, or damages or
expenses.
   (J)   The term of imprisonment on civil contempt for nonpayment of a civil
fine, cost, or damages or expenses shall be specified in the order of
commitment, and shall not exceed one day for each $30 due. A person committed
for non-payment of a civil fine, cost, or damages or expenses shall be given
credit toward payment for each day of imprisonment and each day of detention in
default of recognizance before judgment at the rate of $30 per day.
   (K)   A defendant committed to imprisonment for civil contempt for non-
payment of a civil fine, cost, or damages or expenses shall not be discharged
from custody until one of the following occurs:
      (1)   The defendant is credited with the amount due pursuant to division
(J).
      (2)   The amount due is collected through execution of process or
otherwise.
   (L)   If a defendant does not pay a civil fine or costs or an installment
ordered by the court within 30 days after the day on which payment is due for a
municipal civil infraction action brought for a violation involving the use or
occupation of land or a building or other structure, the prosecutor may obtain
a lien against the land, building or structure involved in the violation by
recording a copy of the court order requiring payment of the fine and costs
with the Register of Deeds for the county in which the land, building, or
structure is located. The court order shall not be recorded unless a legal
description of the property is incorporated in or attached to the court order.
The lien is effective immediately upon recording of the court order with the
Register of Deeds.
   (M) The court order recorded with the Register of Deeds shall constitute
notice of the pendency of the lien. In addition, a written notice of the lien
shall be sent by the prosecution by first class mail to the owner of record of
the land, building, or structure at the owner's last known address.
   (N)   The lien may be enforced and discharged by the city in the matter
prescribed in the Charter for the City of Garden City, by the general property
tax in Public Act 206 of 1893, being M.C.L.A. § 211.1 through 211.57. However,
property is not subject to sale under section 60 of Public Act 206 of 1893,
being M.C.L.A. § 211.60, for non-payment of a civil fine or cost or an
installment ordered by the Court, unless the property is also subject to sale
under section 60 of Public Act 206 of 1893 for delinquent property taxes.
   (O)   A lien created under this section has priority under any other lien
unless one or more of the following apply.
      (1)   The other lien is a lien for taxes or special assessment.
      (2)   The other lien is created before the effective date of the
amendatory act that added to this section.
      (3)   Federal law provides that the other lien has priority.
      (4)   The other lien is recorded before the lien under this section is
recorded.
   (P)   The city may institute an action in accord of competent jurisdiction
for the collection of fines and costs imposed by a court order for a municipal
civil infraction. However, an attempt by the city to collect the fines or costs
by any process does not invalidate or waive the lien upon the land, building,
or structure.
   (Q)   A lien provided by this section shall not continue for a period longer
than five years after a copy of the court order imposing a fine or cost is
recorded, unless within that time an action to enforce the lien is commenced.
(Ord. 97-008, passed 12-1-97)
   (R)   A VIOLATION includes any act which is prohibited or made or declared
to be unlawful or an offense by this Code or any ordinance, and any omission or
failure to act where the act is required by this Code or any ordinance.
   (S)   Each day on which any violation of this Code or any ordinance
continues constitutes a separate offense and shall be subject to penalties or
sanctions as a separate offense.
   (T)   In addition to any remedies available at law, the city may bring an
action for an injunction or other process against a person to restrain, prevent
or abate any violation of this Code or any city ordinance.

   (I)   Changes in zoning, streets, street levels, and utilities are

   (B)   The Development and Tax Increment Financing Plan for the Downtown

   The DDA is currently repaying bonds issued to finance the Ford Road
streetscape. Those bonds are due to be retired in 2019, as reflected in Table
4. Other than the streetscape bonds, at this time the DDA has no plans to incur
any bonded indebtedness to finance the improvement program. Most improvements
will be implemented on a "pay-as-you-go" basis as tax increment revenues are
transmitted to the DDA, or as may be accumulated over more than one year, and
held in reserve to allocate for projects.
   The DDA may obtain a load to fund purchase of the library site, depending
upon the favorability of terms, availability of other funds, and its decision
on whether to purchase the site.

providing for the retirement of officers and employees of the city due to
superannuation or total and permanent disability, providing pensions
supplemental to Federal Social Security benefits, providing for contributions

shall be administered so as to fulfill this intent. Notwithstanding any
provision of this chapter to the contrary, benefits and contributions shall be
limited in accordance with § 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, which is hereby
incorporated by reference. ('83 Code, § 36.02)
   (B)   The effective date of the retirement system shall be April 1, 1955.

the employ of the city for any reason except retirement or death, he or she
shall cease to be a member, and he or she shall forfeit his or her credited
service. In the event the person returns to city service, he or she shall again
become a member, and should he or she return within a period of years not
greater than the number of years of forfeited city service, his or her

pension may be discontinued by the Board, and should refusal continue for one
year, all his rights in and to the pension may be revoked by the Board.
   (B)   If upon a medical examination of a retirant, the physician reports to
the Board that the retirant is physically able and capable of resuming
employment with the city, he shall be restored to active service with the city

RETIREMENT SYSTEM FUNDS
§ 36.50 PENSION SAVINGS FUND.
   (A)   The pension savings fund is continued. It shall be the fund in which
the contributions of members to the retirement system shall be accumulated and
from which refunds of accumulated contributions shall be paid as provided in
this chapter.
   (B)   The contributions of a member to the retirement system shall be 5% of
his annual compensations.
   (C)   The officer or officers responsible for making up the payroll shall
cause the contributions provided for in division (B) of this section to be
deducted from the compensation of each member on every payroll, for every
payroll period, beginning with the effective date of the retirement system, and
continuing so long as a member remains in the employ of the city. When
deducted, contributions shall be paid into the pension savings fund and
credited to the individual account of the member. Every member shall be deemed
to consent and agree to the deductions made and provided for herein, and
payment of his compensations less these deductions shall be a full and complete
discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for the services
rendered by the member during the period covered by the payment, except as to
benefits provided by the retirement system. The members' contributions shall be
made notwithstanding that the minimum compensation provided by law shall be

member, he shall repay to the pension savings fund, in a manner approved by the
Board, all amounts he may have withdrawn from the fund, together with regular
interest thereon computed from the date of withdrawal to the date or dates of

savings fund until he has repaid in full all amounts he owes to the fund.
   (E)   Upon the retirement of a member, his accumulated contributions in the
pension savings fund shall be transferred to the pension reserve fund. Except
as otherwise provided in this chapter, at the expiration of three years from

contributions remaining in the pension savings fund, unclaimed by any
individual or his legal representative, shall be transferred to the pension
accumulation fund.
(‘83 Code, § 36.45)
§ 36.51 REFUND OF ACCUMULATED CONTRIBUTIONS.
   (A)   Should any member cease to be an employee of the city before attaining
his voluntary retirement age for any reason other than his death or retirement,
or after his voluntary retirement age, and not be entitled to a pension, he
shall be paid all or part of his accumulated contributions in the pension
savings fund that he shall demand in writing on forms furnished by the Board.
   (B)   Should a member die before his retirement becomes effective, his
accumulated contributions in the pension savings fund at the time of his death
shall be paid to the person or persons as he has nominated by written
designation duly executed and filed with the Board. In the event there is no
designated person or persons surviving the member, his accumulated
contributions shall be paid to his legal representative.
   (C)   If any member dies without heirs and without having nominated a
beneficiary as provided in division (B) of this section, his accumulated
contributions in the pension savings fund at the time of his death may be used
to pay his reasonable burial expenses, provided that he leave no other estate
sufficient for such purpose.
   (D)   Refunds of accumulated contributions may be made in installments
according to rules and regulations as the Board may adopt from time to time.
   (E)   This division applies to distributions made on or after January 1,
1993. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary that would
otherwise limit a distributee's election under this division, a distributee may
elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Board, to have any
portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
      (1)   Definitions.
         ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTION. An eligible rollover distribution is
any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the
distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include:
any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic
payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life
expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies)
of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a
specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such
distribution is required under § 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code; and
the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income
(determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation
with respect to employer securities).
         ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLAN. An eligible retirement plan is an individual
retirement account described in § 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an
individual retirement annuity described in § 408(b) of the Internal Revenue
Code, an annuity plan described in § 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a
qualified trust described in § 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, that
accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case
of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible
retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement
annuity.
         DISTRIBUTEE. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In
addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the
employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate
payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in § 414(p) of the
Internal Revenue Code, or an eligible domestic relations order under Public Act
46 of 1991, being M.C.L.A. 38.1701 et seq., are distributees with regard to the
interest of the spouse or former spouse.
         DIRECT ROLLOVER. A direct rollover is a payment by the retirement
system to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.
      (2)   If a distribution is one to which §§ 401(a)(11) and 417 of the
Internal Revenue Code do not apply, such distribution may commence less than 30
days after the notice required under § 1.411(a)-(c) of the Income Tax
Regulations is given, provided that the following occurs.
         (a)   The Board clearly informs the member that the member has a right
to a period of at least 30 days after receiving the notice to consider the
decision of whether or not to elect a distribution (and, if applicable, a
particular distribution option).
         (b)   The member, after receiving the notice, affirmatively elects a
distribution.
   (F)   This division shall apply to distributions made after December 31,
2001.
      (1)   For purposes of the direct rollover provisions in division (E) of
this section, an eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity contract
described in § 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and an eligible plan under §
457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code which is maintained by a state, political
subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or
political subdivision of a state and which agrees to account separately for
amounts transferred into such plan from the retirement system. The definition
of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a
surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee
under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in § 414(p) of the
Internal Revenue Code, or an eligible domestic relations order under Public Act
46 of 1991, being M.C.L.A. 38.1701 et seq.
      (2)   For purposes of the direct rollover provisions in division (E) of

spread, and the lands which should be included in the special assessment
district. (‘83 Code, § 100.07)
(Ord. 78-012, passed 5-1-78)
§ 40.04 PUBLIC HEARING; NOTICE.

   (B)   At the time and place specified in the notice for the public hearing,
the Council shall meet and hear any person to be affected by the proposed
public improvement. The hearing may be adjourned from time to time by the
Council, and the Council may make any changes in the proposed work or
assessment which shall seem reasonable or proper in view of any objections, or
for any other reason which may appear to be for the best interests of the
municipality. However, if the improvements intended to be made are enlarged
upon or additions made to the district to be assessed, they shall not be done
until after another hearing is held pursuant to notice as required for original
hearings. (‘83 Code, § 100.09)
(Ord. 78-012, passed 5-1-78)
§ 40.05 RESOLUTION OF DETERMINATION.
   After the public hearing, the Council may, by resolution, determine to make

interest to be charged on installments (not to exceed 6% per annum), designate
the district or land and premises upon which special assessment shall be
levied, direct the Assessor to prepare a special assessment roll in accordance

§ 40.06 SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ROLL.
   (A)   The Assessor shall thereupon prepare a special assessment roll,
including all lots and parcels of land within the special assessment district
designated by the Council, and assess to each lot or parcel of land a relative
portion of the whole sum to be levied against all the lands in the district as
the benefit to each lot or parcel of land bears to the total benefit to all
lands in the district. There shall also be entered upon the roll the amount
which has been assessed to the municipality at large. (‘83 Code, § 100.11)
   (B)   When the Assessor has completed the assessment roll, he shall attach
thereto, or endorse thereon, his certificate to the effect that the roll has
been made by him pursuant to a resolution of the Council (giving its date of
adoption) and that in making the assessments therein, he has, as near as may
be, according to his best judgment, conformed in all respects to the directions
contained in the resolution and the Charter and the provisions of this chapter.
Thereupon, he shall file the special assessment roll with the Clerk, who shall
present it to the Council. (‘83 Code, § 100.12)
   (C)   Upon receipt of the special assessment roll, the Council shall order
it filed in the office of the Clerk for public examination, and shall by
resolution fix the time and place for public hearing when the Council will meet
and review the roll. Notice of the hearing shall be given to each owner of or
party in interest in property in the special assessment district to be assessed
whose name appears on the last local tax assessment records of the
municipality, by mailing a notice by first class mail addressed to the owner or
party in interest at the address shown on the tax records at least ten days

hearing. (‘83 Code, § 100.13)

aggrieved. (‘83 Code, § 100.14)
   (B)   The Council shall meet and review the special assessment roll at the
time and place appointed or at an adjourned date therefor, and shall consider
any written objections thereto. (‘83 Code, § 100.15)
   (C)   If, at or prior to final confirmation of any special assessment, more
than 50% of the number of owners of privately-owned real property to be
assessed for any improvement shall object in writing to the proposed
improvement, the improvement shall not be made by proceedings authorized by
this chapter, except by the affirmative votes of all of the members of the
Council; however, this section shall not apply to sidewalk construction. (‘83
Code, § 100.16)
(Ord. 78-012, passed 5-1-78)
§ 40.08 CORRECTIONS AND CHANGES.
   (A)   The Council may correct the roll as to any assessment or description
of any lot or parcel of land or other errors appearing therein. Any changes
made in the roll shall be noted in the Council minutes. (‘83 Code, § 100.17)
   (B)   After the hearing and review, the Council may confirm the special
assessment roll with such corrections as may have been made, if any, or may
refer it back to the Assessor for revision, or may annul it and any proceedings
in connection therewith. (‘83 Code, § 100.18)
   (C)   The Clerk shall endorse the date of confirmation upon each special
assessment roll, and upon confirmation the roll shall be final and conclusive.
(‘83 Code, § 100.19)
(Ord. 78-012, passed 5-1-78)
§ 40.09 CONTRACTUAL PROVISION.
   In the event that all persons or property owners to be affected by any
proposed improvement agree that the proposed improvement be made and that a
special assessment be levied in connection therewith, the municipality may, in
lieu of the foregoing procedure, enter into a written contract with all of the
persons or property owners affected thereby, which contract, when properly
approved and executed, shall operate as a complete special assessment
procedure, and the assessment shall be made in accordance with the contract.
(‘83 Code, § 100.20) (Ord. 78-012, passed 5-1-78)
§ 40.10 SUBORDINATION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENT TAX LEVIES.
   A special assessment tax lien established under the provisions of the City
Charter or Chapter 41 of this Code may be subordinated by taxpayers when
refinancing a homestead mortgage, upon submission of proof of refinancing and
the approval of the City Treasurer. The City Treasurer may establish
guidelines, upon approval of the City Council, in order to facilitate taxpayers
seeking a tax lien subordination.
(‘83 Code, § 100.21) (Ord. 96-002, passed 2-19-96)
§ 40.11 ASSESSMENT DISTRICT FOR STREET LIGHTING AND SIMILAR SERVICES.

and operation of systems, facilities and equipment for street lighting or other
similar services shall be accomplished pursuant to the improvement procedure
provisions provided under §§

40.08, both inclusive, of this chapter, except and provided, however, that
where such construction or installation is performed by the Detroit Edison
Company, or some other public utility company, and the cost thereof is not
charged to the city or the users of the service, then in such case:
   (A)   The report and recommendation of the City Manager, which may be
required under §
40.03, shall omit all information as to cost of construction and shall include
all other information required by said §
40.03, together with such schedules of existing rates and service charges as
may be submitted to the city by the Detroit Edison Company or other public
utility; and the Council, in acting on such report pursuant to §
40.05, shall consider only such matters as are required by this division;
   (B)   Neither the whole or any part of such cost of construction shall be
assessed against any property within the proposed special assessment district;
   (C)   The regular, approved rates for such service, as charged to the city,
less the amount thereof constituting a general obligation of the city, shall be
annually assessed upon the property especially benefitted, as provided in §§
40.05,
40.06,
40.07, and
40.08;
   (D)   All other sections of this chapter which are inconsistent with or
contrary to the intent of this section, are hereby made and declared to be
inapplicable to all assessments made under this section; and
   (E)   The Department of Public Services is hereby authorized to adopt

§ 41.05 MUNICIPAL ORDINANCE VIOLATIONS BUREAU.
   (A)   Bureau established. The city hereby establishes a Municipal Ordinance
Violations Bureau ("Bureau") as authorized under § 8396 of the Act to accept
admissions of responsibility for municipal civil infractions in response to
municipal civil infraction violation notices issued and served by authorized
city officials, and to collect and retain civil fines and costs as prescribed
by this Code or any chapter.
   (B)   Location; supervision; employees; rules and regulations. The Bureau
shall be located at the City of Garden City Police Department and shall be
under the supervision and control of the City of Garden City Chief of Police.
The Chief of Police, subject to the approval of City Council, shall adopt rules
and regulations for the operation of the Bureau.
   (C)   Disposition of violations. The Bureau may dispose only of municipal
civil infraction violations for which a fine has been scheduled and for which a
municipal civil infraction violation notice (as opposed to a Uniform Law
Citation) has been issued. The fact that a fine has been scheduled for a
particular violation shall not entitle any person to dispose of the violation
at the Bureau. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent or restrict the city from
issuing a municipal civil infraction citation for any violation or from
prosecuting any violation in a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (D)   Bureau limited to accepting admissions of responsibility. The scope of
the Bureau's authority shall be limited to accepting admissions of
responsibility for municipal civil infractions and collecting and retaining
civil fines and costs as a result of those admissions. The Bureau shall not
accept payment of a fine from any person who denies having committed the
offense or who admits responsibility only with explanation, and in no event
shall the Bureau determine, or attempt to determine, the truth or falsity of
any fact or matter relating to an alleged violation. No person shall be
required to dispose of a municipal civil infraction violation at the Bureau,
and may have the violation processed before a court of appropriate
jurisdiction. The unwillingness of any person to dispose of any violation at
the Bureau shall not prejudice the person or in any way diminish the person's
rights, privileges and protection accorded by law.
   (E)   Municipal civil infraction violation notices. Municipal civil
infraction violation notices shall be issued and served by authorized city
officials under the same circumstances and upon the same persons as provided
for citations as provided in §
40.03(F) and (G) of this chapter. In addition to any other information required
by this code or other ordinance, the notice of violation shall indicate the
time by which the alleged violator must appear at the Bureau, the methods by
which an appearance may be made, the address and telephone number of the
Bureau, the hours during which the Bureau is open, the amount of the fine
scheduled for the alleged violation, and the consequences for failure to appear
and pay the required fine within the required time.
   (F)   Appearance; payment of fines and costs. An alleged violator receiving
a municipal civil infraction violation notice shall appear at the Bureau and
pay the specified fine and costs at or by the time specified for appearance in
the municipal civil infraction violation notice. An appearance may be made by
mail, in person or by representation.
   (G)   Procedure where admission of responsibility not made or fine not paid.
If an authorized city official issues and serves a municipal ordinance
violation notice, and if an admission of responsibility is not made and the
civil fine and costs, if any, prescribed by the schedule of fines for the
violation are not paid at the Bureau, a municipal civil infraction citation may
be filed with the district court and a copy of the citation may be served by
first-class mail upon the alleged violator at the alleged violator's last known
address. The citation filed with the court does not need to comply in all
particulars with the requirements for citations as provided by §§ 8705 and 8709
of the Act, but shall consist of a sworn complaint containing the allegations
stated in the municipal ordinance violation notice and shall fairly inform the
alleged violator how to respond to the citation.

to exceed 2% more or 5% less than the actual quantity of water passing through
it. If a meter registers in excess of 2% more than the actual quantity of water
passing throughout it, it shall be considered "fast." If a meter registers in
excess of 5% less than the actual quantity of water passing through it, it
shall be considered "slow."
   (B)   If any meter shall fail to register properly, the Department shall
estimate the consumption on the basis of former consumption records and bill
accordingly.
   (C)   A consumer may require that the meter be tested. If the meter is found
to be accurate or “slow,” a charge, in accordance with the Comprehensive Fee
Schedule in Chapter 12 of this Code, will be made, and the bill will be
adjusted as provided in division (D) of this section. If the meter is found to
be "fast," or in some other way defective, it shall be repaired, no charge
shall be made, and the bill will be adjusted as provided in this chapter.
   (D)   If a meter has been tested at the request of a consumer and shall have
been determined to register "fast," the city shall credit the customer with a
sum equal to the percent “fast” multiplied by the amount of all bills incurred
by the customer within the six months prior to the test, and if the meter so
tested is determined to register "slow," the Department may collect from the
consumer a sum equal to the percent "slow" multiplied by the amount of all
bills incurred by the consumer for the six months prior to the test. When the
Department, on its own initiative, makes a test of a water meter, it shall be
done without cost to the consumer.

pass through the system inadequately treated and into the receiving waters, the
atmosphere, the environment, or will otherwise be incompatible with the system.
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle or reclaim wastewaters or
sludges from the system in an economical and advantageous manner.
      (4)   To provide for the recovery of costs from the users of the Detroit
POTW sufficient to administer regulatory activities and meet the costs of the
operation, maintenance, improvement, or replacement of the system.
   (C)   This chapter regulates the contributors to the Detroit POTW through
the issuance of wastewater discharge permits to certain users and the
enforcement of general requirements for all users, authorizes monitoring and

reports shall be submitted to the control authority no later than 90 days
following the final compliance date for a standard, and at six-month intervals
thereafter on the schedule established by the control authority for each
permittee as hereinabove stated. New sources shall commence reporting at the
time of initial discharge into the system. The reports shall be on a form
prescribed by the control authority or on an approved alternative form and
shall indicate the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge
from each regulated process which are limited by national categorical
pretreatment standards and the records of each day's flow for each process unit
in the industrial user's facility which is regulated by pretreatment standards.
The combined waste stream formula may be used for reporting purposes after the
initial information has been furnished to the control authority, provided there
have been no changes to the elements composing the combined waste stream. These
reports shall contain the results of sampling of the discharge and analysis of
pollutants contained therein cross- referenced to the related flow or
production and mass as required to determine compliance with the applicable
national categorical pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall
be as prescribed in the applicable general pretreatment regulations (40 CFR
403) or by the control authority, whichever is more stringent. All sampling and
analysis shall be performed in accordance with applicable regulations. Where 40

      (3)   Unless more strictly limited in this chapter, any wastewater having
a pH less than 5.0 or more than 10.0 if the equivalent calcium carbonate
alkalinity exceeds 300 mg/l or more than 10.5 if the equivalent calcium
carbonate alkalinity is 300 mg/l or less. If an industrial user wishes to have
a pH limit of 10.5, he shall monitor both pH and alkalinity.
      (4)   Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient
concentration or quantity either singly or by interaction with other pollutants
to cause interference or pass-through or constitute a hazard to humans or
animals.
      (5)   Any liquid gas or solid or form of energy which either singly or by
interaction with other waste is sufficient to create a public nuisance or
hazard to life or is sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for their
maintenance and repair.
      (6)   Any substance which is sufficient to cause the POTW's effluent or
any other product of the POTW such as residues, sludges or scum, to be
unsuitable for reclamation processing where the POTW is pursuing a reuse and
reclamation program. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause
the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria guidelines
or regulations developed under Section 405 of the Act with criteria guidelines
or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid
Waste Disposal Act, the Federal Clean Air Act, the Federal Toxic Substances
Control Act, or state criteria applicable to the sludge method being used.
      (7)   Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate the consent
judgement in U.S. EPA v City of Detroit, et. al. C.A. No. 77-1100, or the
Detroit's National Pollutant Elimination System permit.
      (8)   Any wastewater having objectionable color not removed in the POTW
treatment process such as, but not limited to, dye waste and vegetable tanning
solutions.
      (9)   Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological
activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case
wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into a public sewer which
exceeds 150° F (66°C) or which will cause the influent at the waste treatment
plant to rise above 140° F (60º C).
      (10)   Any pollutant which constitutes a slug.
      (11)   Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of
such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established in compliance
with applicable state or federal regulations.
      (12)   Any floating fats, oil, or grease which are sufficient to cause
interference with or pass through the POTW.

Phenolic (4AAP) compounds which cannot be removed by the POTW
treatment plant as determined by the EPA approved method or   0.5 mg/l
amendments thereto.
      (3)   Iron discharges. Commencing on or before July 1, 1988, no
industrial user classified as a significant user shall discharge wastewater
containing total iron in excess of 1000 mg/l based on a composite sample.
Industrial users having total iron discharge concentrations greater than 1000
mg/l shall submit a compliance schedule by July 1, 1987, for achieving the 1000
mg/l limitation by July 1, 1988. This limitation shall not apply to the
discharge of internal circulating water from heat exchangers during the
cleaning cycle.
   (C)   National categorical pretreatment standards. National categorical
pretreatment standards and requirements promulgated pursuant to the Act by the
effective date of this chapter shall be met by affected dischargers provided,
however, that if a more stringent standard or requirement is applicable
pursuant to this chapter, state law or regulation, then the more stringent
standard requirement shall be controlling. The control authority may, by rule
or regulation require compliance with national categorical pretreatment
standards and requirements promulgated after the effective date of this
chapter. Affected dischargers shall comply with the applicable reporting
requirements under 40 CFR 403 and as established by the control authority.
      (1)   Intake water adjustment. Industrial users seeking an adjustment of
national categorical pretreatment standards to reflect the presence of
pollutants in their intake water must comply with the requirements of 40 CFR
403.15. Upon notification of approval by the U.S. EPA, the adjustment shall be
applied by modifying the permit accordingly.
      (2)   Modification of national categorical pretreatment standards. The
control authority may apply to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, or
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, whichever is applicable, for
authorization to grant removal credits in accordance with the requirements and
procedures of 40 CFR 403.7. Authorization may only be granted when the POTW
Treatment Plant can achieve consistent removal for each pollutant for which a
removal credit is being sought, provided that any limitation on the pollutant
(s) in the NPDES permit are neither being exceeded nor pose the prospect of
being exceeded as a result of the removal credit being granted. Should this
authorization be given to the control authority, any industrial user desiring
to obtain this credit shall make an application to the control authority
consistent with the provisions of 40 CFR 403.7 and this chapter. Any credits
which may be granted under this provision may be subject to modification or
revocation as specified in 40 CFR 403.7 or as determined by the control
authority. A prerequisite to the granting of any removal credit may be that the
industrial user pay a surcharge based on the amounts of pollutants removed by
the POTW, the surcharge being based on fees or rates which the Board may
establish and, when appropriate, revise from time to time. Permits shall
reflect or be modified to reflect any credit granted pursuant to this section.
   (D)   Dilution prohibited. No user shall increase the use of processed water
or, in any way, dilute or attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or
complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the
limitations contained in the national categorical pretreatment standards, or in
any other pollutant-specified limitations or requirement imposed by this
chapter. Combining in-plant waste streams or modulating the release of
pollutants upstream of the sampling point prior to the point of discharge into
the public sewer shall not be construed as dilution except as otherwise
restricted by national categorical pretreatment standards or requirements.
   (E)   Hauled-in wastewater. Unloading liquid or solid waste from hauling
vehicles directly into the POTW with or without the benefit of pretreatment is
prohibited unless the person proposing to unload the waste has applied for and
received a permit from the control authority for unloading the waste in
accordance with the Board's rules pertaining thereto. The discharger shall be
subject to applicable terms, conditions, surcharges, fees or rates as
established by the Board. The control authority may establish specific
limitations for sludge from municipally-owned or operated POTW treatment plants
which are different than the specific limitations in this chapter.
   (F)   Right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish different
or more stringent limitations or requirements of discharges to the POTW.
   (G)   Accidental discharges. Each industrial user shall provide protection
from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated
by this chapter. Facilities and measures to prevent and abate accidental
discharges shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or industrial user's
cost or expense. All significant users shall submit to the control authority
detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide
protection against accidental discharges. All existing significant users shall
complete and submit a plan within 180 days of the effective date of this
chapter. New significant users shall submit such a plan prior to the time they
commence discharging.
   (H)   Notification requirements. Within one hour of becoming aware of a
discharge into the POTW which exceeds or does not conform with federal, state,
control authority, or city laws, rules, regulations, or permit requirements and
the degree exceeded appears to be more than twice the allowable concentration,
the industrial user shall telephone the control authority at its control center
and notify the control authority of the discharge. The notification shall
include the name of the caller, location and time of discharge, type of
wastewater, estimated concentration of excessive or prohibited pollutants and
estimated volume. Within five calendar days after the discharge, the industrial
user shall submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the
discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future
occurrences. When required by the control authority, the industrial user's
wastewater discharge permit shall be modified to include additional measures to
prevent future occurrences. Notification shall not relieve the industrial user
of any expense, loss, damages, or other liability which may be incurred as a
result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other environmental impairment
or any other damage to person or property. However, notification received
pursuant to this division or information obtained by the exploitation of
notification shall not be used against any individual in any criminal case,
except a prosecution for perjury or for giving a false statement. Immunity
shall not bar the criminal prosecution of non-natural persons nor shall it bar
the pursuit of administrative or civil remedies against any person.
   (I)   Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to contact in
the event of an actual or potential excessive or prohibited discharge.
   (J)   Recovery of costs. Any user discharging in violation of any of the
provisions of this chapter which produces a deposit of obstruction, or causes
damage to or impairs the POTW, or causes Detroit to violate its NPDES permit,
shall be liable for any expense, loss, damage, penalty, or fine incurred
because of the violation or discharge. Prior to assessing costs, the control
authority shall notify the user of its determination that the user's discharge
was the proximate cause of the damage, obstruction, impairment, or violation of
Detroit's NPDES permit, and the intent to assess the costs to the user. Any
notice shall include written documentation which substantiates the
determination of proximate cause and breakdown of cost estimates. Failure to
pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The charge
shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, any penalties or remedies provided
under this chapter, other ordinances, statues, regulations, or at law or in
equity.
   (K)   Variance. The Director may grant a variance from the limitations set
forth in divisions (A) and (B) of this chapter in accordance with rules adopted
by the control authority which set forth the guidelines, standards, procedures,
fees, and charges by which a person may be granted such a variance. A variance
shall not be granted to a user if it would result in a violation of an
applicable national categorical pretreatment standard or allow a prohibited
discharge (violate 40 CFR 403.5) or cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with
its NPDES permit. A user requesting a variance shall have the burden of showing
that any guidelines or standards adopted by the Board have been met before a
variance may be granted. The Board may adopt fees or charges for reviewing a
variance application which shall be paid by a user upon applying for a
variance.

§ 52.36 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   Significant users shall provide, operate, and maintain at their own expense
a sampling manhole or special structure to facilitate monitoring, inspection,
sampling, and flow measurement of their discharge by the control authority and
the industrial user, and to enable the control authority to conduct other
monitoring and sampling as required for determining compliance with discharge
requirements, limits, and standards as provided by this chapter. The sampling
manhole should be situated on the industrial user's premises in a location
readily accessible to the control authority. It shall be the responsibility of
the industrial user to obtain any necessary approvals from the city or other
government entities which may be required by the location and construction of
monitoring facilities in the public street or sidewalk area. This construction
shall only occur when another location would be impractical or cause undue
hardship upon the industrial users. In no case shall the location be obstructed
by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near the
sampling or monitoring manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and
preparation of samples for analysis. The facility and any permanently installed
sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition at the expense of the industrial user. Whether
constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring
facilities shall be provided in accordance with the control authority's
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications.

§ 52.37 INSPECTION, SAMPLING AND RECORDS.
   For purposes of administering and enforcing this chapter, the control
authority may inspect the establishment, facility, or other premises of the
industrial user. The control authority shall have ready access to the
industrial user's premises to engage in inspection, sampling, compliance
monitoring and/or metering activities. Each inspection activity shall be
commenced and completed at reasonable times, within reasonable limits, and in a
reasonable manner. The control authority shall, upon arrival at the industrial
user's premises, inform the industrial user or the industrial user's employees
that sampling and/or inspection is commencing, and that the industrial user has
the right to observe the inspection and/or sampling. While performing work on
private properties, the control authority and the city shall observe all
reasonable safety, security and other reasonable rules applicable to the
premises established by the industrial user. Representatives of the control
authority shall bear proper credentials and identification and shall be
accompanied by a representative of the industrial user, at the industrial
user's option. The control authority shall have no authority to inquire into
any process beyond that point having a direct bearing on the kind and source of
discharge to the POTW. However, employees or representatives shall not be
restricted from viewing any of the facility site. The control authority may
take photographs of facilities subject to this chapter unless specifically
prohibited by the industrial user upon request to be permitted to take
photographs. Where an industrial user has security measures in force, the
industrial user shall make prompt and necessary arrangements with the security
personnel so that upon presentation of appropriate credentials, the control
authority will be permitted to enter immediately for the purposes of performing
their specific responsibilities. Significant users shall sample and analyze
their discharges in accordance with the provisions of their permits. The
control authority may request the samples to be split for the control
authority's independent analysis. Industrial users shall maintain records of
all information from monitoring activities required by this chapter or by 40
CFR 403.12(n). Industrial users shall maintain the records for no less than
three years. This period of record retention shall be extended during the
course of any unresolved litigation regarding the discharge of pollutants by
the industrial user or the operation of Detroit's industrial pretreatment
program or when requested by the control authority, EPA, or the state.
Industrial users shall, upon the request of the control authority, furnish
information and records relating to discharges to the POTW. Industrial uses
shall make the records readily accessible at all reasonable times, and allow
the control authority to copy the records. In the event the control authority
obtains samples, and analyses are made of the sample, a copy of the results of
the analyses shall be promptly furnished to the owner, operator, or agent in
charge of the premises upon written request by the industrial user's authorized
representative. When requested by the industrial users, the control authority
shall leave a portion of any sample of the user's discharge taken from any
sampling point on or adjacent to the premises for the user's independent
analysis. In case of disputes arising over shared samples, the portion taken
and analyzed by the control authority shall be controlling unless proven
invalid. In the event a grab sample of the industrial user's discharge is
obtained and analyzed by the control authority and found to contain
concentrations of pollutants which are two or more times greater than the
numeric limitations for composite samples as listed in § 54.35(B) of this
chapter, the industrial user shall be required to provide a written report
describing the cause of greater concentration, and a description of the means
by which the concentration may be held to values of less than two times the
composite sample concentration limitation in the future.

§ 52.38 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   (A)   Information and data on an industrial user obtained from written
reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs
and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental
agencies without restriction unless the industrial user specifically requests
and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the control authority that
the release of the information would divulge information, processes or methods
of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the industrial user.
All claimed confidential information must be clearly marked “Confidential.”
When requested by the person furnishing the report, the portions of a report
which disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available
for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon written request
to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, State Disposal System
permit and/or the Pretreatment programs, provided, however, that the portions
of report shall be available for use by any local, state, or federal agency in
judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information. Information accepted by the control authority as
confidential shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency until and
unless a ten-day notification of intent to transmit is first given to the
industrial user.
   (B)   All information with respect to an industrial user on file with the
control authority shall be made available upon request by that user or the
user's authorized representative during normal business hours.

   (A)   Violations. It shall be a violation of this chapter for any user to do
any of the following.
      (1)   Fail to completely and/or accurately report the wastewater
constituents and/or characteristics of the industrial user's discharge.
      (2)   Fail to report significant changes in the industrial user's
operations or wastewater constituents and/or characteristics.
      (3)   Refuse reasonable access to the industrial user's premises or waste
discharge for the purpose of inspection or monitoring.
      (4)   Fail to comply with any condition or requirement of the industrial
user’s wastewater discharge permit.
      (5)   Fail to comply with any limitation, prohibition, or requirement of
this chapter, including any rule, regulation, or order issued hereunder;
however, if an industrial user acts in full accordance with a compliance
schedule approved and incorporated into the industrial user's wastewater
discharge permit pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, that industrial
user shall be deemed to be in compliance schedule. Industrial users acting in
full compliance with wastewater discharge permits issued prior to the effective
date of this chapter shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements
of this chapter and the permits shall remain in effect and be enforceable under
this chapter until the expiration date of the permit or until a superseding
permit is issued, whichever occurs first. Industrial users shall comply with
national categorical pretreatment standards and requirements on the date
specified in the federal regulations, regardless of compliance schedules.
   (B)   Upsets. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with limits imposed under this chapter or national
categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of division (B)(1) are
met.
      (1)   An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or
other relevant evidence that the following are true.
         (a)   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the
specific cause(s) of the upset.
         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures.
         (c)   The industrial user has submitted the following information to
the department, orally or in writing, within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five days).
            1.   A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance.
            2.   The period of noncompliance including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue.
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (2)   In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (3)   The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to
the extent necessary to maintain compliance with this chapter upon reduction,
loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
   (C)   Emergency suspensions and orders. The control authority may order
suspension of the sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater
discharge permit where suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the control
authority, to stop any actual or threatened discharge which presents or may
present an imminent or significant hazard to the health or welfare of persons

protection of public health and safety, and because of the widely varying
quality characteristics of the sewage discharged by different users of the
public sewer and the publicly-owned treatment works, it is the objective of
this section to impose sewage charges which reflect the cost of treating sewage
strength factors as well as sewage volume. These charges to commercial and
industrial users will be in the form of a payment called a surcharge and will
reflect industries equitable costs of wastewater treatment in excess of the
strength of the domestic sewage. Sewage charge will be based on a volume rate
and surcharge based on volume of discharge and the strength of BOD, suspended
solid, phosphorous, fats, oil and grease or other pollutants present in the
wastewater. In the event other pollutants are required to be surcharged under
this subchapter, authorized variances, or by special arrangements with the
owner of the publicly-owned treatment works, the rules and regulations adopted
herein will apply, the rules and regulations being on file with the City Clerk.
      (2)   Authority. This section is adopted pursuant to and in accordance
with the requirements of Federal Law Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1231 et seq. and
applicable Federal Regulations, the requirements of the Settlement Agreement in
U.S. v City of Detroit, et al, Civil Action #7-71111.
      (3)   Industrial waste pollutant strength surcharges. It is ordained that
the Schedule of Industrial Waste Pollutant Strength Surcharges is hereby
adopted and made effective for users of the wastewater system of the city. The
surcharges are to be computed as follows.
            Computation of Industrial Waste Pollutant Strength Surcharge
   The industrial waste pollutant strength surcharge shall be computed in
accordance with the following formula.
   SC = 0.0624 V a(BOD-275) + b(TSS-350)+c(P-12)+d(FOG-100)
In which the following apply.
   SC = Pollutant strength surcharge fee in dollars for the billing period in
Mcf (1000 cubic feet).
   V = Volume of waste discharged in the billing period in Mcf (1000 cubic
feet).
   BOD = Five-day biochemical oxygen demand of the waste expressed in
milligrams per liter (ppm).
   TSS = Total suspended solids in the waste expressed in milligrams per liter
(ppm).
   P = Phosphorus in the waste expressed in milligrams per liter (ppm).
   FOG = Fats, oils, and grease expressed in milligrams per liter (ppm).
   a, b, c, d = Surcharge rates, $/pound for treating BOD, TSS, P, and FOG
respectively.
   0.0624 = Factor which converts Mcf to MM lbs.
   a = $.254.285/pound.
   b = $324.341/pound.
   c = $3.7293.862/pound.
   d = $.221/2.55/pound.
      (4)   Compliance required. In accordance with the basic service agreement
between the city, the county, and the Wayne County Board of Public Works or
other properly designated agent of the county named pursuant to M.C.L.A. §§
46.171 through 46.185, and M.C.L.A. §§ 123.71 et seq., this
section provides that any person, firm, or corporation discharging wastewater
into the publicly-owned sewer system shall comply with the standards, rules and
regulations controlling the quality or quantity of discharge or wastewater into
the system. The standards, rules, and regulations shall be established from

which, on March 31 preceding, have remained unpaid for a period of 90 days to
the City Assessor, who shall place the same, together with an additional
penalty equaling 25% of the amount, on the next tax roll of the city. The
charges so assessed shall be collected in the same manner as general city
taxes. In cases where the city is properly notified in accordance with Public
Act 94 of 1933 that a tenant is responsible for water supply or sewage disposal
service charges, no service shall be commenced or continued to the premises
until there has been deposited with the City Treasurer a sum sufficient to
cover three times the average quarterly bill for the premises as estimated by
the City Treasurer, the deposit to be in no case less than $100.
   (C)   Where the water supply or sewage disposal service to any premises has
been discontinued to enforce the payment of water supply or sewer disposal
service charges, services shall not be recommenced until all delinquent charges
have been paid, and a deposit made in the case of tenants, and a turn-on fee,
charged in accordance with the Comprehensive Fee Schedule in Chapter 12 of this
Code, is paid to the city.
   (D)   In any other case where, in the discretion of the City Treasurer, the
collection of charges for water supply or sewage disposal service may be
difficult or uncertain, he may require a similar deposit. Deposits may be
applied against any delinquent water supply or sewage disposal service charges,
and the application thereof shall not affect the right of the City Treasurer to
discontinue the water supply and/or sewage disposal service, to any premises
for any delinquency thereby satisfied. No deposit shall bear interest, and the
deposit, or any remaining balance thereof, shall be returned to the customer
making the same when he shall request in writing a discontinuation of water
supply and sewage disposal service.

as would be paid by a private customer for the same service. All charges for
service shall be payable quarterly from the current funds of the city, or from
the proceeds of taxes which the city, within constitutional limits, is herein
authorized and required to levy in amounts sufficient for that purpose.

§ 55.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general
health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in the city, and the
watersheds to which it drains, and to comply with the city’s National Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit and other applicable federal and
state regulations.
   (B)   This chapter seeks to meet that purpose by minimizing the negative
impacts of increased stormwater discharges from new land development and
redevelopment through the following objectives:
      (1)   To minimize increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes from
identified land development and redevelopment;
      (2)   To minimize nonpoint source pollution;
      (3)   To minimize the deterioration of existing watercourses, culverts
and bridges, and other structures;
      (4)   To encourage water recharge where geologically favorable conditions
exist;
      (5)   To maintain the ecological integrity of stream channels;
      (6)   To minimize the negative impacts of development on downstream
channel stability;
      (7)   To preserve and protect water supply facilities and water resources
by controlling increased flood discharges, stream erosion, and runoff
pollution;
      (8)   To reduce the adverse impact of changing land use on water bodies
and, to that end, this chapter establishes minimum standards to protect water
bodies from degradation resulting from changing land use where stormwater
management controls are insufficient to meet water quantity and quality goals;
      (9)   To ensure that storm drains and stormwater BMPs are adequate to
address stormwater management needs within a proposed development, and for
protecting downstream landowners from flooding and degradation of water
quality. The procedures, standards, and recommendations set forth in this
chapter and the current Wayne County Stormwater Control Program are designed
for these purposes;
      (10)   To ensure that all stormwater facilities necessary for a proposed
development will have an appropriate governmental unit responsible in
perpetuity for performing maintenance or for overseeing the performance of
maintenance by a private entity;
      (11)   To facilitate the integration of stormwater management and
pollution control with other ordinances, programs, policies, and the
comprehensive plans of the city;
      (12)   To establish legal authority to carry out all of the inspection
and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.

§ 55.08 STANDARDS FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN (STORMWATER
PLAN) APPROVAL.
   (A)   All developments requiring a stormwater plan shall be designed,
constructed, and maintained to prevent flooding, minimize stream channel
impacts, protect water quality, and achieve the purposes of this chapter, as
stated above. The city has adopted performance standards to meet the objectives
of managing the quantity and quality of stormwater runoff from a site as
described below and in the current Wayne County Stormwater Control Program.
   (B)   Designers may select any combination of stormwater BMPs that meet the
performance standards provided the selections:
      (1)   Comply with the requirements identified in this chapter and the
current Wayne County Stormwater Control Program;
      (2)   Comply with all other local, county, state, or federal
requirements; and
      (3)   Do not conflict with the existing, local stormwater management and
watershed plans.
   (C)   The particular facilities and measures required onsite shall take into
consideration the natural features, upland areas, wetlands, and watercourses on
the site; the potential for onsite and offsite adverse stormwater impacts,
water pollution, and erosion; and the size of the site.
   (D)   The following onsite stormwater management concepts must be followed.
      (1)   Natural topography and site drainage shall be preserved and site
grading shall be minimized to the maximum extent reasonably achievable
considering the nature of the development.
      (2)   The preferred conveyance strategy is to transport, wherever
possible, untreated and treated runoff in conveyance facilities open to the
atmosphere (e.g. swales, vegetated buffer strips, energy-dissipating
structures, and the like), rather than through enclosed pipes, so as to
decrease runoff velocity, allow for natural infiltration, allow suspended
sediment particles to settle, and to remove pollutants.
      (3)   Watercourses shall not be deepened, widened, dredged, cleared of
vegetation, straightened, stabilized, or otherwise altered without applicable
permits or approvals from the City Engineer, relevant county agencies and the
applicable state department(s).
      (4)   The stormwater plan and associated BMPs must demonstrate compliance
with required volume and channel protection criteria by providing retention as
necessary to meet volume and peak flow limits consistent with the requirements
of the design manual. Specific details for achieving compliance with the volume
and channel protection criteria are outlined in the design manual.
      (5)   The stormwater plan and associated BMPs must demonstrate compliance
with required water quality criteria by providing treatment of total suspended
solids (TSS) or by providing retention to achieve the same criteria for maximum
TSS concentrations in the stormwater discharge from the site, with either
approach being consistent with the requirements of the design manual. Specific
details for achieving compliance with the water quality criteria are outlined
in the design manual.
      (6)   The stormwater plan and associated BMPs must demonstrate compliance
with required peak flow rate and flood control criteria by providing stormwater
detention and/or retention consistent with the requirements of the design
manual. Specific details for achieving compliance with the peak flow rate and
flood control criteria are outlined in the design manual.
      (7)   Under certain conditions, the city, upon recommendation by the City
Engineer, may impose the following additional restrictions on stormwater
discharges.
         (a)   Peak discharge may be further restricted when it can be shown
that a probable risk to downstream structures or unique natural areas exists,
or that existing severe flooding problems could be further aggravated.
         (b)   Measures shall be imposed to protect against ground or surface
water pollution where the nature of the soils or bedrock underlying a
stormwater management structure constitutes a substantial risk of
contamination, such as might be the case in limestone formations. Special
provisions to be followed in these cases will be provided by the City Engineer.
   (E)   Stormwater offsets may be considered in accordance with the provisions
provided in the current Wayne County Stormwater Control Program, where water
quantity or water quality BMPs required by this chapter cannot be fully
accommodated onsite.

   (A)   (1)   When the axle spacing is nine feet or more between axles, the
maximum axle load shall not exceed 18,000 pounds for vehicles equipped with
high pressure pneumatic or balloon tires.
      (2)   When the axle spacing is less than nine feet between two axles but
more than 3½ feet, the maximum axle load shall not exceed 13,000 pounds for
high pressure pneumatic or balloon tires.
      (3)   When axles are spaced less than 3½ feet apart, the maximum axle
load shall not exceed 9,000 pounds per axle.
      (4)   Subdivisions (A)(1), (A)(2), and (A)(3) of this section shall be
known as the normal loading maximum.
   (B)   When normal loading is in effect, the state transportation department
and local authorities with respect to highways under their jurisdiction may
designate certain highways, or sections of those highways, where bridges and
road surfaces are adequate for heavier loading, which designation may be
revised as needed, on which the maximum tandem axle assembly loading shall not
exceed 16,000 pounds for any axle of the assembly, if there is no other axle
within nine feet of any axle of the assembly.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (H) of this section, on a legal
combination of vehicles, only one tandem axle assembly shall be permitted on
the designated highways at the gross permissible weight of 16,000 pounds per
axle, if there is no other axle within nine feet of any axle of the assembly,
and if no other tandem axle assembly in the combination of vehicles exceeds a
gross weight of 13,000 pounds per axle. When the maximum gross weight of a
combination of vehicles with load does not exceed 73,280 pounds, two tandem
axle assemblies shall be permitted on the designated highways at a gross
permissible weight of 16,000 pounds per axle, if there is no other axle within
nine feet of any axle of the assembly.
   (D)   The normal size of tires shall be the rated size as published by the
manufacturers, and the maximum wheel load permissible for any wheel shall not
exceed 700 pounds per inch of width of tire.
   (E)   During the months of March, April, and May in each year, the maximum
axle load allowable on concrete pavements, or pavements with a concrete base,
shall be reduced by 25% from the maximum axle load as specified in this
chapter, and the maximum axle loads allowable on all other types of road during
these months shall be reduced by 35% from the maximum axle loads as specified.
The maximum wheel load shall not exceed 525 pounds per inch of tire width on
concrete and concrete base, or 450 pounds per inch of tire width on all other
roads during the period the seasonal road restrictions are in effect.
   (F)   The city may suspend the restrictions imposed by this subchapter when
and where, in its discretion, conditions of the highways or the public health,
safety, and welfare so warrant, and may impose the restricted loading
requirements of this subchapter on designated highways at any other time that
the conditions of the highway may require.
   (G)   For the purpose of enforcement of this act, the gross vehicle weight
of a single vehicle and load or a combination of vehicles and loads shall be
determined by weighing individual axles or groups of axles, and the total
weight on all the axles shall be the gross vehicle weight. In addition, the
gross axle weight shall be determined by weighing individual axles or by
weighing a group of axles and dividing the gross weight of the group of axles
by the number of axles in the group. Pursuant to division (H) of this section,
the overall gross weight on a group of two or more axles shall be determined by
weighing individual axles or several axles, and the total weight of all the
axles in the group shall be the overall gross weight of the group.
   (H)   The loading maximum in this section shall apply to interstate
highways, and the city may designate a highway, or a section of a highway, for
the operation of vehicles having a gross vehicle weight of not more than 80,000

equaling: in which: W = overall gross weight on a group of two or more
consecutive axles to the nearest 500 pounds; L = distance in feet between the
extreme of a group of two or more consecutive axles; N = number of axles in the
group under consideration; except that two consecutive sets of tandem axles may
carry a gross load of 34,000 pounds each if the first and last axles of the
consecutive sets of tandem axles are not less than 36 feet apart. The gross
vehicle weight shall not exceed 80,000 pounds, including all enforcement
tolerances. Except for five-axle truck tractor, semi-trailer combinations
having two consecutive sets of tandem axles, vehicles having a gross weight in
excess of 80,000 pounds or in excess of the vehicle gross weight determined by
application of the formula in this division shall be subject to the maximum
axle loads of divisions (A) through (C) of this section. As used in this
division TANDEM AXLE WEIGHT means the total weight transmitted to the road by
two or more consecutive axles, the centers of which may be included between
parallel transverse vertical planes spaced more than 40 inches, but not more
than 96 inches, apart, extending across the full width of the vehicle.

§ 70.99 
§ 70.61 INSPECTION FOR EXCESSIVE LOADS,
   (A)   A police officer or a duly authorized agent of the city having reason
to believe that the weight of a vehicle and load is unlawful may require the
driver to stop and submit to a weighing of the vehicle by either portable or
stationary scales approved and sealed by the Department of Agriculture as a
legal weighing device, and may require that the vehicle be driven to the
nearest weighing station of the State Transportation Department for the purpose
of allowing an officer or agent of the city to determine whether the conveyance
is loaded in conformity with this subchapter.
   (B)   When the officer or agent, upon weighing a vehicle and load,
determines that the weight is unlawful, the officer or agent may require the
driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable place and remain standing until that
portion of the load is shifted or removed as necessary to reduce the gross axle
load weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted under this subchapter. All
material unloaded as provided under this division shall be cared for by the
owner or operator of a vehicle at the risk of the owner or operator. A judge or
magistrate imposing a civil fine and costs under this division, which are not
paid in full immediately, or for which a bond is not immediately posted in
double the amount of the civil fine and costs, shall order the driver or owner
to move the vehicle at the driver's own risk to a place of safekeeping within
the jurisdiction of the judge or magistrate, inform the judge or magistrate in
writing of the place of safekeeping, and keep the vehicle until the fine and
costs are paid or sufficient bond is furnished, or until the judge or
magistrate is satisfied that the fine and costs will be paid. The officer or
agent who has determined, after weighing a vehicle and load, that the weight is
unlawful, may require the driver to proceed to a judge or magistrate within the
city. If the judge or magistrate is satisfied that the probable civil fine and
costs will be paid by the owner or lessee, the judge or magistrate may allow
the driver to proceed after the load is made legal. If the judge or magistrate
is not satisfied that the owner or lessee, after a notice and a right to be
heard on the merits is given, will pay the amount of the probable civil fine
and costs, the judge or magistrate may order the vehicle to be impounded until
trial on the merits is completed under conditions set forth in this subchapter
for the impounding of vehicles after the civil fine and costs have been
imposed. Removal of the vehicle, and forwarding, care, or preservation of the
load shall be under the control of and at the risk of the owner or driver.
Vehicles impounded shall be subject to a lien, subject to a prior valid bona
fide lien of prior record, in the amount of the civil fine and costs, and if
the civil fine and costs are not paid within 90 days after the seizure, the
judge or magistrate shall certify the unpaid judgment to the prosecuting
attorney of the county in which the violation occurred, who shall proceed to
enforce the lien by foreclosure sale in accordance with procedure authorized in
the case of chattel mortgage foreclosures. When the duly authorized agent of
the city is performing duties under this subchapter, the agent shall have all
the powers conferred upon peace officers by the general laws of this state.
   (C)   An agent or authorized representative of the city shall not stop a
truck or vehicle in movement upon a road or highway within the city for any
purpose, unless the agent or authorized representative is driving a duly marked
vehicle, clearly showing and denoting the branch of government represented.

or other person, who causes or allows the vehicle to be loaded and driven or
moved on a highway, when the weight of that vehicle violates §
70.60(A), is responsible for a civil infraction and shall pay a civil fine in
an amount equal to $.03 per pound for each pound of excess load over 1,000
pounds when the excess is 2,000 pounds or less; $.06 per pound of excess load
when the excess is over 2,000 pounds but not over 3,000 pounds; $.09 per pound
for each pound of excess load when the excess is over 3,000 pounds but not over
4,000 pounds; $.12 per pound for each pound of excess load when the excess is
over 4,000 pounds but not over 5,000 pounds; $.15 per pound for each pound of
excess load when the excess is over 5, 000 pounds but not over 10,000 pounds;
and $.20 per pound for each pound of excess load when the excess is over 10,000
pounds. However, the court shall have discretionary power as to the amount of
civil fine within the schedule provided by this division, and may impose the
civil fine provided in division (B)(2) of this section, for a civil infraction
where, at the time of the violation, either the motor vehicle, motor vehicle
and semi-trailer, or trailer did not exceed the total weight which would be
lawful for each unit by a proper distribution of the load upon the various
axles supporting each unit.
   (B)   If a person is determined to be responsible or responsible "with
explanation" for a civil infraction under §§
70.60 through
70.62 while driving a commercial vehicle, he or she may be ordered to pay costs
as provided in division (B)(3) of this section and a civil fine of not more
than $250.
   (C)   If a civil fine is ordered to be paid, the judge or district court
magistrate shall summarily tax and determine costs of the action, which shall
not be limited to the costs taxable in ordinary civil actions, and may include
all expenses, direct and indirect, to which the plaintiff has been put in
connection with the civil infraction, up to the entry of judgment. Except as
otherwise provided by law, costs shall be payable to the general fund of the
plaintiff.

§ 91.22 ALARM SYSTEM STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purposes of this section are to promote the responsible use of
security alarm systems in order to facilitate the effective and efficient
response to alarms by the Garden City Police and Fire Departments. Furthermore,
the provisions of this section are intended to reduce the number of false alarm
activations and responses by Garden City Police and Fire Departments. It is not
the intention of this section to interfere with the contractual obligations
between alarm businesses and alarm users or to supersede any provisions of
state law.
      (2)   Response to false alarms consumes many hours of valuable law
enforcement and fire responder time and resources, reduces mental preparedness
of officers responding to alarms if an actual emergency exists, and presents
significant health, safety and welfare hazards to the citizens of Garden City.
Those who utilize faulty alarm systems or errantly operate alarm systems which
repeatedly generate false alarms that necessitate public safety (police and
fire) response are impacting valuable public safety resources and it is deemed
that the adoption of a false alarm ordinance is in the best interest of the
public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      (1)   ALARM BUSINESS. The business, by an individual, partnership,
corporation, or other entity, of selling, leasing, servicing, repairing,
altering, replacing, moving, installing or monitoring an alarm system.
      (2)   ALARM DISPATCH. A notification to the Emergency Dispatch Center by
the alarm business that an alarm, either manual or automatic, has been
activated at an alarm site and police and/or fire responders have been
dispatched to the alarm site.
      (3)   ALARM SITE. A single premises or location served by an alarm system
or systems. Each tenancy, if served by a separate alarm system in a multi-
tenant building or complex shall be considered a separate alarm site.
      (4)   ALARM SYSTEM. Any device or assembly of equipment designed for the
detection of fire, medical emergency, unauthorized entry on or into any
building, place or premises, or for the alerting of others on or off premises
of the commission of an unlawful act, or both, and when activated causes an
audible and/or visual signal or transmits a signal or message to which law
enforcement officers and/or fire responders are expected to respond or which
would imply to a reasonable person that public safety personnel (police or
fire) are needed at the alarm source to investigate a criminal activity or
emergency. The following devices shall not constitute an alarm system:
         (a)   Alarm devices affixed to motor vehicles; and
         (b)   Handheld portable personal safety devices.
      (5)   ALARM USER. Any person, firm, partnership, company, association,
corporation or owner, tenant or lessee or their authorized agent or
representative of premises at which an alarm system is installed, maintained or

response to the building, place or premises on which the alarm system is
located by the Garden City Police Department or Garden City Fire Department
when the responding police and/or fire personnel find no evidence of a fire,
medical emergency, or criminal offense or attempted criminal offense after
having completed a timely investigation of the alarm site.
         (a)   FALSE ALARM shall not include an alarm dispatch which is
cancelled by the alarm business or the alarm user prior to the time the
responding police and/or fire personnel reach the alarm site; however, robbery
and hold-up alarms shall not be subject to cancellation, i.e. police and/or
fire personnel shall continue to the alarm site.
         (b)   Acts of God, including violent conditions of nature such as
earthquakes, high intensity winds, extreme storms including thunderstorms,
lightning, electrical surges and utility failures which interrupt the alarm
service through no fault of the alarm user shall likewise not be considered
FALSE ALARMS.
      (7)   MONITORING. The process by which an alarm business receives signals
from an alarm system and relays an alarm dispatch request to the communications
center for the purpose of summoning public safety response to the alarm site.
      (8)   NOTICE OF NON-COMPLIANCE. A formal 30-day notification by the Alarm
Administrator, advising of the intent to put the alarm business in substantial
default status leading to lien.
   (C)   Fee for excessive false alarms. To defray the cost of responding to
false alarms and to discourage the continuation of repeat false alarms, the
alarm user of the alarm site shall pay to the city a false alarm fee as set by
the City Council for the fourth and any subsequent false alarm during any
calendar year that the alarm system is activated and responded to by the Police
and/or Fire Departments, and the service called for is not needed.
      (a)   Notification; assessment of fee. After the Alarm Administrator has
recorded three fire-related and /or police-related false alarm occurrences
within a calendar year for a given alarm site, the Alarm Administrator shall
notify the alarm user, in writing, by first class mail or hand delivery, that
additional false alarm occurrences will result in the imposition of service
charges in accordance with the above fee schedule. Failure to receive such
notification does not waive or nullify any service charges. A fourth or
subsequent police and/or fire related false alarm occurring within any calendar
year shall result in a per occurrence false alarm charge as set by the City
Council to the alarm user of the alarm site. Such fees will be invoiced
periodically as determined by the Alarm Administrator.
      (b)   Disposition of false alarm fees.  All fees and service charges
collected under this section shall be paid into the treasury of the City of
Garden City.
   (D)   Failure to pay fee; lien. False alarm fees under this section shall at
once become a debt to the city and shall be paid to the City Clerk within 60
days from the date of invoice. In the event the false alarm fee is not paid
within 60 days from the date of invoice, a service charge as set by the City
Council shall be added. A notice of non-compliance will be sent with the
adjusted fine amounts. Fees and service charges remaining unpaid for 30 days
shall be filed as a lien on the property and shall have the same character and
effect as a lien created by general law for state and county taxes, until paid.
   (E)   Exceptions. The following circumstances shall not constitute a false
alarm, and no fee shall be assessed:
      (1)   Alarms activated by a person working on the alarm system with prior
notification to the Emergency Dispatch Center;
      (2)   Alarms which can be substantiated as being activated by disruption
or disturbance of utility company facilities or motor vehicle-utility pole

wires or any other lines or wires shall be permitted to come in contact with
any tree or shrub in any manner that shall cause damage thereto, and no person
shall attach any electric insulation to any tree. No person shall use any tree
as an anchor, and no material shall be fastened to or hung on any tree. All

intersection, and so that there shall be a clear space of eight feet above the
surface of the street or right-of-way. The owners shall remove all dead,
diseased, or dangerous trees, or broken or decayed limbs which constitute a
menace to the safety of the public. The city shall have the right to trim any
tree or shrub on private property when it interferes with the proper spread of
light along the street from a street light, or interferes with visibility on
any traffic-control device or sign, the trimming to be confined to the area
immediately above the right-of-way. Trees may be planted and maintained in this
area, provided that all branches are trimmed to maintain a clear vision for a
vertical height of eight feet above the roadway surface. (‘83 Code, § 95.11)
   (B)   When the Director shall discover that any tree growing on private
property within the city is afflicted with any dangerous and infectious insect
infestation or tree disease, he shall forthwith serve a written notice upon the
owner or his agent, or the occupant of the property, describing the tree, its
location, and the nature of the infestation or tree disease, and ordering the
owner, agent, and occupant to take any measures as may be reasonably necessary
to cure the infestation or disease and to prevent the spreading thereof,
specifying the measures required to be taken. The order may require the
pruning, spraying, or destruction of trees as may be reasonably necessary.
Every notice shall be complied with, within ten days after service thereof,
upon the owner, agent, or occupant of the property on which the afflicted tree
is located, or within any additional time as may be stipulated in the notice.
(‘83 Code, § 95.12)

out the order of the Director within the time limit, or in case of an appeal,
within five days after the Council shall have affirmed the order, the Director
shall carry out the pruning, spraying or destruction of the trees as deemed
necessary by him, and shall bill the owner, agent or occupant of the property
for the cost thereof. In case the owner of the property shall fail to pay the
bill within 30 days after it has been rendered, the Director shall report it to
the City Council for collection as a single lot assessment against the property
in accordance with the Charter. The Director may, without serving the above
notice, when the owner or occupant of any private property shall consent
thereto and pay the reasonable cost thereof, cause trees growing on private
property to be sprayed when he deems the same necessary on account of any
infestation or disease or threat thereof. (‘83 Code, § 95.15)
   (D)   The Director and his assistants and employees shall have authority to
enter upon private premises for the purpose of examining any trees, shrubs,
plants, or vines for the presence of destructive insects or plant diseases. No
damages shall be awarded for the destruction of any tree, shrub, plant, or
fruit, or injury to the same, if done by the Director or under his direction,
in accordance with this chapter. (‘83 Code, § 95.16)

maintenance work on the overhead lines of the public utilities, prior notice of
commencing work under a permit shall not be required. EMERGENCY as used in this
section shall mean the occurrence or happening of an event which could not be

lieu of the names of references, any other available evidence as to the good

   (B)   (1)   The fees for a solicitor's license shall be as specified in
Chapter 110 of this Code. No fee for a solicitor's license shall be so applied
as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce. In any case where a
license fee is believed by a licensee or applicant for a license to place an
undue burden upon interstate commerce, he may apply to the Mayor for an
adjustment of the fees so that it shall not be discriminatory, unreasonable, or
unfair as to such commerce. The application may be made before, at, or within
six months after payment of the prescribed license fee. The applicant shall, by
affidavit and supporting testimony, show his method of business and gross
volume or estimated gross volume of business, and any other information as the
Mayor may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of undue
burden on interstate commerce. The Mayor shall then conduct an investigation,
comparing the applicant's business with other businesses of like nature, and
shall make findings of fact from which he shall determine whether the fee fixed
for the solicitor's license is unfair, unreasonable, or discriminatory as to
applicant's business; and he shall fix as the license fee for the applicant an
amount that is fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or if the fee has
already been paid, he shall order a refund of the amount over and above the fee
so fixed.
      (2)   In fixing the fee to be charged, the Mayor shall have the power to
base the fee upon a percentage of gross sales, or any other method which will
assure that the fee assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses
of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the fee as
prescribed by Chapter 110 of this code. Should the Mayor determine the gross
sales measure of the fee to be the fair basis, he may require the applicant to
submit, either at the time of termination of applicant's business in the city
or at the end of each three-month period, a sworn statement of the gross sales,
and to pay the amount of fee therefor; however, no additional fee during any
one license year shall be required after the licensee shall have paid an amount
equal to the annual license fee as prescribed in Chapter 110 of this Code.

HANDBILL SOLICITATION
§ 112.50 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to protect the people against the nuisance
of the promiscuous distribution of handbills as herein defined, with the
resulting detriment and danger to public health and safety, the public
interest, convenience, and necessity require the regulation of handbill
solicitation. To that end, the further purposes of this subchapter are
specifically declared to be as follows.

canvassers, or handbill distributors upon the private property of local
residents, if they have given reasonable notice that they do not wish to be
solicited by such persons or do not desire to receive handbills or advertising
matter.
   (B)   To protect the people against the health and safety menace and the
expense incident to the littering of the streets and public places by the
promiscuous and uncontrolled distribution of advertising matter and commercial
handbills.
   (C)   To preserve to the people their constitutional right to receive and
disseminate information not restricted under the ordinary rules of decency,
good morals, and public order, by distinguishing between the nuisance created
by the promiscuous distribution of advertising and commercial circulars, and
the right to deliver noncommercial handbills to all who are willing to receive
the same.

The Council shall consider the number of taxicabs operating in the city and
whether the demands of the public require additional taxicab service; traffic
conditions on the streets of the city and whether the additional taxicab

   The Chief of Police is empowered, subject to approval by the City Council,
to make rules and regulations regarding the dress and conduct of drivers, and
the maintenance, marking, and operation of taxicabs as may be necessary in the
interest of providing safe and orderly service to passengers. No person shall
fail to comply with any rule or regulation. Upon adoption or change in any rule
or regulation, notice thereof shall be furnished to each taxicab licensee and
taxicab driver licensee. The Chief of Police may require periodic reports to be
submitted by operators and drivers in order to assist in the enforcement of the
rules and regulations or the provisions of this chapter. Until changed or added
to in the manner provided in this section, the following rules and regulations
shall be applicable to taxicabs and taxicab drivers.
   (A)   It shall be the duty of every person driving or operating a taxicab to
be courteous; to refrain from smoking while actually carrying passengers in his
taxicab; to refrain from swearing, loud talking, or boisterous conduct; to
drive his motor vehicle carefully and in full compliance with the traffic
regulations of the city and orders of the police officers of the city; to
promptly answer all court notices, traffic violation notices, or police
notices; and to deal honestly with the public and with his employer.
   (B)   Any taxicab licensee who is a member of any cooperative association
shall furnish the Police Department with the name of the association and shall
notify the Police Department of any change in his membership or affiliation
within 48 hours after the change.
   (C)   All taxicabs shall be kept in good running condition and clean and fit
for public use. Each taxicab shall be inspected at intervals as the Chief of
Police may direct.
   (D)   Only licensed taxicabs in a number as may be designated on any taxicab
stand sign shall remain at that stand while waiting for employment, and each
taxicab shall be parked in single file. The taxicab standing at the head of the
parked line shall not be permitted to refuse to carry any orderly person who
offers to hire the taxicab and agrees to pay the proper rate of fare, but any
person desiring to hire any taxicab shall be free to select any taxicab he may
desire on the stand whether it be at the head of the line or not. As the
taxicabs leave the taxicab stand with passengers, those in the rear shall move
up, and any taxicab entering the stand shall enter at the rear thereof and
shall move up as closely as possible to the last taxicab on the stand.
   (E)   No person shall charge any fare for the hire of any taxicab other than
in accordance with the current schedule of rates.
   (F)   No taxicab, while awaiting employment by passengers, shall stand on
any public street or place other than upon a taxicab stand; nor shall any
taxicab driver seek employment by repeatedly and persistently driving his
taxicab to and fro in a short space before, or by otherwise interfering with,
the proper and orderly access to or egress from any theater, hall, hotel,
public resort, bus station, or other place of public gathering, or by in any
other manner obstructing or impeding traffic. However, any taxicab driver may
solicit employment by driving through any public street or place without stops
other than those due to traffic and at a speed so as not to interfere with or
impede traffic, and may pass and repass any theater, hall, hotel, public
resort, bus station, or other place of public gathering, provided that after
passing the public place he shall not turn and repass until he shall have gone
a distance of two blocks beyond that place.
   (G)   No person shall solicit passengers for a public taxicab upon the
streets of the city except the driver of the taxicab when sitting upon the
driver's box of his vehicle. Every taxicab driver shall remain on the driver's
seat or inside his vehicle at all times when the vehicle is standing upon any
taxicab stand or when actually engaged in carrying passengers; however, every
taxicab driver shall be permitted to leave his taxicab to assist passengers
into or out of the taxicab. Any taxicab driver may leave his taxicab on a
taxicab stand to take care of the calls of nature and during any absences his
taxicab shall be parked at the rear of the taxicab stand, and no absence shall
be longer than 30 minutes.
   (H)   Any taxicab licensee may place advertising matter on or in any
licensed taxicab, but the form and content thereof shall first be approved by
the Chief of Police.
   (I)   No taxicab driver shall drink any intoxicating beverage while on duty,
nor immediately prior thereto.
   (J)   No color scheme or insignia designating the vehicle or vehicles of any
taxicab licensee shall be the same or similar to that of any other licensed
city taxicab service.

   (A)   A franchise shall not be assigned or transferred, either in whole or
in part, or leased, sublet, or mortgaged in any manner, nor shall title
thereto, either legal or equitable or any right, interest, or property therein,
pass to or vest in any person without the prior written consent of the city.
The proposed assignee or transferee must show financial responsibility as
determined by the city and must agree to comply with all provisions of the
franchise. The city shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to a proposed
transfer or assignment. The city may charge the assignee or transferee a
reasonable fee to assume the franchise consistent with the original franchise
fee and to cover all reasonable costs incurred in assuring itself that the
assignee or transferee is as qualified to administer the cable system as the
original Grantee. The city may in a franchise provide for special and relaxed
procedures for transfers or assignments to affiliates of a Grantee.
   (B)   The Grantee shall promptly notify the city of any actual or proposed
change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of control of the
Grantee. The word CONTROL as used herein is not limited to major stockholders
but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. There may be
no change in, transfer of, or acquisition of control without the prior consent
of the city, which will not unreasonably be withheld, and any such alteration
in control without consent shall make the franchise subject to revocation. For
the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to a change, transfer, or
acquisition of control, the city may inquire into the qualifications of the
prospective controlling party, and the Grantee shall assist the city in any
inquiry; and the party shall assume all reasonable costs incurred by the city
in so doing.
   (C)   The consent or approval of the Council to any transfer or assignment
of the franchise shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the
city in and to the streets, and any transfer or assignment shall, by its terms,
be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of this franchise.
   (D)   In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the city will not
approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise or change in control prior
to substantial completion of construction of a proposed system.
   (E)   The Council reserves the right, consistent with federal law, to review
the purchase price of any transfer or assignment of the cable system. Any
assignee to this franchise expressly agrees that any negotiated sale value
which the Council (acting upon professional advice) deems unreasonable will not
be considered in the rate base for any subsequent request for rate increases.
   (F)   In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved
without the successor in interest becoming a signatory to the franchise
agreement.

§ 121.09 FRANCHISE FEE; PAYMENT.
   (A)   For the reason that the streets to be used by the Grantee in the
operation of its cable communications system within the boundaries of the city
are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the city at great
expense to its taxpayers, and that the grant to the Grantee of the right to use
the streets is a valuable property right without which the Grantee would be
required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions,
and because the city will incur costs in regulating and administering the
franchise, and at the option of the Council, the city may make available a
portion of the franchise fee to further the development of public and community
uses of cable TV, a Grantee shall pay to the city an amount equal to 5% of the
Grantee's annual gross revenues.
   (B)   The city may by franchise agreement increase the effective percentage
rate or rates applicable to a particular Grantee.
   (C)   The franchise fee and any other cost or penalties assessed shall be
payable quarterly to the City Treasurer, in accordance with the Grantee's
fiscal year. The Grantee shall file a complete and accurate verified statement
of all gross revenues during the period for which a quarterly payment is made,
and the payment shall be made to the city not later than 30 days after the
expiration of each quarter.
   (D)   The city shall have the right to inspect and audit the Grantee's
records to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this chapter;
provided, however, that the audit shall take place within 36 months following
the close of each of the Grantee's fiscal years. Any additional amount due to
the city as a result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days following
written notice to the Grantee by the city (which notice shall include a copy of
the audit report), unless contested by the Grantee within those 30 days.
   (E)   In the event that any franchise fee payment or recompute amount, cost,
or penalty, is not made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified,
interest shall be charged dally from the date at the annual rate of either 12%
or the current prime interest rate, whichever is greater.

simultaneously. The Grantee shall designate a channel which will be used for
emergency broadcasts of both audio and video. The Grantee shall cooperate with
the city in the use and operation of the emergency alert override system.
   (G)   (1)   The Grantee may be required to interconnect its system with
other broadband communications facilities. The interconnection shall be made
within the time limit established by the city, which time limit shall be
extended as necessary to obtain needed cooperation of third parties. The
interconnection shall, at the city's discretion, be accomplished according to
the method and technical standards determined by the city and generally
accepted in industry practices.

circumstances beyond its control. The Grantee shall not be excused by mere
economic hardship nor by misfeasance or malfeasance of its directors, officers,
or employees.
   (C)   The city may make a written demand that the Grantee comply with any
provision, rule, order, or determination under or pursuant to this franchise.
If the violation by the Grantee continues for a period of 30 days following a
written demand without written proof that the corrective action has been taken
or is being actively and expeditiously pursued, the issue of termination of the
franchise shall be brought before the Council. At least 20 days prior to the

with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 USC 552. The city
shall place in public file for inspection any decision that results in
information being withheld. If the cable operator requests confidentiality and
the request is denied, where the cable operator is proposing a rate increase,
it may withdraw the proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary
information will be returned to it; or the cable operator may seek review
within five working days of the denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the
information will be stayed pending review.

as proprietary with the city. The city shall weigh the policy considerations
favoring non-disclosure against the reasons cited for permitting inspection in
light of the facts of the particular case. It will then promptly notify the
requesting entity and the cable operator that submitted the information as to
the disposition of the request. It may grant, deny or condition a request. The
requesting party or the cable operator may seek review of the decision by
filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Disclosure will be stayed pending
resolution of any appeal.

decision shall pay a nonrefundable fee in the amount of $2,000 for each

FORTUNE-TELLING
§ 133.20 PURPOSES AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   The practice of fortune-telling, as defined in this subchapter, has
historically been subject to abuse by certain unscrupulous practitioners using
the practice to commit fraud and larceny upon clients.
   (B)   It is the purpose of this subchapter to regulate the practice of
fortune-telling in such manner as to reduce the risk of fraud and larceny to
clients while allowing fortune-tellers to provide their services to clients
with only minimal restrictions.
   (C)   The provisions of this chapter requiring a permit, posting of fees,
providing receipts and allowing client recordation of the consultation, will
make it more difficult for an unscrupulous fortune- teller to commit fraud or
larceny, and yet, as informational regulations, will not affect the nature of
the information conveyed by the fortune-teller, nor the manner in which it is
conveyed. These regulations require only minimal expense and effort on the part
of the fortune-teller and will not, therefore, impose any undue burden on their
practices.
   (D)   Fortune-telling for entertainment purposes, as defined in this
chapter, does not create the same risk of fraud and larceny by an unscrupulous
practitioner as would the practice with an individual client, because it is
done with a group at a public place for the purpose of entertaining and not to
deal with the private concerns of an individual.
   (E)   For these and other reasons, the provisions of this chapter are
necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community.
(Ord. 98-001, passed 1-5-98)
§ 133.21 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person shall conduct, engage in, carry on, participate in, or practice

§ 154.026 USES NOT NORMALLY PERMITTED.
   A land use which is not cited by name as a permitted use in a zoning
district may be permitted upon determination by the Zoning Administrator that
the use is clearly similar in nature and compatible with the listed or existing
uses in that district. In making such a determination, the Zoning Administrator
shall consider the following.
   (A)   Determination of compatibility. In making the determination of
compatibility, the Zoning Administrator shall consider specific characteristics
of the use in question and compare those characteristics with those of the uses
which are expressly permitted in the district. Those characteristics shall
include, but are not limited to, traffic generation, types of service offered,
types of goods produced, methods of operation, and building characteristics.
   (B)   Conditions by which use may be permitted. If the Zoning Administrator
determines that the proposed use is compatible with permitted and existing uses
in the district, the Zoning Administrator shall then decide whether the
proposed use shall be permitted by right, as a special use, or as a permitted
accessory use. The proposed use shall be subject to the review and approval
requirements for the district in which it is located.
   (C)   Planning Commission determination. In the event that the Zoning
Administrator is unable to decide if a use should be considered a permitted use
in a particular zoning district, then the determination shall be made by the
Planning Commission, which may elect to resolve the case by initiating an
amendment to the Zoning Ordinance.
   (D)   Uses listed in another district. No use shall be permitted in a
district under the terms of this section if the use is specifically listed as a
use permitted by right or as a special use in any other district.

   Notes related to table.
      (1)   Architectural features. Bay windows, window sills, belt courses,
cornices, eaves, overhanging eaves, and other architectural features may
project into a required side yard not more than two inches for each one foot of
width of the side yard, and may extend into any front or rear yard not more
than 24 inches.
      (2)   Terraces and porches. Open paved terraces and open porches may
project into a required rear yard up to ten feet, provided that the unoccupied
portion of the rear yard has a depth of at least 25 feet.
      (3)   Access drives and walkways. Access drives may be placed in the
required front or side yards so as to provide access to rear yards or accessory
or attached structures. Further, any walk, terrace or other pavement serving a
like function, shall be permitted in any required yard, providing the pavement
is no higher than six inches above grade.
      (4)   Unenclosed porches, with or without roof. Unenclosed porches may
project into the required 30-foot front yard set-back up to six feet, and shall
maintain a minimum side yard setback of three feet. In cases where single-
family houses maintain a front yard setback greater than 30 feet, one
additional foot of projection shall be permitted per each foot of additional
setback outside of the 30-foot requirement; not to exceed a total front porch
projection of ten feet.
   (D)   Unobstructed sight distance. 
      (1)   No fence, wall, structure, or planting shall be erected,
established, or maintained on any lot which will obstruct the view of drivers
in vehicles approaching an intersection of two roads or the intersection of a
road and a driveway (see Appendix B, Illustration 9, Unobstructed Sight
Distance). Fences, walls, structures, or plantings located in the triangular
area described below shall not be permitted to obstruct cross-visibility
between a height of 30 inches and six feet above the lowest point of the
intersecting road(s).
      (2)   Trees shall be permitted in the triangular area provided that limbs
and foliage are trimmed so that they do not extend into the cross-visibility
area or otherwise create a traffic hazard. Landscaping, except required grass
or ground cover, shall not be located closer than three feet from the edge of
any driveway or road pavement within the triangular area.
   (E)   Unobstructed sight area. The unobstructed triangular area is described
as follows.
      (1)   The area formed at the corner intersection of two public right-of-
way lines, the two sides of the triangular area being 25 feet in length
measured along abutting public rights-of-way lines, and the third side being a
line connecting these two sides, or
      (2)   The area formed at the corner intersection of a public right-of-way
and a driveway, the two sides of the triangular area being ten feet in length
measured along the right-of-way line and edge of the driveway, and the third
side being a line connecting these two sides.
   (F)   Lots adjoining alleys. In calculating the area of a lot that adjoins
an alley for the purposes of applying lot area and setback requirements, one-
half of the width of the alley shall be considered a part of the lot. However,
if a portion of the lot is occupied by an alley currently in use (i.e., not
vacated), then the area shall not be used in lot area computations related to
the landscaping standards.

§ 154.028 PUBLIC THOROUGHFARES.
   (A)   Intent. Unimpeded, safe access to parcels of land throughout the city
is necessary to provide adequate police and fire protection, ambulance
services, and other public services, and to otherwise promote and protect the
health, safety, and welfare of the public. The standards and specifications set
forth herein are determined to be the minimum standards and specifications
necessary to meet the above stated intentions.
   (B)   Public access required. The front lot line of all lots shall abut onto
a publicly dedicated road right-of-way.
   (C)   Driveway dimensions. Driveways providing access to residential,
commercial or industrial properties shall comply with the dimensional standards
specified in
§ 154.068.
   (D)   Access across residential district land. No land which is located in a
residential district shall be used for a driveway, walkway, or access purposes
to any land which is located in a nonresidential district, unless access is by
way of a public road.
   (E)   Service roads. If the Planning Commission determines that proposed or
anticipated development will result in an excessive number of entrance or exit
drives onto a public road, thereby creating potentially hazardous traffic
conditions and diminishing the carrying capacity of the road, the Commission
may permit or require construction of service roads across abutting parcels and
generally parallel to the arterial street, to allow traffic to circulate from
one parcel to another without re-entering the public road. The front edge of
any secondary access drive shall be located no closer to the road than the
future right-of-way line. The secondary access drive shall conform to the
minimum specifications established by the City Engineer.
   (F)   Performance guarantee. To assure completion of a private road or
service road in conformance with the requirements set forth herein, the
Building Official or Zoning Administrator may require the applicant or owner to
provide a performance guarantee, in accordance with
§ 154.036.

154.999
§ 154.029 GRADING REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Intent and scope of requirements. Compliance with the grading
regulations set forth herein shall be required as follows.
      (1)   Intent. Grading regulations are established to control the
excavation and filling of land, to assure adequate drainage away from
structures and to a natural or established drainage course, and to assure
protection of trees on sites where grading is to take place. The regulations
set forth herein also establish procedures and requirements for grading
permits, inspection of finished grading operations, and penalties for violation
of the grading regulations.
      (2)   Scope of application. A permit shall be required in all instances
where grading, excavating, filling, stockpiling, or other alteration to the
land are proposed. Filling shall include the dumping of soil, sand, clay,
gravel, or other material on a site. However, where minor alterations to the
land which do not affect the storm drainage pattern are proposed, a grading
permit shall not be required.
   (B)   Grading plan.
      (1)   Grading plan. In the event that a grading permit is required, the
applicant shall first submit a grading plan for review and approval by the City
Engineer and/or Director of Public Services. Grading plans may be submitted in
conjunction with a site plan review, or may be submitted as a separate plan.
The plans shall be prepared by a registered land surveyor or civil engineer.
      (2)   Grading plan standards. At a minimum, grading plans shall show
grade elevations adjacent to existing and proposed structures and at the
nearest side of structures on adjacent properties, and sufficient existing and
proposed elevations on the site to be altered and on as much of the adjacent
property as is necessary to establish the proposed surface water drainage
pattern. If excavation or filling is proposed, the amount of material to be
excavated or filled shall be indicated on the grading plan. All elevations
shall be based on U.S.G.S. datum. Elevations and location of bench marks used
for determining elevations shall be shown on the plan.
      (3)   Subdivision grading plans. For any proposed subdivision, a grading
plan prepared by a registered land surveyor or civil engineer shall be
submitted with the preliminary subdivision plan. The grading plan shall show
the topography of the area to be platted, the existing drainage pattern, and
the
proposed surface water drainage pattern. Drainage easements shall be provided
across private property where necessary for handling surface drainage from
adjacent properties.
   (C)   Grading standards.
      (1)   Slope away from buildings. All buildings and structures shall be
constructed at an elevation which provides a sloping grade away from the
building or structure, thereby causing surface water to drain away from the
walls of the building to a natural or established drainage course. Unless
insufficient space exists on a site, a minimum 5% slope away from all sides of
a building or structure shall be provided for a minimum distance of ten feet.
      (2)   Runoff onto adjacent properties. New grades shall not be
established that would permit an increase in the runoff of surface water onto
adjacent properties, except through established drainage courses.
   (D)   Review, inspection, and approval procedures.  
      (1)   Grading plans shall be reviewed by the City Engineer and/or
Director of Public Services. In the event that the grading plan is submitted in
conjunction with a site plan submission, the Planning Commission shall review
the grading plan as a part of normal site plan review. The Building Official
shall issue a grading permit after the determination has been made that the
requirements set forth herein and in other applicable ordinances have been
complied with.
      (2)   For residential properties, compliance with a grading plan and
permit shall be verified by the Building Official after visual on-site
inspection. The City Engineer and/or Director of Public Services shall be
responsible for verifying compliance with grading plans and permits for
nonresidential uses. Before final inspection and issuance of a certificate of
occupancy, the rough grading must be completed; final grading shall be
completed within six months after a certificate of occupancy has been issued.

§ 154.030 LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS.
   Subject to the provisions set forth herein, all parking areas, walkways,
driveways, building entryways, off-street parking and loading areas, and
building complexes with common areas shall be sufficiently illuminated to
assure the security of property and the safety of persons using such public or
common areas. All lighting must comply with Chapter 92, §
92.03(B) of the City Code of Ordinances.
   (A)   Permitted lighting.  Only non-glare, color-corrected lighting shall be
permitted. Lighting shall be placed and shielded so as to direct the light onto
the site and away from adjoining properties. The lighting source shall not be
directly visible from adjoining properties. Lighting shall be shielded so that
it does not cause glare for motorists (see
Appendix B, Illustration 10, Lighting Requirements).
   (B)   Intensity. In parking areas, the light intensity shall average a
minimum of 1.0 footcandle, measured five feet above the surface. In pedestrian
areas, the light intensity shall average a minimum of 2.0 footcandles, measured
five feet above the surface.
   (C)   Height. Except as noted below, lighting fixtures shall not exceed a
height of 25 feet measured from the ground level to the centerline of the light
source. Fixtures should provide an overlapping pattern of light at a height of
approximately seven feet above ground level. The Planning Commission may modify
these height standards in commercial and industrial districts, based on
consideration of the position and height of buildings, other structures, and
trees on the site; the potential off-site impact of the lighting; the character
of the proposed use; and the character of surrounding land use. In no case
shall the lighting exceed the maximum building height in the district in which
it is located.
   (D)   Sign lighting. Signs shall be illuminated in accordance with the Sign
Regulations set forth in §§
154.600 through
154.999 of this Code.
   (E)   Site plan requirements. All lighting, including ornamental lighting,
shall be shown on site plans in sufficient detail to allow determination of the
effects of the lighting upon adjacent properties, traffic safety, and overhead
sky glow. The objective of these specifications is to minimize undesirable off-
site effects.
   (F)   Lighting around architectural building features. Lighting around
architectural building features is subject to the following requirements:
      (1)   Static light only. Only static light is permitted around
architectural building features, and any flashing, fading, dissolving, or any
other change in color or illumination level is prohibited.
      (2)    Maintenance of bulbs.  All bulbs around architectural building
features must be functional. Bulbs that are nonfunctional or dysfunctional must
be replaced with a bulb of the same color as, or sequence of color of, the
other bulbs to maintain uniformity.
      (3)   Standards applicable to architectural outline lighting. Tube
lighting around architectural features on any existing or proposed building may
be approved administratively through the zoning permit process of §
154.467, provided the tube lighting does not cause glare and is not hazardous
to traffic safety. In considering whether to approve the architectural
lighting, the city shall consider the light's impact on traffic, neighboring
properties, and the night sky in accordance with the requirements of this
section. The city may require the lighting to be shielded or diffused by
translucent panels, tubes, or similar methods. String lights, rope lighting,
and other similar lighting with exposed or visible bulbs are prohibited on
architectural features.
   (G)   Window tube lighting and rope lighting prohibited. Tube lighting and
rope lighting is prohibited around or within the perimeter of windows unless
the tube lighting is part of a conforming illuminated sign pursuant to §§
154.600 through
154.999 of this Code.
   (H)   Temporary lighting. Temporary string lights and other lighting around
windows and architectural building features are permitted not more than 90 days
in a calendar year (e.g., holiday lighting, etc.). These forms of temporary
lighting are subject to all illumination standards of this section.

§ 154.031 DUMPING, FILLING AND EXCAVATING.
   The dumping of waste or other materials, grading, excavating, filling, and
similar “earth changes” shall be subject to the following regulations.
   (A)   Dumping of waste, junk, or similar materials. The use of land for the
storage, collection or accumulation of used construction materials, or for the
dumping or disposal of refuse, ash, garbage, rubbish, waste material or
industrial by-products, shall not be permitted in any district.
   (B)   Excavation. The excavation or continued existence of unprotected
holes, pits, or wells which constitute or are reasonably likely to constitute a
danger or menace to the public health, safety, and welfare is prohibited.
However, this restriction shall not apply to excavations for which a permit has
been acquired, provided the excavations are properly protected with fencing,
guard rails, and warning signs. Excavations which may be permitted if proper
permits are acquired include excavation related to construction of a driveway,
walk, a permitted wall, or building or part thereof, or movement of soil within
the boundaries of a parcel for the purposes of preparing a site for building
construction or another permitted use.
   (C)   Dumping of soil, sand, clay, gravel or similar material. The dumping
or filling with soil, sand, clay, gravel or similar earthen material (excluding
waste, junk, or contaminated material) on any lot or parcel of land shall not
occur unless the plans for dumping or filling have first been reviewed and
appropriate permits issued by the Building Official. Land within a drainage
easement shall not be filled unless approved by the City Engineer and\or the
Director of Public Services.
   (D)   Removal of soil, sand or similar materials. Approval of the Zoning
Administrator shall be required prior to the removal of topsoil, sand, gravel,
or similar earthen material from any site in the city. A permit shall be issued
only upon finding that removal will not cause stagnant water to collect or
leave the surface of the land in an unstable condition or unfit for the growing
of turf and other land uses permitted in the district in which the site is
located.

§ 154.032 STANDARDS FOR TRASH DUMPSTERS.
   (A)   Location. Dumpsters shall be permitted in the side or rear yard,
provided that no dumpster shall extend closer to the front of the lot than any
portion of the principal structure, and provided further that the dumpster
shall not encroach on a required parking area, is clearly accessible to
servicing vehicles, and is located at least ten feet from any building.
Dumpsters shall comply with the setback requirements for the district in which
they are located. Dumpsters shall be located as far as practicable from any
adjoining residential district.
   (B)   Concrete pad. Dumpsters shall be placed on a concrete pad. The
concrete pad should extend a minimum of three feet in front of the dumpster
enclosure.
   (C)   Screening. Dumpsters shall be screened from view from adjoining
property and public streets and thoroughfares. Dumpsters shall be screened on
three sides with a decorative masonry wall, similar in material and/or color to
the main structure, not less than six feet in height or at least six inches
above the height of the enclosed dumpster, whichever is taller. The fourth side
of the dumpster screening shall be equipped with an opaque, lockable metal gate
that is the same height as the enclosure around the other three sides.
Commercial grade slats are required for a chain link gate. The gate shall
remain closed and shall only be opened for the loading and unloading of the
dumpster.
   (D)   Bollards. Bollards (concrete-filled metal posts) or similar protective
devices shall be installed at the opening to prevent damage to the dumpster
enclosure.
   (E)   Site plan requirements. The location and method of screening of
dumpsters shall be shown on all applications and sketch plans submitted for
administrative approval or site plans submitted for approval by the Planning
Commission. The Planning Commission encourages the sharing of dumpsters by
businesses.
   (F)   Exception.
      (1)   The requirements of this section may be modified or waived upon a
determination that the location, screening, or removal of refuse will be
handled in a manner acceptable to the Planning Commission or Zoning
Administrator. The Planning Commission or Zoning Administrator shall consult
with the Fire Chief and Director of the Department of Public Services when
determining the acceptability of the requested modification or waiver. The
Planning Commission or Zoning Administrator may require additional landscaping,
screening or other site improvements as an alternative to adhering to the
requirements of this section. If a requirement for a dumpster is waived, the
site plan or sketch plan shall show a future dumpster location to be built when
or if the use of the building changes prior to occupancy.
      (2)   Prior to granting any exception, the property owner shall submit a
written request. The owner shall provide a list of all standards requiring a
waiver or modification. Any waiver or modification granted shall be limited to
the use of the property at the time the request is made and evaluated. Any
change in use or development of the site upon which the dumpster is located may
required compliance with all standards of this section.

§ 154.037 FENCES.
    Every fence constructed or erected in the city shall comply with the
regulations of this section. No fence shall be erected or constructed until a
permit has been issued in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (A)   Permit required.  Anyone desiring to construct a fence upon property
in the city shall first apply to the Building Department for a permit. There
shall be a permit fee as passed by City Council. The permit shall be issued by
the Building Department upon a written application, which application shall
request that the city establish the grade at which the fence is to be
constructed and shall also contain such information as may be required by the
Building Inspector in order to determine compliance with the provisions of this
code.
   (B)   General requirements.
      (1)   Fence materials. Fences shall consist of materials commonly used in
conventional fence construction, such as wood or metal. Razor wire shall not be
permitted. Fences which carry electric current are prohibited. Barbed wire
shall be permitted only in industrial districts, provided that the barbed wire
is at least eight feet above the ground, and provided further that the barbed
wire shall be installed on supports that extend toward the interior of the
site. Fence posts shall be sunk into the ground at least three feet, and all
posts shall be encased in concrete below the surface of the ground.
      (2)   Fence appearance. If, because of the design or construction, one
side of the fence has a more finished appearance than the other, the side of
the fence with the more finished appearance shall face the exterior of the lot,
with the following exceptions.
         (a)   When a fence is approved for construction under a joint permit,
the joint permit holders shall determine the preferred orientation of the more
finished side of the fence along the common property line(s) of the joint
permit holders.
         (b)   An owner of abutting property may waive the right for the more
finished side of a fence to face his abutting property. The waiver of right
must be in the form of a written consent statement, signed by the owner of the
property where the fence would face under the normal requirements of this
subdivision. The written consent statement shall be attached to the permit
application and maintained with the permit records of the Building Official.
      (3)   Obstruction to use of adjoining property.  No fence shall be
erected where it would prevent or unreasonably obstruct the use of adjacent
property, nor shall a fence be erected where it would obstruct or prevent the
continued safe use of an existing driveway or other means of access to adjacent
property. In enforcing this provision, the Building Official may require a
fence to be set back a minimum distance of not more than two feet from a
driveway or property line in order to provide for the safe passage of
pedestrians, bicyclists or vehicular traffic or other safety related concerns.
      (4)   Fence maintenance. Fences shall be maintained in good condition.
Rotten or broken components shall be replaced, repaired, or removed. As
required, surfaces shall be painted, stained, or otherwise treated with
materials to protect and preserve the fence and provide an attractive finish.
If a fence is found to be in need of repair by the Building Official, the
Building Official shall issue orders to complete the repairs. Failure to comply
with written notice from the Building Official ordering completion of repairs
shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.
      (5)   Location; general requirements.  Any fence shall be located
entirely on the private property of the person constructing it. However,
adjoining property owners may jointly apply for a fence permit, in which case
the Building Official may permit it to be constructed on their common property
line. A fence shall not be attached to or touch a fence located on another
owner's lot without the express written agreement of the owners of both fences.
No more than three inches is permitted between fences. In every case, fences
must be constructed with adequate posts and other supports so that each fence
is capable of maintaining an upright position and the location described in the
original application for permit to construct the fence.
      (6)   Corner clearance. Fences located adjacent to a street or driveway
shall be designed to provide unobstructed sight distance for drivers in
accordance with §
154.027(D) of this Code.
      (7)   Nonconforming fences. Any future additions or improvements will be
required to conform to this chapter.
   (C)   Review and approval procedures.
      (1)   Application for permit.
         (a)   No fence shall be erected or constructed until a permit has been
issued in accordance with the provisions of this section. If a fence is
proposed in conjunction with a development that requires site plan review, then
the fence shall be shown on the site plan which shall be reviewed in accordance
with normal site plan review procedures. No additional permit is required when
a fence is approved as part of a site plan. In all other cases, an application
for a permit to construct a fence shall be filed with the Building Official.
The application shall be accompanied by drawings and other information to
illustrate the dimensions, design and location of the proposed fence. The
following minimum information shall be included on the drawing submitted in
support of a fence permit application.
            1.   Fence location.
            2.   Location of all structures within 25 feet of the proposed
fence.
            3.   Location of all driveways within 25 feet of the proposed
fence.
            4.   Location of all sidewalks within 25 feet of the proposed
fence.
            5.   Location of all existing fences within ten feet of the
proposed fence.
         (b)   The Building Official may determine other additional information
is reasonably necessary to provide a complete review of the proposed fence. Any
additional information shall be provided by the applicant as may be required by
the Building Official to assure compliance with the regulations set forth in
this chapter and to assure the fence is constructed with sound materials.
      (2)   Application review fee. Each fence permit application shall be
accompanied by an application review fee to recover the reasonable costs of
review and permit issuance. The amount of the fee shall be fixed by resolution
of the City Council and posted in the Building Department. If the fence is
constructed before an application for a permit is obtained, the fee shall be
increased to an amount equal to twice the fee that is required if the permit
application and fee were obtained prior to construction of a fence.
      (3)   Survey required. In the event lot lines for the subject property
cannot be located to the satisfaction of the Building Official, the Building
Official may require the applicant to establish lot lines on the property
through placement of permanent stakes located by a licensed surveyor. Lot lines
must be located before the fence permit is issued. The Building Official may
withhold issuance of the permit to construct the fence until the lot lines are
located and permanent stakes are placed by a licensed surveyor.
      (4)   Administrative rules. The Building Official may establish
reasonable rules and procedures, consistent with the intentions of this
chapter, which may be necessary to provide for the proper administration of
this section.
      (5)   Application review and permit issuance by the Building Official.
The Building Official shall review the fence application and supporting data
with respect to the standards set forth in this chapter, the adopted Building
Code, and administrative rules which may be established to provide for proper
administration of this section. The Building Official shall grant a permit to
construct a proposed fence upon finding that the proposed fence fully complies
with all applicable regulations.
      (6)   Appeal of a decision. An applicant may appeal a decision of the
Building Official or Planning Commission concerning a proposed fence or
enforcement of the provisions of this section to the Zoning Board of Appeals.

NONCONFORMITIES
§ 154.050 INTENT.
   Nonconformities are uses, structures, buildings, or lots which do not
conform to one or more provisions or requirements of this chapter or a
subsequent amendment, but which were lawfully established prior to the time of
adoption of the chapter or amendment. Such nonconformities are not compatible
with the current or intended use of land in the district in which they are
located. Therefore, it is the intent of this chapter to permit those
nonconformities to continue under certain conditions, but to discourage their
expansion, enlargement, or extension. Accordingly, the purpose of this
subchapter is to establish regulations that govern the completion, restoration,
reconstruction, extension, and/or substitution of nonconformities, and to
specify the circumstances and conditions under which nonconformities shall be
permitted to continue.
(Ord. 92-005, passed 2-17-92)
§ 154.051 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   The following regulations shall apply to all nonconforming uses, structures,
and lots.
   (A)   Continuation of nonconforming uses and structures. Any lawful
nonconforming use established on or before the effective date of this chapter
or amendment thereto may be continued and shall not be considered to be in
violation of this chapter, provided that, unless otherwise noted in this
subchapter, the building and land involved shall neither be structurally
altered, nor enlarged unless the modifications conform to the provisions of
this chapter for the district in which it is located. Nothing in this chapter
shall he deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition
of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by an official charged
with protecting the public safety, upon order of that official.
   (B)   Buildings under construction. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this
chapter shall be deemed to require a change in plans, construction, or
designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun
prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, and upon
which actual building construction has been diligently carried on. ACTUAL
CONSTRUCTION is defined to include the placing of construction materials in
permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where demolition or
removal of an existing building has begun preparatory to rebuilding, the work
shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that the work shall be
diligently carried on until completion of the building involved.
   (C)   Discontinuation of nonconforming uses and structures.
      (1)   Nonconforming structure. When a nonconforming use of a structure,
or structure and land in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six
consecutive months, or discontinued for any period of time without a present
intention to reinstate the nonconforming use, the structure or structure and
land in combination shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the
provisions of the district in which it is located.
      (2)   Nonconforming uses of open land. If any nonconforming use of open
land ceases for any reason for a period of more than 180 days, any subsequent
use of the land shall conform to the provisions of the district in which it is
located.
      (3)   Seasonal uses. In applying this division to seasonal uses, the time
during the off-season shall not be counted.
   (D)   Purchase or condemnation. In order to accomplish the elimination of
nonconforming uses and structures which constitute a nuisance or are
detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare, the city, pursuant to §
3a, Public Act 207 of 1921, being M.C.L.A. §§ 125.581 - 125.590, as amended,
may acquire by purchase, condemnation or otherwise, private property for the
purpose of removal of nonconforming uses or structures. Where acquisition is
contemplated, the procedures set forth in §
154.054 shall be followed.
   (E)   Recording of nonconforming uses and structures. The Building Official
shall be responsible for maintaining records of nonconforming uses and
structures as accurate as is feasible, and for determining legal nonconforming
uses and structures in existence on the effective date of this chapter. Failure
on the part of a property owner to provide the Building Official with necessary
information to determine legal nonconforming status may result in denial of
required or requested permits
   (F)   Establishment of a conforming use or structure. In the event that a
nonconforming principal use or structure is superseded by a conforming
principal use or structure on a site, the nonconforming use or structure shall
be immediately and permanently removed.
   (G)   Change of tenancy or ownership. In the event there is a change in
tenancy, ownership, or management, an existing nonconforming use or structure
shall be allowed to continue, provided there is no change in the nature or
character of the nonconformity.
   (H)   Exceptions and variances. Any use for which a special exception or
variance has been granted as provided in this chapter shall not be deemed a
nonconformity.
   (I)   Unlawful nonconformities. No nonconformity shall be permitted to
continue in existence if it was unlawful at the time it was established.
   (J)   Substitution. A nonconforming use may be changed to another
nonconforming use upon approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals, provided that
no structural alterations are required to accommodate the new nonconforming
use, and that the proposed use is equally or more appropriate in the district
than the existing nonconformity. In permitting such a change, the Zoning Board
of Appeals may require conditions to accomplish the purposes of this chapter.
   (K)   Change of location. Should a nonconforming structure be moved to
another parcel or to another location on the same parcel for any reason
whatsoever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.

§ 154.052 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   The following regulations shall apply to any nonconforming lot of record or
nonconforming lot described in a deed or land contract executed and delivered
prior to the effective date of this chapter or amendment thereto.
   (A)   Use of nonconforming lots. Any nonconforming lot shall be used only
for a use permitted in the district in which it is located. In any district in
which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single- family dwelling and
customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record in
existence, subject to the requirements in division (C) of this section. This
provision shall apply even though a single-family lot fails to meet the
requirements for area or width that are applicable in the district, provided
that the lot and buildings comply with setbacks and other requirements (other
than lot area and width) for the district.
   (B)   Variance from area and bulk requirements. If the use of a
nonconforming lot requires a variation from the area or bulk requirements, then
the use shall be permitted only if a variance is granted by the Zoning Board of
Appeals.
   (C)   Nonconforming contiguous residential lots under the same ownership. If
two or more residential lots or combinations of lots with contiguous frontage
in single ownership are of record at the time of adoption or amendment to this
chapter, and if each lot has an area of less than 3,500 square feet, then the
lots involved shall be considered to be an individual parcel for purposes of
this chapter. Any residential lot of record having an area less than 5,000
square feet or having a width less than required shall be used only for a
single-family dwelling and customary accessory building.
   (D)   Combination of nonconforming lots. Upon application to the Zoning
Administrator, the Zoning Administrator may permit the combination, in whole or
in part, of nonconforming lots of record into building sites less than the size
requirements established by this chapter, provided that the combination of lots
reduces the degree of nonconformity and results in a parcel which is capable of
accommodating a structure that is in conformance with the building area,
setback, and side yard requirements of this chapter.

§ 154.053 MODIFICATION TO NONCONFORMING USES OR STRUCTURES
   No nonconforming use or structure shall be enlarged, extended, or
structurally altered, nor shall any nonconformity be changed to a different
nonconformity which increases the intensity of use or nonconformity, except as
specifically permitted by the following regulations.
   (A)   Applicability. The following regulations shall apply to any
nonconforming use or structure, including:
      (1)   Nonconforming use of open land;
      (2)   Nonconforming use of buildings designed or used for a conforming
use;
      (3)   Nonconforming use of buildings specifically designed for the type
of use which occupies them but not suitable for a conforming use;
      (4)   Buildings designed and used for a conforming use but not in
conformance with area and bulk, parking, loading, or landscaping requirements;
      (5)   Nonconforming structures such as fences and signs.
   (B)   Enlargement, extension or alteration.  
      (1)   Increase in nonconformity prohibited. Except as specifically
provided in this section, no person may engage in any activity that causes an
increase in the extent of any nonconformity. For example, physical alterations
of new structures on open land is unlawful if the activity results in one the
following.
         (a)   An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a
nonconforming use.
         (b)   A decrease in the amount of required yard area, such as would be
caused by an addition to a nonconforming building where the addition intrudes
into a yard setback otherwise required by this chapter.
         (c)   Enlargement of a use on a site which does not meet all site
development standards required for the use.
         (d)   Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions,
such as setback requirements, height limitations, density requirements, or
other requirements in the district in which the property is located.
      (2)   Permitted extension. Any nonconforming use may be extended
throughout any part of a building which was manifestly arranged or designed for
such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use
shall be extended to occupy any land outside the building. No nonconforming use
of land shall be enlarged, increased, or extended to occupy a greater area of
land, nor shall any such use be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the
lot or parcel than was occupied on the effective date of this chapter or
amendment thereto.
      (3)   Alterations that decrease nonconformity. Any nonconforming
structure or any structure or portion thereof containing a nonconforming use
may be altered if the alteration serves to decrease the nonconforming nature of
the structure or use. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall determine if a proposed
alteration will decrease the degree of nonconformity.
      (4)   Variance to area and bulk regulations. If a proposed alteration is
deemed reasonable by the Zoning Board of Appeals by virtue of the fact that it
would decrease the nonconforming nature of a structure or use, but the
alteration requires a variation of the area or bulk requirements, then the
alteration shall be permitted only if a variance is granted by the Zoning Board
of Appeals. Additionally, the Zoning Board of Appeals may grant variances to
required site development standards applicable to specific uses to permit
expansion of an existing use located on a nonconforming site consistent with
the guidelines and standards of §§
154.450 through
154.453.
   (C)   Repairs, improvements, and modernization.
      (1)   Required repairs. Repairs or maintenance deemed necessary by the
Building Official to keep a nonconforming building structurally safe and sound
are permitted. However, if a nonconforming structure or a structure containing
a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe and/or unlawful due to lack of
maintenance and repairs and is declared as such by the Building Official, it
shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in full
conformity with the regulations in the district in which it is located.
      (2)   Additional permitted improvements. Additional repairs,
improvements, or modernization of nonconforming structures, beyond what is
required to maintain the safety and soundness of the structure, shall be
permitted, provided the repairs or improvements do not exceed 25% of the market
value of the structure (as determined by the City Assessor) during any period
of 12 consecutive months. Any repairs, improvements, and modernization shall
not result in enlargement of the cubic content of the nonconforming structure.
The provisions in this subdivision shall apply to all structures except as
otherwise provided in this subchapter for single-family residential uses and
for reconstruction of structures damaged by fire or other catastrophe.
   (D)   Damage by fire or other catastrophe. 
      (1)   Any nonconforming structure or structure housing a nonconforming
use that is damaged by fire, flood, or other means in excess of 50% of the
structure’s pre-catastrophe fair market value (as determined by the City
Assessor) shall not be rebuilt, repaired, or reconstructed, except in complete
conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   In the event that the damage is less than 50% of the structure"s
pre-catastrophe fair market value, the structure may be restored to its pre-
catastrophe status. Restoration shall take place only upon approval of the
Zoning Administrator and in full compliance with applicable provisions of this
chapter. Any rebuilding, repair, or restoration shall be completed within one
year from the date of the catastrophe.

§ 154.054 ACQUISITION BY CITY; PROCEDURE.
   The Building Official, from time to time, may recommend to the City Council
the acquisition of private property for the purpose of removal of
nonconformities. Where acquisition is contemplated, the following procedures
shall be followed.
   (A)   Building Department documentation and recommendation. The Building
Department shall prepare a report for City Council, which shall include the
following.
      (1)   A list of ordinance requirements which the subject property does
not conform to.
      (2)   Estimates of the expense of acquisition and removal of the
nonconformities.
      (3)   Estimates of the probable resale price of the property.
      (4)   Recommendations concerning the allocation of costs to the
surrounding district.
   (B)   City Council consideration.
      (1)   Public hearing. After receiving and reviewing the report from the
Building Official, the City Council shall determine if acquisition should be
pursued. If the Council decides to pursue acquisition, then it shall first set
a public hearing. Not less than 15 days prior to the public hearing, notice of
the time, place, and purpose of the public hearing shall be published in the
official newspaper of the city, and sent by mail to the owners of property for
which acquisition is being considered. The notice shall be sent to the owner's
address as stated in the latest assessment roll.
      (2)   Special assessment. If any or all of the expense related to
acquisition of the subject property is assessed to a special district, then the
City Assessor shall be directed to furnish the City Council with a tentative
special assessment district and tentative plan of assessment. The names and
addresses of the owners of property located in the district (as stated in the
latest assessment roll) shall be provided to City Council. Notice of the time,
place, and purpose of the public hearing shall be sent by mail to the owners of
property located in the tentative special assessment district.
      (3)   City Council determination. If, following the public hearing, the
City Council finds that elimination of the nonconforming use or structure would
be for a public purpose and for a public use, then it shall declare by
resolution that the city shall proceed to acquire the nonconforming use or
structure in accordance with the laws of the state, the city Charter, and
applicable ordinances of the city. The City Clerk shall send by registered mail
a certified copy of the City Council resolution to the owners of property to be
acquired, and to owners of property in any special assessment district, at the
addresses stated in the latest assessment roll.
   (C)   Removal of nonconformity. Upon passing of title of the property so
acquired by the city, the City Council shall cause the discontinuance or
removal of the nonconforming use, or the removal, demolition or remodeling of
the nonconforming building or structure.
   (D)   Disposition of property. The City Council may thereafter elect to
retain all or part of the property so acquired for municipal purposes. If
acquisition costs and expenses are to be assessed against a special district,
the amount to be assessed shall be reduced by the market value of the property
retained for municipal use, as determined by the City Assessor. The City
Council shall thereafter order the sale of the portion of the property not
retained for municipal purposes, but only for use in conformance with this
chapter. The City Council shall confirm the expense of the project and report
any assessable cost to the City Assessor, who shall then prepare an assessment
roll in the manner provided for in the City Charter and Chapter 41 of this
Code. Such an assessment may, at the discretion of the City Council, be paid in
one or more, but not to exceed ten, annual installments.

issuance of the building permit shall be required.
   (B)   Change in use or intensity.  
      (1)   Whenever use of a building, structure, or lot is changed, parking
facilities shall be provided as required by this chapter for the new use,
regardless of any variance which may have been in effect prior to change of
use.
      (2)   If the intensity of use of any building, structure, or lot is
increased through the addition of dwelling units, increase in floor area,
increase in seating capacity, or through other means, additional off-street
parking shall be provided for the increase in intensity of use.
   (C)   Existing parking facilities.  
      (1)   Off-street parking facilities in existence on the effective date of
this chapter shall not thereafter be reduced below, or if already less than,

changed to any other use unless equal facilities are provided elsewhere in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Additional off-street parking. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed
to prevent voluntary establishment of off-street parking facilities to serve an
existing use of land or buildings, or to prevent provision of additional
parking facilities beyond what is required by this chapter provided all parking
conforms with the regulations herein.
(Ord. 92-005, passed 2-17-92) Penalty, see §
154.999
§ 154.066 GENERAL OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Location.
      (1)   Proximity to building or use being served. Except as otherwise
permitted for shared off-street parking, off-street parking for multiple-family
and nonresidential uses shall be located on the same lot or parcel as the
building, or within 300 feet of the building it is intended to serve, as
measured from the nearest point of the building or use to the nearest point of
the parking.
      (2)   Within yards.
         (a)   Off-street parking in commercial and office districts may be

continued use and maintenance of the shared parking area, as well as cross-
access without limitation, shall be executed by the parties concerned and
submitted to the City for approval before recording with the Wayne County
Register of Deeds. The agreement shall assure the continued availability of the
parking facility for the uses it is intended to serve.
   (D)   Access to parking. Each off-street parking space shall open directly
onto an aisle or driveway of sufficient width and design as to provide safe and
efficient access to or from a public street or alley in a manner that will

§ 154.067 MINIMUM OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   The following standards shall be used in determining the required number of
parking spaces.
   (A)   Definition of floor area. For the purposes of determining the required
number of parking spaces, floor area shall be measured in accordance with the
definitions provided in §
154.005.
   (B)   Units of measurement.
      (1)   Fractional spaces. When calculations for determining the required
number of parking spaces results in a fractional space, any fraction of less
than one-half may be disregarded, while a fraction of one-half or more shall be
counted as one full space.
      (2)   Employee parking. Parking spaces required for employees shall be
based on the maximum number of employees on the premises at any one time.
   (C)   Uses not cited. For those uses not specifically mentioned, the
requirements for off-street parking for the most similar use stated shall be
determined by the Zoning Administrator.
   (D)   Parking during construction. Temporary off-street parking shall be
provided for workers during construction at a rate of one space per employee.
Temporary gravel surfacing may be permitted for temporary parking. Temporary
parking areas must be abandoned and returned to the original state or improved
in accordance with an approved site plan prior to the issuance of a certificate
of occupancy.
   (E)   Parking for the physically handicapped. Each parking lot that serves a
building, except single- and two-family dwelling units, shall have a number of
level parking spaces, identified by an above-grade sign which indicates the
spaces are reserved for physically handicapped persons. Parking for the
handicapped shall comply with the state Barrier-Free Rules, Public Act 1 of
1966, as amended, being M.C.L.A. 125.1351 et seq., and the adopted city
Building Code. The number of barrier-free spaces required is as follows.
Total Parking In Lot   Required Number of Barrier-Free Spaces
Total Parking In Lot   Required Number of Barrier-Free Spaces
Up to 25                 1
26 to 50                 2
51 to 75                 3
76 to 100                4
101 to 150               5
151 to 200               6

301 to 400               12
Over 400                 12 plus 2 for every 250 or fraction thereof over 400
   (F)   Use of loading space. Required loading space shall not be counted or
used for parking requirements.
   (G)   Modification of minimum requirements. In the case of a site plan for
development within the Planned Development District, the Planning Commission
may modify a numerical standard for off-street parking. In other nonresidential
districts, the Zoning Board of Appeals may reduce a standard for a particular
site, based upon evidence that another standard would be more reasonable,
considering the level of current or future employment and/or level of current
or future customer traffic.
   (H)   Shared parking. Off-street parking for two or more uses may be
provided collectively via a shared common parking area. The uses that share a
common parking area may be located within a single building or in separate
buildings. The uses may be located on the same or different property or lot.
The total number of spaces provided collectively shall not be less than the sum
of spaces calculated according to the following procedure.
      (1)   Multiply the minimum parking required for each use, as set forth in
Section 74-6.204 by the appropriate percentage indicated in Table 6, Shared
Parking Factors for each of the six designated time periods.
      (2)   Add together the resulting modified parking figures for each of the
six time period columns. The highest total of the time period columns shall be
the minimum shared parking requirement.
      (3)   If a particular land use proposing to make use of collective
parking facilities (e.g., religious institution, municipal use) does not
conform to the general classifications in the Shared Parking Factors table (as
determined by the Zoning Administrator), the applicant shall submit sufficient
data to indicate the principal operating hours of the proposed use. Based upon
this documentation, the Zoning Administrator shall determine the appropriate
collective parking requirement (if any) for the proposed use.

§ 154.071 ACCESS MANAGEMENT.
   The purpose of this section is to protect the substantial public investment
in the city's street system by preserving the traffic capacity of existing
streets. It is the further intent of this section to promote safe and efficient
travel within the city; minimize disruptive and potentially hazardous traffic
conflicts; establish efficient standards for driveway spacing and the number of
driveways; and ensure reasonable vehicular access to properties, though not
always the most direct access.
   (A)   Zoning districts. The standards of this section shall apply to land in
Garden City's nonresidential zoning districts only.
   (B)   County or state access management standards. Where Wayne County or the
Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) have adopted access management
standards which are more restrictive than the standards of this section, the
adopted county or MDOT standards shall supersede the standards of this section.
   (C)   Driveway spacing standards. Each parcel or part thereof subject to the
standards of this section shall have no more than one driveway entrance and
exit opening to a public street for each 75 feet of frontage or fraction
thereof.
      (1)   Where more than one driveway is allowed, the driveways shall be
located at least 30 feet apart.
      (2)   No driveway shall be located within 25 feet of a side lot boundary,
or within 25 feet of an intersection of two or more street rights-of-way.
   (D)   Shared access standards. Vehicle access to parcels or parts thereof
subject to the standards of this section may be provided by the development and
use of shared driveways, cross-access drives, and similar means of shared
access, subject to the following:
      (1)   Location. New shared driveways and cross-access drives shall be
aligned with existing or proposed drives on adjacent lots where feasible, and
shall be located parallel or perpendicular to the street right-of-way, as
appropriate.
      (2)   Cross-access easement. Shared driveways and cross-access drives
shall be located within a dedicated access easement that permits traffic
circulation between lots. Such access easement shall be recorded with the
County Register of Deeds.
      (3)   Maintenance. The easement area shall remain clear of obstructions
and shall not be used for parking unless otherwise approved by the Planning
Commission. Each property owner shall be responsible for maintenance of the
shared access easement area.
   (E)   Allowed modification. The Planning Commission may waive certain
requirements of this section if practical difficulties exist on the site that
make compliance unreasonable (i.e., sight distance limitations, existing
development, topography, unique site configuration or shape) or existing off-
site driveways make it impractical to comply with the standards of this
section. The modification shall be the minimum necessary.

LANDSCAPING
§ 154.080 INTENT AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Intent. Landscaping enhances the visual image of the city, improving
property values and alleviating the impact of noise, traffic, and visual
d1straction associated with certain uses. Screening is important to protect
less intensive uses from the noise, light, traffic, litter and other impacts of
more intensive, nonresidential uses. Accordingly, these provisions are intended
to set minimum standards for the design and use of landscaping, greenbelts, and
screening, and for the protection and enhancement of the city's environment.
More specifically, the intent of these provisions is to do the following.
      (1)   Improve the appearance of off-street parking areas, vehicular use
areas, and property abutting public rights-of-way.
      (2)   Protect and preserve the appearance, character, and value of the
neighborhoods which abut nonresidential areas, parking areas, and other
intensive use areas, thereby protecting the public health, safety and welfare.
   (B)   Scope of application. No site plan shall be approved unless it shows
landscaping consistent with the requirements of this subchapter. A building
permit shall not be issued until the required landscape plan is submitted and
approved, and a certificate of occupancy shall not be issued unless provisions
set forth in this section have been met or a performance guarantee has been
posted in accordance with the provisions set forth in §
154.036.
   (C)   Minimum requirements. The requirements in this subchapter are minimum
requirements, and under no circumstances shall they preclude the developer from
agreeing to more extensive landscaping.
   (D)   Design creativity. Creativity in landscape design is encouraged.
Accordingly, required trees and shrubs may be planted at uniform distances, at
random, or in groupings, depending on the designer’s desired visual effect and,
equally important, the intent of the city to coordinate landscaping on
adjoining properties.
(Ord. 92-005, passed 2-17-92)
§ 154.081 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   General site requirements. All developed portions of the site shall
conform to the following general landscaping standards, except where specific
landscape elements, such as a greenbelt, berms, or screening are required.
      (1)   All unpaved portions of the site shall be planted with grass,
ground cover, shrubbery, or other suitable live plant material, which shall
extend to any abutting street pavement edge. Grass areas in the front yard of
all nonresidential uses shall be planted with sod.
      (2)   A mixture of evergreen and deciduous trees shall be planted on the
unpaved open portions of nonresidential parcels where specific landscaping
requirements do not appear later in this subchapter. The total number of trees
required shall be determined at the time of site plan review, based on the
overall appearance of the site and the amount of landscaping provided elsewhere
on the site. Required trees may be planted at uniform distances, at random, or
in groupings.
   (B)   Landscaping adjacent to roads and road rights-of-way. Where required,
landscaping adjacent to roads and road rights-of-way shall comply with the
following planting requirements.
      (1)   Minimum requirements. 
         (a)   Where required, landscaping adjacent to a road or road right-of-
way shall consist of a landscaped area with a minimum depth of ten feet, which
shall be located on private property contiguous to the road right-of-way,
excluding openings for driveways and sidewalks. Through lots and corner lots
shall provide such landscaping along all adjacent road rights-of-way.
         (b)   The Planning Commission may permit all or a portion of the
landscaped area to be located within the road right-of-way or elsewhere within
the front setback area, provided that the Planning Commission finds that the
following conditions exist.
            1.   Relocation of the landscaped area is consistent with the
intent of this section.
            2.   Relocation of the landscaped area is justified because of the
physical characteristics of the site, the location of existing easements,
sidewalks, or landscaping, the configuration of existing parking, the need to
maintain emergency vehicle access, or because of other public health or safety
concerns.
            3.   Relocation of the landscaped area will not result in less
landscaped area than would be required if the landscaped area had been located
on private property contiguous to the road right-of- way.
            4.   Relocation of the landscaped area will not jeopardize traffic
safety or the general planning of the city.
      (2)   Required plantings. For the purposes of computing length of road
frontage, openings for driveways and sidewalks shall not be counted. Trees and
shrubs may be planted at uniform distances, at random, or in groupings.
      Type      Requirements
   Deciduous tree    2 per 40 lineal ft. of road frontage
   Shrubs    6 per 40 lineal ft. of road frontage

      (1)   Dimensions. Unless otherwise indicated or appropriate, required
berms shall be measured from the grade of the parking lot or first ground
adjacent to the berm, and shall be constructed with slopes no steeper than one
foot vertical for each three feet horizontal (33% slope), with at least a two-
foot flat area on top. Berms may undulate in height, subject to review and
approval of berm design as shown on the site plan. Unless otherwise indicated,
the maximum height of required berms shall be three feet.
      (2)   Protection from erosion. Any required berm shall be planted with
sod, ground cover, or other suitable live plant material to protect it from
erosion so that it retains its height and shape. The use of railroad ties,
cement blocks, and other types of construction materials to retain the shape
and height of a berm shall be prohibited unless specifically reviewed and
approved by the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Required plantings.  
         (a)   Berms located in the front yard of nonresidential parcels. Berms
located in the front yard of nonresidential parcels shall be landscaped in

other suitable live plant materials shall be planted over the entire greenbelt
area, except where paved walkways are used.
         (b)   Tree and shrub requirements. Except where the greenbelt is used
for screening, a minimum of one deciduous or evergreen tree shall be planted
for each 40 lineal feet or portion thereof of required greenbelt, or,
alternatively, eight shrubs may be substituted for each required tree. Trees
and shrubs may be planted at uniform distances, at random, or in groupings.
         (c)   Distance from sidewalk. Plant materials shall not be placed
closer than four feet from the right-of-way line where the greenbelt abuts a
public sidewalk.
         (d)   Setback from property line. Plant materials shall be placed no
closer than four feet from the property line or fence line.
      (3)   Greenbelts used for screening. Greenbelts used for screening shall
be landscaped in accordance with the requirements for screening, as set forth
in division (E) of this section.
   (E)   Screening.
      (1)   General screening regulations. Unless otherwise specified, wherever
an evergreen or landscaped screen is required, screening shall consist of
closely-spaced evergreen plantings (i.e., no farther than 15 feet apart) which
can be reasonably expected to form a complete visual barrier that is at least
six feet above ground level within three years of planting. Deciduous plant
materials may be used, provided that a complete visual barrier is maintained
throughout the year.
      (2)   Screening of equipment. Mechanical equipment, such as air
compressors, pool pumps, transformers, sprinkler pumps, satellite dish
antennas, and similar equipment shall be screened on at least three sides.
Insofar as is practical, the screening shall exceed the vertical height of the
equipment being screened by at least six inches within two years of planting.
   (F)   Parking lot landscaping. In addition to required screening, all off-
street parking areas shall also provide landscaping as follows.
      (1)   Landscaping ratio. Off-street parking areas containing greater than
15 spaces shall be provided with at least ten square feet of interior
landscaping per parking space. The amount of parking lot landscaping may be
decreased to seven square feet per parking space where a berm is constructed to
screen the parking from the road in accordance with §
154.082(A)(3), (B)(3) or (C)(3). Whenever possible, parking lot landscaping
shall be designed to improve the safety of pedestrian and vehicular traffic,
guide traffic movement, and improve the appearance of the parking area.
      (2)   Minimum area. Landscaped areas in parking lots shall be no less
than five feet in any single dimension and no less than 150 square feet in
area. Landscaped areas in or adjacent to parking lots shall be protected with
curbing or other means to prevent encroachment of vehicles.
      (3)   Other landscaping. Required landscaping elsewhere on the parcel
shall not be counted in meeting the parking lot landscaping requirements.
      (4)   Required plantings. Requirements for plant material shall be based
on the location, size and shape of the parking lot landscaped area. A minimum
of one tree shall be planted per 300 square feet or fraction thereof of
interior landscaped area. At least 50% of each interior landscaped area shall
be covered by living plant material, such as sod, shrubs, ground cover, or
trees. Plantings within parking lots shall comply with the requirements for
unobstructed site distance set forth in §
154.027. The landscape plan shall indicate the types, sizes, and quantities of
plant material proposed for the area.
   (G)   Landscaping of rights-of-way. 
      (1)   Public rights-of-way, located adjacent to required landscaped areas

§ 154.086 MODIFICATIONS.
   In consideration of the overall design and impact of a specific landscape
plan, and in consideration of the amount of existing plant material to be
retained on the site, the Planning Commission may modify the specific
requirements outlined herein, provided that any adjustment is in keeping with
the intent of this subchapter and this chapter in general. In determining
whether a modification is appropriate, the Planning Commission shall consider
whether the following conditions exist.
   (A)   The public benefit intended by the landscape regulations could be
better achieved with a plan that varies from the strict requirements of this
chapter.
   (B)   (1)   Topographic features or other unique features of the site create
conditions such that strict application of the landscape regulations would
result in a less effective screen than an alternative landscape design.
      (2)   Parking, vehicular circulation, or land use are such that required
landscaping would not enhance the site or result in the desired screening
effect.

WALLS
§ 154.100 OBSCURING WALL STANDARDS.
   Where permitted or required by this chapter, obscuring walls shall be
subject to the following requirements.
   (A)   Location. Required obscuring walls shall be placed inside and adjacent
to the lot 1ine except in the following instances.
      (1)   Where underground utilities interfere with placement of the wall at
the property line, the wall shall be placed on the utility easement line
located nearest the property line.
      (2)   Subject to Planning Commission approval, required walls in a
nonresidential district may be located on the side of an alley right-of-way
closest to the adjacent residential zone when mutually agreed upon by affected
property owners and residents. The continuity of the required wall shall be
considered by the Planning Commission in reviewing such requests.
      (3)   Walls shall not extend closer to the front lot line than the
required front setback.
   (B)   Corner clearance. Obscuring walls shall comply with the specifications
for maintenance of unobstructed sight distance for drivers as set forth in §
154.027.
   (C)   Substitution or waiver.  
      (1)   As a substitute for a required obscuring wall, the Planning
Commission may, in its review of the site plan, approve the use of other
existing or proposed living or man-made landscape features (such as closely
spaced evergreens) that would produce substantially the same results in terms
of screening, durability, and permanence. Any substitute screening shall comply
with the applicable requirements set forth in §§
154.027 and
154.081.
      (2)   If a fence is approved by the Planning Commission as a suitable
substitute for a required obscuring wall, the fence shall be constructed of
redwood, cedar, or No. 1 pressure-treated wood. Chain- link fences shall not be
permitted for screening purposes.
      (3)   The Zoning Board of Appeals may waive the requirements for an
obscuring wall upon making the determination that either of the following
apply.
         (a)   The adjoining residential district is in transition and will
become nonresidential in the future.
         (b)   Existing physical features provide adequate screening.
   (D)   Wall specifications. Required walls shall be constructed of masonry
material that is architecturally compatible with the materials used on the

WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES
§ 154.115 SHORT TITLE.
   This subchapter shall be known and cited as the Wireless Telecommunications
section of this chapter.
(Ord. 97-002, passed 6-16-97)
§ 154.116 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   It is the general purpose and intent of the city to carry out the will
of the United States Congress by authorizing communication facilities needed to
operate wireless telecommunication systems. However, it is the further purpose
and intent of the city to provide for that authorization in a manner which
retains the character, property values, public view, and aesthetic quality of
neighborhoods and the community at large. In fashioning and administering the
provisions in this subchapter, it is the intent to balance these potentially
competing interests.
   (B)   In adopting these amendments to the Zoning Ordinance, and in
recognition of the number of providers who have been authorized by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) to provide wireless telecommunication services
and coverage, it is the intent of the city to fully exercise the authority
granted by law relative to the placement, construction and modification of
wireless telecommunication facilities.
   (C)   It is further the purpose and intent of this subchapter to do the
following.
      (1)   Require the City Council and the Planning Commission to regulate
the location and efficient provision of sites for wireless communication
facilities and services.
      (2)   Require the City Council and the Planning Commission to establish
the zoning districts in which the number, shape, and area considered for the
location of wireless telecommunication facilities and services be permitted by
special land use, subject to conformance with applicable standards and
conditions.
      (3)   Provide for regulations within those established districts which
shall be imposed designating the uses for which wireless telecommunication
facilities and services shall or shall not be erected or altered, permitted or
excluded, or subjected to special regulations.
      (4)   Ensure that wireless telecommunication facilities and services are
situated in appropriate locations and have appropriate relationships to other
land uses, structures, and buildings.
      (5)   Limit inappropriate physical and aesthetic overcrowding of land
activities and avoid adverse impacts upon the existing population,
transportation systems, and other public service and facility needs.
      (6)   Facilitate adequate and efficient provision of sites for wireless
telecommunication facilities and services.
      (7)   Promote the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (8)   Require adequate information about plans for wireless
telecommunication facilities and services to allow the city to efficiently plan
and zone their location.
      (9)   Minimize the overall number of new wireless telecommunication
facilities in the city in the future by encouraging the use of existing
structures for attached wireless telecommunication facilities where technically
feasible through the use of colocation. The city recognizes that each licensed
provider of a wireless communication facility must, by law, be permitted to
locate sufficient facilities in order to achieve the objectives promulgated by
the United States Congress. However, in light of the anticipated dramatic
increase in the number of wireless communication facilities to occur as a
result of the recent change of federal law and policy relating to the Federal
Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is the intent of the city that all users
should colocate on attached wireless telecommunication facilities and wireless
telecommunication support structures in the interest of achieving the purposes
and intent of this subchapter.
      (10)   Minimize the adverse impacts of technological obsolescence of
wireless telecommunication facilities and services to include timely removal
and/or conversion.
      (11)   Minimize the adverse impacts from the presence of relatively tall
towers that have a low architectural and aesthetic appeal to most persons,
recognizing that the absence of regulation would result in a material
impediment to the maintenance and promotion of property values, and further
recognizing that this economic component is an important part of the public
health, safety and welfare. The city finds that the presence of numerous tower
structures, particularly if located within residential areas, would decrease
the attractiveness and destroy the character and integrity of the community,
which would in turn have a negative impact upon property values.
      (12)   Minimize the negative visual impacts of wireless telecommunication
facilities and services on the public view of the neighborhoods, community
landmarks, historic sites and buildings, natural beauty areas, and public
rights-of-way by establishing and using as few structures as reasonably
feasible, and using structures which are designed for compatibility, including
the avoidance of lattice structures that are unnecessary, taking into
consideration the purposes and intent of this subchapter.
      (13)   Recognize that the public view and the view from sites and
buildings is a major economic component of a property's value.
      (14)   Recognize that operation of a wireless communication system may
require the establishment of facilities in locations not within the
predetermined zoning districts. In such cases, it is likely that there will be
greater adverse impact upon neighborhoods and areas within the city.
Consequently, more stringent standards and conditions shall apply to the
review, approval and use of such facilities.
      (15)   Provide for the submission of as-built drawings and photographs of
at least three similar existing structures to the city with clearly identified
and certified capacity for colocation and addition of equipment to facilitate
the planning and administration of wireless telecommunication facilities and
services.
      (16)   Provide for the submission of adequate cost, price and market
information to permit administration of colocation.
      (17)   Permit the city to develop community-wide plans for wireless
telecommunication facilities and services.
(Ord. 97-002, passed 6-16-97)

§ 154.120 COLOCATION; NEW SUPPORT STRUCTURES.
   If a provider fails or refuses to permit colocation on a facility owned or
otherwise controlled by the provider, where colocation is feasible, the result
will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure will be compelled, in
direct violation of and in direct contradiction to the basic policy, intent and
purpose of the city. The provisions of this section are designed to carry out
and encourage conformity with the policy of the city.
   (A)   Any proposed commercial wireless telecommunication support structures
shall be designed, structurally, electrically, and in all respects, to
accommodate both the applicant's attached wireless telecommunication facility
and comparable attached wireless telecommunication facilities of additional
users. Wireless telecommunication support structures must be designed to allow
for future rearrangement of attached wireless telecommunication facilities upon
the wireless telecommunication support structure and to accept attached
wireless telecommunication facilities mounted at varying heights.
   (B)   A proposal for a new wireless telecommunication support structure
shall not be approved unless and until it can be documented by the applicant
that the telecommunications equipment planned for the proposed wireless
telecommunication support structure cannot be feasibly colocated and
accommodated on an existing or approved wireless telecommunication support
structure or other existing structure due to one or more of the following
reasons.
      (1)   The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the
existing or approved wireless telecommunication support structure or building,
as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, and the
existing or approved wireless telecommunication support structure cannot be
reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent
equipment at a reasonable cost.
      (2)   The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting
the usability of other existing or planned equipment on the wireless
telecommunication support structure or other existing structure as documented
by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, and the interference cannot
be prevented at a reasonable cost.
      (3)   Existing or approved wireless telecommunication support structures
and buildings within the search radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment
at a height necessary for the coverage area and capacity needs to reasonably
function as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer.
      (4)   Other unforseen reasons that make it infeasible to locate the
planned telecommunications equipment upon an existing wireless
telecommunication support structure or building.
   (C)   Colocation shall be deemed to be feasible for purposes of this section
where all of the following are met.
      (1)   The provider entity being considered for colocation will undertake
to pay market rent or other market compensation for colocation.
      (2)   The site on which colocation is being considered, taking into
consideration reasonable modification or replacement of a facility, is able to
provide structural support.
      (3)   The colocation being considered is technologically reasonable,
e.g., the colocation will not result in unreasonable interference, given
appropriate physical and other adjustment in relation to the structure,
antennas, and the like.
      (4)   The height of the structure necessary for colocation will not be
increased beyond a point deemed to be permissible by the city, taking into
consideration the several standards contained within this section.
   (D)   If a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless telecommunication
support structure shall fail or refuse to alter a structure so as to
accommodate a proposed and otherwise feasible colocation, the facility shall
thereupon and thereafter be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use, and
shall not be altered, expanded or extended in any respect.
   (E)   If a party who owns or otherwise controls a facility shall fail or
refuse to permit a feasible colocation, and this requires the construction and/
or use of a new wireless telecommunication support structure, the party failing
or refusing to permit a feasible colocation shall be deemed to be in direct
violation and contradiction of the policy, intent and purpose of this
subchapter, and, consequently that party shall take responsibility for the
violation, and shall be prohibited from receiving approval for a new wireless
telecommunication support structure within the city for a period of five years
from the date of the failure or refusal to permit the colocation.

§ 154.121 REMOVAL OF FACILITIES.
   When a wireless telecommunications facility has not been used for 180 days
or more, or six months after new technology is available which permits the
operation of a wireless telecommunications facility without the requirement of
a wireless telecommunication support structure, all and/or part of the wireless
telecommunications facility shall be removed by the users, owners of the
wireless telecommunications facility. For the purposes of this section, the
removal of antennas or other equipment from the facility, or the cessation of
operations (transmission and/or reception of radio signals) shall be considered
as the beginning of a period of non-use. The situation(s) in which removal of a
wireless telecommunications facility is required may be applied and limited to
a portion of the facility.
   (A)   Upon the occurrence of one or more of the events requiring removal,
persons who had used the wireless telecommunications facility shall immediately
apply for and secure the application for any required demolition or removal
permits, and immediately proceed with and complete the demolition/removal,
restoring the condition which existed prior to the construction of the wireless
telecommunications facility.
   (B)   If the required removal of the wireless telecommunications facility or
a portion thereof has not been lawfully completed within 60 days of the
applicable deadline, and after at least 30 days written notice, the city may
enter upon the premises and remove or secure the removal of the facility or
required portions thereof, with its actual costs and reasonable administrative
charges to be drawn or collected from the security posted at the time
application was made for establishing the wireless telecommunications facility.

plan for a residential cluster option shall follow the procedures and
requirements established for a special use approval as stated in §§
154.415 through
154.417. The following standards shall apply to single-family cluster projects.
   (A)   Intent. The intent of the single-family cluster option is to provide
the opportunity for creative design in single-family residential districts to
accomplish the following primary objectives.
      (1)   To promote a higher quality of development than could be achieved
under conventional zoning regulations.
      (2)   To encourage innovation in land use and variety in design, layout,
and type of structures constructed.
      (3)   To provide a feasible means of residential development on sites
that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to develop because of the
parcel size or shape, the character of surrounding land uses, or other
constraints.
   (B)   Eligibility criteria.  
      (1)   In considering any proposal for the single-family cluster option,
the Planning Commission shall determine that the proposal satisfies one or more
of the following eligibility criteria.
         (a)   The overall impact of the development will provide a
recognizable and substantial benefit to its ultimate residents and to the
community.
         (b)   The parcel has narrow width, shallow depth, or a unusual
configuration that is a substantial detriment to development as a conventional
subdivision.
         (c)   A significant portion of the property's perimeter is bordered by
a major or secondary thoroughfare, so that, if developed as a conventional
subdivision, a substantial number of the lots would abut the thoroughfare and
be impacted by negative traffic noise and lights.
         (d)   A substantial portion of the property's perimeter is bordered by
land that is zoned or used for more intensive and potentially incompatible
nonresidential development.
         (e)   The parcel contains natural assets that would be preserved or
enhanced through the use of cluster development. Such assets may include stands
of trees, land that serves as a habitat for wildlife, unusual topographic
features, or other natural assets that should be preserved.
      (2)   An application for the single-family cluster option shall be
accompanied by written and graphic documentation demonstrating to the Planning
Commission that the proposal satisfies one or more of the listed eligibility
criteria.

      (1)   The overall density of development on a site that qualifies for
cluster development shall not exceed the standards for density as established
by the underlying zoning regulations for the district in which the site is
located. The density of a development shall be computed by dividing the total
number of units proposed by the allowable acreage. The quotient shall be
rounded to the nearest tenth of an acre.
      (2)   For the purposes of computing density, allowable acreage shall
include the following.
         (a)   All areas to be used for residential purposes, including off-
street parking and private access roads, but excluding public street rights-of-
way.
         (b)   Dedicated private parks and/or common open space devoted for use
of residents of the single-family cluster development.
   (D)   Site design requirements. Single-family cluster developments shall
comply with the following requirements.
      (1)   Clustering alternatives.
         (a)   Attachment of units. A maximum of four single-family dwelling
units may be attached to each other, provided that measures are taken to avoid
monotonous facade design or the appearance of massive buildings that are out-
of-scale with surrounding single-family development. The attached units shall
be offset from one another, and/or different design details (i.e., different
building entrance designs, different building materials, and the like) shall be
used for each unit.
         (b)   Detached clusters. A maximum of single-family detached units may
be combined into a single cluster, provided that the units shall be spaced not
less than ten feet apart. This spacing requirement may be waived or modified by
the Planning Commission during site plan review, based upon a favorable
recommendation of the Fire Chief.
      (2)   Open space.  
         (a)   General requirements. Single-family cluster developments shall
provide and must maintain at least 15% of the site as dedicated common open
space.
         (b)   Water bodies and basins. Up to 25% of the required open space
may include the area of any created water bodies or water detention/retention
basins.
         (c)   Conveyance of open space. The required open space shall be set
aside by the developer through an irrevocable conveyance, such as a deed
restriction(s) or covenant(s) that runs with the land, assuring that the open
space will be developed, dedicated and continually maintained according to the
site plan and never changed to another use.
      (3)   Setbacks.
         (a)    Setbacks between clusters. Each cluster of attached or detached
dwelling units shall be set back a minimum distance of 50 feet from any other
cluster, except that the minimum setback for adjoining clusters that have a
side-to-side building relationship shall be 20 feet.
         (b)   Building setbacks. Buildings within each cluster shall comply
with the following minimum setbacks.
            1.   Internal private road: 20 feet from edge of traveled roadway.

      (4)   Landscaping. Single-family cluster developments shall comply with
the landscaping requirements specified in §§
154.080 through
154.086
      (5)   Transition in density. Where the parcel proposed for use as a
cluster development abuts a conventional single-family development, the cluster
development shall be designed to provide an orderly transition between the two
developments. Such a transition may be achieved by providing a buffer zone
consisting of open space, additional landscaping, berms, changes in topography,
or similar measures.
      (6)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be provided along all public and private
roads within the cluster development.
      (7)   Utility connections. Each dwelling unit shall be separately
connected and metered for city water and sewer service.
   (E)   Determination of eligibility. The application for cluster development
shall include documentation that the proposal satisfies one or more of the
eligibility criteria set forth in division (B)(1) of this section. The Planning
Commission shall make a preliminary determination whether the proposal
qualifies for the cluster option, based on the submitted documentation.
   (F)   Effect of preliminary eligibility determination. Preliminary
determination by the Planning Commission that a parcel qualifies for cluster
development does not assure approval of the site plan. Such a determination,
however, does give the applicant the opportunity to proceed further with site
plan review.
   (G)   Site plan review. A cluster housing development shall be subject to
the site plan review requirements in §§
154.400 through
154.405 of this chapter, as well as the additional requirements in this
section.
   (H)   Information required for site plan review. In addition to the

reference to a cluster development proposal, including the grounds for the
action taken, shall be duly recorded in the minutes of the Planning Commission.
   (J)   Recording of documents. If the Planning Commission approves the
cluster development proposal, all requirements and conditions upon which
approval is based shall be included as part of the approved site plan.
Easements, deed covenants or deed restrictions shall be drafted into recordable
forms, reviewed and approved as to form by the City Attorney, and filed by the
applicant with the appropriate county agency prior to the issuance of a
building permit for any construction.
   (K)   Performance guarantee. A performance guarantee shall be deposited with
the city to ensure faithful completion of improvements, in accordance with §§
154.400 through
154.415.

§ 154.161 COMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENTS.
   In all commercial districts, a limited amount of storage is permitted where
the storage is accessory to the principal retail use. Similarly, in industrial
districts office and sales operations are permitted where such activities are
clearly incidental to the principal industrial use. In certain businesses, the
accessory use is an integral part of the overall business operation, such that
the business takes on the character of a “mixed use.” In these cases, the
specific guidelines provided in this section to determine if the accessory use
is reasonable and should be permitted.
   (A)   Retail uses in industrial districts. Retail uses shall be deemed
acceptable accessory uses in industrial districts if the following criteria are
met.
      (1)   Character of the principal use. The principal use on the site must
be industrial in character. The retail activity must be an integral part of the
business such that separation of the manufacturing and retail activity would
adversely affect operating and management procedures.
      (2)   Percent of floor area. The retail activity shall occupy no more
than 30% of the total floor area or 1,000 square feet, whichever is less.
      (3)   Percent of gross value. The gross value of the retail sales shall
not exceed 30% of the gross value of the products produced on the premises.
      (4)   Products offered for sale. Retail sales shall be limited primarily
to products produced on the premises. If it is determined by the Zoning
Administrator that the sale of limited specialty products not produced on the
premises is essential to installation or use of the principal sold, then those
sales may be permitted, provided that in total they represent less than 50% of
the on-site retail sales.
      (5)   Compatibility of traffic. The type and quantity of traffic
generated by the retail sales operation shall be compatible with permitted
industrial uses in the district.
      (6)   Parking. Adequate parking shall be provided for the retail sales,
as specified in §§
154.065 through
154.069. Off-street parking shall be subject to the location and setback
requirements for the district in which the use is located.
   (B)   Industrial uses in commercial districts. Industrial, processing, and
warehouse uses shall be deemed acceptable accessory uses in commercial
districts if the following criteria are met.
      (1)   Character of the industrial use. Assembly, fabrication,
manufacturing, and warehouse activities shall be directly related to the
specific products or services permitted as principal use on the site.
      (2)   Limits of industrial activity. Any products manufactured or
produced shall not be for distribution to other retail stores or manufacturing
facilities.
      (3)   Types of equipment. Heavy machinery typically found in
manufacturing or industrial plants shall not be permitted. The machinery shall
not create dust, noise, odor, vibration or fumes that would cause an adverse
impact on neighboring properties.
      (4)   Percent of floor area. All industrial activity shall occur within a
defined area and shall occupy no more than 30% of the total building floor area
or 1,000 square feet, whichever is less.
      (5)   Compatibility of traffic. The type and quantity of traffic
generated by the industrial activity shall be compatible with permitted retail
uses in the district.
      (6)   Outside activity prohibited. Industrial activity, if permitted,
shall be located entirely within an enclosed building. There shall be no
outside storage, except as specifically permitted in the district in which the
use is located.

§ 154.162 AUTOMOBILE AND/OR VEHICLE RENTAL ESTABLISHMENTS.
   Automobile and/or vehicle rental operations with outdoor rental space shall
be subject to the requirements that follow. These requirements shall apply to
any operation involving the lease or rental of automobiles and/or vehicles.
   (A)   Grading, surfacing, and drainage. Outdoor lots, parking areas, and
other automobile and vehicle maneuvering areas shall be hard-surfaced with
concrete or bituminous material, and shall be graded and drained so as to
effectively dispose of or retain surface waters. Grading, surfacing, and
drainage plans shall be subject to review and approval by the Director of the
City DPS and/or City Engineer.
   (B)   Servicing of automobiles and/or vehicles. There shall be no servicing
of automobiles and/or vehicles on site, except for the minor routine
maintenance of the interior and exterior of the automobiles and/or vehicles,
and checking of fluid levels. No servicing of any engine compartments.
   (C)   Broadcasting devices prohibited. Devices for the outdoor broadcasting
of voice, telephone monitoring, music or any other amplified sound shall be

§ 154.163 REGULATED USES.
   (A)   Scope of regulations. In the development and execution of this
chapter, it is recognized that there are some uses that, because of their very
nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational
characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under
certain circumstances, thereby causing a deleterious effect upon the adjacent
areas. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to insure that the adverse
effects of these uses will not contribute to the deterioration of the
surrounding neighborhood. These special regulations are itemized in this
section. The primary control or regulation is for the purpose of preventing a
concentration of these uses in any one area; i.e., not more than two such uses
within 1,000 feet of each other. The establishment of the following kinds of
uses is prohibited if the establishment of any one of the following uses
constitutes the third such use within a 1,000-foot radius.
      (1)   Adult book or supply store.
      (2)   Adult model studio.
      (3)   Adult motion picture arcade.
      (4)   Adult motion picture theater or adult live stage performing

regulated uses shall be made to the Zoning Administrator, who shall not approve
any application if there are already in existence two or more regulated uses
within a radius of 1,000 feet of the outermost boundaries of the lot upon which
the proposed regulated use will be situated.
   (C)   Waivers. Upon denial of any application for a regulated use under
division (B) of this section, the applicant may appeal for a waiver of the
locational provisions above to the Zoning Board of Appeals consistent with the
standards set forth below. The Board may waive the locational provisions set
forth in division (B) of this section after all the following findings are
made.
      (1)   Compliance with regulations. The proposed use will not be contrary
to any other provision of this chapter, or injurious to nearby properties.
      (2)   Shall not enlarge district. The proposed use will not enlarge or
encourage the development of a “skid row” or “strip.”
      (3)   Consistent with program. That the establishment of an additional
regulated use will not be contrary to, or interfere with any program of urban
renewal or neighborhood development.
      (4)   Consistent with law. That all applicable city, state, or federal
laws and regulations will be observed.
   (D)   Procedure for waiver. Prior to granting a waiver of the locational
restrictions set forth above, and not less than five nor more than 15 days
before the request for waivers is considered or a public hearing held pursuant
to this section, the Board shall publish, in a newspaper of general circulation
in the city, one notice indicating that a request for waivers to establish a
regulated use has been received, and shall send by mail or personal delivery a
copy of that notice to the owners of the property for which waivers are being
considered and to all persons to whom any real property is assessed within 300
feet of the boundary of the premises in question, and to the occupants of all
structures within 300 feet. If the name of the occupant is not known, the term
“occupant” may be used in making notification.
      (1)   Notification to manager. Notification need not be given to more
than one occupant of a structure, except that if a structure contains more than
one dwelling or spatial area owned or leased by different individuals,
partnerships, businesses, or organizations, one occupant of each dwelling unit
or spatial area shall receive notice. In the case of a single structure
containing more than four dwelling units or other distinct spatial areas owned
or leased by different individuals, partnerships, businesses, or organizations,

the regulated use. If the applicant or the Board requests a public hearing
under this section, any interested person may be represented by a person, firm,
organization, partnership, corporation, board or bureau.
   (E)   Establishment prohibited near schools and residential zones.
      (1)   Restrictions. It shall be unlawful to hereafter establish any
regulated use if the proposed regulated use will be within a 300-foot radius of
a residentially-zoned district, or within a 500-foot radius of any nursery,
primary, or secondary school. This prohibition relative to the establishment of
a regulated use near residentially-zoned districts shall be waived upon the
presentment to the Zoning Board of Appeals of a validated petition requesting
the waiver, signed by at least 51% of all those persons owning, residing, or
doing business within 300 feet of the proposed location. No waivers shall be
given to permit a regulated use to locate within a 500-foot radius of any
nursery, primary, or secondary school.
      (2)   Petitions for waiver. The Zoning Administrator shall adopt rules
and regulations governing the procedure for securing any petition of waiver,
which may be provided for this section. The rules shall provide that the

establishment of any regulated use, the Board of Appeals may impose any
conditions or limitations upon the establishment, location, construction,
maintenance, or operation of the regulated use as in its judgment may be
necessary for the protection of the public interest. Any evidence, bond, or
other performance and guarantee may be required as proof that the conditions
stipulated in connection therewith will be fulfilled.

subject to the following Design Guidelines and must comply with the following
guiding principles. Each project shall include the complete renovation of an
existing building to include the guiding principles for design. Any new
construction shall conform to all of the following guiding principles. The
Planning Department will provide feedback on the project's compliance with
these principles and compliance during the approval process.
      (1)   Appropriate site design. All development should be appropriate for
its context, with building height, setbacks, orientation, lighting, and signage
all designed to fit with the surrounding area.
         (a)   For large developments, cluster buildings to allow for shared
circulation and parking, easy access to common outdoor spaces and promote
pedestrian safety.
         (b)   Building density should fit within the surrounding area.
         (c)   Create a strong street wall or comply with setback requirements
of the district.
         (d)   Provide clear building and site signage. All signage (including
wayfinding, directory and wall signs) shall have a unified design theme.
         (e)   Illuminate all parking areas, entrances and walkways to improve
safety. All lighting shall be directed away from the street and avoid spillover
impacts onto adjacent properties. Light sources should be integrated within the
building and shielded to reflect down onto the ground.
      (2)   Site access and circulation. Provide adequate access and
maneuverability for trucks and cars while paying special attention to the
attractiveness of the street frontage and conflicts with streets and pedestrian
paths.
      (3)   Parking, loading, and outdoor storage. Screen and locate parking,
loading, and outdoor storage areas toward the side or rear of the property away
from public streets. To mitigate negative impacts from industrial uses, sites
should provide natural buffers to rights-of-way and adjacent uses. Parking
Standards shall be met for each use (retailer, processor, grower) per § 154.065
(Off Street Parking and Loading Requirements).
      (4)   Building form and materials. Buildings shall be designed or
remodeled to avoid the appearance of long, blank walls and use high-quality
building materials to enhance key elements such as entrances and corners.
         (a)   All buildings shall be compatible in scale, massing and style
with structures in the area.
         (b)   Vary and articulate all facades to avoid large monotonous walls.
Where the building mass cannot be broken up, building walls may be articulated
through the use of texture, color material changes or other façade treatments.
Entrance facades shall have a high level of detail. Entranceways shall be
emphasized through special design to highlight the entrance location to
include, awnings, porches or porticos.
         (c)   Brick shall be the primary wall covering with variations of
design and layout to enhance the exterior of the building.
         (d)   Use of quality building materials that convey a sense of
permanence.
      (5)   Walls and fences and landscaping. Walls and fences are attractive,
durable, and used to provide screening or security in certain areas of the
site, rather than "wall off" the entire facility. Site landscaping is used to
offset expanses of impervious surfaces and soften visual impacts of buildings,
parking/loading, outdoor storage, and detention ponds.
         (a)   Parking areas shall have a three foot high (as measured from
grade) brick walls that shield the parking lot from the public right of way.
         (b)   Any fencing on the lot shall not exceed six feet in height (as
measured from grade) unless otherwise required by the Cannabis Regulatory
Agency or its successors and be decorative aluminum or steel fencing. There
shall be no razor wire or barbed wire on the site.
         (c)   All fencing shall be located in the rear or side of the lot and
building. No front yard fences are permitted.
         (d)   Landscaping shall be compatible with and integrated with the
building and suitable to the functions of the space. A narrow row of
landscaping is prohibited. The site shall be maximized to include landscaped
areas.
         (e)   Provide canopy trees in planting areas and parking areas.
         (f)   Foundation plantings are required and to include a mix of
evergreen and perennial plantings.
         (g)   Automatic irrigation is required in all landscaped and grass
areas.
         (h)   Landscape plans shall be completed by a registered Landscape
Architect.
      (6)   Sustainable design. Site and building design should utilize design
strategies that decrease energy use, reduce urban heat island effects, manage
stormwater runoff, and naturally mitigate air pollution resulting from
industrial operations and traffic.
         (a)   Orient buildings to take advantage of passive heating, cooling
and daylighting opportunities.
         (b)   Integrate solar panels to offset on-site energy needs.
         (c)   Employ stormwater management solutions such as green roofs,
permeable pavement, underground retention and bioswales.
      (7)   Safe site and design for community policing. Site layout should be
designed to provide clear site distances and visibility for safety and
approachability for Police Department interaction.
         (a)   Integrate Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED)
principles in the site and building design consistent with the Cannabis
Regulatory Agency or its successor's guidelines. The design will include the
five elements of CPTED:   
            1.   Natural access control;
            2.   Natural surveillance;
            3.   Territoriality;
            4.   Activity support; and
            5.   Maintenance.

§ 154.185 DETERMINATION OF COMPLIANCE; METHODS.
   In the event that the city receives complaints or otherwise acquires
evidence of possible violation of any of the performance standards not forth in
this subchapter, the following procedures shall be used to investigate, and if
necessary, resolve the violation.
   (A)   Official investigation. Upon receipt of evidence of possible
violation, the Zoning Administrator shall make a determination whether there in
reasonable cause to suspect the operation is indeed in violation of the
performance standards. The Zoning Administrator may initiate an official
investigation in order to make such a determination. Upon initiation of an
official investigation, the Zoning Administrator is empowered to require the
owner or operator of the facility in question to submit data along with any
evidence deemed necessary to make an objective determination regarding the
possible violation within a time period specified by the Zoning Administrator,
but in every case a reply must be forthcoming within three calendar days from
the receipt of notice. Failure of the owner or operator to supply requested
data within the stated time period shall be considered an admission of
violation and provide prima facie evidence of grounds for taking any action,
including legal action, to terminate the use and/or deny or cancel any permits
or licenses required for continued use of the land. Data which may be required
includes, but is not limited to the following.
      (1)   Plans of the existing or proposed facilities, including buildings
and equipment.
      (2)   A description of the existing or proposed machinery, processes and
products.
      (3)   Specifications for the mechanism and techniques used or proposed to
be used to control emissions regulated under the provisions of this subchapter.
      (4)   Measurement of the amount or rate of emissions of the material,
including but not limited to, heat, sound, and glare, purported to be in
violation.
      (5)   Copies of studies, reports, specifications, and any other
compilation of data, including, but not limited to, RCRA filings.
   (B)   Method and cost of determination.  
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator shall take measurements, or cause
measurements to be taken by a competent contractor, and complete investigation
necessary to make an objective determination concerning the purported
violation. Where required measurements and investigation can be accurately made
by the Zoning Administrator using equipment and personnel normally available to
the city without extraordinary expense, the measurements and investigation may
be completed before notice of violation is issued. If necessary, skilled
personnel and specialized equipment or instruments shall be secured in order to
make the required determination.
      (2)   If the alleged violation is found to exist in fact, the costs of
making the determination shall be charged against those responsible, in
addition to any other penalties as may be allowable. If the bill is not paid
within 30 days, the city shall take whatever appropriate action is necessary to
recover the
costs, or alternately, the cost shall be charged against the property where the
violation occurred. If it is determined that no substantive violation exists,
then the costs of this determination shall be paid by the city.
   (C)   Appropriate remedies. If, after appropriate investigation, the Zoning
Administrator determines that a violation does exist, the Zoning Administrator
shall take or cause to be taken lawful action as provided by this chapter or
any state or federal regulation to eliminate the violation. The owners or
operators of the facility deemed responsible shall be given written notice of
the violation. The Zoning Administrator shall take appropriate action in
accordance with the owner or operator's response to the notice of violation.
Appropriate action includes the following.
      (1)   Correction of violation within time limit. If the alleged violation
is corrected within the specified time limit, even if there is no reply to the
notice, the Zoning Administrator shall note “Violation Corrected” on the city's
copy of the notice, and the notice shall be retained on file. If necessary, the
Zoning Administrator may take other action as may be warranted by the
circumstances of the case, pursuant to this chapter and any other applicable
regulation.
      (2)   Violation not corrected and no reply from owner or operator. If
there is no reply from the owner or operator within the specified time limits,
and the alleged violation is not corrected in accordance with the regulations,
set forth in this subchapter, then the Zoning Administrator shall take any
action reasonably calculated to correct or abate the violation.
      (3)   Reply requesting extension of time. If the alleged violator
responds to the city within the specified time limit of the original notice and
requests an extension of time, the Zoning Administrator shall review the
information submitted with the reply. Upon finding that an extension is
warranted because of unique circumstances and that an extension will not cause
imminent peril to life, health, or property, the Zoning Administrator may
extend the specified time limit to a certain date, if the Zoning Administrator
concurs that one of the following are true.
         (a)   The information requested pursuant to divisions (A) of this
section is impractical to readily produce.
         (b)   An extreme hardship exists.
         (c)   The reply indicates that an alleged violation shall be corrected
or abated by the date certain and that all future operations shall comply with
the regulations as set forth herein.
      (4)   Reply requesting technical determination.  
         (a)   If a reply is received within the specified time limit
requesting further review and technical analysis, even though the alleged
violations continue, then the Zoning Administrator may call in properly
qualified experts to complete the analysis and confirm or refute the initial
determination of violation.
         (b)   If expert findings indicate that violations of the performance
standards do exist in fact, the costs incurred in making such a determination
shall be paid by the persons responsible for the violations, in addition to
such other penalties as may be appropriate under the terms of this chapter or
other applicable regulations. Costs shall be billed to those owners or
operators of the subject use who are deemed responsible for the violation. If
the bill is not paid within 30 days, the city shall take whatever appropriate
action is necessary to recover such costs, or alternately, the cost shall be
charged against the property where the violation occurred. If no substantial
violation is found, cost of determination shall be paid by the city.
   (D)   Continued violation. If, after the conclusion of the time period
granted for compliance, the Zoning Administrator finds that the violation still
exists, any permits previously issued shall be void and the city may initiate
appropriate legal action, including possible pursuit of remedies in Circuit
Court.

§ 154.330 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is the intent of these regulations to permit Planned Development
for the following purposes.
      (1)   Encouraging innovation in land use planning and development.
      (2)   Achieving a higher quality of development than would otherwise be
achieved.
      (3)   Encouraging assembly of lots and redevelopment of outdated
commercial corridors.
      (4)   Encouraging initial development on sites that would be difficult to
develop according to conventional standard because of the shape, size, abutting
development, accessibility, or other features of the site.
      (5)   Providing enhanced housing, employment, and shopping opportunities.
      (6)   Providing a development framework that promotes appropriate
business activity that significantly improves the economic viability of the
city.
      (7)   Ensuring compatibility of design and function between neighboring
properties.
      (8)   Encouraging development that is consistent with the city's Master
Plan.
   (B)   These Planned Development regulations are not intended as a device for
ignoring the more specific standards in this chapter, or the planning upon
which the standards are based. Rather, these provisions are intended to result
in development that is substantially consistent with the zoning standards
generally applied to the proposed uses, but allowing for modifications to the
general standards to assure a superior quality of development.

§ 154.333 PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS.
   The approval of a Planned Development proposal shall require an amendment to
the Zoning ordinance to revise the zoning map and designate the subject
property as “Planned Development.” Approval of a Planned Development proposal,
including all aspects of the final plan and conditions imposed on it, shall
constitute and inseparable part of the zoning amendment. Planned Development
applications shall be submitted in accordance with the procedures and
requirements set forth in §§
154.430 through
154.438. That subchapter calls for a two-step approval process as follows.
   (A)   The applicant shall first submit a Planned Development Plan which
shall be reviewed in accordance with zoning amendment procedures. The Planning
Commission shall review the Planned Development Plan, hold a public hearing,
and make a recommendation to the City Council. The City Council shall have the
final authority to act on a Planned Development Plan and grant the requested
Planned Development zoning.
   (B)   Following approval of the Planned Development Plan and rezoning to
Planned Development (PD), the applicant shall submit a final site plan for
review by the Planning Commission in accordance with normal site plan review
procedures.
(Ord. 92-005, passed 2-17-92)
§ 154.334 STANDARDS FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL.
   In considering any application for approval of a Planned Development
proposals, the Planning Commission and City Council shall make the
determinations on the basis of standards set forth for site plan review in §
154.331, as well as the following standards and requirements.
   (A)   Conformance with the Planned Development concept. The overall design
and all uses proposed in connection with a Planned Development shall be
consistent with and promote the intent of the Planned Development concept as
described in §
154.330, as well as with the specific project design standards set forth
herein.
   (B)   Compatibility with adjacent uses. The proposed Planned Development
shall set forth specifications with respect to height, setbacks, density,
parking, circulation, landscaping, views, and other design and layout features
which exhibit due regard for the relationship of the development to surrounding
properties and the uses thereon. In determining whether this requirement has
been met, consideration shall be given to the following.
      (1)   The bulk, placement, and materials of construction of proposed
structures.
      (2)   The location and screening of vehicular circulation and parking
areas in relation to surrounding development.
      (3)   The location and screening of outdoor storage, outdoor activity or
work areas, and mechanical equipment in relation to surrounding development.
      (4)   The hours of operation of the proposed uses.
      (5)   The provisions of landscaping and other site amenities.
   (C)   Public services. The proposed Planned Development shall not exceed the
capacity of existing and available public services, including but not
necessarily limited to utilities, public roads, police and fire protection
services, and educational services, unless the project proposal contains an
acceptable plan for providing necessary services or evidence that those
services will be available by the time the Planned Development is completed.
   (D)   Impact of traffic. The Planned Development shall be designed to
minimize the impact of traffic generated by the proposed development on
surrounding uses. In determining whether this requirement has been met,
consideration shall be given to the issues required in the traffic impact
analysis set forth in §
154.438(C)(3).
   (E)   Accommodations for pedestrian traffic. The Planned Development shall
be designed with a sidewalk network to accommodate safe pedestrian circulation
throughout and along the perimeter of the site, without interference from
vehicular traffic.
   (F)   Compatibility with the Master Plan. The proposed Planned Development
shall be consistent with the general principles and objectives of the adopted
Master Plan.

§ 154.335 PHASING; COMMENCEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   Integrity of each phase. Where a project is proposed for construction
in phases, the project shall be so designed that each phase, when completed,
shall be capable of standing on its own in terms of the presence of services,
facilities, and open space, and shall contain the necessary components to
ensure protection of natural resources and the health, safety and welfare of
the users of the Planned Development and residents of the community.
   (B)   Rate of completion of residential and nonresidential components.  
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of the following provisions is to ensure that
Planned Developments are constructed in an orderly manner and, further, to
ensure that the Planned Development approach is not used as a means of
circumventing restrictions on the location or quantity of certain types of land
use.
      (2)   General standards. In developments which include residential and
nonresidential components, the phasing plan shall provide for completion of at
least 35% of all proposed residential units concurrent with the first phase of
any nonresidential construction; completion of at least 75% of all proposed
residential construction concurrent with the second phase of nonresidential
construction; and completion of 100% of all residential construction prior to
the third phase of nonresidential construction. For purposes of carrying out
this provision, the percentages shall be approximations as determined by the
Planning Commission and Chief Building Inspector, based on the floor area and
land area allocated to each use.
      (3)   Modifications to general standards. The percentages may be modified
should the Planning Commission and Chief Building Inspector determine that the
applicant has presented adequate assurance that the residential component or
components of the project will be completed within the specified time period.
      (4)   Completion of each phase.
         (a)   Construction of any facility may commence at any time following
site plan approval per §
154.405, provided that construction shall be commenced for each phase of the
project within 24 months of the schedule set forth on the approved plan for the
planned development. However, the applicant may submit a revised phasing plan
for review and approval by the Planning Commission. The applicant shall also
submit a statement indicating the conditions which made the previous phasing
plan unachievable. Once construction of a planned development has commenced,
approval of a revised phasing plan shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, provided that the revised phasing does not materially change the
integrity of the approved planned development proposal. In the event that
construction has not commenced within the required time period and a revised
phasing plan has not been submitted, the city may initiate proceedings to end
the zoning classification of the undeveloped portion of the site.

MUO MIXED USE OVERLAY DISTRICT
§ 154.340 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The intent of the MUO Mixed Use Overlay District is to accommodate a
mix of commercial and residential uses on a single lot and/or building. Mixed
use sites function as a transition from sites that are exclusively commercial
uses to the higher-density, mixed uses that are permitted within the Central
Business District. Office, personal service and retail commercial uses that are
compatible with residential uses are envisioned to be located on the same lot
to create additional development options for property owners. The Mixed Use
Overlay is a permissive alternative for owners and is not a requirement.
   (B)   This district encourages the creation of corridors and sites in the
city with greater pedestrian-scale interaction between businesses and
residents. Mixed use sites will allow property owners a wider variety of
development opportunities while creating unique types of housing alternatives
for new and existing residents. Businesses will have an increased customer base
by having more residents in close proximity to their location. Residents will
have more opportunities to walk, rather than drive, to conduct business in the
city.
(Ord. 22-001, passed 1-24-22)
§ 154.341 OVERLAY DISTRICT ESTABLISHED.
   The MUO Mixed Use Overlay District is a mapped zoning district that overlays
the C-1 and C-2 zoning districts along specific corridors or intersections. The
MUO district is shown on the City Zoning Map. Any reference to the overlay
district means the MUO district requirements, while any reference to the
underlying zoning district means that standard zoning district over which the
MUO district is overlaid. The MUO district establishes specific dimensional and
design standards that replace any similar standard from any other article,
chapter, or section of this zoning ordinance that apply in the underlying
zoning district.

parking lot (not for public use), the total number of spaces provided
collectively shall not be less than the sum of spaces required for each
separate use.
         (b)   If the property owner participates with the city Downtown
Development Authority in a public collective parking facility by contributing,
through an easement, their property behind the rear building line, the required
parking spaces for the subject building or use may be reduced by up to 20%.
         (c)   If a property cannot physically accommodate off-street parking
and is within 300 feet of a public collective parking facility, the property
owner/tenant may use the public collective parking facility to satisfy their
off-street parking requirements upon the Planning Commission making a
determination that the parking demands of the uses served do not overlap, or
there is sufficient capacity in the off-street parking facility to accommodate
the increased parking. Further, the property owner exercising this provision
will contribute an annual amount, as established by the Downtown Development
Authority with City Council approval (based on their parking demand) to the
Downtown Development Authority Collective Parking Maintenance Fund.
         (d)   When required parking is located on a lot or parcel that is
under different ownership from the building it serves or is not contiguous to

§ 154.999
§ 154.355 BUILDING DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   The intent of these requirements is to encourage the renovation of existing
buildings and the construction of new buildings in the Central Business
District that follow the rules established by the majority of the existing
buildings. The goal is to re-establish and build upon the visual character that
once existed in order to recreate Downtown Garden City.
   (A)   Building scale. The intent of these guidelines is to encourage the
construction of buildings that are in scale with the majority of the existing
buildings in the Central Business District. The majority of the older buildings
are narrow in width. The intent of these guidelines is not to limit building
width, but to encourage the subdivision of wider façades, breaking-up the scale
and mass of larger buildings, making them more compatible with existing
façades.
      (1)   Large, long façades shall be subdivided into bays, through the
location and arrangement of openings and architectural treatments that are
compatible in size and scale to existing buildings: bay width to be 16 feet to
35 feet.
      (2)   The height-to-width ratio of one-story buildings(including single
bay façades or individual bays of multiple bay façades) is not to exceed one to
two (1:2).
      (3)   The height-to-width ratio of two-story buildings (including single
bay façades or individual bays of multiple bay façades) is not to exceed one to
one (1:1).
   (B)   Building height. Buildings in the Central Business District are
primarily one-story in height with some two-story buildings. The goal is to
provide a variety of buildings heights to enhance the visual diversity in the
Central Business District. Buildings shall be limited to a 45-foot maximum
height to include all special architectural features, such as corner towers,
entry treatments, and the like.
      (1)   The maximum one-story height shall be 24 feet.
      (2)   The maximum two-story building height shall be 35 feet.
      (3)   Special architectural features (i.e., corner towers, entry
treatments, and the like) will be allowed to exceed the above height
requirements if either of the following apply:
         (a)   The feature is located at a corner (the intersection of two
public rights-of-way).
         (b)   The feature is deemed to be necessary to the type, use, or style
of the building in question.
      (4)   Special architectural features shall not exceed the height of the
remainder of the building by more than 30%.
   (C)   Building roof types.
      (1)   Unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission, buildings
shall have a flat roof appearance from the street with a decorative cornice
that is designed proportionate to the size of the building and length of the
wall.
      (2)   Flat roofs shall be enclosed by parapets.
      (3)   The Planning Commission may permit a pitched roof. Mansard roofs
shall not be permitted on single-story buildings. If an alternative roof type
other than flat is permitted, applicant shall ensure all stormwater drainage
will be maintained on the subject property.
      (4)   Parapets and other screening treatment shall use high quality
building materials and shall blend with the design of the building in terms of
color, materials, style, scale, and height.
      (5)   All rooftop-mounted equipment shall be screened from view on all
sides of the building.

   (D)   Front façade. The majority of the existing front façades, the façades
that face public rights-of-way, are comprised of common façade components. The
arrangement of façade elements shall follow this model which includes the
following typical components, such as façade frame, storefront opening, canopy/
awning, and signs.
      (1)   Façade frame. The façade frame, or wall, shall be brick masonry,
constructed principally in a single plane. The top of the parapet wall shall be
flat or step slightly to accentuate end piers. The façade frame shall be capped
by a stone, or simulated stone, coping with a narrow cap flashing. Brick shall
be laid primarily in running bond with minimal decorative detail.
      (2)   Storefront opening. The storefront opening shall be a rectangular
opening, ten to 12 feet high. The opening shall be almost entirely glass
(window or showcases) with few subdivisions. The building entry is often
centered in the storefront opening and is commonly recessed.
         (a)   The glass framing system shall be aluminum or pre-painted steel;
natural-finish aluminum is a typical material and finish.
         (b)   Windows shall be clear or with a slight green tint only.
Reflective, mirror, heavily tinted, or unusually colored glass is prohibited.
         (c)   Entry doors shall be one- or two-lite door that matches the
storefront glass framing system.
         (d)   Windows shall not be blocked with opaque materials or the back

         CANOPY or AWNING. An architectural feature or roof-like structure
directly attached to a building that may shade a window or door opening or
provide pedestrians protection from the weather. A CANOPY or AWNING is
typically located over a sidewalk and may be a fixed architectural element or
constructed to be raised or retracted.
         (b)   Front façade canopies and awnings.
            1.   Canopies and awnings shall be traditional in design,
consistent with those illustrated in Graphic 7 above. Unusually shaped awnings
are prohibited.
            2.   Canopies and awnings may project a maximum of eight feet
beyond the building façade and must be a minimum of six feet from the curb
line.
            3.   Canopies and awnings may project over a sidewalk with a
minimum-eight-foot clearance provided above the sidewalk grade.
            4.   Canopies and awnings shall be constructed of a durable
material such as canvas or other opaque fabric, metal, plastic, or rigid
fiberglass. High-gloss or plasticized materials are not permitted.
            5.   Canopies and awnings shall not be internally illuminated. Any
signs shall be illuminated by fixtures located above the awning and directed
downward.
            6.   Canopies and awnings are not intended to be a principal means
of signage. The type and amount of signage shall be limited, as set forth in §
154.355(D)(4)(d) and §
154.606(E).
            7.   Canopies and awnings shall be maintained in good appearance
and repair.
      (4)   Signs. Permitted signs within the CBD Zoning District shall comply

storefront opening.
         (b)   The height of building-mounted signs shall not exceed 50% of the
height of the upper façade wall, as measured from the top of the storefront
opening to the top of the parapet cap. Projecting signs are exempt from this
requirement.
         (c)   Projecting signs are allowed. The maximum allowable projection
is 42 inches. The height of projecting signs shall not exceed 75% of the height
of the upper façade wall, as measured from the top of the storefront opening to
the top of the parapet cap.
         (d)   Signs are permitted to be located on awning and canopy fascias
but are prohibited on the sloping portion of awnings and canopies. The height
of lettering on the fascia of an awning or canopy shall be limited to a maximum
of 12 inches.
   (E)   Side or rear façades. Side or rear façades are, in many cases, as
important as front façades, as they are often located adjacent to parking, and,
therefore, serve as the primary entrance to the building, as illustrated in
Graphic 8. Often times they must also accommodate service and delivery
functions as well. Side or rear façades shall exhibit the same components as
front façades wherever the façade is visible from a public street, or if the
main parking area is located to the side or rear of a building. Materials and
architectural features similar or complimentary to those present on the front
of the building shall be used on the side or rear façade.

      (1)   Intent. The exterior appearance of any building located within the
Central Business District has an effect upon the desirability of the immediate
area and of neighboring areas for business and other purposes. Maintenance of
an attractive, compatible, and pleasing exterior appearance of such buildings
will prevent impairment of the stability of the value of other real property in
the area, permit the most appropriate development of the area, and will prevent
attendant deterioration of conditions affecting the general welfare of the
citizens of the city.
      (2)   Scope of application. Except for those items listed below, all
plans submitted for site plan review and special use review shall be subject to
design review requirements of this section. Those items exempt from these

submitted materials concurrently with site plan review by the Planning
Commission. In considering approvals of site plans in the Central Business
District, the Planning Commission shall review recommendations provided by the
Downtown Development Authority. The Downtown Development Authority must forward
a recommendation to the Planning Commission seven days prior to the Planning
Commission meeting during which the site plan will be reviewed. If no
recommendation is provided by the Downtown Development Authority, the Planning
Commission shall complete the site plan review and approval process.
      (4)   Information required. The Downtown Development Authority shall
receive same set of plans as being reviewed by the Planning Commission and
promptly review all drawings, data, plans, and specifications in the same form
as submitted to the Planning Commission.
      (5)   Design criteria. In the process of reviewing the submitted
materials, the Downtown Development Authority shall consider:
         (a)   Site design.
            1.   The site shall be planned to accomplish a desirable
transition, between the building(s) with the streetscape to provide for
adequate planting, safe pedestrian movement, and parking areas.
            2.   Parking areas shall be treated with decorative elements,
building wall extensions, plantings, or other innovative means so as to screen
parking area from view of public ways.
            3.   The height and scale of each building shall be compatible with
its site and existing (or anticipated) adjoining buildings.
            4.   Newly installed utility services, and service revisions
necessitated by exterior alterations, shall be underground.
         (b)   Building design. Architectural style, building mass, and
placement shall be compliant with design guidelines of §
154.355.
      (6)   Approval standards. The Downtown Development Authority shall review
the particular circumstance and facts applicable to each submittal in terms of
preceding design criteria, and shall make a recommendation as to whether the
proposal meets the following standards:
         (a)   The appearance, color, texture, and materials being used will
preserve property values in the immediate neighborhood and will not adversely
affect any property values.
         (b)   The building exterior will not detract from the general harmony
of and is compatible with other buildings already existing in the immediate
neighborhood.
         (c)   The appearance of the building exterior will not be garish or
otherwise offensive to the sense of sight.
         (d)   The appearance of the building exterior will tend to minimize or
prevent discordant and unsightly surroundings in the immediate neighborhood.

permitted use.
      (2)   Exemption. Inventory being stored, maintained, or sold as part of a
business which has been granted a special use under §
154.352(B), which is part of an open air business or inventory consists
entirely of personal vehicles as that term is defined herein and which personal
vehicles were manufactured within the previous five years, and are for sale or
rental.
      (3)   Definition.     For the purpose of this definition, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a

VARIANCES AND APPEALS
§ 154.450 INTENT; PURPOSE.
   (A)   Intent. The purpose of this subchapter is to provide guidelines and
standards to be followed by the Zoning Board of Appeals in considering requests
for variances and appeals, where the jurisdiction of the Board of Appeals has
been established by these regulations or by Public Act 207 of 1921, being
M.C.L.A. §§ 125.581 - 125.590, as amended.

Appeals by a person, or by any office, department, board, or bureau aggrieved
by a decision of the Planning Commission or any Administrative Official or body
charged with enforcement of these regulations.
      (2)   Variances. Where there are practical difficulties preventing a
property owner from conforming with the strict letter of this chapter, or where
strict enforcement of this chapter would create an unnecessary hardship, the
Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power to authorize variances from the
standards in this chapter, with such conditions and safeguards as it may
determine to be necessary so that the overall spirit and intent of this chapter
is observed, public safety secured, and substantial justice done.

§ 154.451 STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
   An appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the appealed action, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies
to the Zoning Board of Appeals, that by reason of the facts stated in the
appeal, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order granted by
the circuit court,
(Ord. 92-005, passed 2-17-92)
§ 154.452 APPLICATION AND PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Application to the Zoning Board of Appeals. Variances and appeals for

Commission, the application data requirements for site plan review, as set
forth in §
154.402, shall be followed.
   (C)   Review by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator shall forward the application, along with
any supporting materials and plans, to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator or the Zoning Board of Appeals shall fix a
reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal or variance request, give due
notice to the parties to whom real property within 300 feet of the premises in
question is assessed, and to occupants of one or two-family dwellings within
300 feet, and decide the appeal or variance within a reasonable time. At the
hearing, a party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
   (D)   Decision by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
      (1)   The concurring vote of a majority of the members of the Board shall
be necessary to reverse an order, requirement, decision, or determination of
the administrative official or body, or to decide in favor of the applicant any
matter upon which they are required to pass under, or to affect any variation
in an ordinance adopted pursuant to Public Act 207 of 1921, being M.C.L.A. §§
125.581 - 125.590, as amended.
      (2)   The Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify
the order, requirement, decision, or determination, in accordance with the
guidelines set forth herein. To that end, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
have all the powers of the officer or body from whom the appeal was taken, and
may issue or direct the issuance of a permit. With an affirmative decision, the
Board may impose conditions pursuant to Section 4c(2)(a) of Public act 207 of
1921, being M.C.L.A. §§ 125.581 - 125.590, as amended. The decision of the
Zoning Board of Appeals shall be final, but any person having an interest
affected by a decision of the Board may appeal to circuit court.
   (E)   Record of decision and order.
      (1)   The Zoning Beard of Appeals shall prepare and retain a record of

imposed by the Zoning Board of Appeals in acting on the appeal shall be entered
into the official record, after being signed by the secretary of the Board.
   (F)   Approval period. If construction has not commenced within 24 months
after the Zoning Board of Appeals grants a variance to permit the erection or
alteration of a building, then the variance becomes null and void. The period
of approval may be automatically extended by 12 months if the variance was
sought in conjunction with a site plan for which approval has been extended by
the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 92-005, passed 2-17-92) Penalty, see §
154.999
§ 154.453 STANDARDS.
   Variances and appeals shall be granted only in accordance with Public Act
207 of 1921, being M.C.L.A. §§ 125.581 - 125.590, as amended, and based on the
findings set forth in this subchapter. The extent to which the following
criteria apply to a specific case shall be determined by the Board.
   (A)   Criteria applicable to variances.  
      (1)   Practical difficulties. Compliance with the strict letter of the
restrictions governing area, setbacks, frontage, height, bulk, density, or
other dimensional provisions would create practical difficulties, unreasonably
prevent the use of the property for a permitted purpose, or render conformity
with such restrictions unnecessarily burdensome. The showing of mere
inconvenience is insufficient to justify a variance.
      (2)   Substantial justice. Granting of a requested variance or appeal
would do substantial justice to the applicant as well as to other property
owners in the district; or as an alternative, granting of lesser variance than

the property, nor shall it be construed as an addition to the uses permitted in
a district.
   (C)   Criteria applicable to appeals. The Board shall reverse an order of an
enforcement official only if it finds that the action or decision appealed:
      (1)   Was arbitrary or capricious;

regulations. If the request for a certificate of occupancy is denied, the
applicant shall be notified in writing of the denial and the reasons for
denial.

CONDITIONAL REZONING
§ 154.520 INTENT.
   It is recognized that there are certain instances where it would be in the
best interests of the city, as well as advantageous to property owners seeking
a change in zoning boundaries, if certain conditions could be proposed by
property owners as part of a request for a rezoning. It is the intent of this
subsection to provide a process consistent with the provisions of § 4g of the
City and Village Zoning Act (M.C.L.A. § 125.584g) by which an owner seeking a
rezoning may voluntarily propose conditions regarding the use and/or
development of land as part of the rezoning request.
(Ord. 06-001, passed 8-29-05)
§ 154.521 APPLICATION AND OFFER OF CONDITIONS.
   (A)   An owner of land may voluntarily offer in writing conditions relating
to the use and/or development of land for which a rezoning is requested. This
offer may be made either at the time the application for rezoning is filed or
may be made at a later time during the rezoning process.
   (B)   The required application and process for considering a rezoning
request with conditions shall be the same as that for considering rezoning
requests made without any offer of conditions, except as modified by the
requirements of this subchapter.
   (C)   The owner's offer of conditions may not purport to authorize uses or
developments not permitted in the requested new zoning district.
   (D)   The owner's offer of conditions shall bear a reasonable and rational
relationship to the property for which rezoning is requested.
   (E)   Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions that
would require a special land use permit under the terms of this subchapter may
only be commenced if all of the special land use requirements for the proposed
use or uses, as outlined in §§
154.415 through
154.417, are met.
   (F)   Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions that
would require a variance under the terms of this subchapter may only be
commenced if a variance for such use or development is obtained from the Zoning
Board of Appeals, prior to the proposed conditional zoning, in accordance with
the provisions of this subchapter.
   (G)   Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions that
would require site plan approval under the terms of this subchapter may only be
commenced if site plan approval for such use or development is ultimately
granted in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.
   (H)   The offer of conditions may be amended during the process of rezoning
consideration provided that any amended or additional conditions are entered
voluntarily by the owner. An owner may withdraw all or part of its offer of
conditions any time prior to final rezoning action of City Council provided
that, if such withdrawal occurs subsequent to the Planning Commission's public
hearing on the original rezoning request, then the rezoning application process
shall be terminated and the applicant shall re-file a new application.
(Ord. 06-001, passed 8-29-05)
§ 154.522 PLANNING COMMISSION REVIEW.
   The Planning Commission, after public hearing and consideration of the
factors for rezoning, may recommend approval, approval with recommended
changes, or denial of the rezoning; provided, however, that any recommended
changes to the offer of conditions are acceptable to and thereafter offered by
the owner.

§ 154.523 CITY COUNCIL REVIEW.
   After receipt of the Planning Commission's recommendation, the City Council
shall deliberate upon the requested rezoning and may approve or deny the
conditional rezoning request. Council's deliberations shall include, but not be
limited to, a consideration of the factors for rezoning. Should Council
consider amendments to the proposed conditional rezoning advisable and if such
contemplated amendments to the offer of conditions are acceptable to and
thereafter offered by the owner, then Council shall, in accordance with § 4 of
the City and Village Zoning Act (M.C.L.A. § 125.584), refer such amendments to
the Planning Commission for a report thereon within a time specified by Council
and proceed thereafter in accordance with said statute to deny or approve the
conditional rezoning with or without amendments.
(Ord. 06-001, passed 8-29-05)
§ 154.524 APPROVAL.

by attachment or otherwise as an inseparable part of the ordinance adopted by
Council to accomplish the requested rezoning.

or an affidavit or memorandum giving notice thereof may be recorded by the city
with the Register of Deeds of the county in which the land referenced in the
Statement of Conditions is located.

parties of the subject land, including all known potential buyers, preceded by

reflect the new zoning classification along with a designation that the land
was rezoned with a Statement of Conditions. The City Clerk shall maintain a
listing of all lands rezoned with a Statement of Conditions.

   (A)   Any person who establishes a development or commences a use upon land
that has been rezoned with conditions shall continuously operate and maintain
the development or use in compliance with all of the conditions set forth in

   Unless another time period is specified in the ordinance rezoning the
subject land, the approved development and/or use of the land pursuant to
building and other required permits must be commenced upon the land within 12
months after the rezoning took effect and thereafter proceed diligently to
completion. This time limitation may upon written request be extended by City
Council if: (1) it is demonstrated to Council's reasonable satisfaction that
there is a strong likelihood that the development and/or use will commence
within the period of extension and proceed diligently thereafter to completion;
and (2) Council finds that there has not been a change in circumstances that
would render the current zoning with Statement of Conditions incompatible with
other zones and uses in the surrounding area or otherwise inconsistent with
sound zoning policy.
(Ord 06-001, passed 8-29-05)
§ 154.527 REVERSION OF ZONING.
   If approved development and/or use of the rezoned land does not occur within

classification but with a different or no Statement of Conditions, whether as a
result of a reversion of zoning pursuant to §
154.527 or otherwise, the Statement of Conditions imposed under the former
zoning classification shall cease to be in effect. Upon the owner's written
request, the City Clerk shall record with the Register of Deeds of the county
in which the land is located a notice that the Statement of Conditions is no
longer in effect.

   Nothing in the Statement of Conditions nor in the provisions of this
subchapter shall be deemed to prohibit the city from rezoning all or any

classification. Any rezoning shall be conducted in compliance with this
subchapter and the City and Village Zoning Act (M.C.L.A. § 125.581).

SIGN REGULATIONS
§ 154.600 FINDINGS.
   The City Council finds that signs and other visual outdoor advertising are
necessary to the commerce, health, safety, and general welfare of the residents
of the city. Further, it finds that failure to regulate their size, location,
and construction may lead to poor identification of individual businesses,
deterioration of the business and residential areas of the city,
intensification of the conflicts between different types of land use, reduction
in the effectiveness of traffic-control devices, and safety hazards to
pedestrians and motorists.
(Ord. 10-013, passed 1-11-10)
§ 154.601 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to regulate signs and outdoor advertising
in a manner that will minimize their harmful effect while permitting latitude
for creative and effective advertising and identification. It is intended by
this subchapter to give recognition to the legitimate needs of
business,industry and other activities, through appropriate guidelines, in
attaining their identification and informational objectives. It is a basic
tenet of this subchapter that unrestricted signage does not benefit the
community, or individual businesses, or property owners. To achieve this
purpose, this subchapter has the following objectives:
   (A)   Regulate the construction, alteration, repair and maintenance of all
signs with respect to structural and fire safety, location, type of sign,
dimensions, height, and method of illumination;
   (B)   Seek removal of illegal signs, and encourage the replacement or
removal of nonconforming signs that are incompatible with the purpose of this
subchapter;
   (C)   Preserve the appearance of the city by preventing the placement of
oversized and non-accessory signs that are out of scale with surrounding
buildings and structures;
   (D)   Keep the number of signs and sign messages at a reasonable level
necessary to identify a business and its products; and
   (E)   Avoid visual clutter that confuses or misleads traffic, obstructs
vision and is potentially harmful to property values, business opportunities
and community appearance.
(Ord. 10-013, passed 1-11-10)

(PRD) that are intended to provide for passive and active recreational needs of
the residents and not designed for billboard signs that could create visual
clutter, compete for the visual attention of motorists, and increase hazards

   (D)   Alterations. Alterations to a nonconforming sign, including changes to
the sign frame, sign copy area, panels or structural elements shall be subject
to the following conditions:
      (1)   The sign shall be brought into compliance with the requirements for
all signs specified in §154.603 (General Standards);
      (2)   The sign shall be brought into compliance with all applicable sign
height and sign area standards for the type of sign, as specified in this
subchapter;
      (3)   Nonconformities caused by inadequate ground sign setback at a

§ 154.610 VARIANCES.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) shall have the authority to grant a
variance from the strict application of these regulations provided that such
relief may be granted without substantially impairing the intent of this
subchapter. Application and consideration of sign variances shall be in
accordance with the following procedures and standards.
   (A)   Application and review procedures. Any party who has been denied a
permit for a proposed sign may file an application for a variance to this
subchapter within 21 calendar days of the decision. Applications shall be
considered by the ZBA per the procedures in §154.450, Variances and Appeals.
   (B)   Variance standards for signs. The ZBA shall consider the following
standards while reviewing any application for an variance from provisions of
this subchapter.
      (1)   Obstructions. Construction of a conforming sign would obstruct the
vision of    motorists or otherwise endanger public health or safety.
      (2)   Visibility. A conforming sign would be blocked from the sight of
passing motorists due to existing buildings, trees, or other obstructions.
      (3)   Site features. Construction of a conforming sign would require
significant tree removal or extensive topographic changes.
      (4)   Scale. A sign that exceeds the allowable height or area standards
of this subchapter would be more appropriated in scale to the building or site
frontage.
      (5)   Aesthetics. The variance shall not adversely impact the character
or appearance of the building or parcel or the neighborhood.
      (6)   Minimal. The variance shall be the minimum necessary to allow
reasonable use, visibility or readability of the sign.
      (7)   Intent. The variance shall not significantly impair the intent and
purpose of this subchapter.
   (C)   Findings and conditions.  In a motion granting or denying a sign
variance, the ZBA shall state the specific grounds for the decision, which
shall be supported by specific findings of fact. The ZBA may attach conditions
to a sign variance approval in accordance with the intent and purpose of this
subchapter.
(Ord. 10-013, passed 1-11-10)
§ 154.611 SIGN REMOVAL BY CITY ACTION.
   (A)   Abandoned and illegal signs. The Building Inspector/Code Enforcement
Officer shall make a determination as to whether the sign is an abandoned and/
or illegal sign, as defined in this subchapter. Written notification of the
determination and any order for removal shall be provided to said owner,
operator or person having beneficial use of the property upon which the sign is
located. Abandoned and/or illegal signs shall be removed within 30 days of the
determination. When there is a question or dispute over the building officer/
code enforcement officer's determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
have the authority to hear such a challenge and, make such determinations and
to require the removal of abandoned and/or illegal signs in the city, subject
to the following procedure.
      (1)   Public hearing. Such action may be taken only after a public
hearing has been held in accordance with M.C.L. § 125.3103 of PA 110 of 2008,
as amended, at which time the owner, operator or person having beneficial use
of the property upon which the sign is located shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence as to whether the sign is abandoned and/or illegal, and
whether the sign should be removed.
      (2)   Removal. If the Zoning Board of Appeals orders the abandoned and/or
illegal signs to be removed, the signs shall be removed within 30 days of the
determination and order for removal by the Zoning Board of Appeals. All sign
copy and component parts shall be completely removed, and the area where the
sign was located shall be restored as nearly as possible to its original
condition. Failure to remove the sign shall constitute grounds for the city to
seek Circuit Court approval to remove the sign at the expense of the owner of
the property upon which the sign is located. The city may then place a lien on
the property, adding necessary removal expenses to the tax bill for the
property.
   (B)   Damaged signs. Signs determined to be in a damaged condition by the
Building Inspector shall be repaired, replaced or removed to the satisfaction
of the Building Inspector by the owner, operator or person having beneficial
use of the property upon which the sign is located. If the owner does not take
such action within ten days, such signs may be repaired or removed by the city
at the expense of the owner of the property upon which the sign is located. The
city may then place a lien on the property, adding necessary removal expenses
to the tax bill for the property.
   (C)   Nonconforming signs. The elimination of nonconforming signs in the
city is hereby declared to be for a public purpose and for a public use. The
City Council shall have the authority to institute and prosecute proceedings
for the condemnation of nonconforming signs determined to be in violation of
the requirements for such signs specified in §
154.609 (Nonconforming Signs), under the power of eminent domain and in
accordance with the General Law City Act, Public Act 3 of 1895, as amended. For
the purpose of removal, the City Council may, at its discretion, acquire and
remove nonconforming signs by purchase, condemnation or otherwise with the cost
paid from general funds.
   (D)   Temporary signs. Temporary signs erected or displayed within a street
right-of-way or corner clearance area, or without a valid permit, or after the
expiration of a permit, may be removed by the city without notice. Signs
removed shall be held by the city for a five day reclamation period, after
which the sign shall be deemed abandoned and shall be discarded.
   (E)   Unsafe signs. Signs determined to be unsafe by the Building Inspector
shall be immediately removed or repaired to the satisfaction of the Building
Inspector by the owner, operator or person having beneficial use of the
property upon which the sign is located. If the owner does not take such action
within 24 hours, such signs may be removed by the city, at the expense of the
owner of the property upon which the sign is located. The city may then place a
lien on the property, adding necessary removal expenses to the tax bill for the
property.

§ 155.01 PURPOSE.
   Purpose and intent. It is the intent of this subchapter is to help protect
the health, safety and welfare of the citizens to prevent blight, protect
property values and neighborhood integrity, to avoid the creation and
maintenance of nuisances and to ensure the safe and sanitary maintenance of
dwellings and commercial and industrial buildings. Due to economic conditions,
mortgage foreclosures, and bankruptcies, homes, buildings and properties have
become vacant and unsupervised. This has caused properties to become nuisances,
decrease private investment and to invite unwanted activity. Such unwanted
activities have included an increase in instances of unsecured or open doors
and windows, broken water pipes, flooded basements, theft of metals and other
materials, overgrowth of grass, weeds, shrubs, and bushes, illegal dumping,
vermin activity, foul odors, and façade decay at vacant properties. These
vacant properties have a negative impact on surrounding properties and causes
deterioration in neighborhoods and commercial areas. The city also needs to be
able to contact owners for utility shutoff, fire safety and police reasons.
(Ord. 19-005, passed 4-22-19)
§ 155.02 DEFINITIONS.
   The following terms shall apply to this chapter as written unless context
indicates or requires different meaning:
   EVIDENCE OF VACANCY. Any condition that on its own, or combined with other
conditions present, would lead a reasonable person to believe that the property
is vacant. Such conditions may include, but shall not be limited to, overgrown
and/or dead vegetation; unshoveled snow from sidewalks; accumulation of
newspapers, circulars, flyers and/or mail; past due utility notices and/or
disconnected utilities; accumulation of trash, junk and/or debris; boarded-up
windows; abandoned vehicles, auto parts or materials; the absence of window
coverings such as curtains, blinds and/or shutters; the absence of furnishings
and/or personal items consistent with habitation or occupancy; statements by
neighbors, passersby, delivery agents or utility agents, including city
employees, that the property is vacant.
   OWNER. The person or legal entity who has legal title and/or the right to
possess, use, transfer or convey property, i.e., the owner or successor to
title by foreclosure, sheriff's sale or by court order.
   VACANT PROPERTY. A lot, property, building, or structure that is not legally
or currently occupied. Vacant property does not mean property that is
temporarily unoccupied while the residents are away on vacation, tending to
personal matters or business, or property that is not intended by the owner to
be left vacant.
(Ord. 19-005, passed 4-22-19)
§ 155.03 SCOPE.
   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all existing vacant land and
structures including, but not limited to, residential, commercial and

rules and regulations.
(Ord. 19-005, passed 4-22-19)

offset the cost of processing the form, conducting the safety and maintenance
inspections and maintaining the records.
   (B)   Payment of fee. The fee established in division (A) above shall be
submitted with the registry information outlined in §
155.05. In addition, in the case where the owner has failed to register, the
