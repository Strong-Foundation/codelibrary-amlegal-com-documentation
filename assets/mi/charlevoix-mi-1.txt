reduce by ordinance one or more appropriations.
   c.   At any time during the fiscal year, the City Manager may transfer part
or all of any unencumbered appropriation balance among programs within a

appropriations balance from one department, office or agency to another.

balance in the appropriation, or without insuring that sufficient funds are or
will be available to cover the claim or meet the obligation when it becomes due
and payable. However, except where prohibited by law, nothing in this Charter
shall be construed to prevent the making or authorizing of payments or the
making of contracts for capital improvements to be financed wholly or partly by
the issuance of bonds, or to prevent the making of any contract or lease
providing for payments beyond the end of the fiscal year. Any such action must
be approved by ordinance.

addition, such resolution shall include a requirement that in all cases of

prior, superior and paramount, upon all personal property of the persons

claims, encumbrances and liens upon the property, whether created by a security
agreement, levy, judgment, or otherwise, and whether arising before or after

City taxes on September 1st and an additional charge of one (1) percent shall
be added to all delinquent unpaid taxes on the first day of each month
thereafter until the taxes are paid. This added penalty shall belong to the
City and shall constitute a charge and shall be a lien against the property to
which the taxes themselves apply, collectible in the same manner as the taxes
to which they are added. If September 1st falls on a Sunday or legal holiday,
taxes shall be collected without penalty on the next business day.
Section 8.19 TAXES - PAYMENT OF

will be charged upon all taxes remaining unpaid after September 1st. As soon as
practical after completion of the tax roll, and in no event later than July
1st, the City Treasurer shall forward a statement of the taxes due, by first
class mail addressed to the owners of the property upon which taxes are
assessed, as indicated by the tax roll. Failure on the part of the City
Treasurer to mail this statement shall not invalidate the taxes on this roll or
relieve the property assessed from the penalties provided by this Article or by
the general tax laws of the State.
Section 8.20 TAX ROLL - RETURN TO COUNTY TREASURER

the date when the roll was received by the City Treasurer shall be returned to
the County Treasurer in the same manner and with like effect as returns by
township treasurers of township, school and county taxes. These returns shall
be made upon a delinquent tax roll to be prepared by the City Treasurer and
shall include all the additional charges and fees hereinbefore provided. These
charges and fees shall, in these returns, be added to the amount assessed on
the tax roll against each description. The taxes so returned shall be collected
in the same manner as other taxes returned to the County Treasurer, and shall
remain a lien upon the assessed lands until paid.
Section 8.21 PROTECTION OF TAX LIEN
   The City shall have the power to purchase any property within the City at
any tax or other public sale, or to purchase the property directly from the
State or the fee owner, when such purchase is necessary to protect the lien of
the City for taxes or special assessments. The City may hold, lease or sell
this property. Any such procedure exercise by the City in the protection of its
lien shall be deemed to be for the public purpose.
Section 8.22 TAX COLLECTION - COUNTY, SCHOOL AND STATE
   For the purpose of assessing and collecting taxes in the City for State,
County and School purposes, the City shall be considered the same as a township
and shall collect and account for these taxes, penalties and interest in the
same manner provided by the general tax laws of the State.

shall be based upon or be in proportion to the benefits derived or to be
derived. Such resolution shall state the estimated cost of the improvement,

any, shall be a general obligation of the City, the number of installments in
which the assessments may be paid, the interest rate on any unpaid assessment
if any, the date on which any such interest shall commence, and shall designate
the districts or land and property on which special assessments shall be
levied.

whom assessed until paid. This lien shall be of the same character and effect
as the lien created by this Charter for City taxes. The assessment shall be
levied upon the respective lots and premises to which they are specially
assessed, and against the persons chargeable therewith, as a tax in the next
City tax roll in a column for special assessments. The amount so levied shall
be enforced and collected in the same manner as other taxes and when collected
shall be paid into the City treasury.
Section 9.6 CHANGES - ADDITIONS
   In any case where the provisions of this Charter, either expressed or
incorporated herein, may prove to be insufficient to carry into full effect the
making of any special assessment, the Council shall provide by general

by special assessment.

municipal civil infraction violations for which a fine has been scheduled
pursuant to division (B)(10) below and for which a municipal civil infraction

determine, the truth or falsity of any fact or matter relating to an alleged
violation. In addition, no person shall be required to dispose of a municipal
civil infraction violation at the Bureau and may have the violation processed

paid. If an authorized city official issues and serves a municipal civil
infraction violation notice, and if an admission of responsibility is not made
and a civil fine and costs, if any prescribed by the schedule of fines for the

official may file a municipal civil infraction citation with the District
Court. The contents of the municipal civil infraction citation shall comply

         (c)   In addition to the civil fines assessed pursuant to division (B)
(11)(b) above, the District Court Judge, or magistrate (if expressly authorized
to do so by the Chief Judge of the 90th District Court) may issue and enforce
any order necessary to enforce the ordinance under which the municipal civil
infraction was charged.
         (d)   If a person who has pled responsible or has been found
responsible for a municipal civil infraction does not comply with any court
order enforcing the ordinance under which the municipal civil infraction arose,
then the city may take such other action authorized by law, including, but not
limited to, seeking an order to show cause why the person should not be held in
contempt of court for failure to comply with the court’s original enforcement
order.
(Prior Code, § 12.11)
      (12)   Lien on property.
         (a)   If a defendant does not pay the civil fine or costs as required
by the District Court Judge or magistrate within 30 days after the date on
which payment is due in a municipal civil infraction action brought for a
violation involving the use or occupancy of land or a building or other
structure, the city may obtain a lien against the land, building or structure
involved in the violation by recording a copy of the court order requiring
payment of the fine and costs with the Register of Deeds for the county in
which the land, building or structure is located. The court order shall not be
recorded unless a legal description of the property is incorporated in or
attached to the court order. The lien is effective immediately upon recording
of the court order with the Register of Deeds.
         (b)   The court order recorded with the Register of Deeds shall
constitute notice of pendency of the lien. In addition, a written notice of the
lien shall be sent by the city by first class mail to the owner of record of
the land, building or structure at the owner’s last known address.
         (c)   The lien created by this section may be enforced and discharged
by the city in the manner prescribed by the General Property Act, Public Act
206 of 1893, being M.C.L.A. §§ 211.1 to 211.157, or by an duly passed by the
city. However, the property is not subject to sale under § 60 of Public Act 206
of 1893, being M.C.L.A. § 211.60, for non-payment of a civil fine or costs
unless the property is also subject to sale under that section for delinquent
property taxes.
         (d)   A lien created under this section has priority over any other
lien unless one or more of the following apply:
            1.   The other lien is a lien for taxes or special assessments;
            2.   The other lien is created before the effective date of the
amendatory act that added this section;
            3.   Federal law provides that the other lien has priority; and
            4.   The other lien was recorded before the lien under this section
is recorded.
         (e)   The city may institute an action in a court of competent
jurisdiction for the collection of the fines and costs imposed by a court order
for a municipal civil infraction. However, an attempt by the city to collect
the fines or costs by any process does not invalidate or waive the lien upon
the land, building or structure.
         (f)   A lien provided for by this division (B) shall not continue for
a period of longer than five years after a copy of the court order imposing a
fine or costs is recorded, unless within that time an action to enforce the
lien is commenced.

information it may require relative to such improvement.
(Prior Code, § 1.604)

obligation of the city; the number of installments in which the assessment
should be spread; and the lands which should be included in the special
assessment district.
(Prior Code, § 1.606)
§ 33.06 DETERMINATION ON PROJECT; NOTICE.
   After the City Manager has presented the report required in §
33.02 of this chapter for making any local public improvement as requested in

publication in a newspaper published or circulated within the city and by first
class mail addressed to each person having an interest in property to be
assessed as shown by the last general tax assessment roll of the city, said
publication and mailing to be made at least 14 full days prior to the date of
said hearing. The hearing required by this section may be held at any regular,
adjourned or special meeting of the Council.
(Prior Code, § 1.607)
§ 33.07 HEARING ON NECESSITY.
   At the public hearing on the proposed improvement, all persons interested
shall be given an opportunity to be heard, after which the Council may modify
the scope of the local public improvement in such a manner as it shall deem to
be in the best interest of the city as a whole; provided that, if the amount of
work is increased or additions are made to the district, then another hearing
shall be held, pursuant to notice prescribed in §
33.03 of this chapter. If the determination of the Council shall be to proceed
with the improvement, a resolution shall be passed approving the preliminary
plans, assessment district and estimates of cost, directing the Engineer to
prepare construction plans and specifications, and directing the Assessor to
prepare a special assessment roll in accordance with the Council’s
determination and report the same to the Council for confirmation. The Council
shall approve construction plans and specifications prior to the meeting to
review the special assessment roll.
(Prior Code, § 1.608)
§ 33.08 DEVIATION FROM PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   No deviation from construction plans and specifications, as approved by the

the original plans on file in his or her office.
(Prior Code, § 1.609)
§ 33.09 LIMITATIONS ON PRELIMINARY EXPENSES.
   The Council shall specify the provisions and procedures for financing a
local public improvement. No contract or expenditure, except for the cost of

be made for the improvement until special assessments to defray the costs of
the same shall have been levied.
(Prior Code, § 1.610)
§ 33.10 ASSESSMENT ROLL; FILING; REVIEW AND OBJECTIONS; CHANGES; PAYMENTS.
   (A)   The Assessor shall make a special assessment roll of all lots and
parcels of land within the designated district benefitted by the proposed local
public improvement and assess to each lot or parcel of land the amount
benefitted thereby. The amount spread in each case shall be based upon the
estimate of the City Manager as approved by the Council.
(Prior Code, § 1.611)
   (B)   When the Assessor shall have completed such assessment roll, he or she
shall file the same with the Clerk for presentation to the Council for review,
confirmation and certification by it.
(Prior Code, § 1.612)
   (C)   Upon receipt of such special assessment roll, the Council, by
resolution: shall accept such assessment roll and order it to be filed in the
office of the Clerk for public examination; shall fix the time and place the
Council will meet to review such special assessment roll; and direct the Clerk
to give notice of a public hearing for the purpose of affording an opportunity
for interested persons to be heard. Such notice shall be given by one
publication in a newspaper published or circulated within the city and by first
class mail addressed to each person having an interest in property to be
assessed as shown by the last general tax assessment roll of the city, said
publication and mailing to be made at least 14 full days prior to the date of
said hearing. The hearing required by this section may be held at any regular,
adjourned or special meeting of the Council. At this meeting, all interested
persons or parties shall present in writing their objections, if any, to the
assessments against them. The Assessor shall be present at every meeting of the
Council at which a special assessment is to be reviewed.
(Prior Code, § 1.613)
   (D)   The Council shall meet at the time and place designated for the review
of such special assessment roll and, at such meeting, or a proper adjournment
thereof, shall consider all objections thereto submitted in writing. The
Council may correct said roll as to any special assessment or description of
any lot or parcel of land or other errors appearing therein; or it may, by
resolution, annul such assessment roll and direct that new proceedings be
instituted. The same proceedings shall be followed in making a new roll as in
the making of the original roll. If, after hearing all objections and making a
record of such changes as the Council deems justified, the Council determines
that it is satisfied with said special assessment roll, and that assessments
are in proportion reciting such determinations, confirming such roll, placing
it on file in the office of the Clerk, and directing the Clerk to attach his or
her warrant to a certified copy thereof within ten days, therein commanding the
Treasurer to levy the various sums and amounts appearing on a special
assessment roll for the full amounts or in annual installments as directed by
the Council. Such roll shall have the date of confirmation endorsed thereon and
shall from that date be final and conclusive for the purpose of the local
public improvement to which it applies, subject only to adjustment to conform
to the actual cost of the improvement, as provided in division (F) below.
(Prior Code, § 1.614)
   (E)   All special assessments, except such installments thereof as the
Council shall make payable, at a future time as provided in this chapter, shall
be due and payable upon confirmation of the special assessment roll.
(Prior Code, § 1.615)
   (F)   (1)   The Council may provide for the payment of special assessments
in annual installments. Such annual installments shall not exceed 20 in number,
the first installment being due upon confirmation of the roll. On all special
assessments confirmed between July 1 and December 31 of any year, the second
installment shall be due on the following July 1 and the remaining installments
shall be due on July 1 of each succeeding year. On all special assessments
confirmed between January 1 and June 30 of any year, the second installment
shall be due July 1 of the following year and the remaining installments shall
be due July 1 of each succeeding year. Interest shall be charged on all
deferred installments at a rate not in excess of that authorized by law,
commencing on confirmation and payable on the due date of each installment; the
full amount of all or any deferred installments, with interest accrued thereon
to the date of payment, may be paid in advance of the due dates thereof. If
special assessment bonds are sold, M.C.L.A. § 141.153 shall apply. Each owner
shall have 60 days from the date of confirmation to pay the full amount of said
assessment, or the full amount of any installments thereof, without interest or
penalty. Following said 60-day period, the assessment or first installment
thereof shall, if unpaid, be considered as delinquent, and the same penalties
shall be collected on such unpaid assessments, or unpaid first installments
thereof, as are provided in the City Charter to be collected on delinquent
general city taxes. Deferred installments shall be collected without penalty
until 60 days after the due date thereof, after which time such installments
shall be considered as delinquent and such penalties on said installments shall
be collected as are provided in the City Charter to be collected on delinquent
general city taxes.
      (2)   After the Council has confirmed the roll, the City Treasurer shall
notify by mail each property owner on said roll that said roll has been filed,
stating the amount assessed and the terms of payment. Failure on the part of
the City Treasurer to give said notice or of such owner to receive said notice,
shall not invalidate any special assessment roll of the city or any assessment
thereon nor excuse the payment of interest or penalties.
(Prior Code, § 1.616)
§ 33.11 LIEN; CREATION.
   Special assessments and all interest, penalties and charges thereon, from
the date of confirmation of the roll shall be and remain a lien upon the
property assessed of the same character and effect as the lien created by
general law for county and school taxes, and by the City Charter for city
taxes, until paid, and the lands upon which the same are a lien shall be
subject to sale therefor the same as are lands upon which delinquent city taxes
constitute a lien. If special assessments or installments thereof remain
delinquent as of February 28, they shall be returned delinquent, with interest,
penalties and charges added, to the County Treasurer for collection in the same
manner as are city, county and school taxes.
(Prior Code, § 1.617)
§ 33.12 ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS; REFUNDS.
   The City Manager shall, after the completion of each local public
improvement, compile the actual cost thereof and certify the same to the
Council. When any special assessment roll shall prove insufficient to meet the
cost of the improvement for which it was made, the Council may make an
additional pro rata assessment; provided, however, that, no such additional pro
rata assessment shall exceed 15% of the original assessment. If the amount of
the special assessment roll for any local public improvement as confirmed by
the Council proves larger than the actual cost thereof as compiled by the City
Manager and certified to the Council, the Council shall make a refund thereof
in accordance with §
9.4 of the City Charter, said refund to be made to the owner of the property as
shown by the current tax rolls of the city on the date that the Council orders
the refund.
(Prior Code, § 1.618)
§ 33.13 ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES.
   In any case where the provisions of this chapter may prove to be
insufficient to carry out fully the making of any special assessment, the
Council shall provide, by ordinance, any additional steps or procedures
required.
(Prior Code, § 1.619)
§ 33.14 SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ACCOUNTS.
   Moneys raised by special assessment to pay the cost of any local public
improvement shall be held in a special fund to pay such cost or to repay any
money borrowed therefor. Each special assessment account must be used only for
the improvement project for which the assessment was levied, except as
otherwise provided in this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 1.620)
§ 33.15 CONTESTED ASSESSMENTS.
   No suit or action of any kind shall be instituted or maintained for the
purpose of contesting or enjoining collection of any special assessment unless
within 30 days after confirmation of the special assessment roll written notice
is given to the Council of intention to file such suit or action, stating
grounds on which it is claimed such assessment is illegal, and unless such suit
or action shall be commenced within 60 days of confirmation of the roll.
(Prior Code, § 1.621)
§ 33.16 REASSESSMENT FOR BENEFITS.
   (A)   (1)   Whenever the Council shall deem any special assessment invalid
or defective for any reason whatever, in whole or in part, the Council shall
have power to cause a new assessment to be made for the same purpose for which
the former assessment was made, whether the improvement or any part thereof has
been completed and whether any part of the assessment has been collected or
not.
      (2)   All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof
shall be made in the manner as provided for the original assessment.
   (B)   If any portion of the original assessment shall have been collected
and not refunded, it shall be applied upon the reassessment and the
reassessment shall to that extent be deemed satisfied. If more than the amount
reassessed shall have been collected, the balance shall be refunded to the
person making such payment.
(Prior Code, § 1.622)
§ 33.17 COMBINATION OF PROJECTS.
   The Council may combine several districts into one project for the purpose
of effecting a saving in the costs; provided, however, that, for each district
there shall be established separate funds and accounts to cover the cost of the
same.
(Prior Code, § 1.623)
§ 33.18 SINGLE LOT ASSESSMENTS.
   When any expense shall have been incurred by the city upon or in respect to
any single premises, which expense is chargeable against said premises and the
owner thereof under the provisions of this code of ordinances and §
9.2 of the City Charter and is not of that class required to be pro-rated among
the several lots and parcels of land in a special assessment district, an
account of the labor, material and services for which such expense was incurred
with a description of the premises upon or in respect to which the expense was
incurred, and the name of the owner, if known, shall be reported to the
Treasurer, who shall immediately charge and bill the owner, if known. The
Treasurer at the end of the quarter shall report to the City Council all sums
so owing to the city and which have not been paid within 30 days after the
mailing of the bill therefor. The Council may, at such time as it may deem
advisable direct the Assessor to prepare a special assessment roll covering all
such charges reported to it together with a penalty of 10%. As an alternative,
the Council may allow property owners to pay a single lot assessment on an
installment basis as described in §
33.10 of this chapter; provided, the terms and interest rate of the installment
program are specified in the resolution directing the Assessor to prepare the
special assessment roll. The special assessment roll shall be filed with the
Clerk who shall advise the Council of the filing of the same and the Council
shall thereupon set a date for the hearing of objections to such assessment
roll.

§ 50.09 INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS.
   (A)   (1)   If connection fees to a commercial or industrial facility exceed
$25,000 and if, in the determination of the City Council, the construction or
expansion of the facility will create jobs and provide significant economic
benefit to the city, then the Council may permit, by resolution, the
installment payment of connection fees as follows: one-third shall be paid upon
execution of the written agreement which is required by this subchapter and the
balance shall be paid periodically as determined by the Council as long as all
connection fees, plus interest, are fully paid on or before two years from the
date of water and/or sewer connection. If connection fees to a community
recreational facility exceed $25,000, then the Council may permit, by
resolution, the installment payment of connection fees as follows: one-fifth
shall be paid upon execution of the written agreement which is required by this
subchapter and the balance shall be paid periodically as determined by the
Council as long as all connection fees, plus interest are fully paid on or
before four years from the date of the water and/or sewer connection. The
resolution regarding either facility shall describe the conditions under which
the Council is willing to accept installment payments and shall include, but is
not limited to, the number of installments, the due date of each installment,
the interest rate to be charged and the amount of each installment payment. The
interest rate shall be the bank prime loan rate which is applicable to the week
in which the resolution authorizing installment payments has been adopted, as
published in the Federal Reserve Statistical Release for Selected Interest
Rates. A written agreement regarding either facility shall be executed between
the city and the owner of the land to which the water and/or sewer service will
be connected which contains the terms of the resolution and which grants to the
city the right to accelerate unpaid connection fees. For a commercial or
industrial facility, the agreement shall also include a provision which grants
to the city a lien on the benefitted real property for the unpaid connection
fees and which also grants to the city the power of sale to foreclose on the
lien by advertisement. In addition, the agreement regarding either facility
shall provide that the rights granted to the city in the written agreement may
be exercised if there is a default in the terms of the agreement by the owner
or assignee of the owner. The agreement shall be in a form approved by the City
Attorney. The city shall adopt, by resolution, criteria similar to those
criteria used in the city’s industrial tax abatement policy which will be used
to determine when a commercial or industrial facility construction or expansion
will create jobs and provide significant economic benefit to the city.
      (2)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
         COMMUNITY RECREATION FACILITY. A swimming pool, ice rink, gymnasium or
similar facility, as determined by the City Council, which is open to the
residents of the city at the lowest user fees, if any, even if the facility is
located outside of the city and which is owned by a municipal corporation or a
non-profit corporation.
         CONNECTION FEES. Tap-in fees, privilege fees or any other fee or
charge which arises by virtue of the mere connection to city water and/or sewer
services.
   (B)   A septage pretreatment facility may only connect to the city’s sewer
system pursuant to a written agreement between the city and the owner of the
proposed septage pretreatment facility. This contract must be approved by the
City Council. The contract shall specify the amount of connection fees, the
terms of payment of those connection fees, the applicable sewer rate, the
conditions under which the connection fees or sewer rate may change and the
method of payment of the connection fees. The amount of connection fees and the
method of payment of those connection fees may vary from provisions that would
apply to a sewer user that is not a septage pretreatment facility. The contract
shall include such other provisions as shall be acceptable to the owner of the
septage pretreatment facility and the City Council. The agreement shall be in a
form approved by the City Attorney. The city shall be under no obligation to
permit a septage pretreatment facility to connect to the city’s sewer system
and any such decision is subject to the sole discretion of the City Council to
determine whether any proposal is in the best interests of the city. The term
SEPTAGE PRETREATMENT FACILITY shall mean a facility that receives and treats
non-domestic wastewater that originates from residential type septic systems
including single-family homes, condominiums, apartments and commercial users
such as hotels, motels, offices, restaurants, schools, retail structures and
the like with the exception of restaurant grease interceptors and industrial
process wastewater. Pretreated septage shall comply with the characteristics of
common domestic sewage, as defined in
Chapter 53 of this code of ordinances. The treatment process shall be approved
and licensed by the state and operated pursuant to the contract with the city

Ord. 707, passed 11-7-2005)
§ 50.10 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Installment payments; acceleration. If installment payments have been
authorized pursuant to §
50.09 of this chapter and a default in the installment payment agreement
occurs, then the city, in its discretion, may elect to accelerate the unpaid
connection fees. Notice of the acceleration shall be sent by first-class mail
to the address shown on city tax rolls.
   (B)   Installment payments; foreclosure by advertisement. If the city elects
to foreclose on a lien for which installment payments have been accelerated,
then the procedure for foreclosure by advertisement as described in M.C.L.A. §§
600.3201 through 600.3280, as currently amended or later amended, shall be
used, except as follows.
      (1)   Any reference to a “sheriff” shall mean the City’s Police Chief or
the designee of the Police Chief.
      (2)   Any reference to a “mortgage” shall mean the lien described in this

may be sold as one parcel.
      (4)   If the city elects to commence foreclosure, then the sum of $700

interest. This amount shall be deemed to reimburse the city for staff time,
attorney fees and other expenses not otherwise reimbursed to the city under the
foreclosure by advertisement statute.
   (C)   Liens not involving installment payments. The city may enforce liens
which do not involve installment payments by using the general laws of the
state which provide for the enforcement of tax liens.
   (D)   Alternate remedy. As an alternative to the procedures provided in
divisions (B) or (C) above, the city may elect to treat the lien as a debt and
may commence legal action against the proper parties to collect such debt.
(Prior Code, § 2.143) (Ord. 621, passed 3-20-1995)
§ 50.11 IMPROVEMENT PAYMENTS.
   Often, industrial or commercial property owners considering new construction
or significant expansion request that significant improvements or extensions be
made to public services or utilities provided by the city such as water, sewer
or electric services as well as public roads. As an incentive for the city to
undertake such improvements and to complete them promptly, an industrial or
commercial property owner typically offers and then agrees to pay for all or
part of the cost of the improvements. The city may execute a contract with the
industrial or commercial property owner regarding the improvements to be made,
the amount which will be paid by the industrial or commercial property owner
toward the cost of the improvement and when such payment is due. The contract
shall require complete payment of the cost of the improvement at least prior to
the commencement of water and/or sewer service to the property.
(Prior Code, § 2.144) (Ord. 621, passed 3-20-1995)
UTILITY EXTENSIONS
§ 50.25 PROCEDURE ESTABLISHED.
   The procedures established in this subchapter shall apply in charging and
allocating the pro-rata share to benefitted property owners of all cost and
expense for extending any and all utility services into any area where said
city-owned and operated utilities are not present.
(Prior Code, § 2.161)
§ 50.26 SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
   In certain instances, the city, by majority vote of its City Council, may
elect to extend utility services at initial city expense. The charge to be
assessed each property owner benefitted and served shall be calculated on the
basis of the actual cost per effective front foot, which shall be determined by
dividing total project cost by effective front footage. Effective front footage
is defined as being determined by modifying actual front footage by a depth
factor as set forth in the state’s Tax Commission Assessing Manual, Depth
Factor Schedule, such manual incorporated in and made part of this subchapter.
The charge to each benefitted property owner shall be assessed at the time of
project completion and shall be paid no later than the time actual service
connections are made to the particular parcel or parcels of land served, which
said charge shall bear interest at the rate of 6% per annum, compounded
annually, accruing from the date of project completion to date of payment.
(Prior Code, § 2.162)
§ 50.27 PRIVATE FINANCING.
   In certain other instances, the city, by majority vote of the City Council,
may consent to a third party extending the utility services; provided, all
applicable local and state laws and regulations are complied with, at the third
party’s initial expense. Other benefitted property owners may, at any time,
elect to make service connections to the extended utility service; provided,
however, that, before such connection is made, the property owner (or owners)
pays to the city, in full, the amount of the assessed charge as to the
particular parcel or parcels of land benefitted, the amount of which the
assessed charge is calculated on the basis of the formula set forth in §
50.26 of this chapter; except that, there shall be no interest charge as set
forth in §
50.26 of this chapter. All moneys received by the city from benefitted property
owners as a condition of their making service connections to the utility
services shall be paid over to the third party or parties, his or their heirs
and assigns, who initially bore the cost and expense of the project, by way of
reimbursement.
(Prior Code, § 2.163) (Ord. 513, passed 4-17-1989)

plats of real property within the city, the plat proprietor shall provide at
said proprietor’s sole expense, within the physical area included in the
boundaries of said plat, water lines, sewer lines, underground electrical
transmission lines, storm water drainage or dispersion or seepage systems,
together with all accessory equipment thereto not charged to or paid for by the
individual platted lot property owner, and shall pay for the cost of all street
construction and improvement, all in accordance with state and city
specifications, with such city specifications to be determined and approved by
the Council of the city by submission by the plat proprietor of a development

§ 51.02 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   Part 115 of Public Act 451 of 1994, being M.C.L.A. §§ 324.11501 et
seq., provides that a municipality shall assure that all solid waste is removed
from sites of generation frequently enough to protect the public health and
delivered to solid waste disposal areas authorized to operate pursuant to such
act. The City Council has determined that the collection of solid waste from
certain residential properties would most appropriately be undertaken at this
time by the city, acting by and through contract with the private sector.
Because solid waste collection directly affects the public health, safety and
general welfare and due to the fact that multiple waste haulers result in
excessive wear and tear on city roads, the city shall contract with a single
waste hauler in order to facilitate city governance and control of the solid
waste program for certain residential properties. In addition, the City Council
has determined that it would be in the public interest if the private waste
hauler were selected on a bid basis, requiring demonstration of the waste
hauler’s capability and strength to provide a high level of service to sites of
generation within the city and to promote and protect the public health, safety
and welfare.
   (B)   The City Council has further determined that its solid waste program
should include recycling, consistent with the county solid waste plan.
   (C)   For purposes of establishing and carrying out a program of solid waste
collection, recycling and disposal, the City Council has adopted this chapter
to provide standards and specifications for services to be provided, provide
for administration of the program and operational specifications and provide
penalties for failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter.

      (1)   A woman's breastfeeding of a baby whether or not the nipple or
areola is exposed during or incidental to the feeding;
      (2)   Material as defined in § 2 of Public Act 343 of 1984, being
M.C.L.A. § 752.362; or

§ 113.02 LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (A)   The City Council acknowledges the difference which the law recognizes
between applications for new licenses and the transfer, renewal or revocation
of existing licenses. This chapter is designed to provide a framework in which
the City Council can decide whether to approve or deny an application for a new
license or an application to transfer an existing license. This framework, when
followed, will show a reviewing court that the City Council's discretion was
not exercised arbitrarily or capriciously. The City Council recognizes that the
issuance or denial of a license can be controversial and that litigation over
the City Council's decision can easily result.
   (B)   The regulation of licenses and their impact on the land use goals of
the city are legislative decisions. The voters and legislative process are the
methods which should be used to alter legislative decisions as long as the
legislative decisions are not made in an arbitrary and capricious manner. It is
hoped that a reviewing court will respect the function of the City Council as
well as the electoral process in evaluating the actions of the City Council.
   (C)   Sections of this chapter dealing with public nudity are intended to
address the city's recognition that public nudity in areas in which alcohol is
being consumed can create significant negative secondary effects. Such sections
are intended to regulate and minimize those negative secondary effects and to
effectuate the city's definition of public nudity, and are not intended to
specifically regulate or inhibit any activity protected by the First Amendment.
   (D)   The city acknowledges that existing licensees have property rights in
those licenses. Thus, for the transfer of existing licenses the city has
adopted with modification certain requirements recommended by the Michigan
Townships Association. For the renewal or revocation of existing licenses, the
city has adopted a system in this chapter to meet procedural due process
requirements.

whichever last occurs. Any delay in the completion of such remodeling or
construction may subject the license to revocation.
   (E)   Reservation of authority. No applicant for a license has the right to
the issuance of such a license to him, her or it, and the City Council reserves
the right to exercise reasonable discretion to determine who, if anyone, shall
be entitled to the issuance of such license. If an application is incomplete,
the license may be denied without a consideration of the merits of the
application.

§ 114.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The City Council finds the rental of dwelling units in the City of
Charlevoix provides value to our local economy but also brings with it negative
externalities affecting the year-round quality of neighborhoods, housing
supply, and health and safety. The City Council has enacted this regulatory
ordinance to strike a regulatory balance between the interests of community
residents, business owners, visitors, and property owners.
   (B)   The community has different expectations for noise, occupant loads,
and transient activity in its residential neighborhoods than it does in
commercial, and even mixed-used zones where hotels are currently permitted. The
renting of a home on a short-term basis is substantially more like a business
than traditional residential use.

any trees, shall be levied against the owner of the pipe or main causing the
damage.

in accordance with approved practices and under the general direction of the
Department. Said permit, as provided for in this section, shall require
reasonable prior notice to the city before any work is commenced thereunder;
provided, however, that, in the event of an emergency requiring immediate
maintenance work on the overhead lines of said public utilities, prior notice
of commencing work under said permit shall not be required. The word EMERGENCY,
as used in this section, shall be defined to mean the occurrence or happening
of an event which could not be foreseen by the exercise of reasonable care and

(Prior Code, § 5.1) (Ord. 791, passed 3-19-2018)
§ 153.002 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as “The Zoning Ordinance” and may be cited as

§ 153.004 SCOPE.
   This chapter does not repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair or
interfere with existing provisions of other laws or ordinances, except those
specifically repealed by this chapter, or of any private restrictions placed
upon property by covenant, deed or other private agreement. Where this chapter
imposes greater restrictions than are imposed or required by existing laws or
ordinances, or by rules, regulations or permits, or by private restrictions,
the provisions of this chapter shall control.
(Prior Code, § 5.4)
§ 153.005 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Construction of language. The following rules of construction apply to
this chapter.
      (1)   The particular shall control the general and the use of a general
term shall not be taken to have the same meaning as another specific term. For
example, a “dry cleaning retail establishment” shall not be interpreted to be
the same as a “retail business supplying commodities on the premises” if each
term is listed as a separate and distinct use.
      (2)   In case of any difference of meaning or implication between the
text of this chapter and any caption or illustration, the text shall control.
      (3)   A building or structure includes any and all of its parts.
      (4)   The phrase “used for” includes, but is not limited to, “arranged
for”, “designed for”, “intended for”, “maintained for” and “occupied for”.
      (5)   The word “shall” is always mandatory and not discretionary. The
word “may” is permissive.
      (6)   The word “person” includes any individual, corporation,
partnership, incorporated association, limited liability company or any other
similar entity.
      (7)   Unless the context clearly indicates the contrary, where a
regulation involves two or more items, conditions, provisions or events
connected by the conjunctions “and”, “or” or “either...or”, the conjunction
shall be interpreted as follows:
         (a)   “And” indicates that all of the connected items, conditions,
provisions or events apply.
         (b)   “Or” indicates that the connected items, conditions, provisions
or events may apply singly or in any combination.
         (c)   “Either...or” indicates that the connected items, conditions,
provisions or events may apply singly, but not in combination.
      (8)   Terms not defined in this chapter shall have the meaning
customarily assigned to them.

and recommendation of the Planning Commission, the City Council shall consider
the proposed amendment.
         (a)   In the case of a rezoning request, the City Council shall
approve or deny the request, which may be based on the consideration of the
criteria for amendment of the Official Zoning Map (rezoning).
         (b)   In the case of a text amendment, the City Council may modify or
revise the proposed amendment prior to enactment.
      (5)   Notice of adoption. Following adoption of a zoning map amendment
(rezoning) or text amendment by the City Council, a notice will be published in
accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Act and the city.
      (6)   Resubmittal. A petition for a rezoning or zoning ordinance text
amendment that has been denied by the City Council shall not be resubmitted for
a period of one year from the date of denial except on the grounds of new
evidence or proof of changed conditions relating to all of the reasons noted
for the denial found to be valid by the Planning Commission.
(Prior Code, § 5.192)
   (D)   Criteria for amendment of the official zoning map (rezoning).
      (1)   In considering a rezoning application, the Planning Commission and
the City Council shall consider the following criteria in making their
findings, recommendations and decisions:
         (a)   Consistency with the goals, policies and future land use map of
the Charlevoix Master Plan, including all applicable subarea and corridor
studies. If conditions have changed since the Master Plan was adopted, then
consistency with recent development trends in the area shall be evaluated;
         (b)   Whether development under current zoning is impractical or less
reasonable than the requested or desired zoning district given factors such as
development trends;
         (c)   Capability of the site’s physical, geological, hydrological and
other environmental features to accommodate the potential uses allowed in the
proposed zoning district;
         (d)   Compatibility of all the potential uses allowed in the proposed
zoning district with surrounding uses and zoning in terms of land suitability,
impacts on the environment, noise, density, nature of use, traffic impacts,
aesthetics, infrastructure, impact on the ability to develop adjacent
properties under existing zoning and potential influence on property values;
         (e)   Capacity of city infrastructure and services sufficient to
accommodate the uses permitted in the requested district without compromising
the health, safety and welfare of the city;
         (f)   The apparent need for the types of uses permitted in the
requested zoning district in the city in relation to the amount of land in the
city currently zoned to accommodate that need; and
         (g)   Other factors as determined by the Planning Commission and the
City Council.
      (2)   Where a rezoning is reasonable given the above criteria, a
determination shall be made that the requested zoning district is more
appropriate than another or by amending the list of permitted or special land
uses within a district.
(Prior Code, § 5.193)
   (E)   Amendments required to conform to court decree. An amendment for the
purpose of conforming to a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction shall be
adopted by the City Council and published without necessity of a public hearing
or a referral to any other commission or agency.
(Prior Code, § 5.194)
(Ord. 795, passed 11-5-2018)
§ 153.007 CONDITIONAL ZONING.
   (A)   An applicant requesting a rezoning may voluntarily offer a conditional
zoning agreement along with an application for rezoning before, or following,
the public hearing for a proposed rezoning. A decision to submit a conditional
zoning agreement shall be pursuant to the Zoning Act and this chapter.
   (B)   The conditional zoning agreement shall be in writing, executed by the
applicant and the city and recorded with the county’s Register of Deeds.
   (C)   The conditional zoning agreement may include limitations on the uses
permitted on the property in question, specification of lower density or less
intensity of development and use; may impose greater restrictions on the
location, size, height or other measure for buildings, structures,
improvements, setbacks, landscaping, buffers, design, architecture and other
features; or may provide for financing and installation of public works
necessary to serve the proposed project.
   (D)   (1)   The conditional zoning agreement shall not authorize uses or
developments of greater intensity or density, or uses and developments that are
not permitted in the proposed zoning district.
      (2)   The conditional zoning agreement may not permit variations from
height, area, setback or similar dimensional requirements that are less
restrictive than the proposed zoning district; however, any variance approved
by the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with §§
153.035 through
153.042 of this chapter may be allowed as part of a conditional rezoning
agreement.
      (3)   If a special land use or site plan review is required by this
chapter for the use proposed or subject to conditions within the rezoning
agreement, the use(s) shall comply with the review and approval requirements as
applicable prior to establishing or commencing the use(s).
   (E)   The conditional zoning agreement shall include conditions that bear a
reasonable and rational relationship and/or benefit to the property in
question. The conditional zoning agreement may include conditions related to
the use and development of the property that are necessary to:
      (1)   Serve the property with improvements including, but not limited to,
the extension, widening or realignment of streets; construction or extension of
utilities and other infrastructure improvements serving the site; or the
construction of recreational facilities serving the site or uses thereon;
      (2)   Minimize the impact of the development on surrounding properties
and the city overall; or
      (3)   Preserve natural features and open space beyond what is normally
required.
   (F)   In addition to any limitations on use or development of the site,
preservation of site features or improvements described above, the conditional
zoning agreement shall also include the following:
      (1)   An acknowledgment that the conditional zoning agreement was
proposed voluntarily by the applicant;
      (2)   A statement that the property shall not be developed or used in any
manner that is not consistent with the conditional zoning agreement;
      (3)   A statement that the approval of the rezoning and the conditional
zoning agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the property
owner and the city, and also their respective heirs, successors, assigns,
receivers or transferees. Where the applicant for rezoning is acting on behalf
of the landowner through some form of purchase agreement or other mechanism,
then the landowner must also consent and sign the agreement;
      (4)   A statement that, if a rezoning with a conditional zoning agreement
becomes void in accordance with this section, that no further development shall
take place and no permits shall be issued unless and until a new zoning
district classification for the property has been established;
      (5)   A statement that no part of the conditional zoning agreement shall
permit any activity, use or condition that would otherwise violate any
requirement or standard that is otherwise applicable in the new zoning
district;
      (6)   A legal description of the land to which the agreement pertains;
and
      (7)   Any other provisions as are agreed upon by the parties.
   (G)   The conditional zoning agreement shall be reviewed concurrently with
the petition for rezoning following the process in§
153.006(C) above and the following.
      (1)   The conditional zoning agreement may be submitted prior to or
following the Planning Commission public hearing. If the agreement is provided
following the public hearing it must be reviewed by the Planning Commission
prior to the Planning Commission making its recommendation on the rezoning to
the City Council. The conditional zoning agreement shall be reviewed by the
City Attorney to determine that the conditional zoning agreement conforms to
the requirements of this section and the Zoning Act and shall confirm that the
conditional zoning agreement is in a form acceptable for recording with the
county’s Register of Deeds.
      (2)   Following the public hearing for a proposed zoning amendment, the
Planning Commission shall make a recommendation to the City Council based upon
the criteria listed in division (D)(1) above. In addition, the Planning
Commission shall consider whether the proposed conditional zoning agreement:
         (a)   Is consistent with the intent of this section;
         (b)   Bears a reasonable and rational connection or benefit to the
property being proposed for rezoning;
         (c)   Is necessary to ensure that the property develops in such a way
that protects the surrounding neighborhood and minimizes any potential impacts
to adjacent properties;
         (d)   Is necessary to allow the rezoning to be approved, in that the
property could not or would not be rezoned without the proposed conditional
zoning agreement;
         (e)   Leads to a development that is more compatible with abutting or
surrounding uses than would have been likely if the property had been rezoned
without a conditional zoning agreement or if the property were left to develop
under the existing zoning classification; and
         (f)   Is clearly in the public interest and not inconsistent with the
recommendations of the city’s Master Plan.
      (3)   If a conditional zoning agreement has been offered by the applicant
and recommended for approval by the Planning Commission, the City Council may
approve the conditional zoning agreement as a condition to the rezoning if it
meets all requirements of division(G)(2) above. The conditional zoning
agreement shall be incorporated by attachment or otherwise as an inseparable
part of the ordinance adopted by the City Council to accomplish the requested
rezoning.
      (4)   If the rezoning and conditional zoning agreements are approved, the
zoning classification of the rezoned property shall consist of the district to
which the property has been rezoned and a reference to the conditional zoning
agreement. The Official Zoning Map shall specify the new district, plus a
parenthetical “CZ” to indicate that the property is subject to a conditional
zoning agreement (i.e., “R1 (CZ)”). The City Clerk shall maintain a listing of
all properties subject to conditional zoning agreements and shall provide
copies of the agreements upon request.
      (5)   The approved conditional zoning agreement shall be recorded with
the county’s Register of Deeds.
      (6)   Any uses proposed as part of a conditional zoning agreement that
would otherwise require approval of a special land use or site plan approval
shall be subject to the applicable review and approval requirements of §§
153.230 through
153.239 and
153.243 through
153.257 of this chapter.
   (H)   (1)   The rezoning and conditional zoning agreement shall expire one
year after adoption of the rezoning and conditional zoning agreement, unless
substantial construction on the approved development of the property pursuant
to building and other required permits issued by the city commences within the
one-year period and proceeds diligently to completion, unless extended by the
City Council for good cause.
      (2)   In the event that substantial construction on the approved
development has not commenced within one year, the conditional zoning agreement
shall be void.
      (3)   Should the conditional zoning agreement become void, all
development on the subject property shall cease and no further development
shall be permitted. Until action satisfactory to the city is taken to bring the
property into compliance with the conditional zoning agreement, the city may
withhold or, following notice to the applicant and being given an opportunity
to be heard, revoke permits and certificates, in addition to, or in lieu of,
any other lawful action to achieve compliance.
      (4)   Notwithstanding the above, if the property owner applies in writing
for an extension of the conditional zoning agreement at least 30 days prior to
the expiration date, the City Council may grant an extension of up to one year.
Further extensions may be granted by the City Council, although the number of
previous extensions granted to a particular conditional zoning agreement shall
be considered in relation to the diligent effort of the land owner to satisfy
the conditions of the agreement.
   (I)   If the rezoning and conditional zoning agreement becomes void as
previously outlined, then the land shall revert back to its prior zoning
classification as set forth in the Zoning Act. The Zoning Administrator or
designee shall initiate the rezoning to the prior zoning classification and
notify the land owner and/or developer of the reversion of zoning by registered
letter.
   (J)   Provided that, all development and/or use of the property in question
is in compliance with the conditional zoning agreement, an authorized use or
development may continue indefinitely; provided that, all terms of the
conditional zoning agreement continue to be met.
   (K)   The conditional zoning agreement may be amended by the city with the
landowner’s consent in the same manner as was prescribed for the original
rezoning and conditional rezoning agreement.
   (L)   Nothing in the conditional zoning agreement, nor any statement or
other provision shall prohibit the city from later rezoning all or any portion
of the property that is the subject of the conditional zoning agreement to
another zoning classification. Any rezoning shall be conducted in compliance
with this chapter and the Zoning Act.
   (M)   The city shall not require an owner to offer conditions as a
requirement for rezoning. The lack of an offer of conditions shall not affect
the owner’s rights under this chapter.
   (N)   The city is not required or obligated to accept any or all conditions
offered by a developer on a rezoning application. In no way is an offer of a
conditional zoning agreement the basis for requiring the city to approve a
rezoning application.
(Ord. 795, passed 11-5-2018)
ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 153.020 ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER.
   The City Manager shall appoint a Zoning Administrator who shall be
authorized to enforce the provisions of this chapter. Such official shall, for
the purpose of this chapter, have the powers of a police officer.
(Prior Code, § 5.160)
§ 153.021 ZONING PERMITS.
   (A)   No building or structure shall be erected or installed on any lot
unless, or until, a zoning permit has been issued by the city for such building
or structure. No permit shall be issued by the city or any official thereof for
the construction, erection, alteration, placing or moving of any building or
structure on any parcel of land unless such building or structure is designed
and the proposed location on its lot, or its intended lot, is arranged to
conform with the provisions of this chapter; except that, no permit shall be
required for alterations which do not result in change in height, floor area,
lot coverage, location of walls or other structural alterations.
   (B)   All applicants for zoning permits shall pay the City Treasurer a fee
according to the schedule as shall be prescribed by the City Council.
   (C)   The Zoning Administrator may require applicants to post approved
zoning permits in a location easily visible to the public and adjoining
property owners based on one or more of the following conditions:
      (1)   The permit authorizes a construction project requiring substantial
excavation;
      (2)   The permit authorizes a construction project that has been
controversial in the area it is located in or with the general public;
      (3)   The permit authorizes a major construction project; and
      (4)   The permit authorizes a construction project for a new primary
building or use.
   (D)   Exempted from the zoning permit requirements are facial alterations,
installation of siding, windows, doors, shingles and replacements of existing
or deteriorated materials and ordinary maintenance repairs made on all
dwellings and their related outbuildings. This exemption does not eliminate the
necessity for compliance with other county, state or federal permitting
requirements.
   (E)   Zoning permits shall expire two years from the date of issuance,
unless substantial construction has begun.
(Prior Code, § 5.161)
§ 153.022 PROJECT STAKING AND INSPECTION.
   (A)   Prior to the issuance of a zoning permit, the applicant or their
representative shall accurately stake the location of the parcel property lines
and the location of the proposed construction such that the Zoning
Administrator may, by use of a tape measure and horizontal measurements,
confirm that the construction as staked is as represented on the applicant’s
site plan which accompanies their application. On sloping sites, the lowest
finished grade level shall be established on a grade stake which is offset from
the construction such that it remains undisturbed during the course of the
construction and may be used to check the final grade by the Zoning
Administrator by means of a string line level.
   (B)   After issuing a zoning permit, the Zoning Administrator shall from
time to time conduct inspections of construction for which a permit has been
issued, as may be required to determine compliance with the permit.
   (C)   Prior to commencing any construction of improvements which are a part
of a project approved with a special use permit such improvements shall be
staked both horizontally and vertically such that the Zoning Administrator may
verify that the improvements are located as shown on the approved site plan.
   (D)   At a minimum, inspections may be required at the following times:
      (1)   Prior to issuance of a zoning permit;
      (2)   Prior to commencement of construction of any site improvements
which are a part of a special use permit; and
      (3)   After site preparation, but prior to construction of any foundation
system.
   (E)   It shall be the duty of the applicant or its agent to notify the
Zoning Administrator when work is ready for inspection. Such inspection shall
be made within a reasonable time following notification giving due
consideration to the Zoning Administrator’s work schedule and work load.
Required inspections shall be deemed a requirement of a zoning permit or a
special use permit even though the inspection requirement is not listed on the
permit document.
   (F)   In the event the Zoning Administrator is unable to determine if parcel
boundaries are accurately located or that proposed or actual construction is
properly located on a parcel, the Administrator may require that the applicant
have a survey of the parcel of proposed or actual work prepared by a registered
land surveyor, at the applicant’s cost. Such survey shall be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator for review and as a part of the applicant’s zoning file.
   (G)   Inspections on the part of the Zoning Administrator shall in no way
absolve the applicant of responsibility for properly locating and undertaking
construction in a manner which meets the requirements of this section of any
permit issued in accord with this section, nor making any corrections to the
construction which are necessary to meet the requirements of this section.
(Prior Code, § 5.162)
§ 153.023 ENFORCEMENT.
   Any land, dwellings, buildings or structures used, erected, altered, razed
or converted in violation of this chapter or in violation of any regulations,
conditions, permits or other rights granted, adopted or issued pursuant to this
chapter are hereby declared to be a nuisance per se.
(Prior Code, § 5.163)
§ 153.024 FEES AND ESCROW.
   (A)   To defray costs, which can reasonably be anticipated to exceed those
normal costs covered by the application fee, related to the processing of
applications for any type of discretionary decision authorized by this chapter,
an escrow account with the city must be established and funded as provided in
this section. Examples of these discretionary decisions include, but are not
limited to, special use permits, planned unit developments, appeals to or
requests for interpretations by the Zoning Board of Appeals, rezoning requests
from individual property owners, variance applications and site plan review.
Applications initiated by an employee or any board, commission or branch of the
city shall not be subject to this section.
   (B)   If the Zoning Administrator determines that the application fee will
not cover the actual costs of processing the application to a final decision or
if the body reviewing the application determines that review of the application
and/or participation in the review process or appeal by qualified professional
planners, engineers, attorneys or other professionals is necessary, then the
applicant shall deposit with the City Treasurer such additional zoning fees in
an amount determined by the Zoning Administrator equal to the estimated
additional costs. Any determination regarding whether additional zoning fees
are needed shall consider the following factors:
      (1)   The complexity of the application, including all documents
submitted with the application;
      (2)   The complexity of the subject matter of the application;
      (3)   Whether the application involves interpretations of this chapter
for which there is no established interpretation;
      (4)   Whether the application involves legal issues or is of a complexity
such that the assistance of legal counsel would be reasonably prudent; and
      (5)   Whether the application involves planning, engineering, traffic or
other issues such that the assistance of a qualified professional would be
reasonably prudent.
   (C)   The additional zoning fees shall be held in escrow in the applicant’s
name and shall be used solely to pay these additional costs. If the amount held
in escrow becomes less than 10% of the initial escrow deposit, or less than 10%
of the latest additional escrow deposit, and review of the application or
decision on the appeal is not completed, then the Zoning Administrator shall
require the applicant to deposit additional fees into escrow in an amount
determined by the Zoning Administrator to be equal to the estimated costs to
complete processing the application to a final decision. Failure of the
applicant to make any escrow deposit required under this chapter shall be
deemed to make the application incomplete or the appeal procedurally defective
and thereby cause the denial of the application or the dismissal of the appeal.
Any unexpended funds held in escrow shall be returned to the applicant
following final action on the application or the final decision on the appeal.
Any actual costs incurred by the city in excess of the amount held in escrow
shall be billed to the applicant and shall be paid by the applicant prior to
the issuance of any permit or the release of a final decision on an appeal. The
applicant, who has placed funds in escrow pursuant to this section, shall be
entitled to an accounting of the expenditure of funds from the escrow account
if an additional escrow deposit has been requested, if any, and at the time of
the return of any unexpended funds. The request for an accounting shall be made
in writing to the City Treasurer. The accounting shall consist of a listing of
all expenditures made from the escrow fund and shall include the name of the
payee, a summary of the services or costs included in the expenditures and the
date of the services.
(Prior Code, § 5.164)
ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS (ZBA)
§ 153.035 CREATION AND MEMBERSHIP.
   (A)   General. A Zoning Board of Appeals (also referred to hereafter as
“ZBA”) is hereby established, having the powers authorized by the Zoning Act,
as amended, and in accordance with the City Charter.
   (B)   Membership. The ZBA shall consist of five members appointed by the
City Council, one of whom may be a member of the Planning Commission, and two
alternate members.
   (C)   Terms.
      (1)   Members shall be appointed for a term of three years; except that,
the terms for the Planning Commission members shall be the same as that for
their office.
      (2)   All vacancies for unexpired terms shall be filled for the remainder
of the term.
   (D)   Alternates. The City Council shall appoint two alternate members to
serve on the ZBA, appointed by the City Council to serve a three-year term. The
alternate members shall have the same voting rights as a regular member of the
ZBA and shall:
      (1)   Sit as regular members of the ZBA in the absence of a regular
member or for the purpose of reaching a decision on a case in which the regular
member has abstained due to conflict of interest; and
      (2)   Once an alternate has been called to serve in a particular case, he
or she shall continue to participate in that case until a decision has been
rendered.
   (E)   Removal. Members of the ZBA or alternates shall be removable by the
City Council for malfeasance, misfeasance or non-feasance in office, upon
filing of written charges and after a public hearing.
   (F)   Conflict of interest. A member shall disqualify themselves from a vote
in which the member has a conflict of interest. Failure of a member to
disqualify themselves from a vote in which the member has a conflict of
interest constitutes malfeasance in office. Any Planning Commissioner or City
Council member on the ZBA shall abstain from any vote on an issue which they
have previously voted upon as a member of the Planning Commission. ZBA members
shall also follow the city’s adopted Ethics and Conflict of Interest Policy, as
amended.
(Prior Code, § 5.175) (Ord. 795, passed 11-5-2018)
§ 153.036 OFFICERS.
   The Board shall elect from its membership a Chairperson, a Vice-Chairperson
and such other officers as it may deem necessary.
(Prior Code, § 5.176)
§ 153.037 RULES OF PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The Board shall adopt rules and regulations. Copies of such
regulations shall be made available to the public at the Office of Planning and
Zoning.
   (B)   Meetings of the Board shall be held at such times as the Board may
determine but, at least one time annually. There shall be a fixed place of

the Public Acts of 1976, being M.C.L.A. §§ 15.261 through 15.275, as amended.
   (C)   The presence of four members shall constitute a quorum. The concurring
vote of four members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order,
requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning Administrator, or to
decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to
pass by this chapter, or to grant variation from the requirements of the
chapter, except that a concurring vote of four members shall be necessary to
grant a land use variance.
   (D)   The ZBA shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the action of
the Board and the vote of each member upon each question or, if absent or
failing to vote, indicate such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations
and other official actions, all of which shall be filed promptly with the
office of the City Clerk and shall be public record.
   (E)   The ZBA may call on other city departments or contracted city
consultants for assistance in the performance of its duties and it shall be the
duty of such other city departments or consultants to render such assistance to
the Board as may be reasonably required.
   (F)   The ZBA may appoint an investigating committee of not more than three
members of the Board to review an application and the affected site(s).
   (G)   Applications submitted to the ZBA shall consist of the following, as
applicable:
      (1)   Signed and dated application form, as provided by the city;
      (2)   A scaled drawing with sufficient detail to indicate the nature and
necessity of the request;

limited to, traffic impact studies, market studies or environmental
assessments.
(Prior Code, § 5.177) (Ord. 795, passed 11-5-2018)
§ 153.038 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   The ZBA shall have jurisdiction and powers granted by the Zoning Act,
jurisdiction and powers prescribed in other subchapters of this chapter and the
following specific jurisdiction and powers.
   (A)   Powers.
      (1)   The ZBA shall not have the power to alter or change the zoning
district classification of any property, nor to make any change in the terms of
this chapter.
      (2)   The decision of the ZBA shall be final. However, a person having an
interest affected by this chapter may appeal to the Circuit Court for review
pursuant to the Zoning Act.
      (3)   In granting a variance, the ZBA may attach thereto such conditions
regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed uses as it
may deem reasonable in furtherance of the purpose of this chapter.
   (B)   Appeals of administrative decisions.
      (1)   General. The ZBA shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
by the appellant that there is error in any order, interpretation, requirement,
permit, decision or refusal made by any administrative official or body in
enforcing any provision of this chapter. Appeals may be taken by a person
aggrieved or by an officer, department, board or bureau of the state or city.
In order to be aggrieved by a decision of the city, the person or other entity
making the appeal must have a property interest and sufficient standing as
recognized under the law to challenge the decision.
      (2)   Filing and hearing of appeal.
         (a)   Appeals shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator within 30
days of the action being appealed.
         (b)   The Zoning Administrator or designee and any person from whom
the appeal is taken shall transmit to the ZBA all of the documents and records
related to the appeal.
         (c)   The ZBA shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the
appeal and shall provide notice as required by the Zoning Act.
         (d)   The applicant, or his, her or their duly authorized agent, must
appear in person at the hearing in order for the ZBA to take action. Failure to
appear may result in tabling or denial of the application.
      (3)   Decisions on appeal.
         (a)   An appeal to an administrative decision may be reversed by the
ZBA only if it finds that the action or decision appealed meets one or more of
the following requirements:
            1.   Was arbitrary or capricious;
            2.   Was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact;
            3.   Constituted an abuse of discretion;
            4.   Was based on an erroneous interpretation of this chapter or
zoning law.
         (b)   If a determination is made that the administrative official or
body making the decision did so improperly, the ZBA may reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from, and may make an order, requirement, decision or
determination as ought to be made and, to that end, shall have all the powers
of the administrative official or body from whom the appeal was taken.
   (C)   Interpretation. Upon request of the Planning Commission, City Council,
Zoning Administrator or designee, or applicant, the ZBA may interpret and
clarify the meaning of ordinance text. The ZBA may also be requested to
interpret boundaries of zoning districts where the zoning district
classification cannot be clearly discerned on the zoning map.
   (D)   Special land uses and planned unit developments (PUDs).
      (1)   The ZBA may grant dimensional or other site plan related variances
for special land uses; however, the ZBA shall not have the power to reverse or
modify the Planning Commission’s decision to approve or deny a special land use
permit nor grant variances to any conditions placed on special land use
approval.
      (2)   The ZBA shall not have the authority to grant variances to the PUD
regulations of §§
153.270 through
153.278 of this chapter or any requirements placed on PUD approval. However,
the ZBA shall have the authority to hear and decide appeal requests by
individual lot owners for variances from other sections of this chapter
following final approval of the PUD; provided, such variances do not affect the
terms or conditions of the original PUD approval or constitute a variance to
the PUD regulations of §§
153.270 through
153.278 of this chapter.
   (E)   Approvals. To hear and decide requests for other decisions that this
chapter specifically authorizes the ZBA to pass.
   (F)   Dimensional variances.
      (1)   The ZBA, after holding a public hearing in accordance with the
requirements of the Zoning Act, shall have the power to grant requests for
dimensional variances from the provisions of this chapter where it is proved by
the applicant that there are practical difficulties in the way of carrying out
the strict letter of this chapter relating to the construction, equipment or
alteration of buildings or structures, or of storm water management
requirements so that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed, public
safety secured and substantial justice done.
      (2)   A dimensional variance may be allowed by the ZBA only in cases
where the applicant has shown a practical difficulty in the official record of
the hearing. The applicant must prove that all of the following conditions have
been met:
         (a)   Extraordinary circumstances. There are exceptional or
extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying to the property in question
that do not apply generally to other properties in the same zoning district.
Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions may include:
            1.   Exceptional narrowness, shallowness, small size or shape of a
specific property on the effective date of this chapter;
            2.   Exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary
situation on the land, building or structure; and
            3.   The use or development of the property immediately adjoining
the property in question, whereby the literal enforcement of the requirements
of this chapter would involve practical difficulties.
         (b)   Substantial justice. Compliance with the strict letter of the
restriction’s governing area, setbacks, frontage, height, bulk, density or
other dimensional provisions would unreasonably prevent the use of the
property. Granting of a requested variance or appeal would do substantial
justice to the applicant as well as to other property owners in the district
and such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right similar to that possessed by other properties in the
same zoning district and in the vicinity. Any variance granted shall be the
minimum necessary to allow the preservation of these substantial property
rights. The possibility of increased financial return shall not of itself be
deemed sufficient to warrant a variance.
         (c)   Impact on the surrounding neighborhood. The variance will not be
detrimental to adjacent property and the surrounding neighborhood or interfere
with or discourage the appropriate development, continued use or value of
adjacent properties and the surrounding neighborhood as compared to other uses
in the neighborhood.
         (d)   Public safety and welfare. The granting of the variance will not
impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property or unreasonably
increase the congestion in public streets, or increase the danger of fire or
endanger the public safety, comfort, morals or welfare of the inhabitants of
the city.
         (e)   Not self-created. The immediate practical difficulty causing the
need for the variance request was not self-created by the applicant or previous
owners of the subject property.
   (G)   Use variances.
      (1)   Application requirements. In addition to the information required
for other variance requests, an application for a use variance shall include a
plan drawn to scale detailing the specific use and improvements proposed by the
applicant and a summary of the facts which support each of the following
conclusions:
         (a)   Applicant’s property cannot be used for the purposes permitted
in the zoning district;
         (b)   Applicant’s plight is due to unique circumstances peculiar to
his property and not to general neighborhood conditions;
         (c)   Applicant’s suggested use would not alter the essential
character of the area;
         (d)   Applicant’s problem has not been self-created;
         (e)   Unavailability of administrative relief which may afford
reasonable use of the applicant’s property; and/or
         (f)   At the end of each of divisions (G)(1)(a) through (G)(1)(e)
above, identify all persons who will testify at the hearing with respect to
each of the facts and, separately, identify all persons who will testify at the
hearing relative to the respective conclusion (and if any person is to be
offered as an expert witness, include with the application a resume which shows
the education and experience of such person within the particular area of
expertise).
      (2)   Use variance; pre-hearing conference.
         (a)   Prior to the scheduling of a hearing, the applicant shall
contact the Zoning Administrator or designee for the purpose of scheduling a
pre-hearing conference.
         (b)   The purposes of the pre-hearing conference shall be to:
            1.   Review the procedure for the hearing and identify all persons
who will testify (directly or through affidavit) and the evidence to be offered
on behalf of the applicant;
            2.   Attempt to secure a statement of agreed-upon facts to be used
to narrow the matters of dispute and shorten the hearing;
            3.   Explore a means of providing relief to the applicant by way of
a non-use variance from the ZBA, or other relief which may require action by
persons or bodies other than the ZBA which will afford an adequate remedy for
the applicant; and
            4.   Discuss the need, desirability and the terms of providing a
verbatim record of the hearing.
         (c)   The Zoning Administrator or designee shall determine who should
be present at the pre-hearing conference based upon the application submitted
and taking into consideration the discussion with the applicant or the
applicant’s representative.
         (d)   The pre-hearing conference shall be scheduled and conducted on
an expeditious basis so as to avoid unreasonable delay to the applicant.
Sufficient time shall be taken, however, to achieve the purposes of the pre-
hearing conference stated above.
      (3)   Use variance; hearing procedure.
         (a)   The applicant will have the burden of proof. In order to be
entitled to relief, the applicant must demonstrate each of the five factors in
division (G)(1) above.
         (b)   Manner of presentation.
            1.   Community representatives shall present an overview of the
zoning regulations involved. This may include an indication of the objectives
sought to be achieved in the zoning district, and any planning, engineering,
financial, environmental or other considerations which are generally relevant
within the zoning district and/or in the general area of the property at issue.
            2.   The applicant may present witnesses, including the applicant,
or may submit affidavits for the purpose of attempting to prove facts or
conclusions. The applicant shall be provided with the opportunity to present
all testimony and evidence proposed to be presented at the pre-hearing
conference, either through witnesses or affidavits; however, the Chairperson of
the ZBA may restrict testimony and evidence which would result in unreasonable
duplication. In addition, by motion made on its own or at the request of a
person at the hearing, the ZBA may require the presence of any witness who has
offered either testimony by affidavit on a material question of fact or
testimony of an expert nature, with the view of permitting members of the ZBA
to ask questions of such witnesses.
            3.   At the conclusion of the applicant’s presentation, interested
persons attending the hearing shall be provided with the opportunity to present
testimony and evidence in the same manner, and subject to requiring the
presence and questioning of witnesses as provided above for the applicant.
         (c)   When interested persons have completed their presentations, at
the same meeting and/or at an adjourned meeting date, testimony and evidence
may be presented on behalf of the community in the same manner, and subject to
requiring the presence and questioning of witnesses, as provided above for the
applicant. The purpose of such presentation shall be to ensure that a full
picture, including all relevant information, is before the ZBA for
consideration as it relates to the specific application presented.
         (d)   If testimony or evidence has been offered by or on behalf of
interested persons and/or the community, the applicant shall have the
opportunity to make a responsive presentation, restricted to answering the
points raised by interested persons and community representatives. The manner
of presenting witnesses, and requirement of their presence and questioning,
shall be the same as provided above for the applicant’s principal case.
         (e)   If a hearing is not completed at a given meeting within the time
period allowed by the ZBA, the Board shall adjourn the hearing to a date
certain for continuation.
      (4)   Use variance; decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
         (a)   The ZBA may deem it appropriate in any given case to provide an
opportunity for anyone presenting testimony or evidence to submit proposed
findings of facts and conclusions.
         (b)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the ZBA may make its decision
at that meeting, or it may adjourn the hearing to a new date for the purpose of
reviewing the testimony and evidence, and reviewing proposed findings and
conclusions submitted by hearing participants in preparation for making its
decision.
         (c)   If the ZBA determines to grant variance relief, it shall be the
minimum relief required to allow reasonable use of the property while
maintaining the essential character of the area. Such relief may be in the form
of one or more non-use variances and/or in the form of a use variance.
Conditions which are designed to ensure compliance with the intent of this
chapter and other regulations of the city may be imposed on a use variance.
Conditions imposed shall be based on the following criteria:
            1.   Ensure that public services and facilities affected by the
proposed land use and site plan will not be adversely affected;
            2.   Ensure that the use is compatible with adjacent land uses and
activities;
            3.   Protect natural resources, the health, safety, welfare and
social and economic well-being of those who will use the land use or activity
under consideration, residents and landowners immediately adjacent to the
proposed land use or activity, and the community as a whole;
            4.   Ensure compatibility between the proposed use or activity and
the rights of the city to perform its governmental functions;
            5.   Meet the intent and purpose of the zoning ordinance, be
related to the regulations and standards established in the ordinance for the
land use or activity under consideration and be necessary to ensure compliance
with those standards;
            6.   Ensure compliance with the intent of other city ordinances
that are applicable to the site plan; and
            7.   Ensure compatibility with the other uses of land in the
vicinity.
         (d)   If the ZBA adopts a motion to grant variance relief, such a
motion may be made as a tentative grant of relief, subject to review by the
Planning Commission, Zoning Administrator/consultant, engineer or other person
or official with expertise with a view of obtaining recommendations on any
conditions that may be relevant and authorized by law, and for the further
purpose of ensuring that the grant of relief would not violate applicable law.
If such a tentative grant of relief is approved, the ZBA shall request the
completion of all reviews by other boards or persons by a specific date so that
relief may be expeditiously finalized.
      (5)   Use variance standards for review. A use variance may be allowed by
the ZBA only in cases where the applicant has shown an unnecessary hardship in
the official record of the hearing. The applicant must prove that all of the
following conditions have been met:
         (a)   Hardship. The applicant has demonstrated that the site cannot
reasonably be used for any of the uses allowed within the current zoning
district designation. The ZBA may require professionals or certified experts to
submit documents to substantiate this finding;
         (b)   Unique circumstances. The condition or situation of the specific
parcel of property or the intended use of such property for which the variance
is sought is unique to that property and not commonly present in the general
vicinity or in the zone district. The applicant must prove that there are
certain features or conditions of the land that are not generally applicable
throughout the zone and that these features make it impossible to reasonably
use the property. Such unique conditions or situations include:
            1.   Exceptional narrowness, shallowness, small size or shape of a
specific property on the effective date of the ordinance from which this
chapter is derived;
            2.   Exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary
situation on the land, building or structure;
            3.   The use or development of the property immediately adjoining
the property in question; and
            4.   Any other physical situation on the land, building or
structure deemed by the ZBA to be extraordinary.
         (c)   Character of neighborhood. The use variance will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood or the intent of the comprehensive
development plan, or be a detriment to adjacent properties;
         (d)   Capacity of roads, infrastructure and public services. The
capacity and operations of public roads, utilities, other facilities and
services will not be significantly compromised; and
         (e)   Not self-created. The immediate practical difficulty causing the
need for the variance request was not self-created by the applicant or previous
owners of the subject property.
(Prior Code, § 5.178)
§ 153.039 PROCEDURE.
   The following procedures shall be followed.
   (A)   An application for decision for all matters delegated to the Board by
this chapter, or for interpretation of the provisions herein, or of the zoning
map, may be filed with the Zoning Administrator for a hearing by the ZBA.
   (B)   The appeal or application shall be accompanied by the required fees,
established by resolution of the City Council, payable to the City Treasurer.
   (C)   A request for a variance that has been denied by the Board shall not
be re-submitted within one year of the decision by the Board, unless the
applicant can show that conditions have changed to the extent that
reconsideration is merited, and the ZBA agrees to rehear the case.
(Prior Code, § 5.179)
§ 153.040 DECISION OF THE BOARD.
   (A)   After a final hearing, the ZBA shall make a decision on an application
or appeal. A copy of the Board's decision shall be transmitted to the applicant
or appellant. Such a decision shall be binding upon the Zoning Administrator
and observed by them, and they shall incorporate its terms and conditions in a
permit to the applicant or appellant whenever a permit is authorized by the
Board.
   (B)   Zoning Board of Appeals decisions shall expire one year from the date
of issuance, unless substantial construction has begun.
(Prior Code, § 5.180) (Ord. 823, passed 1-4-2021)
§ 153.041 STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from unless the Zoning Administrator or designee certifies to the Board after
notice of appeal shall have been filed with them, that by reason of fact stated
in the certificate, a stay would, in their opinion, cause imminent peril to
life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than
by a restraining order which may, with due cause shown, be granted by the Board
or by the Circuit Court, on application, after notice to the Zoning
Administrator.
(Prior Code, § 5.181)
§ 153.042 HEARINGS.
   When an application for a hearing or appeal has been filed with the required
data in proper form, and the fee paid, the Zoning Administrator shall
immediately schedule the application or appeal for a hearing and serve notices
stating the time, date, place and purpose of the hearing. The notice shall be
given to all property owners and to the occupants of residential dwellings
within 300 feet of the subject property. The names of owners shall be
determined from the last assessment roll. If a tenant’s name is not known, the
term “occupant” may be used. The notices shall be served by first-class mail or
by personal delivery and shall be served at least three days prior to the
hearing. Any interested party may appear and be heard at the hearing in person
or by agent or attorney. The Board may adjourn the hearing in order to obtain
additional information, or to provide further notice as it deems proper. In the
case of an adjourned hearing, persons previously notified and persons already
heard need not be notified of the resumption of the hearing.

   (E)   R4 District; additional requirements for multiple-family dwellings.
      (1)   Development standards. The general plan for multiple-family
dwellings shall include evidence and facts showing that it has considered and
made provisions for, and the development shall be executed in accordance with,
the following essential conditions.
         (a)   The proposed development shall be constructed in accordance with
an overall plan and shall be designed as the unified architectural unit (each
building, excluding accessory structures, shall have consistent roof lines,
roof pitch, architectural features and building materials) with appropriate
landscaping meeting the requirements of §
153.171 of this chapter.
         (b)   If the development of the R4 Zone is to be carried out in
stages, each stage shall be so planned that the foregoing requirements and the
intent of this subchapter shall be fully complied with at the completion of any
stage and the development of each stage shall take place in sequential order as
designated by the plan.
      (2)   Development requirements.
         (a)   Distance between buildings. The horizontal distance measured
between buildings, forming courts and courtyards, shall not be less than 20
feet.
         (b)   Parking. A parking area shall be placed so that it does not
interfere with any recreation or service area and shall be set back at least 15
feet from property lines.
         (c)   Paving. All areas provided for use by vehicles and all
pedestrian walks shall be surfaced with bituminous asphalt, concrete, pervious
concrete or similar materials and be properly drained.
         (d)   Service. Areas for loading and unloading delivery trucks and
other vehicles and for the servicing of refuse collection, fuel and other
services shall be provided, shall be adequate in size and shall be so arranged
that they may be used without interference with the use of access ways or
parking facilities.
         (e)   Vehicular circulation system. The proposed development will have
a planned circulation system that is designed in the best interest of the
public health, safety, and welfare in regard to the overall circulation of the
community. Provision shall be made for safe and efficient ingress and egress to
the public streets and highways without undue congestion to, or interference
with, normal traffic flow.
         (f)   Utilities. All buildings within the R4 Zone shall be serviced by
a public sanitary sewer disposal system and public water supply system. All
utility lines within the subject property including, but not limited to, power,
water, sewer and telephone shall be placed underground by the developer for new
developments. Each unit will be considered as a separate dwelling for the
purpose of utility connections.
         (g)   Open space. The developer shall be required where possible to
preserve or incorporate natural features such as wooded areas, streams and open
space areas, which add to the overall cohesive development of the R4 Zone and
overall community development.
   (F)   Dimensional requirements, clustered housing. Building height,
setbacks, lot coverage and minimum floor area for single-family attached,
single-family detached, two-family dwellings or any combination in an R4
District clustered housing development shall conform to the requirements of

NON-RESIDENTIAL AND MIXED USE DISTRICTS
§ 153.085 INTENT.
   (A)   GC, General Commercial District. This district accommodates retail and
service establishments within the city, particularly along major corridors
leading into and out of the city. The uses permitted in the GC District are
intended to provide convenient and attractive retail, professional office and
service establishments for the community and its rural trade area. This
district is intended to accommodate larger scale commercial development and
associated uses, due to larger lot sizes and consistency with the existing
built commercial environment.
   (B)   CBD, Central Business District. This zone regulates land within the
area traditionally considered to be Downtown Charlevoix. Its purpose is to
support the central activity area of the city by accommodating a mix of retail,
office, service, entertainment and residential uses in a walkable, pedestrian-
friendly environment. Business uses which are inconsistent with this purpose or
which detract from the convenience of this district are not permitted.
   (C)   CM, Commercial Mixed Use. This zone is intended to provide a
transitional area between the GC and CBD districts on the south side and the
CBD and R1 Districts north of the Bridge. This area south of the CBD includes a
mix of residential and homes that have been converted to offices or mixed use
buildings. Due to smaller lot sizes and structures with residential
appearances, the area is intended for professional offices, mixed use
buildings, retail and service establishments. This zone is intended to restrict
larger scale commercial development, better suited for the outer north and
south ends of the city.
   (D)   MC, Marine Commercial District. The MC District is established at
locations in the community with water frontage to protect and promote the
historic and unique heritage of the city. The historic marine use of the
waterfront is a keystone to the ambiance of the “fishing village” feeling of
the city. This district is intended to accommodate a mix of land uses including
single-family, condominiums, marine related commercial and professional
offices.
   (E)   CH, Commercial Hospitality District. The CH District provides for
overnight lodging and complementary facilities and services, such as gift shops
and restaurants. By precluding larger scale retail and other relatively intense
commercial uses, it is intended to be limited to lodging and associated uses to
complement the city as a vacation and wedding destination area.
   (F)   PO, Professional Office. This district is intended to accommodate uses
that are administrative and/or professional in nature in appropriate areas,
without adverse impacts to adjacent residential land uses.
   (G)   SR, Scenic Reserve District. The purpose of this district is to
protect the scenic attributes of certain properties along the shores of the
city’s abutting lakes where development has not occurred and views to and from
the water remain relatively unspoiled. The visual connection to the water and
the views from the lakes are considered essential elements of the city’s
character that bring economic health and vitality to the community. Scenic
reserve areas may also be forested lands or natural areas intended to be
protected from future development because of their community or environmental
value. Any uses permitted within this district must be undertaken in a manner
that will respect the environment and the scenic or visual value of the
designated areas. The SR District includes both public and private lands that
are also highly valued for recreational activities.
   (H)   I, Industrial District. This zone is intended to accommodate the
industrial needs of the entire community in such a manner that unreasonable
noise, dust, vibration or any other like nuisance shall not affect adjoining
properties.
   (I)   P, Public Facilities. This zone is intended to accommodate municipal,
county and federal government related buildings and uses. Public facilities
also include schools, public parking lots and the Charlevoix Public Library.
(Prior Code, § 5.30)
§ 153.086 SCHEDULE OF USES.
   Uses permitted in non-residential/mixed use districts are listed in Table
153.086. Additional requirements related to a specific use, if any, are
referenced in the “Specific Requirements” column. The requirements in footnotes

§ 153.118 LODGING, DINING AND ENTERTAINMENT USES.
   (A)   Sexually oriented businesses.
      (1)   Intent. In the development and execution of these zoning
regulations, it is recognized that some uses, because of their very nature, may
have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when
several of those uses are concentrated under certain circumstances, thereby
causing a detrimental effect upon the adjacent areas. The proximity of adult-
regulated uses to certain other uses considered particularly susceptible to the
negative impacts of a concentration of adult-regulated uses has been shown to
erode the quality of life, adversely affect property values, disrupt business
investment, encourage residents and businesses to move or avoid the community,
increase crime and contribute to a blighting effect on the surrounding area.
There is convincing documented evidence of the negative effect that adult-
regulated uses have on both existing businesses around them and the surrounding
residential areas to which they are adjacent. Therefore, the following intents
are served by these regulations.
         (a)   This division (A) describes the uses regulated and the specific
standards necessary to ensure that the adverse effects of these uses will not
contribute to the deterioration of the surrounding neighborhood, to prevent
undesirable concentration of these uses, and to require sufficient spacing from
uses considered most susceptible to negative impacts.
         (b)   These provisions are not intended to impose, nor shall they have
the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials including, but not limited to, sexually oriented
materials that are protected by the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution.
         (c)   Additionally, it is not the intent of the provisions of this
division (A) to restrict or deny, nor shall it have the effect of restricting
or denying, access by adults to sexually oriented materials that are protected
by the federal and state constitutions.
         (d)   Further, it is not the intent of these provisions to deny, nor
shall they have the effect of denying, access by the distributors and
exhibitors of adult oriented entertainment to their target market.
         (e)   These regulations shall not be interpreted as intending to
legitimize any activities that are prohibited by federal or state law, or by
any other ordinance of the city.
      (2)   Definitions. For the purpose of this division (A), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.

determined by the applicant, the applicant has the right to do so on reasonable
terms and conditions and the alternate location does not impose unreasonable
technical limits or significant additional costs.
         (g)   Decommissioning sites. A wireless provider shall notify the
authority in writing before discontinuing use of a small cell wireless
facility, utility pole, or wireless support structure. The notice shall specify
when and how the wireless provider intends to remove the small cell wireless
facility, utility pole, or wireless support structure. The wireless provider
shall return the property to its pre-installation condition. If the wireless
provider does not complete the removal within 45 days after the discontinuance
of use, the authority may complete the removal and assess the costs of removal
against the wireless provider. A permit under this division for a small cell
wireless facility expires upon removal of the small cell wireless facility.
         (h)   A wireless provider shall obtain a permit for any work that will
affect traffic patterns or obstruct vehicular or pedestrian traffic in the ROW.
      (6)   Zoning review for non-permitted uses.
         (a)   This division applies to zoning reviews for the following
activities that are subject to zoning review and approval, that are not a
permitted use under §
153.125(F)(4)(e), and that take place within or outside the public right-of-
way:
            1.   The modification of existing or installation of new small cell
wireless facilities.
            2.   The modification of existing or installation of new wireless
support structures used for such small cell wireless facilities.
         (b)   The processing of an application for a zoning approval is
subject to all of the following requirements:
            1.   Within 30 days after receiving an application under this
division, the authority shall notify the applicant in writing whether the
application is complete. If the application is incomplete, the notice shall
clearly and specifically delineate all missing documents or information. The
notice tolls the running of the 30-day period.
            2.   The running of the time period tolled under §
153.125(F)(6)(b)1 resumes when the applicant makes a supplemental submission in
response to the authority's notice of incompleteness. If the applicant makes a
supplemental submission in response to the authority's notice of
incompleteness, the authority will so notify the applicant in writing within
ten days, delineating the previously requested and missing documents or
information. The time period may be tolled in the case of second or subsequent
notices under the procedures identified in division §
153.125(F)(6)(b)1. Second or subsequent notices of incompleteness may not
specify missing documents or information that was not delineated in the
original notice of incompleteness.
            3.   Modification of support structure or collocation or
installation of wireless facilities shot clock 90 days - new support structure
shot clock 150 days; modification by agreement; deemed approved. The authority
shall approve or deny the application and notify the applicant in writing
within 90 days after an application for a modification of a wireless support
structure or installation of a small cell wireless facility is received or 150
days after an application for a new wireless support structure is received.
               a.   The time period for approval may be extended by mutual
agreement between the applicant and authority.
               b.   If the authority fails to comply with this division, the
application is considered to be approved subject to the condition that the
applicant provide the authority not less than 15 days' advance written notice
that the applicant will be proceeding with the work pursuant to this automatic
approval.
            4.   The authority may deny an application if all of the following
apply:
               a.   The denial is supported by substantial evidence contained
in a written record that is publicly released contemporaneously.
               b.   There is a reasonable basis for the denial.
               c.   The denial would not discriminate against the applicant
with respect to the placement of the facilities of other wireless providers.
         (c)   The authority's review of an application for a zoning approval
is subject to all of the following requirements:
            1.   Applicant presumed reasonable. An applicant's business
decision on the type and location of small cell wireless facilities, wireless
support structures, or technology to be used is presumed to be reasonable. This
presumption does not apply with respect to the height of wireless facilities or
wireless support structures. The authority may consider the height of such
structures in its zoning review, but shall not discriminate between the
applicant and other communications service providers.
            2.   The authority shall not evaluate or require an applicant to
submit information about an applicant's business decisions with respect to any
of the following:
               a.   The need for a wireless support structure or small cell
wireless facilities.

substantially similar to a spacing, setback, or fall zone requirement imposed
on other types of commercial structures of a similar height.
         (d)   Application fees:
            1.   $1,000 for a new wireless support structure or modification of
an existing wireless support structure.
            2.   $500 for a new small cell wireless facility or modification of
an existing small cell wireless facility.
         (e)   All zoning approval is void if the wireless provider fails to
commence construction within one year of the grant of same, unless the
authority and the applicant agree to extend this period or the delay is caused
by a lack of commercial power or communications facilities at the site. The
wireless provider may reapply for a zoning approval.
         (f)   A wireless provider may voluntarily request that a zoning
approval be terminated.
         (g)   The authority shall not institute a moratorium on either of the
following:
            1.   Filing, receiving, or processing applications for zoning
approval.
            2.   Issuing approvals for installations that are not a permitted
use.
         (h)   The authority may revoke a zoning approval, upon 30 days' notice
and an opportunity to cure, if the permitted small cell wireless facilities and
any associated wireless support structure fail to meet the requirements of the
approval, applicable codes, or applicable zoning requirements.
      (7)   Authority owned poles; rates; terms.
         (a)   The authority shall not enter into an exclusive arrangement with
any person for the right to attach to authority poles. A person who purchases,
controls, or otherwise acquires an authority pole is subject to the
requirements of this division.
         (b)   Rate. The rate for the collocation of small cell wireless
facilities on authority poles shall be nondiscriminatory regardless of the
services provided by the colocating person. The rate shall not exceed $30 per
year per authority pole. Every five years after the effective date of the Act,
the maximum rate then authorized under this division is increased by 10% and
rounded to the nearest dollar. This rate for the collocation of small cell
wireless facilities on authority poles is in addition to any rate charged for
the use of the ROW under §
153.125(F)(4).
         (c)   All greater rates and fees in current agreements shall be
modified within 90 days of application receipt, so as not to exceed the fees
provided here, except with respect to wireless facilities on authority poles
installed and operational before the effective date of this division or any
related agreement, which shall remain in effect for the duration of the
division or agreement.
         (d)   Within 90 days after receiving the first request to colocate a
small cell wireless facility on an authority pole, the authority shall make
available, through ordinance or otherwise, the rates, fees, and terms for the
collocation of small cell wireless facilities on the authority poles. The
rates, fees, and terms shall comply with all of the following:
            1.   The rates, fees, and terms shall be nondiscriminatory,
competitively neutral, and commercially reasonable and shall comply with the
Act.
            2.   The authority shall provide a good-faith estimate for any
make-ready work within 60 days after receipt of a complete application. Make-
ready work shall be completed within 60 days of written acceptance of the good-
faith estimate by the applicant.
            3.   The person owning or controlling the authority pole shall not
require more make-ready work than required to comply with law or industry
standards.
            4.   Fees for make-ready work shall not do any of the following:
               a.   Include costs related to preexisting or prior damage or
noncompliance unless the damage or noncompliance was caused by the applicant.
               b.   Include any unreasonable consultant fees or expenses.
               c.   Exceed actual costs imposed on a nondiscriminatory basis.
         (e)   This division does not require the authority to install or
maintain any specific authority pole or to continue to install or maintain
authority poles in any location if the authority makes a nondiscriminatory
decision to eliminate aboveground poles of a particular type generally, such as
electric utility poles, in a designated area of its geographic jurisdiction.
For authority poles with colocated small cell wireless facilities in place when
an authority makes a decision to eliminate aboveground poles of a particular
type, the authority shall do one of the following:
            1.   Continue to maintain the authority pole.
            2.   Install and maintain a reasonable alternative pole or wireless
support structure for the collocation of the small cell wireless facility.
            3.   Offer to sell the pole to the wireless provider at a
reasonable cost.
            4.   Allow the wireless provider to install its own utility pole so
it can maintain service from that location.
            5.   Proceed as provided by an agreement between the authority and
the wireless provider.
      (8)   No provider requirement of service. This division does not require
wireless facility deployment or regulate wireless services.
      (9)   Appeals. The applicant may appeal any authority determinations
related to this division to the highest elected body of the authority or, the
Charlevoix County Circuit Court.
      (10)   Defense, indemnity and insurance. All applicant wireless providers
shall:
         (a)   Defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the authority and its
officers, agents, and employees against any claims, demands, damages, lawsuits,
judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, and attorney fees resulting from the
installation, construction, repair, replacement, operation, or maintenance of
any wireless facilities, wireless support structures, or utility poles to the
extent caused by the applicant, its contractors, its subcontractors, and the
officers, employees, or agents of any of these.
         (b)   Obtain insurance naming the authority and its officers, agents,
and employees as additional insureds against any claims, demands, damages,
lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, and attorney fees. A
wireless provider may meet all or a portion of the authority's insurance
coverage and limit requirements by self-insurance. To the extent a wireless
provider elects to self-insure, the wireless provider shall provide to the
authority evidence demonstrating, to the authority's satisfaction, the wireless
provider's financial ability to meet the authority's insurance coverage and
limit requirements.
      (11)   Bonding.
         (a)   As a condition of a permit described in this act, the wireless
provider shall provide a $1,000 bond per small cell wireless facility, for the
purpose of providing for the removal of abandoned or improperly maintained
small cell wireless facilities, including those that an authority determines
should be removed to protect public health, safety, or welfare, to repair the
ROW as provided under §
153.125(F)(4)(b) and, to recoup rates or fees that have not been paid by a
wireless provider in more than 12 months, if the wireless provider has received
60-day advance notice from the authority of the noncompliance.
         (b)   The authority shall not require a cash bond, unless the wireless
provider has failed to obtain or maintain a bond required under this division
or the surety has defaulted or failed to perform on a bond given to the
authority on behalf of a wireless provider.

or controlled by an investor-owned utility whose rates are regulated by the
MPSC, an affiliated transmission company, or an independent transmission
company.
         (b)   This division does not impose or otherwise affect any rights,
controls, or contractual obligations of an investor-owned utility whose rates
are regulated by the MPSC, an affiliated transmission company, or an
independent transmission company with respect to its poles or conduits, similar
structures, or equipment of any type.
         (c)   Except for purposes of a wireless provider obtaining a permit to
occupy a right-of-way, this division does not affect an investor-owned utility
whose rates are regulated by the MPSC. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this division, pursuant to and consistent with § 6g of Public Act 470 of 1980,
being M.C.L.A. § 460.6g, the MPSC has sole jurisdiction over attachment of
wireless facilities on the poles, conduits, and similar structures or equipment
of any type or kind owned or controlled by an investor-owned utility whose
rates are regulated by the MPSC.

   (B)   Average front setback. The minimum front setback requirements for a
principal building in any residential district may be reduced in accordance
with the following: where two or more lots, entirely or partially within 200
feet of a subject lot, on the same side of the street and on the same block,
are occupied by principal buildings of which the existing front setback is less
than required by the zoning district, the average of the established setbacks
for those buildings shall be the minimum required front setback for the subject
lot.
   (C)   Setback from bodies of water. Notwithstanding other provisions of this
subchapter, all principal uses located in the R1 and R4 Districts shall have a
setback of 50 feet from the ordinary high water mark of Lake Michigan, Lake

§ 153.153 OUTDOOR STORAGE.
   (A)    Inoperable or unlicensed motor vehicles shall not be kept, parked or
stored in any residential district, except within a completely enclosed
building. The purpose of this provision is to prevent the accumulation of junk
motor vehicles and, therefore, it shall not apply to any motor vehicle
ordinarily used, but temporarily out of running condition. If the motor vehicle
is being kept for actual use, but is temporarily unlicensed, the Zoning
Administrator may grant the owner a reasonable time, not to exceed two months,
to procure a license.
   (B)   Likewise, old, rusty and unsightly machinery, machines not suited for
use upon the premises or quantities of used building materials not fit to be
used to improve the premises shall not be kept or stored outside a building;
provided, however, that, building materials fit to be used to improve the
premises may be kept on-site for one year if they are piled off the ground so
as not to become a harbor for vermin.
   (C)   Recreational equipment and vehicle storage. The standards of this
section apply to all zone districts with the exception of the industrial

[https://export.amlegal.com/media/0cbb34c9261c13beaa34740e94e954696d006833/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2138.png]Publisher's Note: This Section has been AMENDED by new
legislation (Ord. 842-2023, adopted 12-18-2023). The text of the amendment will
be incorporated below when the ordinance is codified.
   (A)   Intent. This section promotes the public health, safety and welfare by
establishing minimum standards for the design, installation and maintenance of
landscaping. Landscaping and landscaped buffers help protect and enhance land
uses and the visual image of the community. They further preserve natural
features, improve property values and can alleviate the impacts of noise,
traffic and visual distractions. Landscaped buffers protect less intense uses
from noise, lighting and other impacts associated with more intensive land
uses. Specifically, the intent of these provisions is to:
      (1)   Improve the appearance of off-street parking and storage areas and
property abutting public rights-of-way;
      (2)   Protect and preserve the appearance, character and value of the
neighborhoods, which abut non-residential areas, parking lots and other
potentially obtrusive uses;
      (3)   Reduce soil erosion and depletion;
      (4)   Increase soil water retention, thereby helping to prevent flooding,
erosion and sedimentation and enhancing ground water recharge;
      (5)   Remove air pollutants and reduce, eliminate or control glare,
reflection and heat island effects; and
      (6)   Assist in directing safe and efficient traffic flow and prevent
vehicular and pedestrian circulation conflicts.
   (B)   General requirements. These regulations apply to all new uses and the
expansion of existing uses requiring site plan approval.
      (1)   Landscaping shall be installed before occupancy, unless the
Planning Commission authorizes occupancy prior to complete landscape
installation, due to unforeseen weather conditions or other circumstances
beyond the applicant’s control. In such a case, a performance guarantee, per §
153.239 of this chapter, shall be provided to ensure completion of the project
as required. All landscaping shall be completed within one full growing season.
      (2)   All landscaping shall be maintained after planting and regularly
watered, fertilized, pruned and kept free from disease. The owner or
controlling party shall be responsible for maintenance.
      (3)   Diseased or dead plants shall be replaced within one growing
season.
      (4)   All plants shall be hardy per climatic conditions in the city.
      (5)   All landscaped areas shall be mulched and those not containing
trees and shrubs must be planted with ground cover. Mulch of any type is not
considered groundcover, nor is it a substitute for ground cover.
      (6)   The overall landscape plan shall not contain more than 25% of any
one plant species.
      (7)   Trees and shrubs shall not be placed closer than four feet to a
fence, wall or property line.
      (8)   For a corner lot or a lot with more than one frontage where
landscaping is required, all frontages shall be landscaped.
      (9)   Berms shall be designed to vary in height and shape to create a
more natural appearance. An unbroken earth mound of uniform height shall be
avoided. The maximum slope for a berm shall be one foot vertical to three feet
horizontal, unless otherwise allowed by the Planning Commission.
      (10)   Landscaping shall not obstruct sight distance, per §
153.142 of this chapter.
      (11)   Landscaping plans are subject to Planning Commission review and
approval.
      (12)   The Planning Commission may allow a deviation from the
requirements of this section under any of the following circumstances:
         (a)   Existing vegetation or topographic features make compliance with
requirements unnecessary or difficult to achieve;
         (b)   The application of requirements will result in a significant
loss of existing vegetation, or natural or cultural features;
         (c)   Modification of requirements will clearly result in a superior
design that could not be otherwise achieved;
         (d)   Where the distance between a building, parking area or use is
more than 200 feet from a side or rear lot line, the Planning Commission may
reduce the buffer area requirements along the applicable lot line(s) by 50%;
         (e)   Where the required landscaping may interfere with view
corridors, such as developments along water bodies, the Planning Commission may
require planting of specific species in locations where the height or canopy
will not compromise view corridors; and
         (f)   Where landscaping requirements may not be necessary for
community aesthetics, such as within the Ance Industrial Park.
      (13)   The Planning Commission may impose conditions on landscaping as
part of site plan review.
      (14)   Where a development is proposed in phases, each phase shall comply
with all applicable landscaping requirements.
      (15)   Where landscaping requirements are based on a distance measured
along a property line and result in a fractional requirement, the required
landscaping for just that area shall be multiplied by the fraction. For
example, when a fractional area is equal to 30% of the required distance the
number of required plants shall be multiplied by 0.30. A fraction less than 25%
may be disregarded.
      (16)   To ensure that all landscaping is installed, as a condition of
approval a letter of credit or some other performance guarantee may be required
in accordance with §
153.239 of this chapter.
      (17)   Low impact design, such as use of native vegetation, rain gardens
and vegetated swales is encouraged.
   (C)   Buffer areas.
      (1)   A buffer area may be required where any use in a business or
industrial district is adjacent to residentially zoned land and where multiple-
family residential land uses are adjacent to land in the R1, R2, R2A and R4
Districts.
      (2)   A buffer area is not required if the qualifying adjacent zoning
districts are separated by a public right-of-way.
      (3)   A buffer area shall be parallel to and follow the property line
tangent to the qualifying zoning district.
      (4)   A buffer area shall be required even when the adjacent property is
undeveloped.
      (5)   Except for access drives or private streets determined by the
Planning Commission to be necessary to provide safe access to a property, a
building, structure or parking lot shall not encroach within a required buffer
area.
      (6)   When adjacent to a PUD containing a residential land use, a use in
a non-residential or multiple-family residential district shall provide a
buffer area along the property line adjacent to the residential use, in
accordance with the requirements of Table 153.171(a). The Planning Commission,
however, may waive or modify the required buffer if the setbacks and perimeter
landscaping provided within the PUD meet the intent of division (A) above.
      (7)   Buffer areas are required as shown in Table 153.171(a). Buffer
types 1, 2 and 3 are described in Table 153.171(b).

(Prior Code, § 5.81) (Ord. 791, passed 3-19-2018) Penalty, see §
153.999
§ 153.172 LIGHTING.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. It is the purpose and intent of this Code to
balance the goals of the City of Charlevoix's Master Plan to maintain its
small-town character with the need to provide for safe lighting practices and
to minimize light pollution for the enjoyment of Charlevoix's citizens and
visitors.
      (1)   The use of outdoor lighting is often necessary for adequate
nighttime safety and utility, but common lighting practices can also interfere
with other legitimate public concerns. Principles among these concerns are:
         (a)   The degradation of the nighttime visual environment by
production of unsightly and dangerous glare;
         (b)   Lighting practices that interfere with the health and safety of
Charlevoix's citizens and visitors;
         (c)   Unnecessary waste of energy and resources in the production of
too much light or wasted light; and
         (d)   Interference in the use or enjoyment of property which is not
intended to be illuminated at night, and the loss of the scenic view of the
night sky due to increased urban sky-glow.
      (2)   The concerns of safety, utility and aesthetic appearance need not
compete. Good modern lighting practices can provide adequate light for safety
and utility without excessive glare or light pollution. In nearly all cases,
careful attention to when, where and how much nighttime lighting is needed will
lead to better lighting practices.
      (3)   The topography and atmospheric conditions in northern Michigan are
uniquely suited for commercial and private astronomical observation in the
area. Unnecessary or excessive uses of outdoor nighttime lighting have an
adverse impact on astronomical observation even at relatively distant
observatories.
      (4)   Accordingly, it is the intent of this Code to require lighting
practices and systems which will minimize light pollution, glare, light
trespass, and conserve energy while maintaining nighttime safety, utility,
security and productivity.
   (B)   Outdoor lighting. This definition includes the following terms and
definitions:
      (1)   CLASS 1 LIGHTING. All outdoor lighting used for, but not limited
to, outdoor sales or eating areas, assembly or repair areas, advertising and
other signs, recreational facilities and other similar applications where color
rendition is important to preserve the effectiveness of the activity.
      (2)   CLASS 2 LIGHTING. All outdoor lighting used for, but not limited
to, illumination for walkways, roadways, equipment yards, parking lots and
outdoor security where general illumination for safety and/or security of the
grounds is the primary concern.
      (3)   CLASS 3 LIGHTING. Any outdoor lighting used for decorative effects
including, but not limited to, architectural illumination, flag and monument
lighting, and illumination of trees, bushes, and similar things.
      (4)   DIRECT ILLUMINATION. Illumination resulting from light emitted
directly from a lamp, luminary, or reflector and is not light diffused through
translucent signs or reflected from other surfaces such as the ground or
building faces.
      (5)   DISPLAY LOT OR AREA. Outdoor areas where active nighttime sales
activity occurs and where accurate color perception of merchandise by customers
is required. To qualify as a display lot, one of the following specific uses
must occur: automobile sales, boat sales, tractor sales, building supply sales,
gardening or nursery sales, and assembly lots. Uses not on this list may be
approved as display lot uses by the Zoning Administrator.
      (6)   FOOT-CANDLE. One lumen per square foot. Unit of illuminance. It is
the luminous flux per unit area in the Imperial system. One foot-candle equals
approximately 0.1 (0.093) lux.
      (7)   FULLY SHIELDED LIGHT FIXTURE. A light fixture that is shielded in
such a manner that light rays emitted by the fixture, either directly from the
lamp or indirectly from the fixture, are projected below a horizontal plane
running through the lowest point on the fixture where light is emitted (see
Figure 153.172)

IMAGES/0-0-0-2202.png]
   Figure 153.172 Example of Fully Shielded Light Fixtures
      (8)   GLARE. The sensation produced by a bright source within the visual
field that is sufficiently brighter than the level to which the eyes are
adapted to cause annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual performance and
visibility; blinding light. The magnitude of glare depends on such factors as
the size, position, and brightness of the source, and on the brightness level
to which the eyes are adapted.
      (9)   INSTALLED. A light fixture attached or fixed in place, whether or
not connected to a power source, of any outdoor light fixture.
      (10)   LIGHT POLLUTION. Any adverse effect of man-made light.

parks, baseball diamonds, soccer and football fields, golf courses, tennis
courts, and swimming pools.
      (19)   PARTIALLY SHIELDED LIGHT FIXTURE. A fixture shielded in such a
manner that no more than 10% of the light emitted directly from the lamp or
indirectly from the fixture is projected at an angle above the horizontal, as
determined by photometric test or certified by the manufacturer. Luminaries
mounted under canopies or other structures such that the surrounding structure
effectively shields the light in the same manner are also considered partially
shielded for the purposes of this Code.
      (20)   SECURITY LIGHTING. Lighting designed to illuminate a property or
grounds for the purpose of visual security.
      (21)   UNSHIELDED FIXTURE. Any fixture that allows light to be emitted
above the horizontal directly from the lamp or indirectly from the fixture or a
reflector.
      (22)   WATT. The unit used to measure the electrical power consumption
(not the light output) of a lamp.
   (C)   Applicability.
      (1)   New uses, buildings and major additions or modifications. If the
total cumulative increase in floor area is greater than 33% for single-family
residential or greater than 25% for all other uses, then all outdoor lighting
fixtures shall meet the requirements of this Code for the entire site,
including previously installed and any new outdoor lighting. Cumulative
modification or replacement of outdoor lighting constituting 25% or more of the
permitted lumens for the parcel, no matter the actual amount of lighting
already on a nonconforming site, shall constitute a major addition for purposes
of this section.
      (2)   Minor additions. If the total cumulative increase in the floor area
is 33% or less for single family residential or 25% or less for all other uses,
then full conformance of the existing portion of the building or structure is
not required. However, such projects shall require the submission of a complete
inventory and site plan detailing all existing and any proposed new outdoor
lighting.
      (3)   New lighting. Any new lighting on the site shall meet the
requirements of this Code with regard to shielding and lamp type; the total
outdoor light output after the modifications are complete shall not exceed that
on the site before the modification, or that permitted by this Code, whichever
is larger.
      (4)   Resumption of use after abandonment. If a property or use with
nonconforming lighting is abandoned as defined in § 153.293, Nonconforming
Buildings or Structures, then all outdoor lighting shall be reviewed and
brought into compliance with this Code before the use is resumed.
      (5)   Public roadways. In general, this Code does not apply to city and
state rights-of-way. However, the goal of the city is to have all such street
lights fully shielded.
   (D)   Outdoor lighting standards.
      (1)   Light Emitting Diode Lighting (LED). Due to their high energy
efficiency, long life and spectral characteristics, (LED) lamps are the
preferred illumination source throughout the city. Their use is to be
encouraged, when not required, for outdoor illumination whenever its use would
not be detrimental to the use of the property.
         (a)   Class 1 Lighting. Light emitting diode (LED) lamps are not
required. Businesses who choose to use LED as their primary lamps are eligible
to apply for an additional 10% increase in the lumens per acre allowed for
their site.
         (b)   Class 2 Lighting. Light emitting diode (LED) lamps are required.
Up to 10% of the total lumens per acre allowed may be white light.
      (2)   Light trespass standard.
         (a)   All light fixtures, including security lighting, shall be aimed
and shielded so that the direct illumination shall be confined to the property
boundaries of the source.
         (b)   Particular care is to be taken to ensure that the direct
illumination does not fall onto or across any public or private street or road.
Motion sensing light fixtures shall be fully shielded and properly adjusted,
according to the manufacturer's instructions, to turn off when detected motion
ceases.
      (3)   Lamp and shielding. All light fixtures are required to be fully
shielded and shall be installed in such a manner that the shielding complies
with the definition of fully shielded light fixtures for all uses, including
single-family and multi-family residential uses, except as provided below.
         (a)   All lamp types above 2,000 lumens shall be fully shielded.
         (b)   Partially shielded light fixtures may be permitted subject to
the approval of the Zoning Administrator.
         (c)   Partially shielded light fixtures are limited to a maximum of
5,500 lumens per net acre and shall not exceed 2,000 per lamp (see subsection
(4) of this section).
      (4)   Total outdoor light output standards - nonresidential and multi-
family uses.
         (a)   Total outdoor light output shall not exceed an average of .4356
lumens per net foot for all development except single-family residential uses.
This cap is not intended to be achieved in all cases or as a design goal.
Instead, design goals should be the lowest levels of lumens necessary to meet
the lighting requirements of the site. Partially shielded light fixtures are
limited to an average maximum of 7.92 lumens per net foot and are counted
towards the 100,000 lumens per net acre cap.
         (b)   Seasonal decorations, permitted between November 15 and January
15, are not counted toward these limits. Lighting used for external
illumination of signs is counted.
      (5)   Total outdoor light output standards - single-family residential
uses.
         (a)   Outdoor lighting for single-family residential uses is not
subject to a lumens per net acre cap.
         (b)   Outdoor lighting for single-family residential uses is subject
to the lamp fixture and shielding requirements.
      (6)   Parking lot standards. Parking lots shall be considered Class 2
lighting. Parking lot lighting poles shall be sized in such a manner that the
top of any luminary does not exceed 12 feet above adjacent grade.
      (7)   Lighting time limitations.
         (a)   Class 1 lighting, including but not limited to sales, service,
commercial, assembly, repair, maintenance, and industrial areas, may only
continue in operation until 11:00 p.m. or for as long as the area is in active
use but once off remain off during non-business hours.
         (b)   Class 2 lighting shall have no time restrictions except as
specified by any conditions of approval. Uses that do not require all-night
illumination are encouraged to turn off their outdoor lighting during night
hours whenever possible.
         (c)   Class 3 lighting, except for flagpole lighting and low-wattage
holiday decorations must be extinguished after 11:00 p.m. or when the business
closes, whichever is later.
         (d)   Multi-class lighting, except for security lighting, must conform
to the time limitations of the strictest class.
      (8)   Multi-class lighting standard. Multi-class lighting must conform to
the shielding and timing restrictions, if any, that apply to the most
restrictive included class.
      (9)   Class 3 lighting standards.

masses). Uplighting or ground-mounted lighting shall be designed and installed
in such a manner as to minimize glare with special consideration in areas where
there is vehicle and pedestrian traffic.
            2.   All lighting which is directed upwards shall be placed in such
a manner that the angle of the lamp shall not be greater than 45 degrees
measured from a horizontal plane to a line projected through the center of the
lamp, and fixtures shall be fully shielded to contain and direct the light onto
the feature to be lit.
      (10)   Searchlights, floodlights, laser source lights, strobe or flashing
lights, illusion lights or any similar high intensity light shall not be
permitted except in emergencies by police and fire personnel at their
direction. Spot lights are permitted and must be directed downward 45 degrees
from any neighboring property.
      (11)   On projects where an engineer or architect is required, the
developer shall verify in writing to the city that all outdoor lighting was
installed in accordance with the approved plans.
   (E)   Special uses.
      (1)   Recreational facilities.
         (a)   Lighting for outdoor athletic fields, courts or tracks shall be
considered Class 1.
         (b)   Lighting allowed in this section shall be subject to Planning

level sports facilities where fully, shielded fixtures are not utilized,
acceptable luminaries shall include those which:
            1.   Are provided with internal or external glare control louvers,
or both, and installed so as to minimize uplight and off-site light trespass as
determined by the Zoning Administrator; and
            2.   Are installed and maintained with aiming angles that permit no
greater than 2% of the light emitted by each fixture to project above the
horizontal.
      (2)   Outdoor display lots. Light for outdoor display lots shall be
considered Class 1, and shall conform to the lumens per net acre limits except
as follows:
         (a)   All such lighting shall utilize fully shielded luminaries that
are installed in a fashion that maintains the fully shielded characteristics.
         (b)   When the proposed lumens exceed the per acre limits, the
installation shall be designed to achieve no greater than the minimum

OFF-STREET PARKING, LOADING, ACCESS AND CIRCULATION
§ 153.185 DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to prescribe regulations for off-
street parking of motor vehicles in residential and non-residential zoning
districts, to ensure that adequate parking and access are provided in a safe
and convenient manner and to afford reasonable protection for adjacent land
uses from light, glare, noise, air pollution and other effects of parking
concentrations.
   (B)   It is the further intent of these regulations to:
      (1)   Implement the goals and policies of the city’s Master Plan;
      (2)   Reduce the impacts associated with parking lots through minimum and
maximum parking requirements; and
      (3)   Accommodate shared parking to limit the extent of paved and
impervious surfaces.
(Prior Code, § 5.90)
§ 153.186 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   For all buildings and uses established after the effective date of
this chapter, off-street parking shall be provided as required by this section,
except in the CBD Central Business District. Parking spaces provided in this
manner shall be unreserved and generally available to the public.
   (B)   If the intensity of the use of any building or site is increased by
adding floor area, increasing seating capacity or employees, or by any other
means, additional off-street parking shall be provided to the extent required
by this subchapter.
   (C)   For off-street parking facilities that exist on the effective date of
this chapter, their capacity shall not be reduced below the requirements of
this subchapter, nor shall the capacity of non-conforming parking facilities be
further reduced or made more non-conforming.
   (D)   Required off-street parking shall not be changed to another use unless
equal facilities are provided elsewhere, in accordance with the provisions of
this subchapter.
   (E)   Changes in use or new uses of existing buildings or floor area shall
require parking in accordance with this subchapter, except in the CBD Central
Business District the requirement for additional parking due to a legal
commercial use change shall be waived.
(Prior Code, § 5.91) (Ord. 807, passed 9-3-2019)
§ 153.187 PARKING REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   Off-street parking shall only be used for temporary vehicle parking
related to the activities on the premise. The storage of merchandise, motor
vehicles for sale, recreational vehicles, limousines, trucks and trailers is
prohibited, except under the conditions of §
153.153 of this chapter. Use of off-street parking to store or park wrecked or
junked cars, or to repair vehicles is prohibited.
   (B)   When calculations for required parking spaces result in a fraction
over one-half, one full parking space shall be required.
   (C)   For a use not specifically included in Table 153.187, off-street
parking requirements shall be in accordance with a use determined by the Zoning
Administrator to have comparable parking characteristics. For any use
determined as not having a comparable parking requirement, it shall be
determined by the Planning Commission based on recent and published parking
research, or by accepting the findings of a parking study provided by the
applicant in accordance with §
153.188(B)(6) of this chapter.
   (D)   For benches, pews or similar seating, each 24 inches shall be counted
as one seat unless plans filed with the city specify a maximum seating
capacity, which shall then be used to determine parking requirements.
   (E)   Unless otherwise indicated, floor area shall refer to usable floor
area (UFA).
   (F)   Where parking requirements are established by maximum building seating
or occupancy, capacity shall be based on the building and/or fire code,
whichever is more restrictive.
   (G)   Minimum parking space requirements shall not be exceeded unless
approved by the Planning Commission based on documented evidence that
additional spaces are required to accommodate parking demand on a typical day.
The Planning Commission may require any additional spaces to be constructed
using alternate paving materials, such as pervious pavers or concrete. A
required or requested use of alternative paving materials shall include a
maintenance plan and agreement from the property owner deemed satisfactory to
the Planning Commission.
   (H)   The minimum required number of off-street parking spaces shall be
determined based on the requirements listed in Table 153.187.

§ 153.188 PARKING ALTERNATIVES.
   (A)    Shared/common parking. Shared parking, or an arrangement in which two
or more nonresidential uses with different peak parking demands (hours of
operation) uses the same off-street parking spaces to meet their off-street
parking requirements, may be allowed.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator may approve an adjustment to the parking
requirements allowing shared parking arrangements for nonresidential uses with
different hours of operation.
      (2)   Applicant must provide that there is no substantial conflict in the
principle operating hours of the uses for which the shared parking is proposed.
      (3)   Shared parking must be within 50 feet walking distance, measured
from the entrance of the use to the nearest parking space in the shared lot.
      (4)   An agreement providing for the shared use of the parking, executed
by the parties involved, must be filed with the Zoning Administrator, in a form
approved by the Zoning Administrator upon consultation with the city attorney.
   (B)   Modification of parking requirements. The Planning Commission may
reduce the parking space requirements of this section for any use, based upon
one or more of the following.
      (1)   Shared parking by multiple uses is expected due to the likelihood
of numerous multipurpose visits, or if uses have peak parking demands during
different times of the day or days of the week; subject to the following.
         (a)   Sidewalks shall be maintained or established between the uses.
         (b)   Pedestrian connections, both within and to the site, shall
provide safe and convenient access to building entrances.
         (c)   For separate properties, shared parking lots shall be within 300
feet to one another with vehicular and pedestrian access.
         (d)   Unless the multiple uses are all under single ownership and
within a unified business or shopping center, office park or industrial park,
shared parking agreements shall be filed with the City Clerk after approval by
the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   Convenient municipal off-street parking facilities or on-street
spaces are located no further than 600 feet from the subject properties.
      (3)   An expectation of walk-in trade is reasonable due to the proximity
of residential neighborhoods, downtown or employment areas that are
interconnected with sidewalks.
      (4)   Other forms of travel such as bicycle or transit are available and
are reasonable alternatives.
      (5)   The Planning Commission may require a parking study to document
that the above divisions (B)(1)(a) through (B)(1)(d) have been addressed.
      (6)   Where the applicant has provided a parking study, it shall
demonstrate that a standard other than that required by this subchapter would
be more appropriate based on the number of employees, expected level of
customer traffic, or actual counts at a similar establishment. Parking studies
shall be prepared by a qualified expert, such as a professional transportation
engineer or professional transportation planner, based upon standards, manuals
and research published by professional organizations, such as the Institute of
Transportation Engineers, the Transportation Research Board or Urban Land
Institute. The Planning Commission may require parking studies of comparable
uses in the general area as part of the study.
   (C)   Deferred parking.
      (1)   Where a reduction in parking spaces is not warranted, but an
applicant can demonstrate the parking requirements for a proposed use may be
excessive given the particular circumstances of the use and property, the
Planning Commission may defer some of the required parking. The site plan shall
designate an area to accommodate its future construction, if and when it is
needed, meeting the design standards and dimensional requirements of this
subchapter. In the interim, the deferred parking area shall be landscaped and
maintained and shall not occupy required setbacks, buffers or landscaped areas
or be used for any other purpose.
      (2)   Construction of the deferred parking spaces may be initiated by the
owner or required by the city based on conditions affecting on-site parking
needs or observations, and shall require administrative approval of an amended
site plan.
   (D)   Downtown parking. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces
required by this section shall be waived for all buildings fronting Bridge
Street between the Pine River Channel and Antrim Street.
   (E)   Proposed developments. The Planning Commission may require parking in
the side or rear of a building where possible, if a proposed development fronts
a public street. In these instances the Planning Commission may waive or reduce
landscaping or screening requirements in §
153.171 of this chapter.

§ 153.189 OFF-STREET PARKING FACILITY DESIGN.
   (A)   Off-street parking location and setbacks.
      (1)   Side and rear yard limitation. Off-street parking lots shall meet
the side setback requirements as specified in the zoning district and shall not
be closer than 15 feet from the rear property line.
      (2)   Front yard limitation. In the CBD, GC, PO and CM Districts and
single multi-family buildings in the R1 or R2 Districts, the required front
yard setback shall not be used for off-street parking, loading, or unloading
and shall remain open, unoccupied and unobstructed, except for landscaping or
vehicle access drives.
      (3)   Proximity. Required off-street parking facilities for all uses,
other than residential dwellings, shall be located on the same lot as the use,
or within 300 feet of the building(s) or use they are intended to serve.
Distance shall be measured from the nearest point of the building to the
nearest point of the off-street parking lot.
         (a)   Required off-street parking facilities for residential dwellings
shall be located on the same property as the premises they are intended to
serve and shall consist of a driveway, a parking apron and/or a garage. Parking
for single multifamily structures shall be located at the rear or on the side
of the building.
         (b)   In the CBD District, parking facilities shall be located within
600 feet of the building or use to be served. Distance shall be measured from
the nearest point of the building to the nearest point of the off-street
parking lot.
         (c)   Parking access shall be from the alley or front side where
available, otherwise access may be from the front lot line.
   (B)   Parking construction and development. The construction of a parking
lot shall require an approved site plan, in accordance with §§
153.230 through
153.243  of this chapter. Construction shall be completed and approved by the
Zoning Administrator.
   (C)   Pavement. Unless alternative materials are specifically permitted as
provided in this division (C), all parking lots and vehicle and equipment
storage areas shall be hard-surfaced using asphalt, concrete or concrete or
brick pavers and shall be appropriately graded and drained. The Planning
Commission may approve permeable paving for all or part of a parking lot. For
storage areas, a substitute for hard surface paving may be allowed if the
Planning Commission finds adjoining properties will not be adversely affected.
   (D)   Curbs. A parking lot shall be surrounded by a six-inch concrete curb,
except for driveway openings, sidewalk dub-downs and approved drainage systems,
to protect landscaped or pedestrian areas, buildings or adjacent property from
potential vehicle encroachment. The Planning Commission may approve an
alternative to a fully curbed parking facility as long as the intent of this
division (D) is achieved. To avoid conflicts with swinging car doors and
overhanging bumpers, in such circumstances all plants shall be set back at
least two feet from the edge of pavement.
   (E)   Dimensions. 
Table 153.189 specifies applicable parking space and aisle dimension
requirements.
      (1)   Angled parking between the specified ranges shall be to the nearest
degree.
      (2)   The length of a parking stall may be reduced by up to two feet if
the parked vehicle can overhang an unobstructed landscaped area or sidewalk by
not less than two feet. In such instances a sidewalk shall be at least seven
feet wide.
      (3)   At least seven feet shall be maintained between a parking lot and
building.
      (4)   All parking lots shall be striped and maintained showing individual
parking bays in accordance with the following dimensions:

as a bank, restaurant, car wash, pharmacy, dry cleaner or oil change
establishment) shall be at least 24 feet long and ten feet wide and shall not
block off-street parking spaces. Where the waiting/stacking lane is a single
lane accommodating five or more vehicles, an escape lane shall be provided for
vehicles wishing to by-pass the drive-up window.
   (G)   Ingress and egress. Clearly defined and limited driveways shall
provide adequate vehicular access to a parking lot. Interior access and
circulation aisles for all parking spaces shall be provided. A public street
shall not be used as a maneuvering space for a vehicle to get into or out of an
off-street parking space. Access drives serving a parking lot in a non-
residential zoning district shall not cross a residential district, except when
access is provided by means of an alley that forms a boundary between a
residential and non-residential district.

pose a likely threat of a total or partial collapse.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator and/or other officials designated by the
Zoning Administrator shall have the right to inspect signs and advertising
devices to determine whether they are structurally unsafe. The Zoning
Administrator and/or other officials designated by the Zoning Administrator may
exercise this right of inspection by consent of the owner of the sign or
advertising device and the owner of the property on which the sign or
advertising device is located or by administrative search warrant.
      (3)   If the Zoning Administrator finds that a sign or advertising device

or the owner of the property on which the sign or advertising device is located
fails to remedy the unsafe condition within the time specified in the written
notice, the city may enter onto the property to remedy the unsafe condition and
charge the costs of such action, including reasonable attorney fees, to the
owner of the sign or advertising device and/or the owner of the property on
which the sign or advertising device is located;
         (e)   A statement that the owner of the sign or advertising device and
the owner of the property on which the sign or advertising device is located
has the right before the expiration of the deadline contained in the written
notice to request a hearing before the City Council regarding whether the sign
or advertising device is structurally unsafe;
         (f)   The service required by this subsection shall be personal
service or service by certified mail, restricted delivery, return receipt
requested. For purposes of this section, the phrase REMEDY THE UNSAFE CONDITION
shall mean repairing the sign or advertising device so that it does not pose a
serious threat of a total or partial collapse or removing the sign or
advertising device from the property;
         (g)   If the owner of the sign or advertising device or the owner of
the property on which the sign or advertising device is located requests a
hearing before the City Council as provided in this section, the city shall
take no action to remedy the unsafe condition until, after notice and hearing,
the City Council finds that the sign or advertising device is structurally
unsafe. A notice of the time, date and place of the hearing before the City
Council shall be served on the owner of the sign or advertising device and on
the owner of the property on which the sign or advertising device is located no
less than 14 days before the scheduled hearing. The service of this notice may
be made by first class mail. The owner of the sign or advertising device or the
owner of the property on which the sign or advertising device is located may
appeal an adverse decision by City Council to the circuit court as provided by
law; and
         (h)   In exercising its right under this section to remedy the unsafe
condition, either with or without a hearing before the City Council, the city
shall remove the sign or advertising device from the property if the unsafe
sign is in imminent danger of collapse causing injury or damage to persons or
property. The costs of remedying and/or removing the unsafe condition shall be
collected by the city from the owner of the sign or advertising device or the
owner of the property on which the sign or advertising device is located.
   (F)   Non-conforming signs.
      (1)   Subject to the remaining restrictions of this section, non-
conforming signs that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this
chapter may be continued, repaired and maintained as is necessary to keep in a
sound condition.
      (2)   No person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the
extent of non-conformity of a non-conforming sign. In addition, no person may
add illumination.
      (3)   A non-conforming sign may not be moved or replaced, except to bring
the sign into greater conformity with this chapter.
      (4)   If a non-conforming sign is destroyed to the extent it is
impractical to be restored using a majority of its existing major components,
it may not thereafter be repaired, reconstructed or replaced except in
conformity with all the provisions of this chapter, and the remnants of the
former sign structure shall be cleared from the land.
      (5)   The message of a non-conforming sign may be changed so long as this
does not create any new non-conformity.
(Prior Code, § 5.101) (Ord. 789, passed 3-19-2018)
§ 153.207 SIGN STANDARDS FOR ALL SIGNS.
   (A)   Number and placement requirements.
      (1)   A number of small signs with organized elements or cohesive design
may be construed as a single sign. Where graphic material is displayed in a
random manner without an organized relationship of elements, each element may
be considered a single sign.
      (2)   No sign may extend above any parapet or be placed upon any roof
surface, except that for purposes of this chapter, roof surfaces constructed at
an angle of 75 degrees or more from horizontal shall be regarded as wall space.
   (B)   Computation of sign face area.
      (1)   The sign face area of a sign shall be computed by including the
entire area within a single, continuous perimeter of a circle, triangle,
rectangle or parallelogram enclosing the extreme limits of the writing,
representation, emblem or other display, together with any material or color
forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is
placed, but not including any supporting framework or bracing that is clearly
incidental to the display itself.
      (2)   If the sign consists of more than one section or module, all of the
area, including that between sections or modules, shall be included in the
computation of the sign face area.
      (3)   Subject to the provisions of §
153.208(B) of this chapter, the sign face area of two-sided, multi-sided or
three-dimensional signs shall be computed by including the total of all sides
designed to attract attention or communicate information.
   (C)   Sign height. The height of a sign shall be measured vertically from
the ground level to the top of the sign, unless otherwise specified.
   (D)   Illumination and lighting.
      (1)   Externally lit signs shall be illuminated only with steady,
stationary, shielded light sources directed solely onto the sign without
causing glare, no unshielded lights, or lights directed upward or horizontally
at sign faces, flashing lights, scrolling or moving electronic lights, or other
distractive devices may be used in conjunction with any sign or business.
      (2)   Light bulbs or lighting tubes used for illuminating a sign shall
not be visible from adjacent public rights-of-way or residential properties.
Illumination by bare bulbs or flames is prohibited.
      (3)   External illumination for signs shall conform to all provisions of
outdoor lighting. Such lighting shall be treated as Class 1 lighting and shall
conform to the lamp and shielding restrictions and lumen caps.
      (4)   The fixtures used to illuminate signs shall not be directed toward
nearby residential properties.
      (5)   Internally illuminated signs are permitted in certain circumstances
as follows:
         (a)   Individual back-lit letters which are silhouetted against a
softly illuminated wall.

SITE PLAN REVIEW
§ 153.230 INTENT.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish uniform requirements for the
planning and design of developments within the city in order to achieve the
following objectives:
   (A)   To determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter;
   (B)   To apply provisions of this subchapter equitably and fairly;
   (C)   To promote the orderly development of the city;
   (D)   To prevent depreciation of land values;
   (E)   To ensure a consistent level of quality throughout the community;
   (F)   To ensure a harmonious relationship between new development and the
existing natural and manmade surroundings;
   (G)   To achieve the goals and recommendations of the city Master Plan; and
   (H)   To promote consultation and cooperation between applicants and the
city in order that applicants may accomplish their objectives in the
utilization of land, consistent with the public purposes of this chapter and
the Master Plan.
(Prior Code, § 5.115) (Ord. 822, passed 10-19-2020)
§ 153.231 APPLICABILITY.
   Site plan review shall be required, as applicable, under the following
conditions, or under other circumstances required by the City of Charlevoix
Zoning Ordinance or other applicable law, unless exempted by §
153.232.
   (A)   Level “A” review. The Zoning Administrator shall review site plans in
connection with the creation of a use or the erection of a building or
structure in any of the following circumstances:
      (1)   Any use permitted by right within any zoning district, if the
proposed building is less than 2,000 square feet;
      (2)   Additions to existing buildings in any zoning district; provided,
the addition is not larger than 20% of the area of the building prior to the
expansion or more than 2,000 square feet in area, whichever is less;
      (3)   Changes in the use of any existing building in any zoning district;
provided, the use is permitted by right in that zoning district; and
      (4)   When, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator, a project which
otherwise qualifies for level “A” site plan review may have a significant
impact on surrounding properties or the city, the Zoning Administrator may, at
their sole discretion, submit the site plan to the Planning Commission for
review. In such cases, the Planning Commission shall follow the review
procedure for level “B” site plans and may require any additional information
needed to make an informed decision.
   (B)   Level “B” review. The Planning Commission shall act upon all site
plans, other than those provided for level “A” review, in connection with the
creation of a use or the erection of a building or structure in any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   Any “permitted” use within any zoning district occupying a building
of 2,000 square feet or more;
      (2)   Any special use in any district;
      (3)   Any planned unit development;
      (4)   Any site plan on a waterfront parcel. A waterfront parcel is a
parcel of land, or a portion thereof, abutting a water body; and
      (5)   As otherwise required by this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 5.116) (Ord. 791, passed 3-19-2018; Ord. 822, passed 10-19-2020)
§ 153.232 EXEMPTIONS.
   Site plan review shall not be required for:
   (A)   Developments, expansions, or additions to existing uses within the
Charlevoix City Airport.
   (B)   Single- or two-family dwellings on a lot on which there exists no
other principal building or use or for any home occupation or accessory
building in a single-family residential district.
(Prior Code, § 5.117) (Ord. 822, passed 10-19-2020)
§ 153.233 SITE PLAN REVIEW PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The Charlevoix Zoning Administrator and/or planner shall have the
authority to conduct a pre-application meeting with the applicant/developer to
assist them in understanding the site plan review process and other subchapter
requirements; and to provide insight as to what portions of their proposed
development may be of special concern to the Planning Commission.
   (B)   This conference is not mandatory, but is recommended for small and
large projects alike. For large projects, a pre-application conference should
be held several months in advance of the desired start of construction. Such an
advance conference will allow the applicant/developer time to prepare the
needed information for the Planning Commission to make a proper review.
(Ord. 822, passed 10-19-2020)
§ 153.234 SITE PLAN REVIEW PROCEDURES.
   The process for reviewing the site plan shall be as follows:
   (A)   Site plan and level "A" reviews shall be performed by the Zoning
Administrator as follows:
      (1)   Two copies of a complete site plan and an electronic version, in a
format specified by the city, shall be submitted along with an application for
that purpose and a fee, as established by the City Council.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall review the site plan for
completeness.
      (3)   If the site plan is found to be incomplete, the Zoning
Administrator shall return the site plan to the applicant with a list of items
needed to make the site plan complete.
      (4)   Once the site plan is determined to be complete, the Zoning
Administrator shall notify and seek comment from other city departments as
applicable. A review by all the applicable departments will be held within 14
days. A report will be drafted by the Zoning Administrator stating a synopsis
of the proposal and how the proposal relates to the zoning ordinance standards.
      (5)   The Zoning Administrator shall consider the site plan, any comments
received and the applicable standards of this subchapter and shall either
approve the site plan, as submitted, if all applicable requirements and the
standards of §
153.237 have been met; approve the site plan with conditions; or deny approval
of the site plan, if applicable requirements and standards have not been met.
      (6)   The reasons for the Zoning Administrator's action, along with any
conditions that may be attached, shall be stated in writing and provided to the
applicant.
      (7)   If approved, two copies of the final site plan shall be signed and
dated by the Zoning Administrator and the applicant. One copy, along with the
digital version, shall be kept on file with the city and one copy shall be
returned to the applicant or their designated representative. If the plan is
approved with conditions, a revised plan shall be submitted reflecting those
conditions and signed by the applicant and Zoning Administrator prior to the
issuance of any permits.
   (B)   Site plan and level "B" reviews shall be performed by the Planning
Commission as follows:
      (1)   Two copies of a complete site plan and an electronic version, in a
format specified by the city, shall be submitted along with an application for
that purpose and a fee, as established by the City Council.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall review the site plan for
completeness.
      (3)   If the site plan is found to be incomplete, the Zoning
Administrator shall return the site plan to the applicant with a list of items
needed to make the plot plan or site plan complete.
      (4)   Once the site plan is determined to be complete, the Zoning
Administrator shall notify and seek comment from other city departments as
applicable. A review by all the applicable departments will be held within 14
days. A report will be drafted by the Zoning Administrator stating a synopsis
of the proposal and how the proposal relates to the zoning ordinance standards.
      (5)    The applicant will then submit 11 copies of the complete (revised)
site plan; two full size, nine 11 inches by 17 inches and an electronic
version, in a format specified by the city.
      (6)   The Zoning Administrator shall transmit the site plan and report to
the Planning Commission for consideration at its next meeting that meets the
noticing requirements. Comments, if any, from the public, city departments and
consultants shall be transmitted to the Planning Commission prior to its review
of the plan. Where required by the City of Charlevoix Zoning Ordinance or other
applicable law, notice shall be given to all persons to whom real property is
assessed within 300 feet of the property that is the subject of the request and
to the occupants of all structures within 300 feet of the subject property
regardless of whether the property or structure is located in the zoning
jurisdiction, and a public hearing held.
      (7)   The Planning Commission shall consider the site plan and shall
either approve the site plan, as submitted, if all applicable requirements and
standards have been met; approve the site plan with conditions; or deny the
site plan if applicable requirements and standards have not been met. The
Planning Commission review shall be based on the requirements of this chapter,
comments received from city departments and consultants, and, specifically, the
review standards of §
153.237.
      (8)   If approved, two copies of the site plan shall be signed and dated
by the Planning Commission chairperson and the applicant. One copy, plus the
digital copy, shall be kept on file with the city and one copy shall be
returned to the applicant or their designated representative. If the plan is
approved with conditions, a revised plan shall be submitted reflecting those
conditions and signed by the applicant and the Planning Commission chairperson,
prior to the issuance of any permits.

§ 153.237 STANDARDS FOR SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   A site plan shall be approved or approved with conditions, only upon a
finding of compliance with the following standards:
   (A)   The site plan must comply with all standards of this section and all
applicable requirements of this chapter, as well as with all other applicable
city, county, state and federal laws and regulations.
   (B)   The site must be designed in a manner that is harmonious, to the
greatest extent possible, with the character of the surrounding area.
   (C)   The site must be designed to minimize hazards to adjacent property and
to reduce the negative effects of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes and glare to the
maximum extent possible.
   (D)   The site plan does not have a negative impact on the provisions of
human services, housing, transportation needs, and access to food in the
community.
   (E)   The site plan protects the natural environment and conserves natural
resources and energy to the extent possible in light of the proposed
development.
   (F)   Unless a more specific design standard is required by the city through
a different ordinance or regulation, all uses and structures subject to site
plan review shall comply with the following design standards:
      (1)   Traffic circulation.
         (a)   The site plan shall comply with the applicable zoning district
requirements for minimum floor space, height of building, lot size, yard space,
density and all other requirements as set forth in the City of Charlevoix
Zoning Ordinance, unless otherwise provided.
         (b)   Vehicular and pedestrian circulation. Safe, convenient,
uncontested, and well-defined vehicular and pedestrian circulation shall be
provided for ingress/egress points and within the site. A pedestrian
circulation system shall be provided and shall be as insulated as completely as
reasonably possible from the vehicular circulation system. The number, location
and size of access and entry points, and internal vehicular and pedestrian
circulation routes shall be designed to promote safe and efficient access to
and from the site, as well as circulation within the site. In reviewing traffic
features, the number, spacing and alignment of existing and proposed access
points shall be considered relative to their impact on traffic movement on
abutting streets and adjacent properties.
         (c)   Walkways from parking areas to building entrances.
            1.   Internal pedestrian walkways shall be developed for persons
who need access to the building(s) from internal parking areas and shall be
designed to provide access from these areas to the entrances of the building(s)
            2.   The walkways shall be designed to separate people from moving
vehicles.
            3.   These walkways shall have a minimum width of five feet with no
car overhang or other obstruction.
            4.   The walkways must be designed in accordance with the Michigan
Barrier Free Design Standards.
            5.   The walkways shall be distinguished from the parking and
driving areas by use of any of the following materials: special pavers, bricks,
raised elevation or scored concrete. Other materials may be used if they are
appropriate to the overall design of the site and building and acceptable to
the review authority.
      (2)   Storm water. Storm water retention and drainage systems shall be
designed so the removal of surface water will not adversely affect neighboring
properties or public storm water drainage systems. Unless impractical, storm
water shall be removed from all roofs, canopies and paved areas by an
underground surface drainage system. Low impact design solutions such as rain
gardens and green roofs are encouraged. The proposed project will meet the City
of Charlevoix Storm Water Ordinance. Applicants are required to submit a
grading and drainage plan, demonstrating stormwater can be contained and
managed on the subject property if no municipal stormwater system exists. If a
municipal stormwater system exists, the Director of Public Works or consulting
engineer representing the city shall review the grading and drainage plan to
determine if the existing infrastructure can adequately handle the stormwater
runoff. Applicants may be required to install stormwater management features to
mitigate impacts to the municipal stormwater system.
      (3)   Snow storage. Proper snow storage areas shall be provided so to not
adversely affect neighboring properties, vehicular and pedestrian clear vision,
and parking area capacity.
      (4)   Landscaping. The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state,
insofar as practical, by minimizing unnecessary tree and soil removal. Any
grade changes shall be in keeping with the general appearance of neighboring
developed areas. Provision or preservation of landscaping, buffers or
greenbelts may be required to ensure the proposed uses will be adequately
buffered from one another and from surrounding property.

impractical due to engineering difficulties.
      (8)   Exterior uses. Exposed storage areas, machinery, heating and
cooling units, service areas, loading areas, waste storage areas, utility
buildings and structures, and similar accessory areas shall be located to have
a minimum negative effect on adjacent properties and shall be screened, if
reasonably necessary, to ensure compatibility with surrounding properties.
      (9)   Emergency access. All buildings and structures shall be readily
accessible to emergency vehicles.
      (10)   Water and sewer. Water and sewer installations shall comply with
all city specifications and requirements.
      (11)   Signs. Permitted signs shall be located to avoid creating
distractions, visual clutter and obstructions for traffic entering or exiting a
site.

permitted but, due to unique operational characteristics, may not be desirable
or compatible in all locations within the district. Factors such as traffic,
hours of operation, noise, odor or similar potential nuisance effects require
that the special use be evaluated relative to its appropriateness on a case-by-
case basis. This article establishes the review procedure for special uses and
the general standards that must be met for all special uses. In addition, more
specific standards and requirements, as found in §§
153.140 through

Commission.
(Prior Code, § 5.137)
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS (PUDS)
§ 153.270 INTENT.
   The Planned Unit Development (PUD) District is established as an optional
development tool to permit flexibility in the regulation of land development;
to encourage innovation in land use, form of ownership and variety of design,
layout and type of structures constructed; to achieve economy and efficiency in
the use of land; to preserve significant natural, historical and architectural
features and open space; to promote efficient provision of public services and
utilities; to minimize adverse traffic impacts; to provide better housing,
employment and business opportunities particularly suited to residents; to
encourage development of convenient recreational facilities; and to encourage
the use and improvement of existing sites when the uniform regulations
contained in other zoning districts alone do not provide adequate protection
and safeguards for the property and surrounding areas. It is the further intent
of the PUD regulations to promote a higher quality of development than can be
achieved from conventional zoning requirements in furtherance of the vision and
goals of the adopted City Master Plan.
(Prior Code, § 5.140)
§ 153.271 QUALIFYING CONDITIONS.
   (A)   In order to qualify for PUD approval, the project must satisfy the
conditions of this section.
   (B)   It is the applicant’s responsibility to demonstrate in writing that
each of the following criteria is, or will be, met by the proposed PUD.

         (g)   Coordinated development of multiple small parcels; or
         (h)   Infill development and/or removal or renovation of blighted
buildings, sites or contamination clean-up.
      (2)   Size. Each PUD shall contain a minimum of 21,780 square feet;
provided sites containing less than 21,780 square feet may be considered for
rezoning to PUD, if the Planning Commission determines that the site will
advance the purposes of the PUD District. When determining the appropriateness
of areas less than the applicable minimum required, the Planning Commission
shall determine that:
         (a)   Rezoning the area to PUD will not result in a significant
adverse effect upon nearby or adjacent lands;
         (b)   The proposed uses will complement the character of the
surrounding area;
         (c)   The purpose and qualifying conditions of the PUD District can be
achieved within a smaller area; and

NON-CONFORMITIES
§ 153.290 INTENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that there exists within zoning districts certain
lots, buildings, structures and uses which were lawful before this chapter was
passed or amended, but are now prohibited, regulated or restricted under the
terms of this chapter. It is the intent to permit these legal non-conformities
to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival.
   (B)   Non-conforming lots, buildings, structures and uses are declared by
this chapter to be incompatible with the provisions of the districts in which
they are located. It is the intent of this chapter that these non-conformities
shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, except as otherwise permitted
in this subchapter, nor be used as grounds for adding other buildings,
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the district.
   (C)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the
plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual
construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building construction has been
diligently conducted.
   (D)   Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted as authorization for, or
approval of, the continuance of the use of a structure or premises in violation
of the zoning regulation in effect at the time of the adoption of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 5.150)
§ 153.291 NON-CONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   (A)   Where a legally established lot of record in existence at the time of
adoption or amendment of this chapter does not meet the minimum requirements
for lot width or lot area, the lot of record may be used for any permitted or
special land use in the district in which the lot is located; provided that,
any building or structure constructed on the lot complies with all other
requirements for the zoning district, except as subject to the following:
      (1)   Required minimum front and rear yard setbacks and the maximum
building height limitations shall be met as required in the zoning district in
which the lot is located.
      (2)   The required minimum side yard setback for a lot which is non-
conforming by reason of lot width shall be 10% of the width of the non-
conforming lot, but in no event shall the required minimum side yard setback
for such a non-conforming lot be less than five feet on each side.
   (B)   If two or more vacant lots of record or a combination of lots and
portions of lots of record in existence at the time of the passage of this
chapter, or an amendment thereto, with continuous frontage and under single
ownership do not meet the requirements established for lot width or lot area,
the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the
purposes of this chapter, and no portion of that parcel shall be used or
divided in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area
requirements established by this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 5.151)
§ 153.292 NON-CONFORMING USES.
   (A)   A non-conforming use shall not be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land or building area than was occupied at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
   (B)   No part of any non-conforming use shall be moved unless that movement
eliminates or reduces the non-conformity.
   (C)   If a non-conforming use is abandoned for any reason for a period of
more than 12 months, any subsequent use shall conform to the requirements of
this chapter. A non-conforming use shall be determined to be abandoned if one
or more of the following conditions exists, and which shall be deemed to
constitute an intent on the part of the property owner to abandon the non-
conforming use:
      (1)   Utilities, such as water, gas and electricity to the property, have
been disconnected;
      (2)   The property, buildings and grounds have fallen into disrepair;
      (3)   Signs or other indications of the existence of the non-conforming
use have been removed;
      (4)   Equipment or fixtures necessary for the operation of the non-
conforming use have been removed; and
      (5)   Other actions which, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator,
constitute an intention on the part of the property owner or lessee to abandon
the non-conforming use.
   (D)   A non-conforming use may be changed to another non-conforming use
provided all of the following determinations are made by the Zoning Board of
Appeals.
      (1)   The proposed use shall be as compatible or more compatible with the
surrounding neighborhood than the previous non-conforming use, considering
factors such as hours of operation, traffic, noise and similar external
impacts.
      (2)   The proposed non-conforming use shall not be enlarged or increased,
nor extended to occupy a greater area of land or building area than the
previous non-conforming use.
      (3)   That appropriate conditions and safeguards are provided that will
ensure compliance with the intent and purpose of this chapter.
   (E)   Uses consisting of lots occupied by storage yards, used car lots, auto
wrecking, junk yards, golf driving ranges, miniature golf courses and similar
open uses, where the only buildings on the property are ancillary to the open
use and where the use is non-conforming shall be subject to the following
restrictions, in addition to all other applicable provisions of this
subchapter.
      (1)   When a non-conforming use has been changed to a conforming use, it
shall not be used again for any other non-conforming use.
      (2)   Non-conforming open uses of land shall only be converted to a
conforming use.
      (3)   A non-conforming open use of land shall not be enlarged to cover
more land than was occupied by that use when it became non-conforming.
      (4)   When any non-conforming use is discontinued for a period of more
than six months, any future use of the land shall be limited to those uses
permitted in the zoning district under which the property is governed. Vacancy
and/or non-use of the land, regardless of the intent of the owner or tenant,
shall constitute discontinuance under this provision.
(Prior Code, § 5.152)
§ 153.293 NON-CONFORMING BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Where a lawful building or structure exists at the effective date of
this chapter, or an amendment thereto, that does not comply with the
requirements of this chapter because of restrictions such as lot area, lot
coverage, width, height or setbacks, that building or structure may continue to

         (d)   The application to reconstruct the non-conforming building or
structure shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator within six months of the
event in which the building or structure was damaged or destroyed.

and for any distance, it shall be moved to a location which complies with the
requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   None of the provisions of this section are meant to preclude normal
repairs and maintenance on any non-conforming building or structure that would

Division Act (Public Act 288 of 1967, as amended, being M.C.L.A. §§ 560.101
through 560.293, formerly known as the Subdivision Control Act), to prevent the
creation of lots and parcels that do not comply with applicable city
ordinances, to minimize potential boundary disputes, to maintain the orderly
development of the city, and to otherwise protect the public health, safety and
general welfare of the residents and the present and future property owners of
the city. This shall be accomplished by regulating the division of existing
lots and parcels and the property transfer between two or more adjacent lots or
parcels. It is further the purpose of this chapter to prescribe the procedures
for the submission and review of proposed lot and parcel divisions and property
transfers, to authorize fees for the review of applications submitted under
this chapter and to provide penalties for violations of this chapter.

(Prior Code, § 5.304) (Ord. 680, passed 11-18-2002)
§ 154.05 PROCEDURE FOR DIVISION OR PROPERTY TRANSFER.
   The following procedure shall be followed to divide a lot, parcel or tract
of land or to effect a property transfer.
   (A)   The applicant shall submit an application to the Zoning Administrator
on a form supplied by the city for that purpose. The application shall include,
but not be limited to the following:
      (1)   Proof of ownership of the lot, parcel or tract of land to be
divided, or of the lots or parcels involved in a property transfer, which shall
include a copy of a warranty deed, land contract, title commitment or other
evidence satisfactory to the Zoning Administrator;
      (2)   The names and addresses of all persons having an interest in the
lot, parcel or tract of land to be divided, or of the lots or parcels involved
in a property transfer and a statement of the type of interest each holds;
      (3)   The history of the prior divisions of the parent parcel from which
the applicant’s parcel or tract of land came and proof that the applicant holds
the right to divide the parcel or tract of land proposed for division;
      (4)   A survey map of the land proposed to be divided or the land
involved in the property transfer prepared pursuant to the survey map
requirements of Public Act 132 of 1970, being M.C.L.A. §§ 54.211 to 54.213, as
amended, certified by a land surveyor licensed by the state. This survey map
shall depict all of the following:
         (a)   The dimensions of the lot, parcel or tract of land to be
divided, or the lots or parcels involved in a property transfer;
         (b)   The dimensions of the lots, parcels or tracts of land that will
result from the division or property transfer;
         (c)   The location of all current easements on the lot, parcel or
tract of land to be divided, or on the lots or parcels involved in a property
transfer;
         (d)   The location of all proposed utility and ingress/egress
easements on the lots, parcels or tracts of land that will result from the
division or property transfer;
         (e)   The location of all buildings and structures on the lot, parcel
or tract of land to be divided, or on the lots or parcels involved in a
property transfer;
         (f)   The distances between these buildings and structures and the
original property lines of the lot, parcel or tract of land to be divided, or
the lots or parcels involved in a property transfer; and
         (g)   The distances between these buildings and structures and the
property lines of the lots, parcels or tracts of land that will result from the
division or property transfer.
      (5)   In addition to providing the survey map, the applicant or his or
her representative shall accurately stake the boundaries of the lot, parcel, or
tract of land proposed to be divided or the lot or parcel involved in the
property transfer and the boundaries of the lots, parcels or tracts of land
that will result from the division or property transfer such that the Zoning
Administrator may, by use of a tape measure and horizontal measurements,
confirm that the boundaries as staked are as represented on the survey;
      (6)   Accurate legal descriptions of the lots, parcels or tracts of land
that will result from the division or property transfer. In the event the
Zoning Administrator is unable to determine whether the legal description is
accurate, he or she may require the applicant to obtain at applicant’s sole
expense legal descriptions of the lots, parcels or tracts of land that will
result from the division or property transfer certified by a registered land
surveyor licensed by the state;
      (7)   The Applicant shall submit documentation that each such resulting
lot, parcel or tract of land has or will have adequate permanent access, as
defined in
Chapter 153 of this code of ordinances, as amended. In addition, if the lot,
parcel or tract of land that will result from the division or property transfer
will be a development site, then the applicant shall submit evidence
establishing adequate easements for public utilities from each such resulting
lot, parcel or tract of land to existing public utility facilities; and
      (8)   Such other documentation that the Zoning Administrator may require
relating to the application to divide a lot, parcel or tract of land or to
effect a property transfer.
   (B)   The application shall be accompanied by an application fee as
established and set forth in a city fee schedule. This fee schedule shall also
establish “after the fact” fees that must be paid when an otherwise lawful
division or property transfer occurs, but without first complying with the
procedural requirements of this chapter. This “after the fact”
   (C)   Within 45 days after receiving the information required in division
(A) above, the Zoning Administrator shall decide whether to approve or
disapprove the proposed division or property transfer. If the Applicant fails
to provide all the information required by this chapter, then the application
shall be deemed incomplete and may be denied on that basis. The Zoning
Administrator’s decision to approve the division or property transfer shall be
made pursuant to the standards contained in §
154.06 of this chapter. The Zoning Administrator may grant conditional approval
of an application, subject to the applicant obtaining any necessary variances
from the Zoning Board of Appeals pursuant to §
154.08 of this chapter. If the Zoning Administrator fails to grant approval of
a proposed division or property transfer, written reasons for his or her
decision shall be given to the applicant. The applicant shall then have the
option of resubmitting information for approval to the Zoning Administrator or
appealing the Zoning Administrator’s decision to the Zoning Board of Appeals
pursuant to §
154.09 of this chapter.
   (D)   Upon approval of a proposed division or property transfer, the Zoning
Administrator shall send a letter indicating such approval to the applicant
with a copy to the county's Equalization Department. This letter shall contain
the following statement: “Pursuant to Section 109a of the Land Division Act, as
amended, the City of Charlevoix, its officers and employees are not liable if a
building permit is not issued for a parcel less than one (1) acre in size that
resulted from an approved division under the City of Charlevoix Parcel Division
Ordinance.” A copy of this letter shall be retained by the Zoning Administrator
in his or her official records.
   (E)   Because zoning requirements may change over time, any approval of an
application for a division or property transfer by the Zoning Administrator
under division (C) above shall expire and a new approval required after 90 days
from the date of the approval, unless the applicant records in the county's
Register of Deeds Office an instrument(s) of conveyance documenting the
division or property transfer and files a copy of that recorded instrument(s)
with the Zoning Administrator.

Appendix A: City of Charlevoix Storm Water Ordinance Design Standards
PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES, AND ADMINISTRATION
§ 155.001 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to supplement Michigan Public Act 451 of
1994, as amended, for the more stringent regulation of storm water discharges
originating within the city; to provide a set of regulations for storm water
management; and to provide rules and guidelines to facilitate enforcement
thereof.
(Ord. 810, passed 11-18-2019)
§ 155.002 OBJECTIVES.
   The objective of this chapter is to accomplish, among other things, the
following:
   (A)   To manage storm water runoff resulting from earth changes occurring
within the City of Charlevoix, both during and after development.
   (B)   To ensure that future development provides measures to manage the
quantity and quality of storm water runoff originating from the property so
that surface water and groundwater quality is protected and flooding potential
is reduced.
   (C)   To preserve and use the natural drainage system for receiving and
conveying storm water runoff and to minimize the need to construct enclosed,
below grade storm drain systems.
   (D)   To preserve natural infiltration and the recharge of groundwater and
to maintain subsurface flows which replenish lakes, streams and wetlands.
   (E)   To ensure that storm water management systems are incorporated into
site planning at an early stage of the planning and design process.
   (F)   To minimize the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, ditches, streams, lakes, wetlands and storm water management
facilities which are the result of inadequate storm water control.
   (G)   To reduce long-term expenses and remedial projects which are caused by
uncontrolled storm water runoff.
   (H)   To encourage the design and construction of storm water management
systems which serve multiple purposes, including but not limited to flood
prevention, water quality protection, wildlife habitat preservation, education,
recreation and wetlands protection.
   (I)   To minimize the impact of development on downstream properties and to
preserve the biological and structural integrity of existing watercourses.
   (J)   To allow for off-site storm water management facilities and measures
if such proposals meet the requirements of these regulations.
   (K)   To assure that all storm water management facilities will be properly
designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with a uniform set of
standards.
   (L)   To provide for enforcement of this chapter and penalties for
violations.
(Ord. 810, passed 11-18-2019)
§ 155.003 ORDINANCE ADMINISTRATION.
   The City of Charlevoix shall designate an enforcing agent (“agent”) to

agreement with Charlevoix County which will permit the Charlevoix County Soil
Erosion and Sedimentation Control Officer to be the agent for this chapter.
(Ord. 810, passed 11-18-2019)
§ 155.004 EXCLUSIVE STORM WATER REGULATION PROVISION.
   To the extent that this storm water ordinance is in conflict with any
previously adopted ordinance within the city, the intent is to have this storm
water ordinance supersede any other storm water regulations that may have been
previously adopted or included as a portion of other local ordinances or zoning
provisions. If any conflicts arise, the city shall either repeal or amend such
other ordinances to make this chapter the exclusive regulation.

(Ord. 810, passed 11-18-2019)
§ 155.031 PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.
   For purposes of this chapter, a storm water management (SWM) permit for
regulated activities as identified in §
155.030 is required before any earth changes commence. The SWM permit
requirements are independent of any other regulations governing the proposed
earth change, such as soil erosion regulations or zoning requirements, which
may require additional permitting through other enforcing agencies. The
granting of a SWM permit shall authorize only such earth changes for which the
permit has been issued, and shall not be deemed to approve any development as a
whole, or any other land use activities.
(Ord. 810, passed 11-18-2019)
§ 155.032 PERMIT APPLICATION SUBMITTAL.
   (A)   An application for a SWM permit shall be submitted on the form
provided by the agent, signed by the landowner or his/her duly authorized
agent, and shall include a storm water management plan, prepared in accordance
with §§
155.055 through
155.057, along with the appropriate permit and review fees, prior to being
considered by the agent as an administratively complete application. The agent
may request additional storm water management plans or supporting documentation
at his/her discretion during the permit review process.
   (B)   The application for a SWM permit shall be made, reviewed and approved
prior to the start of any earth change including construction of access roads,
driveways, grubbing or grading. Permit approval shall be given prior to the
initiation of any work activity. Any unauthorized work shall be considered a
violation of this chapter subject to enforcement actions under §§
155.100 through
155.102 regardless of any later actions taken toward compliance. Soil test
borings including those utilizing reasonable backhoe test excavation,
vegetative cutting for land surveys, percolation tests and normal maintenance
shall not be considered a start of work under these regulations.
(Ord. 810, passed 11-18-2019)
§ 155.033 PLAN PREPARATION BY A REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL.
   Following the calculation of pre- and post-development (or increase in
development) stormwater runoff, if 100% of this increased storm water will not
be retained on-site in a stormwater retention basin, the storm water management
plan shall be prepared by a registered professional as defined by this chapter.
The agent may waive this requirement for regulated activities on a single
family dwelling site when the agent finds that, considering the size, location,
or natural discharge of the stormwater runoff, a storm water management plan is
not reasonably required to accomplish the objectives of this chapter.
(Ord. 810, passed 11-18-2019)
§ 155.034 SEQUENTIAL APPLICATIONS
   (A)   On development proposals which are so large or complex that a storm
water management plan encompassing all phases of the project cannot reasonably
be prepared prior to initial ground breaking, an application for a sequential
SWM permit, based on successive major incremental earth change activities may
be allowed. Requests for sequential applications shall be approved by the agent
prior to submittal of the initial SWM permit application.
   (B)   Approval of sequential applications shall take place in two phases.

costs of the application review, or if the agent determines that review of the
application and/or participation in the review process by qualified
professional planners, engineers, attorneys, or other professionals is
necessary or advisable, then the applicant shall deposit with the agent such
additional fees in an amount determined by the agent equal to the estimated
additional costs. The additional fees shall be held in escrow in the
applicant’s name and shall be used solely to pay these additional costs. If the
amount held in escrow becomes less than 10% of the initial escrow deposit or
less than 10% of the latest additional escrow deposit and review of the
application is not completed, then the agent may require the applicant to
deposit additional fees into escrow in an amount determined by the agent to be
equal to the estimated costs to complete the review. Failure of the applicant
to make any escrow deposit required under this chapter shall be deemed to make
the application incomplete thereby justifying the denial of the application.
Any unexpended funds held in escrow shall be returned to the applicant
following final action on the application. Any actual costs incurred by the
agent in excess of the amount held in escrow shall be billed to the applicant
and shall be paid by the applicant prior to the release of a final decision on
the application.

APPEALS
§ 155.115 CREATION OF APPEALS BOARD.
   An Appeals Board is hereby created which shall consist of five members. The
membership and organizational structure of the Appeals Board shall be
determined by the City. When discharging its duties under this chapter, the
Appeals Board shall comply with all requirements of the Open Meetings Act,
being Act 267 of the Public Acts of 1976, as amended. The Appeals Board Clerk
shall be responsible for providing all required notices for Appeals Board
hearings and for taking the minutes of the Appeals Board hearings.
(Ord. 810, passed 11-18-2019)
§ 155.116 RIGHT OF APPEAL.
   Any person aggrieved by the action or inaction of the agent related to this
chapter may appeal to the Appeals Board. Such appeal shall be made in writing
and shall be filed with the Appeals Board Clerk within 30 calendar days of the
decision that is being appealed. Any appeal that is not filed in a timely
manner shall be dismissed by the Appeals Board. The written appeal shall state
the order, requirement, decision, or determination that is being appealed, the
sections of this chapter that relate to the appeal, and those facts relevant to
the appeal, which support the basis for the appellant’s claim.
(Ord. 810, passed 11-18-2019)
§ 155.117 APPEALS PROCESS.
   Upon receipt of an appeal, the Appeals Board Clerk shall direct the agent to
transmit to the Appeals Board a summary report of all previous action taken on
the subject of the appeal, a copy of any permits issued, and the appellant’s
written statement. The Appeals Board will then adhere to the following general
process:
   (A)   Within 15 calendar days of receiving a completed application, the
Appeals Board Clerk shall schedule a hearing date before the Appeals Board. The
Appeals Board Clerk shall send a written notice specifying the time, date, and
place of the Appeals Board hearing to the appellant and to all land owners
within 300 feet of the subject parcel and shall publish a copy of the hearing
notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the city where the subject
property is located. The notice shall be mailed and published no less than 15
days before the scheduled hearing. The Appeals Board shall hold the hearing
within 60 calendar days from receipt of a completed application.
   (B)   The appellant shall deposit with the Appeals Board Clerk when the
appeal is filed the required fee, as specified in the fee schedule adopted
under §
155.039(A) of this chapter. The fee shall be used to cover the cost of handling
said appeal including compensation for Appeals Board members and associated
administrative costs.
   (C)   If the Appeals Board Clerk determines that the basic fee will not
cover the actual costs of the appeal, then the appellant shall deposit with the
Appeals Board Clerk such additional fees in an amount determined to be equal to
the estimated additional costs, including costs which may be incurred by the
agent. The additional fees shall be held in escrow in the appellant’s name and
shall be used solely to pay these additional costs. If the amount held in
escrow becomes less than 10% of the initial escrow deposit or less than 10% of
the latest additional escrow deposit and the appeal is not completed, the
Appeals Board Clerk may require the appellant to deposit additional fees into
escrow in an amount determined to be equal to the estimated costs to complete
the appeal. Failure of the appellant to make any required deposits shall be
deemed to make the appeal incomplete thereby justifying denial of the appeal.
Any unexpended funds held in escrow shall be returned to the appellant
following final action on the appeal. Any actual costs incurred in excess of
the amount held in escrow shall be billed to the appellant and shall be paid by
the applicant prior to the release of a final decision on the appeal.
   (D)   The Appeals Board may affirm or reverse, wholly or in part, a decision
of the agent. In deciding an appeal, the Appeals Board shall determine:
      (1)   Whether the agent properly interpreted and applied this chapter in
making the decision.
      (2)   Whether the specific situation has circumstances that warrant a
variance from the standards of this chapter. Where the Appeals Board has
determined that a variance from the standards of this chapter may be warranted,
the Board may grant the appellant a variance from any design standard, setback,
or other provision contained within this chapter, provided that such variance
complies with the following general standards:
         (a)   The variance will not adversely impact adjacent property owners
or downstream properties in any material way.
         (b)   The variance is necessary to grant the appellant substantial
relief from a hardship that would otherwise be imposed by strict enforcement of
this chapter.
         (c)   The variance granted is the minimum deviation from the
requirements of this chapter necessary to do substantial justice to the
appellant. The Appeals Board may include such conditions or limitations on any
variance issued to ensure that granting the relief requested will not
substantially prevent, nor result in less, effective management of storm water
runoff.
         (d)   Granting of the variance would not knowingly be in conflict with
other regulatory requirements.
         (e)   The need for the variance is due to circumstances that are
unique to the property in question and not due to any act or omission of the
property owner, a prior property owner, or a past or present occupant of the
property.
   (E)   The decisions of the Appeals Board shall in all instances be final
administrative decisions, shall be in writing, and shall include specific
findings of fact by the Board, and further, shall be subject to such judicial
review as by law may be provided.
(Ord. 810, passed 11-18-2019)
REVISIONS
§ 155.130 REVISIONS.
   The agent shall review this chapter at least biannually, and make
recommendations for amendments if needed. The recommendations of the agent
shall be transmitted to the legislative body of the City of Charlevoix.

APPENDIX A
City of Charlevoix Storm Water Ordinance Design Standards
Temporary Storm Water Management Standards
   (A)   Temporary storm water management facilities shall be installed by the
applicant and inspected by the agent before grading, filling or grubbing is
initiated.
   (B)   Where permanent storm water management facilities, such as detention
or retention basins are proposed for use during construction as a temporary
storm water management measure, the construction sequence and grading plan
shall be designed for the proper and effective implementation of these
facilities.
   (C)   Temporary storm water management measures shall be maintained
throughout the duration of the earth change, including the later stages of
development. Maintenance activities may include, but are not limited to removal
of accumulated sediment, structural repairs, and reseeding or replacement of
temporary vegetative covers.
   (D)   Temporary storm water management facilities shall be designed in
accordance with the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy
(EGLE) Best Management Practices (BMP) Guide Book for Michigan Watersheds.
   (E)   At a minimum, during construction all regulated earth changes shall be
required to provide temporary storm water management that either contains the
volume of runoff generated from a 10-year, 24-hour design storm on-site for all
disturbed area, or to provide silt fencing or other permeable barriers that
will manage the flow of storm water discharging off-site, diffusing it and
releasing it at reduced velocities, where such discharge will not adversely
impact downstream properties.
Permanent Storm Water Management Standards - General
   (A)   Storm Water Management Plan Preparation.
      (1)   For regulated activities on sites that exceed one acre, the agent
may require the Storm Water Management Plan is prepared by a registered
professional as defined by this chapter.
      (2)   For regulated activities on sites that exceed one acre, the agent
may request that the submitted site plan be reviewed by one or more registered
professionals contracted by the agent. The costs incurred for such review(s)
shall be the responsibility of the applicant. The applicant shall deposit with
the agent such fees in an amount determined by the agent equal to the estimated
costs. The fees shall be held in escrow in the applicant’s name and shall be
used solely to pay these costs. If the amount held in escrow becomes less than
10% of the initial escrow deposit or less than 10% of the latest additional
escrow deposit and review of the application is not completed, then the agent
may require the applicant to deposit additional fees into escrow in an amount
determined by the agent to be equal to the estimated costs to complete the
review. Failure of the applicant to make any escrow deposit required under this
chapter shall be deemed to make the application incomplete, thereby justifying
denial of the application. Any unexpended funds held in escrow shall be
returned to the applicant following final action on the application. Any actual
costs incurred in excess of the amount held in escrow shall be billed to the
applicant and shall be paid by the applicant prior to the release of a final
decision on the application.
      (3)   If the applicant disputes the agent’s need for outside professional
assistance in the review of the submitted plans, or the professional(s)
selected, the applicant has the right to appeal the agent’s decision to the
Appeals Board, who shall be responsible for making the final decision.
   (B)   On-site storm water management facilities which minimize adverse
impact to downstream properties shall be required for all sites unless a
proposal for off-site storm water management has been approved. Storm water
management facilities may include, but are not limited to: retention basins/
ponds, detention basins/ponds, wet basins, storm water treatment units,
controlled outfall structures, and rain gardens or other bio-filtration
systems.
   (C)   The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality “Urban Stormwater
Best Management Practices Manual” will be used as a reference as well as the
following manuals: “Controlling Urban Runoff” by the Metropolitan Washington
Council of Governments; “Designing Stormwater Quality Management Practices” by
the University of Wisconsin, Madison; and the “Design of Stormwater Filtering
Systems” by the Center for Watershed Protection.
   (D)   Retention and detention basins shall have an emergency overflow
system. The overflow system shall be designed to accommodate flow from a 100-
year storm event, or as otherwise required by the appropriate State of Michigan
agency.
   (E)   If the storm water facilities for a 50-year storm cannot discharge to
a stream, lake or wetland without causing scouring, flooding or pollution on
site or downstream, then the basin shall be designed to hold or infiltrate
storm water from a 100-year, 24-hour frequency storm event.
   (F)   Sites that are located in areas serviced with a municipal storm
system, and that have the prior approval of the municipal system owner, may
discharge storm water to that system after it has been treated with an approved
separator system that removes 60% of sediments. The applicant shall be
responsible for all costs incurred to the municipal system to accommodate any
storm water discharged to the system from the site.
   (G)   The rainfall amounts for Charlevoix County shall be the numbers given
by the Natural Resources Conservation Service for a 24-hour duration and are as
follows: one-year storm equals 1.8 inches; two-year storm equals 2.2 inches;
five-year storm equals 2.7 inches; ten-year storm equals 3.0 inches; 25-year
storm equals 3.5 inches; 50-year storm equals 3.9 inches; 100-year storm equals
4.2 inches.
   (H)   The maximum grade for the side slopes of any storm water retention or
detention basin shall be no greater than 3:1 (horizontal to vertical) for
vegetated basins. Where, due to site limitations, this maximum side slope grade
cannot be met, the agent may grant an increase in the slope, provided
additional stabilization (beyond seed and mulch) is proposed.
   (I)   Storm water basins with permanent pools of water of three foot depth
or greater with side slopes steeper than one on six shall have one or more of
the following safety features:
      (1)   Safety ledges at the basin perimeter which are at least ten feet
wide.
      (2)   Aquatic vegetation surrounding the basin which discourages wading.
      (3)   Fencing to prevent unauthorized access to the basin.
   (J)   Storm water detention basins shall not be constructed in regulated
wetlands unless approved by the appropriate State of Michigan agency and/or the
Army Corps of Engineers.
   (K)   Storm water detention basins which impound five acres or more and have
a head of six feet or more shall meet dam construction permit requirements in
Part 315 of Act 451 of 1994, as amended, administered by the Michigan
Department of Environmental Quality.
   (L)   Whenever possible, a created wetland or other bio-filtration area
shall be incorporated into storm water management facilities to assist removal
of soluble pollutants that cannot be removed by conventional settling. Sediment
carried off by runoff shall be required to settle out prior to discharge into
the created wetland or other bio-filtration area.
   (M)   Storm water management basins designed for retention, detention or
infiltration shall be isolated from septic systems and water wells by 50 feet
or more. Variations in the required setback may be granted by the Health
Department of Northwest Michigan prior to the issuance of a Charlevoix County
Storm Water Management Permit.
   (N)   New fueling stations will be required to install an approved separator
system for sites that discharge storm water off-site. Existing fueling stations
that are modifying more than 25% of their existing impervious surfaces will be
required to install an approved separator system if they discharge storm water
off-site.
Retention Basin Design
   (A)   Small projects in areas that have less than one-half (0.5) acre of
impervious surface shall be allowed to have runoff retention stored at two
inches of runoff from all impervious surface areas in lieu of detailed
hydrologic calculations.
   (B)   At a minimum, retention basins created in soils with permeability
greater than 1.3 inch per hour shall have the storage capacity to hold the
increase in runoff volume generated by the earth change.
      (1)   The required volume shall be calculated by comparing the
undeveloped conditions for a two-year, 24-hour frequency storm event to the
developed condition for a 25-year, 24-hour frequency storm event. Soil
permeability rates are listed in the following table:
 
Soil Texture & Structure                             Permeability (Inches/Hour)
Coarse sand and medium sand                          6 or more
Fine sand and loamy sand                             3 - 6
Sandy loam                                           2 - 3
Loam, sandy clay loam                                1.3 - 2
Clay loam, silt loam, clays, silts, muck, peat, marl Less than 1.3
 
         The retention basin shall be designed to drain within 72 hours.
   (C)   At a minimum, retention basins, which are created in soils with
permeability less than 1.3 inch per hour, shall be designed to store runoff
from back-to-back 50-year, 24-hour rainfall events.
Detention Basin Design Standards
   (A)   When using the Natural Resource Conservation Service Method, the
volume of a detention pond is to be calculated based upon a 50-year, 24-hour
storm with the developed site conditions and with an allowable outflow of a
ten-year, 24-hour storm based upon the pre-existing site conditions or 10% of
the flow rate calculated by the 50-year developed site conditions analysis.
[The TR-55 program does not accept lower values than 10% of the developed
rate.]
   (B)   The allowable peak discharge rate from a permanent storm water
management measure may be a staged rate. The maximum allowable peak discharge
rate shall not exceed the peak discharge rate from the project site prior to
the proposed development for all of the following 24-hour storm events: two-
year, five-year, ten-year, 25-year, and 50-year. In no event shall the
discharge exceed the ability of the downstream condition to convey the flow
without damage to abutting properties.
   (C)   All sites with greater than one acre of impervious surface will
require the detention outflow to be directed to approved storm systems or have
the approval of adjacent property owners, with documented easements, or one can
release at a two-year before construction rate if it can be determined that
there is not a flooding hazard on the adjacent property. Low porosity in the
soils in the area of discharge and depressions in the land would be examples of
reasons to deny detention out-flowing at a two-year rate. Sites that have three
acres or more of parking area must in addition have an approved separator
system to remove impurities before discharging to the detention/retention pond
or install an approved treatment forebay.
Storm Water Separator Design Standards
   (A)   Approved separators are to remove a minimum of 60% of sediments.
   (B)   Treatment forebay criteria - the treatment forebay is designed to
store the “first flush” of pollutants typically found in urban storm water
runoff, and to capture initial flush pollutant loads.
      (1)   The treatment forebay shall be a wet basin or approved structure
with an impermeable bottom and sides to the design high water level.
      (2)   Sizing - the treatment forebay shall be sized to store the water
quality volume (Vwq) defined as one-half (0.5) inch of runoff from the directly
connected impervious area. This volume can be included in the overall flood
control volume.
      (3)   The minimum required water quality volume is given by the equation:
         Vwq = 1815 A 1
         Where:   Vwq   =   Water quality volume (cft)
            1815   =    0.5 inch of runoff x 3,630 to convert ac-in to cft
            A   =   Contributing drainage area (ac)
            1   =   Percent impervious expressed as a ration
      (4)   Capacity for the water quality volume shall be provided above the
normal water level.
      (5)   The overflow structure from the treatment forebay shall be sized
for the peak inflow from the design rainfall event.
      (6)   The top-of-berm elevation between the treatment forebay and the
infiltration basin shall be a minimum of one foot below the outer berm
elevation.
      (7)   The treatment forebay shall have a minimum one-foot-deep sump below
the inlet pipe for sediment accumulation.
      (8)   The outlet structure from the treatment forebay shall be designed
to draw water from the central portion of the water column with the forebay to
trap floatables and contain sediments. The top of the inlet structure shall be
located a minimum of one foot below the normal water level, and the invert
shall be a minimum of one and one-half (1.5) feet above the bottom of the
treatment forebay.
      (9)   Material - treatment forebays shall be lined with impermeable
materials extending up to the design high water elevation. A minimum 18-inch-
thick clay layer, or an impermeable liner protected with a minimum of 12 inches
of soil cover are acceptable alternatives. Maximum allowable permeability shall
be 0.0001417 inch/hour as determined by a geotechnical engineer for clay
placement, or manufacturer’s certificate for line products.
Underground Storm Water Management Facilities
   (A)   If the use of storm water retention or detention basins, either on-
site or off-site is not feasible and the permeability of the soils is greater
than 1.3 inch per hour, the installation of underground drainage systems (catch
basins / manholes with open bottoms with stone and/or run(s) of perforated
piping) may be allowed if they provide for detention or retention volumes as
stated in these Charlevoix County Storm Water Ordinance guidelines. The
perforated piping and dry basin structure(s) cannot be considered to provide
for any outflow when calculating volumes for the detention system design. All
underground drainage systems must provide the following:
      (1)   Catch basins or separator systems, sediment basins, silt traps for
storm water flowing to the underground drainage system.
      (2)   An approved overflow system.
      (3)   Adequate provisions for maintenance.
   (B)   The required detention volume may be reduced by the agent by an amount
not to exceed 50% if rain gardens are implemented and demonstrate the ability
to accommodate an equivalent amount of storm water.
