resolution shall designate the sum to be raised by taxation for the general

obligation during the fiscal year. The Council, upon the written recommendation
of the City Manager, and by the affirmative vote of not less than five of its
members, may appropriate unappropriated funds or transfer any unencumbered
appropriation balance, or any portion thereof, from any budget item or account,

purpose to be financed by the proceeds of a bond issue or from special
assessments, the Council shall make an appropriation of the proceeds of such
bond issue or special assessment therefor.

general account. Instead, the necessary amount of the appropriation from such
account shall be transferred to the appropriate budget item or account and the
expenditure then charged thereto. The Clerk shall be responsible for the

shall file with the Council a schedule of all encumbrances upon the budget
appropriations existing at the end of the fiscal year, with his recommendations
thereon, and the Council shall provide for the payment of such thereof as
constitute valid claims against the city from corresponding budget items from

required for other appropriations or obligations of the city. Such accounts
shall be continuing accounts and the balances therein at the end of each fiscal
year shall remain a part thereof.

unencumbered balance or any part thereof into one or more of the accounts

as set forth in subsection (A) hereof, shall be used only at the direction of
the Council, and only for the purpose provided in the original ordinance
establishing such account, unless their use for some other municipal purpose be
authorized by a majority vote of the electors of the city who vote on the
proposition to amend such ordinance to provide for a change in the use of the
moneys in such account. After the purpose of any such account has been
fulfilled, any balance remaining therein may be transferred by the Council to
any other special account or to the general fund of the city.
   (E)   Moneys which are accumulated for the purpose of purchasing equipment,
as set forth in subsection (A) hereof, shall be expended only for the purpose

designate some other officer having knowledge of the accounts of the city to
countersign in lieu of the Treasurer.

subsequently be required by law, the majority of its members shall sign a
certificate to the effect that the same is the assessment roll of the city for
the year in which it has been prepared, as approved by the Board of Review,
which certificate, when attached to any volume of the roll, shall constitute a
conclusive presumption of the validity of the entire roll, as provided in
Section 8.6 of this chapter. In the event that the Board of Review shall fail
or refuse to so review the assessment roll of the city, such roll, as prepared
and presented to the Board of Review by the Assessor, shall be the assessment
roll for the year for which it was prepared, and shall stand as though it had
been certified by the Board of Review.

ending the last day of the meeting of the Board of Review, it shall be the
assessment roll of the city for county, school, and city taxes, and for other
taxes on real and personal property that may be authorized by law. It shall be
presumed by all courts and tribunals to be valid, and shall not be set aside,
except for cause set forth by law.
SECTION 8.13. CLERK TO CERTIFY LEVY.
   Within three days after the adoption of the budget for the ensuing year, the
Clerk shall certify to the Assessor the total amount which the Council
determines shall be raised by general ad valorem taxation, together with such
other assessments and lawful charges and amounts which the Council requires to
be assessed, reassessed, or charged upon the city tax roll against property or
persons.
SECTION 8.14. CITY TAX ROLL.
   After the Board of Review has completed its review of the assessment roll,
the Assessor shall prepare a tax roll, to be known as the "City Tax Roll." Upon
receiving the certification of the several amounts to be raised, assessed, and
charged for city taxes, as provided in the preceding section, the Assessor
shall proceed forthwith: (1) to spread the amounts of the general ad valorem
tax according to and in proportion to the several valuations set forth in said
assessment roll, and (2) to place such other assessments and charges upon the
roll as are required and authorized by the Council. For convenience, the city
tax roll may be divided into two or more volumes. The city tax roll may be,
either, an independent tax roll, or may be a combination city tax roll and a
tax roll for state, county, school, and other taxes, charges and assessments.
Statutory reference:
   Avoidance of fractions, see M.C.L.A. § 211.39
SECTION 8.15. TAXES A DEBT AND LIEN.
   The taxes on real and personal property shall become a debt to the city from
the owner or person otherwise to be assessed, on the tax day provided by law.
The amounts assessed on any interest in real property shall become a lien upon
such real property on the first day of July following the said tax day and the
lien for such amounts, and for all interest and charges thereon, shall continue
until payment thereof. All personal taxes shall also be a first lien, prior,
superior, and paramount, on all personal property of persons so assessed from
and after the first day of July following the said tax day and shall so remain
until paid. Said tax liens on personal property shall take precedence over all
other claims, encumbrances, and liens, upon said personal property whatsoever,
whether created by chattel mortgage, title retaining contract, execution, or
upon any other final process of a court, attachment, replevin, judgment or
otherwise. No transfer of personal property assessed for taxes shall operate to
divest or destroy such lien, except where such property is actually sold in the
regular course of retail trade.
SECTION 8.16. TAX ROLL CERTIFIED FOR COLLECTION.
   After spreading the taxes and placing other assessments and charges upon the
roll, the Assessor shall certify the tax roll, and attach his warrant thereto
directing and requiring the Treasurer to collect, prior to March first of the
following year, from the several persons named in the roll the several sums
mentioned therein opposite their respective names as a tax, charge, or
assessment. Said warrant shall grant to and vest in the Treasurer, all the
statutory power and immunities possessed by township treasurers for the

   City taxes shall be due and payable on August thirty-first of each year.
SECTION 8.18. TAXES DUE – NOTIFICATION THEREOF.
   The Treasurer shall not be required to make personal demand for the payment
of taxes but, upon receipt of the city tax roll, he shall, forthwith, mail a
tax statement to each person named in the tax roll, which mailed statement
shall be a sufficient demand for the payment of all taxes assessed. Neither the
failure on the part of the Treasurer to mail such statement nor the failure of
any person to receive the same, shall invalidate the taxes on the tax roll or
release any person or property assessed from the liabilities provided in this
Charter in case of nonpayment.
SECTION 8.19. TAX PAYMENT SCHEDULE.
   The Council shall provide by ordinance, a tax payment schedule and the
amount of collection charges and interest to be added to taxes, charges, and
assessments on the city tax roll. When so added, such collection charges and
interest shall be treated in all respects as an item of taxes and collected as
such. If delinquent city taxes are collected by returning the same to the
County Treasurer, then all charges and assessments on the tax roll, and any
collection charges and interest thereon, which remain unpaid at the time the
delinquent tax roll is returned to the County Treasurer shall be treated in all
respects as an item of taxes and shall be included with the city taxes spread
upon such roll and shall be collected by the County Treasurer in like manner as
delinquent taxes are collected on delinquent tax rolls returned to County
Treasurers under the general property tax act.
SECTION 8.20. FAILURE OR REFUSAL TO PAY PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX.
   If any person shall neglect or refuse to pay any tax on personal property
assessed to him, the Treasurer shall collect the same by seizing any personal
property of such person, to an amount sufficient to pay such tax, together with
any charges and interest added thereto, wherever the same may be found in the
State. No property shall be exempt from such seizure. He may sell the property
seized, to an amount sufficient to pay such tax, together with any charges and
interest added thereto, wherever the same may be found in the State. No
property shall be exempt from such seizure. He may sell the property seized, to
an amount sufficient to pay the taxes and all charges, fees, penalties, and
interest, in accordance with statutory provisions. The Treasurer may also sue
the person to whom a personal property tax is assessed, in accordance with the
powers granted him by law.
Statutory reference:
   Failure or refusal to pay tax, see M.C.L.A. § 211.47
SECTION 8.21. STATE, COUNTY, AND SCHOOL TAXES.
   For the purpose of assessing and collecting taxes for state, county, and
school purposes, the city shall be considered the same as a township, and all
provisions of law relative to the collection of, and accounting for, such taxes
and the penalties and interest thereon shall apply. For the purpose of
collecting state, county, and school taxes, the Treasurer shall perform the
same duties and have the same powers as township treasurers under state law.
Statutory reference:
   Mandatory that Charter provide for levy, collection and return of state,
county and school taxes, see M.C.L.A. § 117.3(i)
SECTION 8.22. PROTECTION OF CITY LIEN.
   The city shall have power, insofar as the exercise thereof shall not
conflict with or contravene the provisions of law, to acquire such interest in
any premises within the city, by purchase at any tax or other public sale, or
by direct purchase from or negotiation with the State of Michigan or the owner,
as may be necessary to assure to the city the collection of its taxes, special
assessments, charges and any interest thereon which are levied against any lot
or parcel of real property or to protect the lien of the city therefor, and may
hold, lease, or sell the same. Any such procedure exercised by the city to
assure the collection of its taxes or the protection of its tax or other liens
shall be deemed to be for a public purpose. The Council may adopt any ordinance
which may be necessary to make this section effective.
Statutory reference:
   Return of delinquent taxes, see M.C.L.A. §§ 211.55 et seq.
SECTION 8.23. COLLECTION OF DELINQUENT TAXES.
   All taxes, assessments, and charges upon real property on the tax roll,
together with collection charges and interest added thereto, remaining
uncollected by the Treasurer on the first day of March following the date when
the roll was received by him shall be subject to one of the following
procedures:
   (1)   The real property against which such taxes, assessments, and charges
are assessed shall be subject to disposition, sale, and redemption for the
enforcement and collection of the tax lien against the same in the method and
manner which may be provided by ordinance. The Council may provide by ordinance
the procedure for the sale and redemption of real property for such unpaid
taxes, assessments, and charges, together with collection charges and interest
added thereto, by judicial sale on petition filed in behalf of the city. Such
procedure shall correspond substantially to the procedure provided by law for
the sale by the State of tax delinquent real property and redemption therefrom,
except that the acts performed by state and county officers shall be performed
by appropriate city officers and that city tax sales shall be held not less
than thirty nor more than ninety days prior to the dates of corresponding tax
sales under the general law.
   (2)   If no ordinance is in effect pursuant to subsection (1) of this
section, such taxes, assessments, and charges, together with any collection
charges and interest added thereto, shall be returned to the County Treasurer,
to the extent and in the same manner and with like effect as provided by law
for returns by township treasurers of township and county taxes. The taxes,
assessments, and charges, together with any collection charges and interest
added thereto, thus returned shall be collected in the same manner as other
taxes returned to the County Treasurer are collected in accordance with law,
and shall be and remain a lien upon the property against which they are
assessed until paid.
Statutory reference:
   Return of delinquent taxes, see M.C.L.A. §§ 211.55 et seq.
SECTION 8.24. DISPOSITION OF REAL PROPERTY HELD BY CITY FOR TAXES.
   When the city has acquired any interest in property to protect the city's
tax lien thereon, the owner of any interest therein, by fee title, as
mortgagee, or as vendor or vendee under a land contract shall have the right to
purchase the city's interest therein, upon payment to the city of the amount of
money which the city has invested therein in the form of taxes, special
assessments, charges, fees, penalties, interest, and costs and expenses paid by
the city to acquire and protect its interest in such property. After the lapse
of 90 days after the date the city acquired title to any such property, the
Council may remove the same from the market by determining that such property
is needed for and should be devoted to public purposes, naming such purposes,
or may sell the same at a price which shall be not less than its market value,
as determined and certified to the Council by the Assessor or by 2 competent
real estate appraisers selected by the Council.
CHAPTER 9. SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS
SECTION 9.1. GENERAL POWER RELATIVE TO SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
   The Council shall have the power to make public improvements within the
city. As to public improvements which are of such a nature as to benefit

assessment roll;
      (8)   If, under item (4) above, the determination is to proceed
determining the probable life of the improvement, finally fixing the special

assessment roll therefor: Provided, That, if prior to the adoption of the
resolution to proceed with the making of the public improvement, written
objections thereto have been filed by the owners of property in the district
which, according to the City Manager's report, will be required to bear more
than fifty percent of the cost thereof, or by a majority of the owners of
property to be assessed, no resolution determining to proceed with the
improvement shall be adopted while such objections remain, except by the
affirmative vote of five members of the Council.
      (9)   Publication of notices required by this section shall be given in a
newspaper published in the city and by first class mail addressed to the owners
of the property to be affected according to the current assessment roll of the

SECTION 9.5. LIMITATION ON SUITS AND ACTIONS.
   No suit or action of any kind shall be instituted or maintained for the
purpose of contesting or enjoining the collection of any special assessment or
additional special assessment, (1) unless, within thirty days after the
confirmation of the special assessment roll, written notice be filed with the
Clerk of intention to file such suit or action, stating the grounds on which it
is claimed such assessment is illegal, and (2) unless such suit or action shall
be commenced within ninety days after the confirmation of the roll.
SECTION 9.6. LIEN AND COLLECTION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
   Upon the confirmation of each special assessment roll, the special
assessments thereon shall become a debt to the city from the persons to whom
they are assessed and, until paid shall be a lien upon the property assessed

procedures for the collection of special assessments and all collection fees or
charges and interest which may have been added or accumulated thereto.
SECTION 9.7. SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ACCOUNTS.

SECTION 9.10. HAZARDS AND NUISANCES.
   When any lot, or premises, building or structure within the city, because of
age of dilapidation, the accumulation of refuse or debris, the uncontrolled
growing of noxious weeds, or because of any other condition or happening
becomes, in the opinion of the Council, a public nuisance or hazard which is
dangerous to the health, safety, or welfare of the inhabitants of the city or
of those residing or habitually going near such lot or premises, or such
building, or structure, the Council may, after investigation, give notice to
the owner or owners of the land upon which such nuisance or hazard exists or to
the owner or occupant of the land or the building or structure itself, by
posting notice upon the premises, by personal service, or by registered or
certified mail addressed to the address set forth in the current assessment
roll of the city, or the records of the Assessor, specifying the nature of the
nuisance or hazard and requiring such owner or occupant to alter, repair, tear
down, abate or remove the nuisance or hazard within a time to be specified by

hazard. If, at the expiration of the time limit in said notice, the owner has
not complied with the requirements thereof, or in any case where the owner of
the land or of the building or structure itself is not known or cannot be
found, the Council may order such nuisance or hazard to be abated by the proper
department or agency of the city which is qualified to do the work required, or
may do the work by contract or by hire, and the cost of such abatement may be
assessed against the lot, premises, or description of real property upon which
such nuisance or hazard is located, by special assessments which shall be due

CHAPTER 10. BORROWING POWER
SECTION 10.1. MUNICIPAL BORROWING POWER.
   (A)   Subject to the applicable provisions of law, the city may borrow money
for any purpose within the scope of its powers or which may be permitted by
law, and may issue bonds or other evidences of indebtedness therefor, which
shall include, but not be limited to the following types:
      (1)   General obligation bonds for the payment of which the full faith
and credit of the city is pledged;
      (2)   Special assessment bonds which are issued in anticipation of the
payment of special assessments for the purpose of defraying the cost of any one
or more public improvements, which bonds shall be both an obligation of the
special assessment district and a general obligation of the city;
      (3)   Revenue bonds as authorized by law;
      (4)   Tax anticipation notes, which may be issued in anticipation of the
collection of taxes for the current or next succeeding fiscal years of the
city, or any other year permitted by law, in the manner and subject to any
limitations provided by law;
      (5)   Mortgage bonds, as authorized by law, for the acquiring, owning,
purchasing, construction, improving, or operating of any public utility which
the city is authorized by law to finance in this manner;
      (6)   Bonds issued in anticipation of future payments from the Motor
Vehicle Highway Fund or any other fund of the State which the city may be
permitted by law to pledge for the payment of the principal and interest
thereof, which bonds, if the law so permits, may also be a general obligation
of the city[;]
      (7)   Water main extension bonds, in an amount not to exceed one percent
of the assessed valuation of all real and personal property in the city, for
the payment of which the full faith and credit of the city are pledged for the

imposed for water main extensions as buildings are connected with such
extensions, which bonds shall be payable in not more than thirty years, with
interest thereon at a rate which shall not exceed six percent per annum;
      (8)   Calamity bonds, issued in case of fire, flood, or other calamity
for the relief of the inhabitants of the city and for the preservation of
municipal property, in a sum not to exceed three-eights of one percent of the
assessed value of the real and personal property in the city, which shall
become due in not more than five years.
   (B)   Whenever any portion of public improvements shall be assessed by or
charged to the city at-large and the balance of such cost assessed against the
property benefitted, the Council may provide for the payment of the city's
portion of such cost in installments. In such case, bonds may be issued in
anticipation of the payment of the amount assessed against the city at-large,
the same as they may be issued in anticipation of the payment of the amount
assessed against the benefitted property[.] In such case, the Council shall
appropriate in each fiscal year an amount which is sufficient to pay the
principal of and interest on such bonds which are required to be paid during
that year. Such bonds may be included as a part of a total issue of bonds for
the public improvement to which they apply and need not be separated from bonds
issued in anticipation of the payment of special assessments assessed against
the benefitted property.
   (C)   Bonds may be issued in anticipation of the collection of special
assessments levied with respect to two or more public improvements, but no
special assessment district shall be required to pay the obligation of any
other special assessment district and the ordinance or resolution creating such
districts shall so provide.

such rolls shall be set apart in a separate fund and shall be used for the
purpose for which levied, and for the payment of the principal of and interest

deficiency in any special assessment fund to meet the payment of the principal
or interest to be paid therefrom, there shall be levied a tax upon the real and
personal property in the city for that purpose. Moneys may be advanced from the
general funds of the city to meet such deficiency, and shall be replaced in the
general funds when the special assessment fund shall be sufficient therefor.
   (E)   Each bond or other evidence of indebtedness shall contain on its face
a statement specifying the purpose for which the same is issued, and the
proceeds thereof shall not be used for any other purpose, except that, whenever
the proceeds of any bond issue, or a part thereof, remain unexpended and
unencumbered for the purpose for which said bond issue was made, the Council
may, by the confirming vote of not less than five members, authorize the use of
such unexpended and unencumbered funds:
      (1)   For the retirement of such bond issue, or
      (2)   If such bond issue has been fully retired, then for the retirement
of other bonds or obligations of the city provided for by this section:
Provided, That in the case of special assessment bonds, such funds shall be
refunded to the owners of property against which special assessments therefor
were made, or placed in the general fund of the city in accordance with the
provisions of Section
10.2 of this Charter, or
      (3)   For such other purposes as may be permitted by law, subject to the
proviso in paragraph (2) above; or
      (4)   If such funds cannot be so used, then in any manner approved by the
vote of not less than five members of the Council.
   (F)   No bond or other evidence of indebtedness, regardless of type or
purpose, shall bear interest at a rate exceeding that fixed by law.
   (G)   All bonds and other evidences of indebtedness shall be signed by the
Mayor and countersigned by the Clerk, under the seal of the city. Interest
coupons may be executed with the facsimile signatures of the Treasurer. A
complete and detailed record of all bonds and other evidences of indebtedness
shall be kept by the Treasurer. Upon the payment of any bond or other evidence
of indebtedness, the same shall be marked "Cancelled" or otherwise defaced by
the Treasurer to indicate payment. After all of the bonds of any issue have
been paid, they may be destroyed by cremation, with a proper certificate of
such destruction filed in the office of the Clerk.

personal property in the city: Provided, That, in computing such net bonded
indebtedness, there shall be excluded money borrowed under the provisions of
Section
10.1.(A), clauses (2), (3), and (4) of this chapter, and any other bonds which
are not, by law, subject to the debt limitation of the city. The resources of

outstanding bonds which are subject to the debt limitation here established,
shall also be deducted from the amount of the bonded indebtedness.
   (B)   No bonds shall be sold to obtain funds for any purpose other than that
for which they were specifically authorized, and if such bonds are not sold

void except when delay is caused by litigation or when a bond issue has been
authorized by the electors to be issued in two or more parts or series. In case
of litigation, the three year period shall start at the time of the filing of

business dealings with the city changes at any time, he shall file a statement
thereof, which shall be spread upon the proceedings of the Council and
published as herein required. Approval of any such business dealings shall
require a concurring vote of at least five members of the Council, not
including any member who is disqualified under Section 4.6(K) of this Charter.
Any business dealings made in violation of this section shall be void.

civil infraction violation of the same requirements or provision: committed by
a person within any 6 month period (unless some other period is specifically

declared to be unlawful or an offense by this Code or any ordinance, and any
omission or failure to act where the act is required by this Code or any
ordinance.
      (3)   Each day on which any violation of this Code or any ordinance
continues constitutes a separate offense and shall be subject to penalties or
sanctions as a separate offense.
      (4)   In addition to any remedies available at law, the city may bring an
action for an injunction or other process against a person to restrain, prevent
or abate any violation of this Code or any city ordinance.
   (C)   When the performance of any act is prohibited by this Code or any
other ordinance of the city, and no penalty for the violation of the Code or
other ordinance is imposed, either in a section of the ordinance or a portion

emergency medical and rescue services by the city, or by a private individual
or corporation operating at the request or direction of the city, to an
incident resulting in an accident involving a motor vehicle where one or more
of the drivers were operating the motor vehicle while under the influence of an

§ 2-208 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The city finds that a significant number of traffic arrests and traffic
accidents in the city involve drivers who operate a motor vehicle while under
the influence of alcoholic beverages or controlled substances. In addition, the
city finds that in traffic accidents involving drivers who were operating motor
vehicles while under the influence of alcoholic beverages or controlled
substances there is a greater likelihood of personal injury and property
damage. As a result of these determinations, a greater operational and
financial burden is placed upon the city's police, firefighting, rescue and
other services by persons who are operating a motor vehicle while under the
influence of alcoholic beverages or controlled substances.

§ 2-209 LIABILITY FOR EXPENSE.

in an emergency response.

operate a motor vehicle with the caution characteristic of a sober person of
ordinary prudence. Further, it shall be presumed that a person was operating a

imprisoned; iv) escaped from confinement; v) under supervised release; vi) on
medical furlough; vii) residing in a mental health facility or halfway house;

community service ordered by the court, or failed to pay any fine for that
conviction, by a fine of not more than $500, or both, as applicable. A court
may order a minor under this subsection to participate in substance use
disorder services as defined in § 6230 of the Public Health Code, 1978 PA 368,

probation. The terms and conditions of that probation include, but are not
limited to, the sanctions set forth in §
6-10(h)(3), payment of the costs including any minimum state costs, and the
costs of probation. If a court finds that an individual violated a term or
condition of probation or that the individual is utilizing a corresponding
provision in another court, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and
proceed as otherwise provided by law. If an individual fulfills the terms and
conditions of probation, the court shall discharge the individual and dismiss
the proceedings. Discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without
adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of this section or
for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon
conviction of a crime. An individual may obtain only one discharge or dismissal
under this section as to an individual or any corresponding provision of the
state law or local ordinance. In accordance with the corresponding provisions
of state law, the court shall maintain a nonpublic record of the matter while
proceedings are deferred and the individual is on probation under this section.
The court shall provide the Secretary of State with a record of the plea and
discharge under this section to allow the Secretary of State to retain and
disseminate a nonpublic record of a plea and of the discharge and dismissal
under the procedures established for the corresponding state law provision.
      (5)   A misdemeanor violation of §
6-10(a) successfully deferred, discharged and dismissed under §
6-10(h)(4) is considered a prior judgment for the purposes of § 6-10(h)(3).
      (6)   As used in this section, PRIOR JUDGMENT means a conviction,
juvenile adjudication, finding of responsibility, or admission of
responsibility for any of the following, whether under a law of this state, a

of Appeals to a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Act No. 306 of the
Public Acts of 1969, as amended, shall act as a stay upon an order,

ARTICLE IV. MARIHUANA ESTABLISHMENTS
§ 15-75 PROHIBITION OF MARIHUANA ESTABLISHMENTS.
   (A)   Pursuant to the provisions of § 6.1 on the Michigan Regulation and
Taxation of Marihuana Act (the “Act’), Marihuana establishments, as defined by
the Act, are completely prohibited with the boundaries of the City of
Charlotte.
   (B)   Any applicant for a state or local license to establish a marihuana
establishment, as defined by the Act, within the boundaries of the city shall
be deemed to be not in compliance with this subchapter or with the Code of
Ordinances amended by this subchapter.
   (C)   This section does not supersede rights and obligations with respect to
the transportation of marihuana through the city to the extent provided by the
Act, and does not supersede rights and obligations under the Michigan Medical
Marihuana Act, the Medical Marihuana Licensing Act, 2016 PA 281, or any other
law of the State of Michigan allowing for or regulating marihuana for medical
use.
(Ord. 2018-02, passed 4-8-2019)
§ 15-76 MEDICAL MARIHUANA CAREGIVER REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Intent. It is the intent of this section to give effect to the intent
of the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act, Initiated Law 1 of 2008, MCL 333.26421
et seq. (hereinafter "Act") as approved by the electors. These provisions are
designed to recognize the fundamental intent of the Act to allow the creation
and maintenance of a private and confidential patient-caregiver relationship to
facilitate the statutory authorization for the limited cultivation, storage,
distribution and use of marihuana for medical purposes; and to regulate this
fundamental intent in a manner that does not conflict with the Act. By
permitting the operations of registered primary caregivers as a home
occupation, rather than in a commercial setting, this promotes the Act's
purpose of ensuring that a registered primary caregiver is not assisting more
than the five qualifying patients permitted in the Act with their medical use
of marihuana, and a registered primary caregiver does not unlawfully expand its
operations beyond five qualified patients, so as to become an illegal
commercial operation in the nature of a marihuana collective, cooperative, or
dispensary.
   (B)   Remainder of article; effect of permit approval. In recognition of the
unique nature of the medical marihuana caregiver as a home occupation provided
for hereunder, the conditions and requirements set forth in Chapter 82, §
82-107 for home occupations shall not be applicable to medical marihuana home
occupations.
   (C)   Regulations. The following standards and requirements shall apply to
the location at which the medical use of marihuana is conducted by a primary
caregiver.
      (1)   The medical use of marihuana shall comply at all times with the
MMMA and the MMMA General Rules, as amended.
      (2)   A registered primary caregiver shall not possess marihuana, or
otherwise engage in the medical use of marihuana, in a school bus, on the
grounds of any preschool or primary or secondary school, or in any correctional
facility.
      (3)   Not more than two registered primary caregivers, who shall also be
full-time residents of the dwelling, shall be permitted to operate at any one
property.
      (4)   The medical use of marihuana shall be conducted entirely within a
dwelling or attached garage, except that a registered primary caregiver may
keep and cultivate, in an "enclosed, locked facility" (as that phrase is
defined by the MMMA), up to 12 marihuana plants for each registered qualifying
patient with whom the registered primary caregiver is connected through the
registration process established by the Department of Licensing and Regulatory
Affairs, and up to 12 additional marihuana plants for personal use, if the
primary caregiver is also registered as a qualifying patient under the MMMA.
      (5)   A sign identifying the home occupation by word, image or otherwise,
or indicating that the medical use of marihuana is taking place on the
premises, shall not be permitted; nor shall any vehicle having such a sign be
parked anywhere on the premises.
      (6)   Except for lighting, heating, watering, drying or other equipment,
or fertilizers, herbicides or other chemicals directly related to the medical
use of marihuana, no other materials or equipment not generally associated with
normal ownership, use, and maintenance of a dwelling shall be permitted.
      (7)   Distribution of marihuana or use of items in the administration of
marihuana shall not occur at or on the premises of the primary caregiver. A
qualifying patient shall not visit, come to, or be present at the residence of
the primary caregiver to purchase, smoke, consume, obtain or receive possession
of any marihuana.
      (8)   Except for the primary caregiver, no other person shall deliver
marihuana to the qualifying patient.
      (9)   No one under the age of 18 years shall have access to medical
marihuana.
      (10)   No on-site consumption or smoking of marihuana shall be permitted
within the dwelling (or on the property) of a primary caregiver, except for
lawful medical marihuana consumption by the primary caregiver if registered as
a qualifying patient under the MMMA.
      (11)   Medical marihuana shall not be grown, processed, handled or
possessed at the dwelling of the primary caregiver beyond that which is
permitted by law.
      (12)   All necessary building, electrical, plumbing and mechanical
permits shall be obtained for any portion of a building or structure in which
equipment and devices that support the cultivation, growing or harvesting of
marihuana are located or used.
      (13)   If marihuana is grown or located in a room with windows, all
interior lighting shall be shielded to prevent ambient light from creating a
distraction for adjacent properties.
      (14)   Related merchandise or products shall not be sold or distributed
from the dwelling or property of the primary caregiver, apart from the
permitted quantity of medical marihuana.
      (15)   To ensure compliance with all applicable requirements and laws,
the portion of a building or other structure, such as a cultivation room, where
energy use and heating requirements exceed typical residential limits and
chemical storage occurs, are subject to inspection and approval by the zoning
administrator or other authorized official.
      (16)   The property, dwelling and all enclosed, locked facilities shall
be available for inspection upon request by the zoning administrator, building
official or law enforcement official.
   (D)   Permit required. The operations of a registered primary caregiver, as
a home occupation, shall be permitted only with the prior issuance of a City of
Charlotte permit.
      (1)   A complete and accurate application shall be submitted on a form
provided by the city and an application fee in an amount determined by
resolution of the City Council shall be paid.
      (2)   The permit application shall include the name and address of the
applicant; the address of the property; proof, such as a driver's license,
voter registration card or similar record showing that the dwelling is the
applicant's full-time residence; a current state registration card issued to
the primary caregiver; a full description of the nature and types of equipment
which will be used in marihuana cultivation and processing; and a description
of the location at which the use will take place. The zoning administrator may
require additional information necessary to demonstrate compliance with all
requirements. The zoning administrator shall review the application to
determine compliance with this section, the MMMA and the MMMA General Rules. A
permit shall be granted if the application demonstrates compliance with this
section, the MMMA and the MMMA General Rules.
      (3)   The use shall be maintained in compliance with the requirements of
this section, the MMMA and the MMMA General Rules. Any departure shall be
grounds to revoke the permit and take other lawful action. If a permit is
revoked, the applicant shall not engage in the activity unless and until a new
permit is granted.
      (4)   Information treated as confidential under the MMMA, including the
primary caregiver registry identification card and any information about
qualifying patients associated with the primary caregiver, which is received by
the city, shall be maintained separately from public information submitted in
support of the application. It shall not be distributed or otherwise made
available to the public and shall not be subject to disclosure under the
Freedom of Information Act.
      (5)   It is unlawful to establish or operate a for-profit or nonprofit
marihuana dispensary, collective or cooperative within the city, even if such
use is intended for the medical use of marihuana.
      (6)   The use of the dwelling or other permitted facility of a qualifying
patient to cultivate medical marihuana in accordance with the MMMA, solely for
personal use, does not require a permit under this subsection; however, all
applicable state and city ordinance requirements must be met.
      (7)   The provisions of this subsection do not apply to the personal use
and/or internal possession of marihuana by a qualifying patient in accordance
with the MMMA, for which a permit is not required.
   (E)   Enforcement. Any violation of this section shall be considered a civil
infraction.

§ 15-80 PURPOSES AND INTENT.
   (A)   The purpose of this subarticle is to exercise the police, regulatory,
and land use powers of the city by licensing and regulating cannabis operations
to the extent permissible under state law and regulations and to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city and those
within the city boundaries.
   (B)   The city finds that the activities described in this subarticle are
significantly connected to the public health, safety, security, and welfare of
its residents and therefore necessary to regulate and enforce safety, security,
fire, police, health, and sanitation practices related to such activities and
also to provide a method to defray administrative costs incurred by such
regulation and enforcement.
   (C)   The city further finds and declares that economic development,
including job creation and training, increase and productive land use, and the
protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of city neighborhoods and
residents are public purposes.
It is not the intent of this subarticle, except as may be required or permitted
by law or regulation, to diminish, abrogate, or restrict the protections for
medical use of cannabis found in the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act (“MMMA”).
   (D)   The city adopts this subarticle:
      (1)   To implement certain provisions of the Medical Marihuana Facilities
Licensing Act, PA 281 of 2016, and certain provisions of the Michigan
Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act, Initiated Law 1 of 2018, to protect
the public health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city by setting
forth the manner in which specific cannabis operations may be operated within
the jurisdiction of the city.
      (2)   To establish this subarticle pertaining to the regulation of
cannabis operations consistent with state law and regulations. Nothing in this
subarticle purports to permit activities that are otherwise illegal under state
or local law or expressly prohibited by this subarticle.
      (3)   Further, this subarticle:
         (a)   Prohibits within the jurisdiction of the city all cannabis
activities, operations, licenses, facilities, establishments, and business not
expressly permitted under this subarticle, including those licenses under the
MRTMA and the MMFLA, except those activities expressly permitted under the
Michigan Marihuana Act (“MMMA”), as amended.
         (b)   Provides for and limits the location and type of cannabis
operations, facilities, and establishments licensed under the MMFLA and MRTMA
and Department licensees within the jurisdiction of the city.
         (c)   Provides for and regulates and controls cannabis operations,
Department licensees, for the commercial retail sale, processing, secure
transportation, and safety compliance testing of cannabis, as set forth herein,
and for purposes of implementing specific licensure provided under the Medical
Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act and Michigan Regulation and Taxation of
Marihuana Act, where such activities will have minimal detrimental impact.
         (d)   To protect public health and safety through reasonable
limitations on cannabis operations, Department licensees, and commercial
operations, and limitations upon other cannabis related activities provided
under the MMFLA and MRTMA, as they relate to noise, odor, and water quality,
neighborhood safety, security for the cannabis operation and its personnel, and
other health and safety concerns.
         (e)   To provide fees to defray and recover the costs to the city of
the administrative, fire, and police costs associated with cannabis operations,
and permitted cannabis activities as provided under the MMFLA and MRTMA, as
permitted under this subarticle.
      (4)   This subarticle authorizes the establishment of specific cannabis
operations, facilities and establishments within the city, consistent with the
provisions of the MMFLA and MRTMA, and with regulations enacted by the
Department, and subject to the following:
         (a)   Nothing in this subarticle is intended to promote or condone the
commercial cannabis cultivation and grow, processing, transportation, testing,
production, distribution, sale, or possession of cannabis in violation of any
applicable law.
         (b)   This subarticle is to be construed to protect the public over
cannabis operations and licensee interests. The operation of cannabis
operations is a revocable privilege and not a right in the city. There is no
property right for a person or establishment to engage in or obtain a license
to engage in cannabis as a cannabis facility, establishment, or cannabis
operation or enterprise within the jurisdiction of the city.
         (c)   All licensees and their employees and agents are assumed to be
fully aware of the law; the city shall not therefore be required to issue
warnings before issuing citations or other enforcement measures for violations
of this subarticle or any applicable city ordinance, regulation, or state law
or regulation.

and after it has been presented over the cable system. Any program material not
picked up within 60 days after its presentation on the cable system will be
considered to have been abandoned by the owner thereof. The city will not be

§ 32-5 MUNICIPAL ORDINANCE VIOLATIONS BUREAU.
   (A)   Bureau established. The city hereby establishes a Municipal Ordinance
Violations Bureau ("Bureau") as authorized under Public Act 236 of 1961, §
8396, being M.C.L.A. § 600.8396, to accept admissions of responsibility for
municipal civil infractions in response to municipal civil infraction violation
notices issued and served by authorized city officials, and to collect and
retail civil fines and costs as prescribed by this Code or any ordinance.
   (B)   Location; supervision; employees; rules and regulations. The Bureau
shall be located at City Hall, and shall be under the supervision and control
of the Treasurer. The Treasurer shall adopt rules and regulations for the
operation of the Bureau.
   (C)   Disposition of violations. The Bureau may dispose only of municipal
civil infraction violations for which a fine has been scheduled and for which a
municipal civil infraction violation notice (as compared with a citation) has
been issued. The fact that a fine has been scheduled for a particular violation
shall not entitle any person to dispose of the violation at the Bureau. Nothing
in this chapter shall prevent or restrict the city from issuing a municipal
civil infraction citation for any violation or from prosecuting any violation
in a court of competent jurisdiction. No person shall be required to dispose of
a municipal civil infraction violation at the Bureau and may have the violation
processed before a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The unwillingness of any
person to dispose of any violation at the Bureau shall not prejudice the person
or in any way diminish the person's rights, privileges and protection accorded
by law.
   (D)   Bureau limited to accepting admissions of responsibility. The scope of
the Bureau's authority shall be limited to accepting admissions of
responsibility for municipal civil infractions and collecting and retaining
civil fines and costs as a result of those having committed the offense or who
admits responsibility only with explanation, and in no event shall the Bureau
determine, or attempt to determine, the truth or falsity of any fact or matter
relating to an alleged violation.
   (E)   Municipal civil infraction violation notices. Municipal civil
infraction violation notices shall be issued and served by authorized city
officials under the same circumstances and upon the same persons as provided
for citations as provided in §
32-3(6) and (7)(a) of this chapter. In addition to any other information
required by this Code or other ordinance, the notice of violation shall
indicate the time by which the alleged violator must appear at the Bureau, the
hours during which the Bureau is open, the amount of the fine scheduled for the
alleged violation, and the consequences for failure to appear and pay the
required fine within the required time.
   (F)   Appearance; payment of fines and costs. An alleged violator receiving
a municipal civil infraction violation notice shall appear at the Bureau and
pay the specified fine and costs at or by the time specified for appearance in
the municipal civil infraction violation notice. An appearance may be made by
mail, in person, or by representation.
   (G)   Procedure where admission of responsibility not made or fine not paid.
If an authorized city official issues and serves a municipal civil infraction
notice and if an admission of responsibility is not made and the civil fine and
costs, if any prescribed by the schedule of fines for the violation are not
paid at the Bureau, a municipal civil infraction citation may be filed with the
district court and a copy of the citation may be reserved by first-class mail
upon the alleged violator at the alleged violator's last known address. The
citation filed with the court does not need to comply in all particulars with
the requirements for citations as provided by Public Act 236 of 1961, §§ 8705
and 8709, being M.C.L.A. §§ 600.8705 and 8709, but shall consist of a sworn
complaint containing the allegations stated in the municipal civil infraction
notice and shall fairly inform the alleged violator how to respond to the
citation.

prior to the issuance of any license by the City Clerk, such certification
shall be based upon a finding that the person making application for such
license is of good moral character.
   (C)   The phrase GOOD MORAL CHARACTER, when used in this chapter for the
purpose of licensing, shall be construed to mean the propensity on the part of
the person to serve the public in the licensed area in a fair, honest and open
manner.
   (D)   A judgment of guilt in a criminal prosecution or a judgment in a civil
action shall not be used, in and of itself, as proof of a person's lack of good
moral character. It may be used as evidence in the determination, and when so
used the person shall be notified and shall be permitted to rebut the evidence
by showing that at the current time he has the ability and is likely to serve
the public in a fair, honest and open manner, that he is rehabilitated or that
the substance of the former offense is not reasonably related to the occupation
or profession for which he seeks to be licensed.
   (E)   The following criminal records shall not be used, examined or
requested by the city in a determination of good moral character:
      (1)   Records of an arrest not followed by a conviction;
      (2)   Records of a conviction which has been reversed or vacated,
including the arrest records relevant to that conviction;
      (3)   Records of an arrest or conviction for a misdemeanor or a felony
unrelated to the person's likelihood to serve the public in a fair, honest and
open manner;
      (4)   Records of an arrest or conviction for a misdemeanor for the
conviction of which a person may not be incarcerated in a jail or prison.
   (F)   When a person is found to be unqualified for a license because of a
lack of good moral character or similar criteria, the person shall be furnished
by the City Clerk with a statement to that effect. The statement shall contain
a complete record of the evidence upon which the determination was based. The
person shall be entitled, as of right, to a rehearing on the issue before the
Council if he has relevant evidence not previously considered regarding his
qualifications.
(1993 Code, § 46-2)
Statutory reference:
   Similar provisions, see M.C.L.A. §§ 338.41 et seq.

§ 46-4 SAME – FEES.
   The fees for a solicitor's license shall be $5 per day, $10 per week, $25
per month, or $50 per year. This fee may be changed by resolution of the City
Council from time to time. No fee for a solicitor's license shall be so applied
as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce. In any case where a
license fee is believed by a licensee or applicant for a license to place an
undue burden upon interstate commerce, he may apply to the City Manager for an
adjustment of the fee so that it shall not be discriminatory, unreasonable or
unfair as to such commerce. Such application may be made before, at or within 6
months after payment of the prescribed license fee. The applicant shall, by
affidavit and supporting testimony, show his method of business and gross
volume or estimated gross volume of business and such other information as the
City Manager may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of
such undue burden on such commerce. The City Manager shall then conduct an
investigation, comparing the applicant's business with other businesses of like
nature, and shall make findings of fact from which he shall determine whether
the fee fixed for the solicitor's license is unfair, unreasonable or
discriminatory as to the applicant's business and shall fix as the license fee
for the applicant an amount that is fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory or,
if the fee has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and
above the fee so fixed. In fixing the fee to be charged, the City Manager shall
have the power to base the fee upon a percentage of gross sales or any other
method which will ensure that the fee assessed shall be uniform with that
assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not
exceed the fee as prescribed. Should the City Manager determine the gross sales
measure of the fee to be the fair basis, he may require the applicant to
submit, either at the time of termination of the applicant's business in the
city or at the end of each 3 month period, a sworn statement of the gross sales
and pay the amount of fee therefor, provided that no additional fee during any
1 license year shall be required after the licensee shall have paid an amount
equal to the annual license fee.
(1993 Code, § 46-4)
§ 46-5 RESIDENTIAL SOLICITING PROHIBITED.
   (A)   It is hereby declared to be the policy of the city that the occupants
of the residences in the city shall make the determination of whether
solicitors shall be, or shall not be, invited to their respective residences.
   (B)   Notice of the refusal of invitation to solicitors, to any residence,
shall be given on a weatherproof card, approximately three inches by four
inches in size, exhibited upon or near the main entrance door to the residence,
indicating the determination by the occupant, containing the applicable words,
as follows:
   "NO SOLICITORS INVITED"
   (C)   The card so exhibited shall constitute sufficient notice to any
solicitor of the determination by the occupant of the residence of the
information contained thereon.
(1993 Code, § 46-5)
§ 46-6 REGISTRATION REQUIRED.
   (A)   No person shall engage in canvassing within the city without first
registering with the City Clerk.
   (B)   The registration for a person engaged in canvassing shall contain the

(1993 Code, § 54-3) (Ord. 2015-02, passed 7-27-2015)
§ 54-4 SURVEY AND REPORT.
   (A)   Before the Council shall consider making any local public improvement,
the local public improvement contemplated shall be referred by resolution to
the City Manager, directing him to prepare a report which shall include
necessary plans, profiles, specifications and detailed estimates of cost, an
estimate of the life of the improvement, a description of the assessment
district and such other pertinent information as will permit the Council to
decide the cost, extent and necessity of the improvement proposed and what part
or proportion thereof should be paid by special assessments upon the property
especially benefitted and what part, if any, should be paid by the city at
large.
   (B)   The Council shall not finally determine to proceed with the making of
any local public improvement until such report of the City Manager has been
filed nor until after a public hearing has been held by the Council for the
purpose of hearing objections to the making of such improvement.
(1993 Code, § 54-4)
§ 54-5 DETERMINATION ON THE PROJECT; NOTICE; HEARING GENERALLY.
   (A)   After the City Manager has presented the report required in §
54-4 for making any local public improvement as requested in the resolution of
the Council and the Council has reviewed the report, a resolution may be passed
tentatively determining the necessity of the improvement, setting forth the
nature thereof, prescribing what part or proportion of the cost of such
improvement shall be paid by special assessment upon the property especially
benefitted and what part, if any, shall be paid by the city at large,
designating the limits of the special assessment district to be affected,
designating whether to be assessed according to frontage or other benefits,
placing the complete information on file in the office of the Clerk where the
information may be found for examination, and directing the Clerk to give
notice of public hearing on the proposed improvement, at which time and place
opportunity will be given interested persons to be heard.
   (B)   The notice of public hearing shall be given by 1 publication in a
newspaper published or circulated within the city and by first class mail
addressed to each owner of or person in interest in property to be assessed as
shown by the last general tax assessment roll of the city. The publication and
mailing shall be made at least 10 full days prior to the date of the hearing.
The hearing required by this section may be held at any regular, adjourned or
special meeting of the Council.
   (C)    The notice of hearing shall include a statement that appearance and
protest at the hearing is required in order to appeal the amount of the special
assessment to the state tax tribunal and shall describe the manner in which an
appearance and protest shall be made.
   (D)   An owner or party in interest or his agent may appear in person at the
hearing to protest the special assessment or shall be permitted to file his
appearance or protest by letter and his personal appearance shall not be
required.
   (E)   The City Council shall maintain a record of parties who appear to
protest at the hearing. If the hearing is terminated or adjourned for the day
before a party has been heard, a party whose appearance was recorded is
considered to have protested the special assessment in person.
(1993 Code, § 54-5)
§ 54-6 HEARING ON NEED.
   At the public hearing on the proposed improvement, all persons interested
shall be given an opportunity to be heard, after which the Council may modify
the scope of the local public improvement in such a manner as they shall deem
to be in the best interest of the city as a whole, provided that if the amount
of work is increased or additions are made to the district, then another
hearing shall be held pursuant to notice prescribed in §
54-5. If the determination of the Council shall be to proceed with the
improvement, a resolution shall be passed approving the necessary profiles,
plans, specifications, assessment district and detailed estimates of cost,
determining the probable useful life of the improvement, and directing the
Assessor to prepare a special assessment roll in accordance with the Council's
determination and to report the special assessment roll to the Council for
confirmation. If, prior to the adoption of the resolution to proceed with the
making of the public improvement, written objections thereto have been filed by
the owners of property in the district which, according to the City Manager's
report, will be required to bear more than 50% of the cost thereof or by a
majority of the owners of property to be assessed, no resolution determining to
proceed with the improvement shall be adopted while such objections remain,
except by the affirmative vote of 5 members of the Council.
(1993 Code, § 54-6)
§ 54-7 SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ROLL.
   The Assessor shall make a special assessment roll of all lots and parcels of
land within the designated district benefitted by the proposed improvement and
assess to each lot or parcel of land the proportionate amount benefitted
thereby. The amount spread in each case shall be based upon the detailed
estimate of the City Manager as approved by the Council.
(1993 Code, § 54-7)
§ 54-7.5 SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ROLL; HAZARDS AND NUISANCES.
   Pursuant to the provisions of §
2.1(B)(1) of the Charter, the assessor shall make a special assessment roll of
all lots and parcels of land within the City upon which hazards and nuisances
were found to have existed and for which the City incurred costs associated
with altering, repairing, tearing down, abating or removing the hazards and
nuisances. The assessment roll shall be prepared annually and shall list for
each lot and parcel the amount of such cost that has remained unpaid for at
least 30 days.
(Ord. 2010-03, passed 8-9-2010)
§ 54-8 FILING ASSESSMENT ROLL.

Council for review and certification by it.
(1993 Code, § 54-8)
§ 54-9 MEETING TO REVIEW SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ROLL; OBJECTIONS.
   Upon receipt of the special assessment roll as required in this chapter, the
Council, by resolution, shall accept such assessment roll and order it to be
filed in the office of the Clerk for public examination, shall fix the time and
place the Council will meet to review such special assessment roll and direct
the Clerk to give notice of a public hearing for the purpose of affording an
opportunity for interested persons to be heard. Such notice shall be given by 1
publication in a newspaper published or circulated within the city and by first
class mail addressed to each owner of or person in interest in property to be
assessed as shown by the last general tax assessment roll of the city. The
publication and mailing are to be made at least 10 full days prior to the date
of the hearing. Such notice shall meet all requirements of §
54-5. The hearing required by this section may be held at any regular,
adjourned or special meeting of the Council. At this meeting, all interested
persons or parties shall present in writing their objections, if any, to the
assessments against them. The Assessor shall be present at every meeting of the
Council at which a special assessment is to be reviewed.
(1993 Code, § 54-9)
§ 54-10 CHANGES AND CORRECTIONS IN ASSESSMENT ROLL.
   The Council shall meet at the time and place designated for the review of
the special assessment roll prepared as required in this chapter, and at such
meeting or a proper adjournment thereof shall consider all objections to the
special assessment roll submitted in writing. The Council may correct the roll
as to any special assessment or description of any lot or parcel of land or
other errors appearing therein or it may, by resolution, annul such assessment
roll and direct that new proceedings be instituted. The same proceedings shall
be followed in making a new roll as in the making of the original roll. If,
after hearing all objections and making a record of such changes as the Council
deems justified the Council determines that it is satisfied with the special
assessment roll and that assessments are in proportion to benefits received, it
shall thereupon pass a resolution reciting such determinations, confirming such
roll, placing it on file in the office of the Clerk and directing the Clerk to
attach his warrant to a certified copy thereof within 10 days and commanding
the Assessor to spread and the Treasurer to collect the various sums and
amounts appearing thereon as directed by the Council. Such roll shall have the
date of confirmation endorsed thereon and shall from that date be final and
conclusive for the purpose of the improvement to which it applies, subject only
to adjustment to conform to the actual cost of the improvement, as provided in
§
54-14.
(1993 Code, § 54-10)
§ 54-11 DUE DATE; NOTICE OF FILING APPEAL.
   (A)   All special assessments, except such installments thereof as the
Council shall make payable at a future time as provided in this chapter, shall
be due and payable upon confirmation of the special assessment roll.
   (B)   The notice of a special assessment made against property shall include
a statement that the owner or any person in interest may file a written appeal
with the state tax tribunal within 30 days after confirmation of the roll if
the special assessment was protested at the hearing held for the purpose of
confirming the roll.
(1993 Code, § 54-11)
§ 54-12 PARTIAL PAYMENTS.
   (A)   The Council may provide for the payment of special assessments in
annual installments. Such annual installments shall not exceed 20 in number,
the first installment being due upon confirmation of the roll. Interest shall
be charged on all deferred installments at a rate to be set by the City
Council, commencing on the due date of the first installment and payable on the
due date of each subsequent installment. The full amount of all or any deferred
installments, with interest accrued thereon to the date of payment, may be paid
in advance of the due dates thereof.
   (B)   If the full assessment or the first installment thereof shall be due
upon confirmation of the special assessment roll, each property owner shall
have 60 days from the date of confirmation to pay the full amount of the
assessment or the full amount of any installment thereof, without interest or
penalty. Following the 60 day period, the assessment or first installment
thereof shall, if unpaid, be considered as delinquent and the same penalties
shall be collected on such unpaid assessments or first installments thereof as
are provided in the Charter to be collected on delinquent general city taxes.
Deferred installments shall be collected without penalty until 60 days after
the due date thereof, after which time such installments shall be considered as
delinquent and such penalties on installments shall be collected as are
provided in the Charter to be collected on delinquent general city taxes.
   (C)   After the Council has confirmed the roll, the City Treasurer shall
notify by mail each property owner on the roll that the roll has been filed,
stating the amount assessed and the terms of payment. Failure on the part of
the City Treasurer to give such notice or of such owner to receive the notice
shall not invalidate any special assessment roll of the city or any assessment
thereon nor excuse the payment of interest or penalties.
(1993 Code, § 54-12) (Ord. passed 9-26-2005)
§ 54-13 CREATION OF LIEN.
   (A)   Special assessments and all interest, penalties and charges thereon
from the date of confirmation of the roll shall become a personal obligation to
the city from the persons to whom they are assessed and, until paid, shall be
and remain a lien upon the property assessed, of the same character and effect
as the lien created by general law for county and school taxes and by the
Charter for city taxes, and the lands upon which the special assessments are a
lien shall be subject to sale therefor the same as are lands upon which
delinquent city taxes constitute a lien.
   (B)   In addition to the procedures established in subsection (A) of this
section for the collection of special assessments levied against property, the
city may recover the special assessments in a suit in any court of competent
jurisdiction. In any such suit, the confirmed special assessment roll upon
which the special assessment concerned appears shall be prima facie evidence of
the existence of the special assessment, of the regularity of the proceedings
in making the special assessment and of the right of the city to recover
judgment therefor.
(1993 Code, § 54-13)
§ 54-14 ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS; REFUNDS.
   (A)   The City Manager shall, within 60 days after the completion of each
local public improvement, compile the actual cost thereof and certify the cost
to the Council. When any special assessment roll shall prove insufficient to
meet the cost of the improvement for which it was made, the Council may make an
additional pro rata assessment; provided, however, that no property shall be
assessed in excess of benefits received. No additional assessment for any local
public improvement which exceeds 10% of the original assessment shall be made
except in accordance with the requirements of Charter, §
9.2(7).
   (B)   The excess by which any special assessment proves larger than the
actual cost of the improvement and expenses incidental thereto may be placed in
the General Fund of the city, if such excess is less than 5% of the total
amount of the assessment roll, but should the assessment prove larger than the
amount by 5% or more, the entire excess shall be refunded on a pro rata basis
to the owners of the property assessed. Such refund shall be made by credit
against future unpaid installments to the extent such installments then exist
and the balance of such refund shall be in cash. No refunds may be made which
contravene the provisions of outstanding evidence of indebtedness secured in
whole or in part by such special assessment.
(1993 Code, § 54-14)
§ 54-15 ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES.
   If the provisions of this chapter may prove to be insufficient to carry out
fully the making of any special assessment, the Council shall provide by
ordinance any additional steps or procedures required.
(1993 Code, § 54-15)
§ 54-16 ACCOUNTS.
   Monies raised by special assessment for any public improvement shall be
credited to a special assessment account and shall be used to pay the special
assessment portion of the cost of the improvement for which the assessment was
levied and of expenses incidental thereto, including the repayment of the
principal and interest on money borrowed therefor, and to refund excessive
assessments, if refunds are authorized.
(1993 Code, § 54-16)
§ 54-17 CONTESTED ASSESSMENTS.
   No suit or action of any kind shall be instituted or maintained for the
purpose of contesting or enjoining collection of any special assessment unless
within 30 days after confirmation of the special assessment roll written notice
is given to the City Clerk of intention to file such suit or action, stating
grounds on which it is claimed such assessment is illegal, and unless such suit
or action shall be commenced within 60 days of confirmation of the roll.
(1993 Code, § 54-17)
§ 54-18 REASSESSMENT FOR BENEFITS.
   Whenever the Council shall deem any special assessment invalid or defective
for any reason whatever or if any court of competent jurisdiction shall have
adjudged such assessment to be illegal for any reason whatever, in whole or in
part, the Council shall have power to cause a new assessment to be made for the
same purpose for which the former assessment was made, whether the improvement
or any part thereof has been completed and whether any part of the assessment
has been collected or not. All proceedings on such reassessment and for the
collection thereof shall be made in the manner as provided for the original
assessment. If any portion of the original assessment shall have been collected
and not refunded, it shall be applied upon the reassessment and the
reassessment shall to that extent be deemed satisfied. If more than the amount
reassessed shall have been collected, the balance shall be refunded to the
person making such payment.
(1993 Code, § 54-18)
§ 54-19 COMBINATION OF PROJECTS.
   The Council may combine several districts into 1 project for the purpose of
effecting a saving in the costs of the local public improvement assessed under
the provisions of this chapter; provided, however, that for each district there
shall be established separate funds and accounts to cover the cost of the
improvement.
(1993 Code, § 54-19)
§ 54-20 ASSESSMENT AFTER COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENT.
   If funds are on hand or a revolving fund exists to defray the expense of any
public improvement prior to the completion thereof, a special assessment roll
to defray such cost may be made within 30 days after the improvement is
completed based upon the actual cost thereof. The proceeds from such special
assessment shall be used to reimburse the account or fund from which the cost
of the improvement was derived.
(1993 Code, § 54-20)
§ 54-21 HARDSHIP DEFERMENTS.
   The City Manager may grant a deferment of the annual installment payments
due on special assessments for street and sidewalk improvements on homestead
properties in case of hardship, subject to the following.
   (A)   The payment of special assessment installments may be deferred for
owners who meet the terms and conditions of this section annually for a period
not to exceed 20 years or until the property is sold or until 1 year after the
owner's death; however, the death of a spouse shall not terminate deferral of
an assessment on homestead property owned by a husband and wife. The gross
amount of the annual special assessment installment eligible for deferment
under this section shall not be less than $300.
   (B)   To receive deferment, the owner shall annually certify to the City
Manager on or before July 1 that his annual household income does not exceed
HUD Section 8 income limits for Eaton County for very low income families.
   (C)   The owner shall execute and deliver to the City Clerk a lien in
recordable form in favor of the city indicating the amount of the annual
special assessment deferred, plus interest as provided in subsection (D), and
identifying the homestead.
   (D)   The payment of special assessment installments deferred under this
section which are subsequently made by the owner or owner's estate shall
include interest computed at the rate of .005% per month or fraction of a
month.
   (E)   The City Treasurer shall not report as delinquent any special
assessment installment which is deterred under this section for which a lien
has been recorded in favor of the city, until such time as the term of the
deferment expires as provided in division (A) above.
   (F)   A hardship deferment shall not be granted by the City Manager where
the owner of homestead property is eligible for a deferment of special
assessment on that homestead pursuant to Public Act 225 of 1976, being M.C.L.A.

provisions of this chapter.
      (5)   If the Planning Commission is not satisfied that the proposed
subdivision option meets the letter and spirit of the zoning chapter or finds
that the approval of the subdivision option will be detrimental to existing
development in the general area and should not be approved, it shall
communicate such disapproval to the City Council with the reasons therefor. The
proprietor shall be entitled to a hearing upon the proposal before the City
Council upon written request therefor filed with the City Clerk.
      (6)   If the City Council gives preliminary approval of the proposed

following the calendar year upon which such service charge is calculated and
shall be distributed to the several units levying ad valorem property taxes in
the same proportion as for said taxes. Failure to pay the service charge on or

development project upon the City Treasurer filing a certificate of non-payment

the requirements of law, this article shall automatically expire, terminate and
be of no further effect.

for the payment of the next month's expenses of administration and operation of
the system and such current expenses for the maintenance of the system as may
be necessary to preserve the system in good repair and working order.
      (3)   Bond and Interest Redemption Fund; Bond Reserve Account. Out of the

shall set aside each month an amount equal to the amounts specified in each
bond ordinance applicable to outstanding bonds secured or payable from revenues
of the system. In addition, if required by any bond ordinance, the City Manager
shall set aside the amounts required to establish and maintain the Bond Reserve
Account. Money in the Bond and Interest Redemption Fund shall be used
exclusively for payment of the principal of redemption premiums, if any, and
interest on the bonds as they come due. Money in the Bond Reserve Account shall

and interest on the bonds as to which there would otherwise be a default. If at
any time it is necessary to use money credited to the Bond Reserve Account for
such payment, then the City Manager shall replace the money used from the net
revenues next received that are not needed for current principal and interest
requirements, until the amount on deposit equals the reserve amount.
      (4)   Replacement and Improvement Fund. Out of the revenues and moneys of
the system remaining in the Receiving Fund at the end of each month, after
provision has been made for credits or deposits to the Operation and
Maintenance Fund and the Bond and Interest Redemption Fund, the City Manager
may deposit such additional funds into the Replacement and Improvement Fund
such amounts as the City Manager shall determine advisable, not to exceed the
amounts budgeted for such purpose. The money in the Replacement and Improvement
Fund shall be used solely for the purpose of making repairs, replacements,
improvements, or enlargements of the system, including any buildings or
structures related to the system. If at any time it shall be necessary to use
the money in the Replacement Fund for the purpose for which the Replacement
Fund was established, the City Manager shall replace those amounts from any
money in the Receiving Fund which is not required to be used for the Operation
and Maintenance Fund or the Bond and Interest Redemption Fund, including the
Bond Reserve Account.

Receiving Fund each month, the City Manager shall credit to the General
Obligation Debt Fund such sums as shall be necessary to pay debt service on
outstanding general obligation bonds or contractual obligations of the city
issued or incurred for system purposes.
   (D)   Surplus revenues. All money remaining in the Receiving Fund after
satisfying all of the requirements of this section may, at the option of the
City Council, be used for any purpose directly relating to the system,
including credit or transfer to the Replacement Fund or the general obligation
debt, or for the purchase of bonds on the open market at not more than the fair
market value thereof, or for the redemption of bonds prior to maturity.
   (E)   Priority of funds. If the money in the Receiving Fund is insufficient
to provide for the current requirements of the Operation and Maintenance Fund
or the Redemption Fund, any money or securities in other funds of the system,
except the proceeds of the sale of bonds, shall be credited or transferred,
first, to the Operation and Maintenance Fund, and second to the Bond and
Interest Redemption Fund.

system must receive sufficient total annual revenue to ensure the proper
operation and maintenance of the system, the development and perpetuation of
the system, and the preservation of the financial integrity of the system. The
City Council has also determined that the system shall be self- sustaining,
supported solely by the revenues of the system and not dependent upon the
property tax payers of the city. To meet those ends, City Council shall
annually fix the rates and charges to be imposed on all users of each component
of the system in accordance with the principles and standards set forth in this
article.

§ 68-97 PURPOSE OF SEWER AND WATER RATES; ESTABLISHMENT OF COST OF SERVICE.
   (A)   The City Council has determined that the purpose of sewer and water
rates is to produce sufficient revenues each year to pay the costs of service.
The City Council has found that annual revenues and expenditures of the system
can fluctuate as much as 25% from year to year. Based on the recommendations of
the city's engineers, City Council has determined that, in order to provide
adequate, but not excessive, annual adjustments in revenue levels in a timely
manner, the Department shall develop the costs of service based on 5 year
projections of cash needs, adjusted for inflation, and shall base rates each
year on the estimated needs for those 5 year periods, adjusted annually.
   (B)   The costs of service to be paid from revenues shall include all of the
following:
      (1)   Operation and maintenance expenses;
      (2)   Debt service expenses; and
      (3)   Capital expenses not funded from bonded indebtedness.
(1993 Code, § 68-97) (Ord. passed 1-22-2001; Ord. 2014-01, passed 1-27-2014)
§ 68-98 SERVICE TO CITY.
   (A)   The city shall pay the same water and sewer rates for service to the
city as would be payable by a private user for the same service.
   (B)   In addition, in recognition of the capacity requirements of fire
hydrants, the city shall pay a fee equal to 5% of the annual budgeted revenues
of the water supply system.
(1993 Code, § 68-98) (Ord. passed 1-22-2001; Ord. 2014-01, passed 1-27-2014)
§ 68-99 BILLING AND COLLECTION.
   (A)   Charges for water and sewer usage shall be paid within 30 days of the
date which they are billed. Payments shall be deemed made when they are
received in the Treasurer's office or a city authorized depository. If payment
is not made as provided in this section, a penalty of 10% shall be added to the
bill. Failure to receive a bill shall not relieve the customer from the
responsibility for payment.
   (B)   Such charges shall constitute a lien upon the respective properties
served and if any charge is not paid before it becomes delinquent it may be
recovered by the city in an action in assumpsit against the owner of the
property served as well as any tenant supplied with such water, or such charges
may be certified to the City Treasurer by the City Council and assessed against
the property on the next city tax roll, in which event such charge shall be
collected and returned in the same manner as other city taxes are collected and
returned; provided that any charge shall not be so certified which has not been
delinquent for a period of a least 6 months. The effective date of
certification by City Council shall be May 1 of each year. In addition to any
other remedy provided in this chapter or by law, if such charges for water
consumed is not paid as provided in this section, the City Treasurer shall have
the authority to shut off the supply of water to any such premises, provided:
      (1)   Delinquent notice is provided by first class mail to the account
holder, which shall serve as due process, prior to the water being shut off;
      (2)   Shut off notice is provided to any occupant(s) of the property by
posting notice of same at the premises at least 3 days prior to the water being
shut off;
      (3)   After shut off, such connection shall not thereafter be reconnected
until all such water charges and penalties shall be paid, together with turn-on
charges.
   (C)   If the city shuts off the water supply by mistake, the City Manager or
his designee is authorized to credit the property owner an amount equal to the
shut-off fee.
   (D)   (1)   It is the policy of the city to discontinue utility service to
customers by reason of nonpayment of bills only after notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard on disputed bills. The city’s form for application for
utility service and all bills shall contain, in addition to the title, address,
room number, and telephone number of the official in charge of billing, clearly
visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:
         (a)   That all bills are due and payable on or before the date set
forth on the bill; and
         (b)   That if any bill is not paid by or before that date, a second
bill will be mailed containing a cutoff notice that if the bill is not paid
within ten days of the mailing of the second bill, service will be discontinued
for nonpayment; and
         (c)   That any customer disputing the correctness of his bill shall
have a right to a hearing at which time he may be represented in person and by
counsel or any other person of his choosing and may present orally or in
writing his complaint and contentions to the city official in charge of utility
billing. This official shall be authorized to order that the customer’s service
not be discontinued and shall have the authority to make a final determination
of the customer’s complaint.
      (2)   Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be entertained;
only questions of proper and correct billing will be considered. In the absence
of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided
herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified, but in no event
until the charges have been due and unpaid for at least 30 days.
      (3)   When it becomes necessary for the city to discontinue utility
service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only
after all bills for service then due have been paid, along with a turn-on
charge of such amount as is authorized from time to time by Council by
resolution.
(1993 Code, § 68-99) (Ord. passed 1-22-2001; Ord. passed 1-14-2002; Ord. 2014-
01, passed 1-27- 2014; Ord. 2021-10, passed 8-2-2021)
§ 68-100 ALLOCATION OF COSTS OF SERVICE.
   (A)   The City Council has determined that not all classes of users of the
system cause the same costs of service. Based on the recommendations of
independent engineering consultants to the city, City Council has determined
the following:
      (1)   The commodity costs of water supply and some portions of the costs
of sewage disposal are uniform among users in accordance with the volume of
use;
      (2)   Indirect costs of water supply and sewage transportation, including
size of service pipe, materials used, locations of meters, size of storage and
treatment facilities, and maintenance, billing and collection costs vary
according to the size of meters;
      (3)   While all users benefit equally from capital improvements to the
system, users taking possession of previously undeveloped properties, and users
changing the nature and amount of use of the system at renovated or expanded
properties would not bear equally the cost of those capital improvements unless
required to pay a system equity charge;
      (4)   Certain types of property uses require a reservation of a greater
capacity of the system than others;
      (5)   At least 50% of the costs of service to all customers is related to
the indirect costs of service;
      (6)   Current technology does not support the efficient and cost
effective metering of sanitary sewage discharged into the sanitary sewage
disposal system. As a result, the city has determined that the most equitable
measure of the volume of sanitary sewage discharged into the system is the
amount of water consumed;
      (7)   The city will offer service to properties located outside the city
limits only pursuant to city-township contract.
   (B)   The City Council has therefore developed the following classes of
users.
      (1)   For meters of the following sizes, the following meter equivalency
ratios for purposes of allocating the base amount of the indirect costs of
service and calculating the quarterly base rate per meter size:
Meter Size (inches) AWWA Meter Capacity Ratio
Meter Size (inches) AWWA Meter Capacity Ratio
5/8 and 3/4         1.0
1                   1.6
1-1/2               3.3
2                   5.3
3                   10.0
4                   15.5
6                   33.3
 
      (2)   All classes of users shall pay the same rate per gallon of metered
water for water supply and sewage transportation services.
      (3)   For purposes of calculating the system equity charge, City Council
has decided to use a table of unit factors, a copy of which is on file with the
Director, based on a unit equaling 250 gallons of water consumed per day per
year, as recommended by the city's consulting engineers.
      (4)   The base charge shall be calculated so as to produce no less than
50% of the annual budgeted expenditures of the system.
      (5)   The amount of water consumed is generally an appropriate and fair
indicator of the amount of sanitary sewage discharged into the sanitary sewage
disposal system.
      (6)   Where a user discharges sanitary sewage into the sanitary sewage
disposal system but does not use the water supply system, or where a property
uses large quantities of water that are not disposed of through the sanitary
sewage system, the Department shall propose and the City Council shall adopt,
methods of allocating the costs of service to those properties based on the
estimated use of the sanitary sewage system.
(1993 Code, § 68-100) (Ord. passed 1-22-2001; Ord. 2014-01, passed 1-27-2014)
§ 68-101 SPECIFIC RATES AND CHARGES.
   (A)   Consumption charge. Every user shall pay a consumption charge
calculated on the basis of metered gallons per day of water consumed at a rate
determined by City Council to produce an estimated 45% of the annual budgeted
revenues of the system.
   (B)   Base charge. Every user shall pay a base charge calculated on the
basis of meter capacity ratio in an amount determined by Council to produce an
estimated 50% of the annual budgeted revenues of the system.
   (C)   System equity charge. The purpose of the system equity charge is to
recover certain of the capital costs incurred to provide sufficient capacity to
all users from those users that have not previously paid their share of those
costs. Every person seeking to utilize the system for a use estimated to demand
the reservation of greater capacity of the system shall pay a system equity
charge established and managed as provided in this section.
      (1)   Calculation of estimated demand on capacity. The estimated demand
on capacity of the system shall be based on the unit factor assigned to the
type of use described in the table of unit factors approved by City Council
from time to time, based on historic average use for each type of use.
      (2)   Calculation of system equity. System equity shall be determined
annually on the basis of the value of system assets comprising the backbone
facilities of the system, including, but not limited to, wells, reservoirs,
treatment plants, mains, distribution mains and high service pumps, plus funds
in the Replacement and Improvement Fund, plus accumulated depreciation, less
the amount of any grants received to fund system assets, and less the principal
amount of bonds remaining outstanding and incurred to finance those assets.
      (3)   Calculation of system equity charge. The system equity charge shall
be determined each year as follows:
   System Equity x residential equivalent unit factor
                            Total number of existing Meter Equivalent Units
      (4)   Credits. If the system equity charge relates to an increase in
demand on capacity, the city shall provide residential equivalent unit credits
in the following order:
         (a)   The number of documented residential equivalent units previously
paid for connection of that property to the system;
         (b)   If the number of residential equivalent units paid for
previously can not be identified, the residential equivalent units shall be
determined by the latest 2 year average billable flow divided by 250 gallons
per day per year;
         (c)   If the latest 2 year average billable flow cannot be determined,
the residential equivalent units shall be determined by the table of unit
factor based on the properties' previous use.
      (5)   Use of proceeds of the system equity charge. Proceeds of the system
equity charge shall be used exclusively to pay for replacements and
improvements to the system, other than extensions of service to new users.
      (6)   Appeals. A person may challenge the unit factor applicable to the
property being connected to the system, or the amount of the system equity
charge by bringing an appeal to the Utility Board of Appeals within 24 months
of payment of the charge and after review of the City Manager. In considering
the appeal, the Utility Board of Appeals shall take into account the historical
volume of use by the appellant for the previous 24 months.
   (D)   System equity charges for buildings built before 1960. The purpose of
this section amendment is to encourage the redevelopment of structures
originally constructed before December 31, 1959. For all structures built
before this date which: 1) involves a change of use and 2) which use is
estimated to demand a greater reservation of capacity, the equity investment
fee shall be half of the fee set by resolution of the City Council for new
construction. By resolution of the City Council, payment for the equity
investment charge can be deferred for a period of up to 2 years. Any deferrals
shall be filed as a lien on the property.
   (E)   Tap fee. Each person connecting to the system shall pay the actual
costs of the material, meter, labor, equipment and supervision related to the
installation of the connection and the meter, plus an administrative charge
equal to 10% of the actual costs of the connection.
   (F)   Inspection fee. Each person connecting to the system shall also pay a
fee for inspection of the premises during connection to the system, which fee
shall be set from time to time by City Council by resolution.

   As authorized by the provisions of Public Act 94 of 1933, being M.C.L.A. §§
141.101 through 141.138, as amended, if a user shall fail to pay a bill within
6 months of the date on which the bill is due and payable, the delinquent bill

Assessor shall place such charges on the next general tax roll, and the charges
shall be collected in the same manner in all respects as provided by law for
the collection of taxes by the city.

§ 68-176 GENERAL/SPECIFIC PROHIBITIONS.
   (A)   Allowable bypasses. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur
which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but
only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (C) and (D) of
this section.
   (B)   Notice.
      (1)   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least 10 days before the date of the
bypass if possible.
      (2)   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within 5 days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of
the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass
and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times,
and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected
to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-
case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
   (C)   Conditions.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement action
against an industrial user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The industrial user submitted notices as required under
subsection (C) of this section.
      (2)   The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the 3 conditions
listed in subsection (C)(1) of this section.

DIVISION 5. PRETREATMENT
§ 68-186 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (A)   This division sets forth requirements for dischargers into the POTW
wastewater collection systems, treatment systems, surface waters, groundwaters,
storm sewers, septic systems, dry wells or on the ground and enables the city
POTW to protect public health, the environment and the POTW in conformity with
all applicable local, state and federal laws relating thereto.
   (B)   The objectives of this division are to:
      (1)   Control or prevent the introduction of pollutants into the
municipal wastewater system which will interfere with the normal operation of
the system or contaminate the resulting municipal sludge;
      (2)   Control or prevent the introduction of pollutants into the
municipal wastewater system which do not receive adequate treatment in the POTW
and which will pass through the system into receiving waters or the atmosphere
or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
      (3)   Improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the system;
      (4)   Control or prevent discharges or potential discharges (storage of
materials) to systems or areas under the jurisdiction of this city that may
impair the environment.
   (C)   The city will be responsible for the monitoring of the pretreatment
program, unless the industrial user has written permission from the city to
perform its own monitoring. If the city performs the monitoring, it has the
right to demand reimbursement of all labor, maintenance and lab fees associated
with the monitoring period. If the industrial user has written permission to
perform its own monitoring, the industrial user must notify the POTW within 24
hours of a violation. It is also required that the industrial user resample and
resubmit the results within 30 days to the POTW.

§ 68-188 LIMITATION ON WASTEWATER STRENGTH.
   (A)   National categorical pretreatment standards. National categorical
pretreatment standards, as promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) pursuant to the Act (33 U.S.C. 1345 et seq.) and as adopted as
Appendix C to this article, which appendix is on file in the office of the City
Clerk, shall be met by all dischargers of the regulated industrial categories.
An application for modification of the national categorical pretreatment
standards may be considered for submittal to the regional administrator by the
approval authority, when the approval authority’s wastewater treatment system
achieves consistent removal of the pollutants as defined by 40 C.F.R. 403.7.
   (B)   State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges
to the POTW shall be met by all dischargers which are subject to such standards
in any instance in which they are more stringent than federal requirements and
limitations or those in this or any other applicable ordinance.
   (C)   Right of revision. The approval authority reserves the right to amend
this article to provide for more stringent limitations or requirements on
discharges to the POTW where deemed necessary to comply with the objectives set
forth in §
68-186.
   (D)   Dilution. No discharger shall increase the use of potable or process
water in any way nor mix separate waste streams for the purpose of diluting a
discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve
compliance with the standards set forth in this article.
   (E)   Notice of potential problems. All categorical and noncategorical
industrial users shall notify the POTW immediately of all discharges that could
cause problems to the POTW, including any slug loadings, as defined by 40
C.F.R. 403.5(b), by the industrial user.
   (F)   Net/gross and federal categorical pretreatment standards. A user may
apply to the city for an adjustment in a federal categorical pretreatment
standard to reflect the presence of pollutants in the user’s intake water in
accordance with 40 C.F.R. 403.15. If such an adjustment is made, the adjusted
federal categorical pretreatment standard shall apply, provided the adjustment
will not result in interference or pass through.
   (G)   Removal credits. Removal credits will be awarded to those POTWs who
follow the requirements set in 40 C.F.R. 403.7.
   (H)   RCRA notification. It is the responsibility of the industrial user to
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Director, and the state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
C.F.R. 261.

§ 68-189 POTW’S RIGHT TO REFUSE OR CONDITION DISCHARGE; POLLUTANT REDUCTION
PLANS, BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   (A)   In general. The POTW may refuse to accept, or may condition the
acceptance of, all or any portion of any proposed or existing discharge to the
POTW, regardless of whether or not a wastewater discharge permit has been
issued for the discharge, if the POTW superintendent determines that the
discharge has a reasonable potential to adversely affect the operation of the
POTW; result in pass through or interference; violate any pretreatment standard
or requirement; cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit; or if the impacts
of the discharge on the POTW or the POTW’s discharge are uncertain or unknown
(because, for example, no local limits or headworks analysis has been conducted
for particular pollutants in the discharge). If the POTW superintendent denies
any person permission to commence or continue all or any portion of a discharge
or shall immediately terminate the discharge to the POTW, the person shall
refrain from commencing to discharge or shall immediately terminate the
discharge to the POTW and shall not thereafter recommence discharge without
written authorization from the POTW superintendent. Similarly, if the POTW
superintendent denies any person permission to commence or continue all or any
portion of a discharge to the POTW except subject to conditions determined
necessary and appropriate by the POTW superintendent, the person shall refrain
from commencing or continuing the discharge except in full compliance with
those conditions. Conditions may include, but are not limited to, the
imposition of surcharges, pretreatment requirements, reduction plans, best
management practices, and any other conditions or requirements, or combination
thereof, determined necessary by the POTW superintendent to comply with the
purposes and requirements of this article. The failure to comply with any
condition or requirement imposed under this section or other provisions of this
article constitutes a separate violation and shall be subject to fines,
penalties and other sanctions as provided by this article.
   (B)   The POTW authority and the industry may enter into an agreement under
which the authority may treat a particular waste, subject to payment therefor
by the industry, unless prohibited by state or federal law.
   (C)   Pollutant reduction plans. If determined necessary by the POTW
superintendent to prevent interference or pass through, to protect the POTW, to
comply with applicable federal or state laws or regulations, to comply with the
POTW's NPDES permit, or to otherwise meet the purposes and objectives of this
article, any user determined by the POTW superintendent to have a reasonable
potential to discharge any regulated pollutant (including, but not limited to,
mercury or PCBs) to the POTW may be required to develop, submit for approval,
and implement a reduction plan ("RP") for the pollutant, as provided by this
section. The RP may be imposed as a condition to a wastewater discharge permit,
or may be required independently by order of the superintendent and even if a
wastewater discharge permit has been issued to the user.
      (1)   At a minimum, the RP shall contain such requirements and
conditions, as determined necessary by the POTW superintendent to ensure that
the pollutant reduction efforts will be effective in achieving the goals of
this article (including, but not limited to, requirements and conditions
regarding user source identification; best management practices; schedules of
compliance; monitoring, sampling and analysis; reporting; treatment system for
removal of the pollutant from the discharged wastewater; written procedures for
disposal of contaminated wastes and wastewater; employee training, and ongoing
employee training requirements regarding pollutant related issues; elimination,
if feasible, of any purchased materials containing the pollutant; and any other
elements determined necessary and appropriate under the circumstances by the
POTW superintendent).
      (2)   The goals of an RP shall be to maintain the amount of one or more
pollutants or substances at or below the applicable discharge limits or levels,
to minimize discharge of a pollutant as much as possible, or such other goals
as required by the POTW. The POTW superintendent may, in the superintendent's
discretion, consider cost-effectiveness during the development and
implementation of an RP.
      (3)   The POTW superintendent may require any user to submit an RP that
describes the control strategy designed to proceed toward achievement of the
specified goal and which shall at a minimum include, but shall not be limited
to, all of the following as determined necessary by the POTW superintendent on
a case-by-case basis;
         (a)   Periodic monitoring for the pollutant in the user's discharge.
         (b)   Periodic monitoring of the potential sources of the pollutant in
the user's discharge.
         (c)   A commitment by the user that reasonable control measures and/or
best management practices will be implemented when sources of the pollutant are
discovered. Factors to be considered by the POTW may include the following:
            1.   Significance of sources.
            2.   Economic considerations.
            3.   Technical and treatability considerations.
            4.   Such other factors as determined appropriate by the POTW
superintendent.
         (d)   An annual status report. The report shall be sent by the user to
the POTW and shall include, at a minimum, all of the following:
            1.   All RP monitoring results for the previous year.
            2.   A list of potential sources of the pollutant in the user's
discharge.
            3.   A summary of all actions taken by the user to reduce or
eliminate the identified sources of the pollutant or substance.
      (4)   As determined necessary by the POTW superintendent, the
superintendent may require a user to develop, submit and implement an RP for
any pollutant or substance regulated by this article.
      (5)   Failure to submit an approvable RP within the specified deadlines
or to fully and timely comply with any condition or requirement of an approved
RP shall constitute a violation of this article, subject to the fine, penalty,
and other enforcement provisions of this article.
      (6)   Holding enforcement action in abeyance. If the effluent sample
analysis results in a user's discharge exceeding the applicable discharge
limit, detection level, or quantification level for a pollutant, the POTW
superintendent may, in the POTW superintendent's sole discretion, nevertheless
allow that discharge to continue and may hold any enforcement action regarding
the prohibited discharge in abeyance, subject to the terms, conditions, and
requirements of this subsection as follows:
         (a)   If an approved RP is already in place: If effluent sample
analysis results exceed the applicable discharge limit, detection level, or
quantification level for a pollutant for which an approved RP is already in
place, then the POTW superintendent may, in the POTW superintendent's sole
discretion, nevertheless allow that discharge to continue and may hold any
enforcement action regarding the prohibited discharge in abeyance for the
period that the sample represents if the RP (and all terms, conditions and
requirement thereof) is being fully and continually performed in good faith by
the user, as determined by the POTW superintendent, and subject to all of the
requirements and conditions of this section.
         (b)   If an approved RP is not already in place: If effluent sample
analysis results exceed the applicable discharge limit, detection level, or
quantification level for a pollutant for which an approved RP is not already in
place, then the POTW superintendent may, in the POTW superintendent's sole
discretion, nevertheless allow that discharge to continue and may hold any
enforcement regarding the prohibited discharge in abeyance, subject to all of
the requirements and conditions of this section, and provided further as
follows: The user with the non-compliant discharge shall develop and implement
an RP approved by the POTW superintendent to minimize the user's discharges of
the pollutant in question to the POTW. The RP shall meet all of the
requirements of this section.
         (c)   The following requirements and conditions shall apply to any
situation under this subjection in which an enforcement action is held in
abeyance as provided by this subsection (regardless of whether or not an RP was
in place at the time of the non-compliance):
            1.   The user with the non-compliant discharge shall have a POTW-
accessible point for monitoring all discharges from the user to the POTW. All
costs and expenses for and related to the installation and maintenance of this
monitoring point and any required sampling devices shall be paid for solely by
the user.
            2.   The user with the non-compliant discharge shall routinely
self-monitor its discharges and report results to the POTW for the pollutant in
question using the sampling methods, procedures, preservation and handling, and
analytical protocol required by the POTW superintendent and at the frequency
specified by the POTW superintendent. All costs and expenses of this sampling
and analysis shall be paid for solely by the user.
            3.   The POTW may collect any additional samples of the user's
discharge as determined necessary by the POTW superintendent, all costs and
expenses to be paid for by the user.
            4.   If the user complies with all of the requirements and
conditions for the RP as specified by the POTW superintendent, and if the POTW
superintendent determines that all reasonable and cost-effective actions based
on the economic, technical, and treatability consideration, including, but not
limited to, all elements of the user's RP, have been, and continue to be, fully
and satisfactorily implemented by the user, then the POTW may, in its
discretion, hold enforcement action in abeyance and allow the user to continue
the non-compliant discharge.
            5.   Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the
contrary, and regardless of whether a user fully complies with all requirements
and conditions of this section and/or of an approved RP, the POTW
superintendent shall have the unconditional right to prohibit and terminate any
non-compliant discharge at any time and without prior notice, and to take any
enforcement action in response thereto, including any enforcement action that
had previously been held in abeyance under this subsection.
            6.   Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the
contrary, the POTW superintendent shall not hold an enforcement action in
abeyance as provided by this subsection unless the POTW superintendent has
first obtained approval from MDEQ to do so for the specific pollutant parameter
in question; provided, that such prior approval shall not be required for
discharges of mercury or PCBs.
   (D)   Best management practices.
      (1)   The POTW superintendent may require any user to develop and
implement best management practices to control, contain, treat, prevent, or
reduce the discharge of wastewater, pollutants or other substances from the
user's premises to the POTW, as determined necessary by the superintendent.
      (2)   In addition, the POTW superintendent may require a user to develop
and submit a Best Management Practices Plan ("BMPP"), including an enforceable
implementation schedule, for review and approval by the superintendent. The
BMPP shall be submitted within 30 days after notification by the superintendent
or as otherwise required by a wastewater discharge permit or order. The BMPP
shall be directed at preventing the entrance of pollutants, directly or
indirectly, into the POTW. The BMPP shall be available for inspection at all
times at the user's premises. At a minimum, a user's BMPP shall contain all of
the following elements, as determined necessary by the POTW superintendent, at
a level of detail and in units and terms as determined necessary by the
superintendent to adequately evaluate the plan:
         (a)   A statement of the purpose and objectives of the plan.
         (b)   A description of the strategies, methods, policies and
procedures to prevent, minimize or reduce the introduction of pollutants into
the user's discharge and to minimize waste generation.
         (c)   A description of the options available to the user to control
accidental spillage, leaks and drainage.
         (d)   A description of best available or practicable control
technologies available for the user's specific circumstances.
         (e)   A detailed facility layout and site diagram showing points of
entry in the POTW.
         (f)   A description of the waste handling, treatment and discharge
disposal facilities, including flow diagrams and process schematics.
         (g)   A description of operating and maintenance processes and
procedures.
         (h)   An inventory of raw materials and a list of waste sources,
including a list of all chemicals used or stored at the facility.
         (i)   A description of employee training programs, policies and
procedures; continuing education programs; and participation.
         (j)   A description of documentation, including record keeping and
forms.
         (k)   A description of monitoring activities.
         (l)   An information log of facility personnel, organization chart,
emergency phone numbers, contact person and maintenance or service
representatives.
         (m)   Certification by a qualified professional that the plan is
adequate to prevent spills, leaks, slug loads, or non-customary discharges of
regulated substances, directly or indirectly, to the POTW.
         (n)   Such other information, documents or diagrams as require by the
POTW superintendent, including, but not limited to, any of the information
required under §
68-191 of this article.
      (3)   The BMPs or BMPP required of a user or approved for a user may be
incorporated into a wastewater discharge permit issue to the user. If the user
already has a wastewater discharge permit, the existing permit may be modified
to incorporate the BMP requirements. If the user does not currently have a
wastewater discharge permit, a permit may be issued for that purpose.
Alternatively, BMPs or a BMPP may be required of a user independently by order
of the superintendent and even if a wastewater discharge permit has not been
issued to the user.
      (4)   The POTW superintendent may require revisions to users' BMPP if the
superintendent determines that the plan contains elements that are inadequate,
or as otherwise determined necessary by the superintendent to ensure compliance
with applicable requirements of this article. Review of a BMPP by the
superintendent shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify its
facility as necessary to comply with local, state and federal laws and
regulations.
   (E)   Mercury discharge limits.  The instantaneous maximum concentration,
daily maximum and monthly average discharge limits for mercury are non-detect
when utilizing U.S. EPA Method 245.1 with a detection limit of 0.0002 mg/L.
      (1)   Discharge of detectable mercury prohibited; determining compliance.
To determine compliance with the instantaneous maximum concentration, daily
maximum and monthly average discharge limits for mercury a user's discharge
shall be sampled and analyzed for detectable mercury. For the purpose of this
article DETECTABLE MERCURY  is defined to mean any wastewater, pollutant or
substance containing mercury at or above the quantification level of the
minimum mercury sampling and analytical protocol and methods required by this
article or other more stringent methods required by the POTW superintendent.
      (2)   Minimum sampling and analytical protocol and methods.
         (a)   Mercury sampling procedures, preservation and handling, and
analytical protocol for compliance monitoring of a user's discharge shall be in
accordance with the U.S. EPA Method 245.1.
         (b)   For Method 245.1, the quantification level shall be 0.0002 mg/l,
unless higher quantification levels are determined appropriate by the POTW
superintendent because of sample matrix interference. Any discharge of mercury
at or above 0.0002 mg/l using U.S. EPA Method 245.1 is prohibited as a
discharge of detectable mercury.
(Ord. 2014-01, passed 1-27-2014)
§ 68-190 SPILL PREVENTION.
   (A)   Required. Each sewer system user shall provide protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by
this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner’s or user’s own cost
and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide for this protection shall be approved by the city before construction
of the facility. No user who commences contribution to the POTW shall be
permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge
procedures have been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans
and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify the user’s facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this article. Copies of the user’s spill prevention control and
countermeasure (SPCC) and the pollution incidence prevention plan (PIPP) shall
be filed with the city. Each user required to develop a PIPP as provided by
Part 5 of the Michigan Water Resources Commission Rules, 1979 ACR 323.1151 et
seq., as amended (promulgated pursuant to Part 31 of Act 451 of the Public Acts
of Michigan of 1994 MCLA §§ 324.3101 et seq., as amended), shall submit a copy
of that plan to the POTW superintendent. The PIPP shall be submitted to the
superintendent within 60 days of the effective date of this article for an
existing source, or 30 days prior to the date of discharge for a new source.
   (B)   Secondary containment requirements.
      (1)   Each user must provide and maintain at the user’s sole expense
secondary spill containment structures (including diking, curbing or other
appropriate structures) adequate to protect all floor drains from accidental
spills and discharges to the POTW of any pollutants or discharges regulated by
this article.
         (a)   The containment area shall be constructed so that no liquid
polluting material can escape from the area by gravity through the building
sewers, drains, or otherwise directly or indirectly into the POTW.
         (b)   The containment or curbing shall be sufficient to hold not less
than 10% of the total volume of the tanks or containers within the secondary
containment structure or provide a capacity of 100% of the largest single tank
or container within the secondary containment structure, whichever is larger,
unless a lesser containment area or alternate control measures are approved in
advance by the POTW superintendent.
         (c)   The containment structure must accommodate “squirt distance.”
Containers within the containment structure must be able to be placed
sufficiently back from the edge of the structure so if punctured, the resulting
leak will be contained.
         (d)   The containment structure must be designed or operated to
prevent run-on or infiltration of precipitation into the secondary containment
system unless the collection system has sufficient excess capacity to contain
run-on or infiltration. Such additional capacity must be sufficient to contain
precipitation from a 25 year, 24-hour rainfall event.
         (e)   The containment structure shall be constructed with chemical-
resistant water stops in place at all joints (if any) and be free of cracks or
gaps.
         (f)   The containment structure shall be designed and installed to
completely surround the tank or containers and to cover all surrounding earth
likely to come into contact with the waste if released from the tank(s) or
containers (i.e., capable of preventing lateral as well as vertical migration
of the material).
         (g)   All floor drains found within the containment area must be
plugged and sealed.
      (2)   Spill troughs and stumps within process areas must discharge to
appropriate pretreatment tanks.
      (3)   Emergency containment shall also be provided for storage tanks that
may be serviced by commercial haulers and for chemical storage areas.
      (4)   Solid pollutants shall be located in secure areas designed to
prevent the loss of the materials in the POTW.
      (5)   Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide the protection required by this section shall be submitted to the POTW
superintendent for review, and shall be approved by the superintendent before
construction. Construction of approved containment for existing sources shall
be completed within the time period specified by the POTW superintendent.
      (6)   No new source shall be permitted to discharge to the POTW until
emergency containment facilities have been approved and constructed as required
by this section.
      (7)   The POTW superintendent may order a user to take interim measures
for emergency containment as determined necessary by the superintendent under
the circumstances.
   (C)   Immediate notice. For an accidental discharge, it is the
responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the
incident. The notification shall include location of the discharge, type of
waste, concentration and volume and corrective actions.
   (D)   Written notice. Within 48 hours following an accidental discharge, the
user shall submit to the manager a detailed written report describing the cause
of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or property, nor
shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other
liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law.
   (E)   Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
user’s bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call
if a dangerous discharge occurs. Employers shall ensure that all employees who
may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
   (F)   Defense. A documented and verified, bona fide operating upset shall be
an affirmative defense to any enforcement action brought by the city POTW
against a discharger for any noncompliance with this article or any wastewater
discharge permit, contract or waiver, pursuant to this article, which arises
out of violations alleged to have occurred during the period of the upset.

§ 68-192 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE AND WASTEWATER CONTRIBUTION PERMITS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful to discharge without a city permit to any natural
outlet within the city or in any area under the jurisdiction of the city or to
the POTW any wastewater except as authorized by the Director in accordance with
this article.
   (B)   All major contributing industries proposing to connect to or
contribute to the POTW shall obtain a wastewater discharge permit before
connecting to or contributing to the POTW.
   (C)   Users required to obtain a wastewater contribution permit shall
complete and file with the city an application in the form prescribed by the
city and accompanied by a fee. Proposed new users shall apply for a wastewater
contribution permit at least 90 days prior to connecting to or contributing to
the POTW. In support of the application, the user shall submit, in units and
terms appropriate for evaluation, the information required. The following
information shall also be submitted:
      (1)   A base line monitoring report (BMR) must be submitted at least 90
days prior to commencement of the discharge. The required sampling, for BMRs,
will be based on both grab samples and composite samples. If known pollutants
which are limited by the city, state, or federal agency are discovered in the
discharge, a statement must be prepared regarding whether or not the
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether
additional operation and maintenance or additional pretreatment is required for
the user to meet applicable pretreatment standards;
      (2)   If additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance will be
required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the
user will provide such additional pretreatment shall be submitted to the
Director. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the
compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. The
following conditions shall apply to this schedule:
         (a)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer,
completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing
construction, completing construction, and the like);
         (b)   No increment referred to in subsection (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall exceed 9 months;
         (c)   Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and
the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the
superintendent, including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it
expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay and the
steps being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule
established. No more than 9 months shall elapse between such progress reports
to the manager.
      (3)   Any other information as may be deemed by the city to be necessary
to evaluate the permit application.
   (D)   Within 9 months of the promulgation of a national categorical
pretreatment standard, the wastewater contribution permit of users subject to
such standards shall be revised to require compliance with such standard within
the time frame prescribed by such standard. Where a user, subject to a national
categorical pretreatment standard, has not previously submitted an application
for a wastewater contribution permit as required by this section, the user
shall apply for a wastewater contribution permit within 180 days after the
promulgation of the applicable national categorical pretreatment standard. In
addition, the user with an existing wastewater contribution permit shall submit
to the superintendent within 180 days after the promulgation of an applicable
federal categorical pretreatment standard the information required by this
section.
   (E)   Permits may contain the following:
      (1)   The unit charge or schedule of user charges and fees for the
wastewater to be discharged to a community sewer;
      (2)   Limits on the maximum wastewater constituents and characteristics;
      (3)   Limits on average and maximum rate and time of discharge or
requirements for flow regulations and equalization;
      (4)   Requirements for installation and maintenance of inspection and
sampling facilities;
      (5)   Specifications for monitoring programs which may include sampling
locations, frequency of sampling, number, types and standards of tests and
reporting schedule;

reports;
      (8)   Requirements for maintaining and retaining plant records relating
to wastewater discharge as specified by the city and affording the city access
thereto;
      (9)   Requirements for notification of the city of any new introduction
of wastewater constituents or any substantial change in the volume or character
of the wastewater constituents being introduced into the wastewater system;
      (10)   Requirements for notification of sludge discharges;
      (11)   Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the city to ensure
compliance with this article.
   (F)   Permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed 3
years. A permit may be issued for a period less than 1 year or may be stated to
expire on a specific date. The user shall apply for permit reissuance a minimum
of 90 days prior to the expiration of the user’s permit. The terms and
conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by the city during the
term of the permit as limitations or requirements are modified or other just
cause exists. The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in his permit
at least 30 days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or new
conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for
compliance.
   (G)   Wastewater contribution permits are issued to a specific user for a
specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned or
transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises or a new or
changed operation without the approval of the city. If a transfer is granted, a
copy of the existing control mechanism must be provided to the new owner or
operator.
   (H)   Any user, categorical or noncategorical, issued a wastewater discharge
permit shall submit to the superintendent during the months of June and
December, unless required more frequently, a report indicating the nature and
concentration of pollutants in the effluent and any other information the
superintendent deems necessary as listed in §
68-174.
   (I)   The superintendent may impose mass limitations on users in cases where
they are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by subsection (H) of
this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment
standards in the effluent of the user.
   (J)   Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be acceptable to
the city before construction of the facility. The review of plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying
the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under
the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the
city prior to the user’s initiation of the changes.
   (K)   A user to which a promulgated federal categorical pretreatment
standard applies shall achieve compliance with such standard within the
shortest time feasible, not to exceed 90 days.
   (L)   The surveillance reports referred to in this article shall be signed
as follows:
      (1)   By a responsible corporate officer, if the user submitting the
reports is a corporation. The term “responsible corporate officer” means:
         (a)   A President, Secretary, Treasurer or Vice-President of the
corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who
performs similar policy or decision making functions for the corporation; or
         (b)   The manager of 1 or more manufacturing, production or operation
facilities employing more than 250 persons, if authority to sign documents has
been assigned or delegated to the manager in accordance with corporate
procedures.
      (2)   By a general partner or proprietor, if the user submitting the
reports is a partnership or sole proprietorship, respectively.
      (3)   By a duly authorized representative of the individual designated in
subsection (L)(1) or (2) of this section, if:
         (a)   The authorization is made in writing by the individual described
in subsection (L)(1) or (2) of this section;
         (b)   The authorization specifies either an individual or a position
having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility from which the
discharge originates, such as the position of plant manager or a position of
equivalent responsibility for environmental matters for the company; and
         (c)   The written authorization is submitted to the superintendent.
      (4)   If an authorization under this subsection is no longer accurate
because a different individual or position has responsibility for the overall
operation of the facility or overall responsibility for environmental matters
for the company, a new authorization satisfying the requirements of this
subsection must be submitted to the superintendent prior to or together with
any reports to be signed by an authorized representative.
      (5)   Compliance reports by non-domestic users must contain the
certification statement requried by 40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii).
   (M)   It is the responsibility of the permitter to notify the new permittee,
at the time that the permit is granted, of all specifications and regulations
that the permittee is responsible to comply with.

§ 68-193 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND PUBLIC RECORDS.
   Information and data furnished to the city POTW with respect to the nature
and frequency of discharge shall be available to the public or other
governmental agency without restriction unless the discharger specifically
requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city POTW that
the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods
of production entitled to protection as trade secrets or proprietary
information of the discharger. When requested by a discharger furnishing a
report, the portions of a report which may disclose trade secrets or secret
processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be
made available upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to this
article, the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit,
state disposal system permit or the pretreatment programs; provided, however,
that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any
state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the
discharger furnishing the report. Any request that data be kept confidential
must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information. Information accepted by the city POTW as confidential
shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public in
the city until and unless a 10 day (optional) notification is given to the
discharger.
(1993 Code, § 68-192) (Ord. passed 1-22-2001; Ord. 2014-01, passed 1-27-2014)
§ 68-194 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Emergency suspension of service and discharge permits. The city POTW
may for good cause shown suspend the wastewater treatment service, the water
supply service, electrical service, and/or the wastewater discharge permit of a
discharger when it appears to the city POTW that an actual or threatened
discharge presents or threatens:
      (1)   A violation of the NPDES permit;
      (2)   An imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of
persons;
      (3)   An adverse impact to the environment;
      (4)   Interference with the operation of the POTW;
      (5)   Violation of any pretreatment limits imposed by the city pursuant
to this article; or
      (6)   Violation of any wastewater discharge permit issued by the city
pursuant to this article.
   Any discharger notified of the suspension of the city POTW wastewater
treatment service, the water supply service, the electrical service, the
discharger’s wastewater permit, contract or waiver shall, within a period of
time as determined by the approval authority, cease all discharges or be
subject to utility cutoff or sewer blockage by the approval authority. If the
discharger fails to comply voluntarily with the suspension order within the
specified time, the city POTW shall notify the Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality and commence judicial proceedings immediately thereafter
to compel the discharger’s compliance with such order. The city POTW shall
reinstate the wastewater discharge permit, contract or waiver or the wastewater
treatment service and terminate judicial proceedings upon proof by the
discharger of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge or conditions
creating the threat as set forth in this subsection.
   (B)   Revocation of permit, contract or waiver. The city POTW may revoke the
permit, contract or waiver of any discharger which fails to:
      (1)   Factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of
its discharge;
      (2)   Report significant changes in wastewater constituents or
characteristics;
      (3)   Refuses reasonable access to the discharger’s premises by
representatives of the POTW or the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality
for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or
      (4)   Violates the condition of its permit, contract, waiver or this
article or any final judicial order entered with respect thereto.
   (C)   Notice of violation. Upon determination by the POTW that a user has
violated any provision of this article, an industrial discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the POTW
shall serve or cause to be served upon such discharger a written notice, either
personally or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested,
stating the nature of the alleged violation.
      (1)   Unless otherwise specified by the NOV, the following provisions
shall apply: within 30 days of the date of the NOV, the user shall submit to
the POTW an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions.
Submission of the required plan shall not in any way relieve the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after the receipt of the
notice of violation. The POTW shall approve or reject the user’s proposed plan
after receipt thereof.
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to
take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a notice of violation.
      (3)   Failure to comply with any requirement of a notice of violation
shall constitute a separate violation of this article.
   (D)   Orders. The POTW superintendent may issue an order to any user as
determined by the superintendent to be appropriate under the circumstances, as
provide by this section. Multiple orders may be issued simultaneously or in
combination as a single order with respect to a single discharger.
Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, the POTW
superintendent may issue any type of order or orders as determined necessary by
the superintendent to comply with the intent and purposes of this article or
other applicable laws and regulations.
      (1)   Service. An order shall be served upon a user and shall contain the
information as provided in § 68-194(E)(2) of this article. However, orders to
immediately cease and desist discharge, or to terminate sewer services, or
other emergency orders where delay might endanger human health, the environment
or the POTW, may be oral and may be served by telephone to be followed within 5
days by written confirmation of the order by the POTW superintendent.
      (2)   Types of orders. The POTW superintendent may issue the following
types of orders:
         (a)   Order to immediately cease and desist discharge. The POTW
superintendent may issue an order to cease and desist from discharging any
wastewater, pollutant, or discharge not in compliance with this article. The
order shall have immediate effect if the actual or threatened discharge to the
POTW presents, or may present, imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons, to the environment, or causes, or may cause,
interference or pass through. The POTW superintendent shall implement whatever
action is necessary to halt the illegal discharge. The user shall be assessed
for any penalties, fines, charges, surcharges, expenses, or losses incurred due
to the actual or threatened discharge or pollutants as provided by this
article.
         (b)   Order to cease discharge within a certain time. The POTW
superintendent may issue an order to cease and desist from discharging any
wastewater, pollutant, or discharge not in compliance with this article by a
certain time and date. The proposed time for remedial action shall be specified
in the order. In addition to other circumstances as determined appropriate by
the POTW superintendent, the failure to pay applicable permit fees or to comply
with any term of a wastewater discharge permit constitutes sufficient cause to
issue an order under this section.
         (c)   Order to effect pretreatment. The POTW superintendent may issue
an order to a user requiring the user to pretreat its discharge in accordance
with this article. Any user subject to an order to pretreat shall prepare a
plan to pretreat its discharge so that the discharge complies with the
requirements of the order and this article. The plan shall be submitted to the
POTW superintendent within a reasonable period as specified in the order. The
plan shall be prepared in accordance with good engineering practice and shall
state whether construction is necessary, as well as identify measures that can
be completed without construction. The plan shall contain a schedule of
compliance for completion of each of the various phases necessary to implement
full pretreatment. The schedule of compliance must be approved by the POTW
superintendent. The schedule of compliance shall consist of one or more
remedial measures, including enforceable timetables for a sequence of actions
or operations leading to compliance with an effluent standard, or other
prohibition or standard. The following steps or phases shall be included in the
schedule of compliance as determined necessary by the POTW superintendent.
            1.   Retain a qualified engineer and/or consultant.
            2.   Obtain any engineering or scientific investigation or surveys
deemed necessary.
            3.   Prepare and submit a preliminary plan to achieve pretreatment.
            4.   Prepare plans and specifications, working drawings, or other
engineering or architectural documents that may be necessary to effect
pretreatment.
            5.   Establish a time to let any contract necessary for any
construction.
            6.   Establish completion times for any construction necessary.
            7.   Establish a time limit to complete full pretreatment pursuant
to the final order.
            8.   If a phase or unit of construction or implementation may be
effected independently of another phase or unit, establish separate timetables
for the phase or unit.
         (d)   Order to perform affirmative action. The POTW superintendent may
issue an order requiring a user to perform any action determined necessary by
the POTW superintendent under this article, including, but not limited to,
requiring a user to submit samples.; to install sampling, metering and
monitoring equipment; to submit reports; to permit access for inspection,
sampling, testing, monitoring and investigations; to reduce or eliminate a
discharge or pollutants in a discharge; or to pay permit fees or other
applicable charges.
         (e)   Order to terminate sewer services. The POTW superintendent may
issue an order to terminate the sewer services of a user, including physical
blockage of the user's sewer connection, for reasons including, but not limited
to, the following:
            1.   A discharge that violates any general or specific discharge
prohibition, including any pretreatment standard or requirement, and that
reasonably appears to present an imminent endangerment to human health, the
environment or the POTW.
            2.   Failure of a user to notify the POTW of any discharge as
described in §
68-172 of which the user was aware or reasonably should have been aware.
            3.   Failure of a user to sample, monitor, pretreat, report, or
failure to install monitoring or pretreatment facilities, as required by an
order of the POTW superintendent.
            4.   A knowing, willful violation of any term, condition or
requirement of an order or wastewater discharge permit, or any provision of
this article.
            5.   A negligent violation of any major term, condition or
requirement of an order or wastewater discharge permit. For purpose of this
section, a "major" term, condition or requirement is one the violation of which
is reasonably likely to endanger human health, the environment or the POTW. It
shall be a violation of this article for any person to remove or tamper with
any physical blockage or bulkhead installed pursuant to an order under this
article.
            6.   The POTW superintendent's determination that such an order is
necessary to comply with the intent and purposes of this article or other
applicable laws and regulations.
      (3)   Immediate response to order may be required. Any user issued an
order as provided by this section to immediately suspend it discharge to the
POTW shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge using whatever means are
necessary to do so, or take any other action as required by the order. If the
user fails to comply voluntarily with the order to immediately suspend its
discharge, the city shall take any action determined necessary as authorized by
this article, including, but not limited to, immediate suspensions of water
service and/or severance of the sewer connection or commencement of judicial
proceedings, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW or endangerment to
public health, safety or the environment. The city may reinstate the wastewater
treatment service and terminate any judicial proceedings, as applicable, upon
satisfactory proof or other demonstration by the user that the noncomplying
discharge has been eliminated or will not reoccur. A detailed written statement
submitted by the user describing the causes of the noncomplying discharge and
the measures taken to prevent any further occurrence shall be submitted to the
POTW superintendent within 15 days of the occurrence.
      (4)   Noncompliance due to factors beyond user's control. If
noncompliance with an order is unintentional and temporary and due to factors
beyond the reasonable control of a user, and the user can demonstrate the
conditions necessary for demonstration of an upset as provided by § 68-196(A),
the POTW superintendent may modify the order or take other actions as
determined appropriate. However, a user shall not be relieved of liability for
noncompliance with an order to the extent caused by operational error,
improperly designed or inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative
maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
      (5)   Amendment, suspension and revocation of orders. An order shall be
subject to amendment, suspension or revocation as determined appropriate by the
POTW superintendent. Notice of the amendment, suspension or revocation shall be
served upon the user in the same manner as notice was provided for the original
order. An amendment, suspension or revocation of an order shall be subject to
the same procedures for review and appeal as the original issuance of the
order, as provided by this article.
      (6)   Consent orders and agreements. The POTW superintendent may enter
into a consent order or agreement with a user to resolve disputed claims and
address identified and potential deficiencies in the user's compliance status.
The order or agreement shall be in the form of a written agreement with the
user and may contain appropriate provisions, including, but not limited to,
compliance schedules and stipulated fines and remedial actions.
      (7)   POTW authority to require finance assurances. The POTW may require
a noncompliant user to post a performance bond (or other form of surety
acceptable to the POTW superintendent) sufficient to cover expenses that might
reasonably be incurred as a result of future violations. Users that have in the
prior 2 years been responsible for causing interference or pass through at the
POTW may be required to obtain liability insurance sufficient to cover the
reasonable costs of responding or restoring the POTW in the event of a second
such incident. These requirements may also be made conditions of a user's
permit.
   (E)   Service of notices of violations, orders and notices of assessments.
Except as otherwise expressly provided by this article, all orders, notices of
violations and notices of assessments shall be served upon persons and shall
contain the information as provided by this section.
      (1)   Service. Service shall be by personal delivery or certified mail
(return receipt requested), addressed to the user, alleged violator or other
person, as applicable, at the person's last known address as shown by city
records. The person served shall sign and date the order or notice and shall
return the signed original copy to the POTW; provided, that the failure to do
so shall not affect the person's obligation to comply with the order or notice.
Further a notice or order served by mail may not actually be received, but this
shall not nullify any enforcement action subsequently taken by the POTW under
authority of this article.
      (2)   Contents. All orders and notices shall contain at least the
following information, as applicable to the situation and to the extent know by
the POTW:
         (a)   The name and address of the violator;

procedures;
         (i)   The date and time the order or notice was issued.
      (3)   Request for additional information. A person served may request
additional information from the POTW superintendent regarding the contents or
requirements of any order or notice. However, a request for additional
information shall not extend the time for compliance with an order or notice.
   (F)   Show cause hearing. Where the violation of subsection (B) of this
section is not corrected by timely compliance by means of administrative
adjustment, the POTW may order any discharger which causes or allows conduct
prohibited by subsection (B) of this section to show cause before the POTW or
its duly authorized representative why the proposed revocation should not be
taken. A written notice shall be served on the discharger by personal service,
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, specifying the time and
place of a hearing to be held by the POTW or its designee regarding the
violation, the reasons why the enforcement action is to be taken, the proposed
enforcement action and directing the discharger to show cause before the POTW
or its designee why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The
notice of the hearing shall be served no less than 10 days before the hearing.
Service may be made on any agency, officer or authorized representative of a
discharger. The proceedings at the hearing shall be conducted by the city POTW
which shall then enter appropriate orders with respect to the alleged improper
activities of the discharger. Appeal of such orders may be taken by the
discharger in accordance with applicable local or state law.
   (G)   Judicial proceedings. Following the entry of any order by the city
POTW with respect to the conduct of a discharger contrary to the provisions of
subsection (B) of this section, the attorney for the POTW may, following the
authorization of such action by the POTW, commence an action for appropriate,
equitable relief in the appropriate court.
   (H)   Publication of users in significant non-compliance. The POTW shall
publish once per year in the largest daily newspaper in the city a list of
categorical industrial users that, at any time during the previous 12 months,
were in significant non-compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards
or requirements. The POTW may similarly publish a list of non-categorical users

hereby made a lien on all premises served thereby, subject to the remedies
described in §
68-102 of this chapter.
(1993 Code, § 68-194) (Ord. passed 1-22-2001; Ord. 2014-01, passed 1-27-2014)
§ 68-196 UPSET.
   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if all of the
requirements of §
68-196(A) below, are met. However, in the event of an upset, the user may still
be liable for surcharges for exceeding applicable discharge limitations as
provided by this article. In any enforcement proceedings, the user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.

specifying the grounds thereof. The Building Official shall forthwith transmit
to the Board all of the papers constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from was taken.

restraining order, which may be granted by the Board of Appeals or by a court
of record on application, on notice to the Building Official and on due cause
shown.
   (C)   The Board shall select a reasonable time and place for the hearing of

§ 82-59 JURISDICTION.
   (A)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not have the power to alter or
change the zoning district classification of any property, nor to make any
change in the terms of this chapter, but does have power to act on those
matters where this chapter provides for an administrative review,
interpretation, exception or special approval permit and to authorize a
variance as defined in this section and laws of the state. These powers include
the following.
      (1)   Administrative review. To hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged by the applicant that there is an error in any order, requirement,
permit, decision or refusal made by the Building Official or any other
administrative official in carrying out or enforcing any provisions of this
chapter.
      (2)   Variance. To authorize, upon an appeal, a nonuse variance from the
strict application of the provisions of this chapter where by reason of
exceptional narrowness, shallowness, shape or area of a specific piece of
property at the time of enactment of this chapter or by reason of exceptional
topographic conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional conditions of such
property, the strict application of the regulations enacted would result in
peculiar or exceptional undue hardship upon the owner of such property,
provided such relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public
good and without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of this
chapter. In granting a variance the Board may attach thereto such conditions
regarding the location, character, and other features of the proposed uses as
it may deem reasonable in furtherance of the purpose of this chapter. In
granting a variance, the Board shall state the grounds upon which it justifies
the granting of a variance.
      (3)   Exceptions and special approvals. To hear and decide, in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter, requests for exceptions, for
interpretations of the zoning map, and for decisions on special approval
situations on which this chapter specifically authorizes the Board to pass. Any
exception or special approval shall be subject to such conditions as the Board
may require to preserve and promote the character of the zoning district in
question and otherwise promote the purpose of this chapter, including the
following:
         (a)   Interpret the provisions of this chapter in such a way as to
carry out the intent and purpose of the plan, as shown upon the zoning map
fixing the use districts, accompanying and made part of this chapter, where
street layout actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on
the zoning map;
         (b)   Permit the erection and use of a building or use of premises for
public utility purposes, upon recommendation of the Planning Commission;
         (c)   Permit the modification of the automobile parking space or
loading space requirements where, in the particular instance, such modification
will not be inconsistent with the purpose and intent of such requirements;
         (d)   Permit such modification of the height and area regulations as
may be necessary to secure an appropriate improvement of a lot which is of such
shape, or so located with relation to surrounding development or physical
characteristics, that it cannot otherwise be appropriately improved without
such modification;
         (e)   Permit temporary uses for periods not to exceed 2 years in
undeveloped sections of the city and for periods not to exceed 6 months in
developed sections;
         (f)   Permit temporary carport and storage structures. The Board shall
consider the placement of such structures with regard to size, anchoring, type
of construction, and appropriate setbacks of the zoning districts. The Zoning
Board shall determine the length of time the temporary building may be allowed
and may attach reasonable conditions of approval.
         (g)   Permit, upon proper application, the following character of
temporary use, not otherwise permitted in any district, not to exceed 12 months
with the granting of 12-month extensions being permissible: uses which do not
require the erection of any capital improvement of a structural nature.
   (B)   The Board of Appeals, in granting permits for temporary uses pursuant
to subsections (A)(3)(e) and (A)(3)(f) of this section, shall do so under the
following conditions:
      (1)   The granting of the temporary use shall in no way constitute a
change in the basic uses permitted in the district nor on the property wherein
the temporary use is permitted;
      (2)   The granting of the temporary use shall be granted in writing,
stipulating all conditions as to time, nature of development permitted and
arrangements for removing the use at the termination of the temporary permit;
      (3)   All setbacks, land coverage, off-street parking, lighting and other
requirements to be considered in protecting the public health, safety, peace,
morals, comfort, convenience and general welfare of the inhabitants of the city
shall be made at the discretion of the Board of Appeals;
      (4)   In classifying uses as not requiring capital improvement, the Board
of Appeals shall determine that they are either demountable structures related
to the permitted use of the land; recreation developments, such as, but not
limited to, golf driving ranges and outdoor archery courts; or structures which
do not require foundations, heating systems or sanitary connections;
      (5)   The use shall be in harmony with the general character of the
district;
      (6)   No temporary use permit shall be granted without first giving
notice to owners of adjacent property of the time and place of a public hearing
to be held as further provided for in this chapter. Further, the Board of
Appeals shall seek the review and recommendation of the Planning Commission
prior to the taking of any action.
   (C)   In consideration of all appeals and all proposed variations to this
chapter, the Board shall, before making any variations from the chapter in a
specific case, first determine that the proposed variation will not impair an
adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or unreasonably increase
the congestion in public streets, or increase the danger of fire or endanger
the public safety, or unreasonably diminish or impair established property
values within the surrounding area, or in any other respect impair the public
health, safety, comfort, morals or welfare of the inhabitants of the city. The
concurring vote of 4 members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any
order, requirement, decision or determination of the Building Official, or to
decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon which it is authorized by this
chapter to render a decision. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to
give or grant to the Board the power or authority to alter or change this
chapter or the zoning map, such power and authority being reserved to the Mayor
and the City Council in the manner provided by law.

ARTICLE IV. ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS AND OFFICIAL ZONE MAP
§ 82-81 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   The city is hereby divided into districts or zones, as shown on the Official
Zoning Map, which, together with all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.
      (1)   The Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the
Mayor attested by the City Clerk, and bear the seal of the city under the
following words:
"This is to certify that this is the OFFICIAL ZONING MAP referred to in ARTICLE
IV, § 5.15 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Charlotte, Michigan,"
together with the date of the adoption of this chapter. The Official Zoning Map
shall be deposited in the City Clerk's vault when not in actual use.
      (2)   If, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the laws
of the state, changes are made in district boundaries or other matter portrayed
on the Official Zoning Map, such changes shall be made on the Official Zoning
Map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the City Council,
together with an entry on the Official Zoning Map as follows:
On  (date)  , by official action of the City Council, the following (change)
changes were made in the Official Zoning Map, (brief description of the nature
of the change) which entry shall be signed by the Mayor and attested by the
City Clerk. No amendment to this chapter which involves matter portrayed on the
Official Zoning Map shall become effective until after such change and entry
has been made on such map.
      (3)   No changes of any nature shall be made on the Official Zoning Map
or matter shown thereon except in conformity with the provisions set forth in
this chapter. Any unauthorized change of whatsoever kind by any person shall be
considered in violation of this chapter and punishable as provided in this
chapter.
      (4)   Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the Official
Zoning Map which may from time to time be made or published, the Official
Zoning Map above described and deposited in the vault of the City Clerk shall
be the final authority.
      (5)   Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following
the centerlines of streets or highways, street lines or highway right-of-way
lines, such centerlines, street lines, or highway right-of-way lines shall be
construed to be such boundaries.
      (6)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are
approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets, or the centerlines of
right-of- way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as
being parallel thereto and at such distances therefrom as indicated on the
zoning map. If no such distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by
the use of the scale shown on the zoning map.
      (7)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately
follow the lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
      (8)   Where the boundary of a district follows a stream, lake or other
body of water, such boundary line shall be deemed to be located midway between
opposite shores.
      (9)   Where the boundary of a district follows a subdivision boundary
line, such boundary line shall be construed to be the district boundary line.
      (10)   Where unzoned property may exist, or where, due to the scale, lack
of detail or illegibility of the zoning map on file in the office of the City
Clerk, there is any uncertainty, contradiction or conflict as to the intended
location of any district boundaries shown thereon, interpretation concerning
the exact location of district boundary lines shall be determined, upon written
application, or upon its own motion, by the Board of Appeals.

   The following uses may be permitted in One- Family Residential Districts
upon the granting of a permit for such use by the Planning Commission subject

requirements of this article.
   (B)   In all cases where a wall extends to an alley which is a means of
ingress and egress to a parking area, it shall be permissible to end the wall
not more than 10 feet from such alley line in order to permit a wider means of
access to the parking area.
   (C)   In addition to the requirements in this article, such parking area
shall comply with such further requirements or conditions as may be prescribed
by the Planning Commission for the protection of the residential district
abutting such parcel in which the parking area is to be located.

§ 82-407 ACCESS MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   Intent.
      (1)   The intent of this section is to establish roadway access standards
inclusive of driveways, shared drives, frontage and rear access and road
related roadway geometric improvements and access control features.
      (2)   The compliance standards of this section are intended to minimize
potentially hazardous traffic movements and related traffic conflicts, provide
effective spacing standards between driveways and between driveways and
intersections and to ensure reasonable access to properties within desired
public safety standards. The provisions of this section shall apply during the
site plan review process before Planning Commission approval.
   (B)   Driveway spacing.
      (1)   Definitions. For the purposes of this section, a COMMERCIAL
DRIVEWAY is defined as any vehicular access, except those serving single family
or two family residences or serving an essential public service structure.
      (2)   Minimum spacing (commercial). Minimum spacing between 2 commercial
driveways on the same side of the roadway shall be determined based upon the
posted speed limit along the parcel frontage. The minimum spacings indicated
below are measured from centerline to centerline.
 
Posted Speed Limit (MPH) Minimum Driveway Spacing (Feet)
25                       130
30                       185
35                       245
40                       300
45                       350
50                       455
 
      (3)   Left-turn conflicts. To reduce left turn conflicts, new commercial
driveways shall be aligned with existing driveways across the roadway where
possible. If alignment is not possible, driveways should be offset a minimum of
150 feet from existing driveways, measured centerline to centerline, on the
opposite side of the roadway.
      (4)   Minimum spacing. Minimum spacing between proposed driveways and
street intersections shall be subject to the following requirements. The
following measurements are from the nearest edge of the driveway throat to the
nearest edge of the intersection.
 
                                                     Minimum Spacing for a
Location of Driveway        Minimum Spacing for Full Channelized Right-Turn-In,
                            Movement Driveway (Feet) Right-Turn-Out Driveway
                                                     (Feet)
On a major thoroughfare,
intersecting street is a    250                      125
major thoroughfare
On a major thoroughfare,
intersecting street is not  200                      125
a major thoroughfare
On a secondary thoroughfare 125                      75
On a collector street       75                       75
 
      (5)   Number of commercial driveways.
         (a)   The number of commercial driveways serving a property shall be
the minimum number necessary to provide reasonable access and access for
emergency vehicles, while preserving traffic operations and safety along the
public roadway.
         (b)   Access shall be provided for each separately owned parcel. This
access may be an individual driveway, shared driveway, or via a service drive.
Additional driveways may be permitted for the property only as follows: 1
additional driveway may be allowed for properties with continuous frontage over
300 feet, and 1 additional driveway for each additional 300 feet of frontage,
if the Planning Commission determines additional access is justified without
compromising traffic operations along the public street. The applicant shall
submit a traffic impact study if additional access is sought. All driveways
shall comply with the spacing requirements set forth in this section.
         (c)   In making its determination on whether additional access is
justified, the Planning Commission may refer to the following list of
developments, that generate enough traffic to warrant consideration of
additional access. Where possible, additional access points should be located
on a side street, shared with adjacent uses, or designed for right-turn-in,
right-turn-out only movements.
            1.   Multiple family developments with over 500 units.
            2.   Grocery store of over 30,000 square feet (GFA).
            3.   Shopping center with over 40,000 square feet (GFA).
            4.   Hotel or motel with over 400 rooms.
            5.   Industrial developments with over 300,000 square feet (GFA) or
350 employees, although a secondary entrance for trucks should be allowed.
            6.   Warehouses of over 750,000 square feet (GFA) or 350 employees.
            7.   Mobile home park with over 600 units.
            8.   General office building of 150,000 square feet (GFA) or 500
employees.
            9.   Medical office building of 60,000 square feet (GFA) or 200
employees.
            10.   Fast food restaurant of over 6,000 square feet (GFA).
            11.   Sit down restaurant of over 20,000 square feet (GFA).
      (6)   Shared driveways and service roads.
         (a)   Where the Planning Commission determines that reducing the
number of access points may have a beneficial impact on traffic operations and
safety while preserving the property owner's right to reasonable access, a
shared driveway or service drive connecting 2 or more properties or uses may be
required. In particular, service drives may be required where recommended in
the Master Plan or corridor plan, near existing traffic signals or near
locations having traffic volumes and along segments of roadway with a
relatively high number of accidents or limited sight distance.
         (b)   Shared driveways and service drives shall be within a recorded
access easement.
         (c)   The Planning Commission may allow temporary access where the
service road is not completed if a performance bond or other financial
guarantee is provided which assures the elimination of the temporary access
upon completion of the service road. Occupancy permits shall not be issued
until such financial guarantee has been submitted to the city.
      (7)   Driveway Width. The following standards shall apply unless
engineering judgement determines that another dimension is more suitable for a
particular site.
         (a)   The standard two-way commercial driveway design shall include 1
ingress lane and 1 egress lane with a combined width of 30 feet, measured from
face of curb to face of curb.
         (b)   Where exit volumes are expected to exceed 1,000 vehicles per
day, 100 during peak hours, or in areas where it is determined that undesirable
motorist delays will occur, 2 egress lanes may be required. Such driveways
shall include 1 15-foot wide ingress lane and 2 11.5-foot wide egress lanes (1
marked exclusively for left turns). In areas where significant pedestrian/
bicycle travel is expected, the egress and ingress lanes shall be separated by
a 6 to 10 foot wide median with a pedestrian refuge area.
         (c)   Where driveways are to be located on a road segment having a
high accident rate or significant traffic congestion/delays, or where left run
access is available through alternative means of access, the Planning
Commission may require driveway design and signing which prohibits certain
turning movements.
         (d)   For access arrangements which include 2 one-way driveways, such
as a right-turn-in and right-turn-out only arrangements, each driveway shall be
16 feet wide, measured perpendicular to the curb, and angled to minimize the
disruption of traffic flow.
      (8)   Engineering judgement. Engineering judgement shall be utilized to
determine the necessary throat length, but in no case shall it be less than 25
feet.
      (9)   Angle of commercial driveways. Commercial driveways shall be on a
90 degree angle with roadway unless physical modification and/or directional
signs are used to enforce intended one-way operations or restricted movements.
      (10)   Deceleration and acceleration lanes and tapers. Deceleration and
acceleration lanes and tapers where warranted by either through traffic
conditions or expected high driveway volumes shall be used to avoid the
disruption in the flow of traffic.
(1993 Code, § 82-407) (Ord. passed 2-12-2001; Ord. passed 9-10-2001(3))
Editor's note:
   Ord. of Feb. 12, 2001, § 82-474, set out provisions intended for use as §
82-471. At the City Clerk's request, these provisions have been included as §
82-407.
§ 82-408 MARGINAL SERVICE ROADS; INTENT.
   Marginal service roads may be required by the Planning Commission, after
consultation with the traffic engineer, when it is determined by the Commission
that an excessive number of ingress and egress roads may occur with relation to
a major or secondary thoroughfare and that reducing the number of points of
access to the thoroughfare is in the best interest of the city. Unless the
property owner demonstrates that an alternative design would be in the public
interest, as determined by the Planning Commission, marginal service roads may
be required.
(1993 Code, § 82-408) (Ord. passed 2-25-1991; Ord. passed 5-14-2001; Ord.
passed 3-11-2002(1))
§ 82-409 MARGINAL SERVICE ROADS; REQUIRED CONDITIONS.
   Uses permitted in this chapter shall be subject to the following conditions.
      (1)   In those instances where the Planning Commission finds that an
excessive number of ingress or egress points may occur with relation to major
or secondary thoroughfares, the Commission may require marginal service roads
and, to assure adequate traffic circulation on the site, may require the
development of parking so that contiguous lots on abutting properties will
allow traffic circulation from 1 property to another without re-entering the
public thoroughfare.
      (2)   The pavement of the marginal service road shall be located 10 feet
from the future right-of- way line of the thoroughfare and shall be at least 24
feet wide except in the situation where existing adjacent parking lots are to
be connected by way of a common maneuvering lane and a greater width cannot be
provided, the such service road shall be at least 22 feet in width. Said
service road shall be an easement which will permit the use of the service road
for traffic circulation from 1 property to another. Said easement shall be in a
written form acceptable to the City Council prior to the issuance of a building
permit and shall run with the land and benefit/burden the heirs, assigns and
transferees of the properties to be served by the drives. No permanent
structures shall be permitted within the easements. Each property owner shall
be responsible for maintenance of the easement so that it remains usable as a
means of getting from 1 property to another. The Street Administrator will
cause the service road to be maintained if the property owner fails in his
responsibility, and all costs will be charged to the property and added to the
taxes if not paid. The easement shall be recorded with the County Register of
Deeds.
      (3)   Building permits for the property to be served by the marginal
service roads shall not be issued unless and until such drives have been
completed, or a performance guarantee has been posted with the city for such
purposes.
      (4)   When marginal service roads are required, the Planning Commission
shall require that the entire 24 foot area be paved up to the abutting
properties. Backing from parking spaces onto the marginal service shall not be
permitted. The site plan shall indicate the proposed elevation of the marginal
access service road at the property line and the Street Administrator shall
maintain a record of all marginal service road elevations so that their grades
can be coordinated. Marginal service road elevations shall conform to
elevations established by the Council or, if not so established, be not more
than 1 foot above the elevation of the adjoining property. Marginal service
roads shall meet construction specifications set by the Street Administrator
based on current engineering practices and principals for the construction of
base, pavement and draining facilities, and the like.
      (5)   The 10 foot setback area between the future road right-of-way and
the service road shall be kept in grass and landscaped in accordance with plans
approved by the Planning Commission.
      (6)   Temporary entrances and exits may be approved for individual sites
provided money is placed in escrow to assure elimination of temporary entrances
and exits. Building permits shall not be issued until monies have been
deposited with the city.
      (7)   In determining which entrances and exits will be permanent and
which will be temporary, the Planning Commission shall generally be guided by
the requirements of §
82-407, access management standards.

§ 82-427 NOTES TO SCHEDULE.
   (A)   See §
82-428, averaged lot size, and §
82-429, subdivision open space plan, regarding flexibility allowances.
   (B)   For all uses permitted other than single family residential, the
setback shall equal the height of the main building or the setback required in
§
82-108 or §
82-426, whichever is greater. For all lots of record having less than 70 feet
of lot width, the minimum required side yards shall be 5 feet and 10 feet.
   (C)   In the case of a rear yard abutting a side yard, the side yard setback
abutting a street shall not be less than the minimum front yard setback of the
district in which located and all regulations applicable to a front yard shall
apply.
   (D)   In an RM-2 Multiple Family District, the total number of rooms, not
including kitchen, dining and sanitary facilities, shall not be more than the
area of the parcel, in square feet, divided by 1,200. All units shall have at
least 1 living room and 1 bedroom, except that not more than 10% of the units
may be of an efficiency apartment type. For the purpose of computing the
permitted number of dwelling units per acre, the following room assignments
shall control:
      Efficiency      =   1 room
      One bedroom      =   2 rooms
      Two bedroom      =   3 rooms
      Three bedroom   =   4 rooms
      Four bedroom      =   5 rooms
Plans presented showing 1, 2 or 3 bedroom units and including a den, library or
other extra room shall count such extra room as a bedroom for the purpose of
computing density. The area used for computing density shall be the total site
area exclusive of any dedicated public right-of-way of either interior or
bounding roads. For the RM-1 District a minimum of 4,000 square feet of lot or
site area shall be provided for each dwelling unit.
   (E)   In all RM-1 and RM-2 Multiple Family Residential Districts, the
minimum distance between any 2 buildings shall be regulated according to the
length and height of such buildings, and in no instance shall this distance be
less than 30 feet. Parking may be permitted within a required side or rear yard
but shall not cover more than 30% of the area of any required yard or any
minimum distance between buildings. The formula regulating the required minimum
distance between 2 buildings in all RM Districts is as follows:
         LA + LB + 2(HA + HB)
   S   =                                        
             6
Where:
   S   =   Required minimum horizontal distance between any wall of building A
and any wall of building B or the vertical prolongation of either.
   LA   =   Total length of building A. The total length of building A is the
length of that portion of a wall of building A from which, when viewed directly
from above, lines drawn perpendicular to building A will intersect any wall of
building B.
   LB   =   Total length of building B. The total length of building B is the
length of that portion of a wall of building B from which, when viewed directly
from above, the lines drawn perpendicular to building B will intersect any wall
of building A.
   HA   =   Height of building A. The height of building A at any given level
is the height above natural grade level of any portion of a wall along the
length of building A. Natural grade level shall be the mean level of the ground
immediately adjoining the portion of the wall along the total length of the
building.
   HB   =   Height of building B. The height of building B at any given level
is the height above natural grade level of any portion of a wall along the
length of building B. Natural grade level shall be the mean level of the ground
immediately adjoining the portion of the wall along the total length of the
building.
   (F)   The distance from the front lot line to the nearest point of a
principal building shall not be less than 25 feet, except that where an entire
block frontage is developed at one time, under single ownership or control,
then the minimum setback may be reduced to 20 feet, provided that the average
setback for all structures shall not be less than 25 feet.
   (G)   Off-street parking shall be permitted to occupy a portion of the
required front yard, provided that there shall be maintained a minimum
unobstructed and landscaped setback of 10 feet between the nearest point of the
off-street parking area, exclusive of access driveways, and the nearest right-
of-way line as indicated on the Thoroughfare Plan of the Master Plan of Future
Land Use.
   (H)   No side yards are required along the interior side lot lines of the
district, except as otherwise specified in the Building Code, provided that if
walls of structures facing such interior side lot lines contain windows, or
other openings, side yards of not less than 10 feet shall be provided. On a
corner lot which has a common rear lot line with a residential district, there
shall be provided a setback of not less than 10 feet on the side bordering the
residential district or street.
   (I)   Off-street loading space shall be provided in the rear yard in the
ratio of at least 1 space for each establishment and shall be provided in
addition to any required off-street parking area. Off-street loading space
shall further meet the requirements of §
82-457. This provision shall not apply in the CBD District. In those instances
where properties abut an alley, such alley may be substituted for off-street
loading requirements in business districts. In office districts off-street
loading may take place in undesignated places in parking lots, provided such
loading is of a short-term nature.
   (J)   No building shall be closer than 75 feet to any adjacent residential
district or to any major thoroughfare.
   (K)   Off-street parking shall be permitted in a required side yard setback.
   (L)   Off-street parking may be permitted within the required front yard,
provided that such off-street parking is not located within 20 feet of the
front lot line.
   (M)   No building shall be located closer than 50 feet or the height of the
building, whichever is the greater, to the outer perimeter (property line) of
such district when the property line abuts any residential district.
   (N)   All storage shall be in the rear yard and shall be completely screened
with an obscuring wall or fence, not less than 6 feet high, or with a chainlink
type fence and a greenbelt planting so as to obscure all view from any adjacent
residential, office, or business district or from a public street.

§ 82-428 AVERAGED LOT SIZE.
   The intent of this section is to permit the subdivider or developer to vary
lot sizes and lot widths so as to average the minimum size of lot per unit as
required in the schedule of regulations in this article for each one-family
residential district. If this option is selected, the following conditions
shall be met.
      (1)   In meeting the average minimum lot size, the subdivision shall be
so designed as not to create lots having an area or width greater than 10%
below that area or width required in the schedule of regulations and shall not
create an attendant increase in the number of lots.
      (2)   Each final plat submitted as part of a preliminary plat shall
average the minimum required for the district in which it is located.
      (3)   All computations showing lot area and the average resulting through
this technique shall be indicated on the print of the preliminary plat.
(1993 Code, § 82-428) (Ord. passed 10-12-1992)
§ 82-429 SUBDIVISION OPEN SPACE PLAN.
   (A)   The intent of the subdivision open space plan is to promote the
following objectives:
      (1)   Provide a more desirable living environment by preserving the
natural character of open fields, stands of trees, brooks, hills and similar
natural assets;
      (2)   Encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the
development of residential areas;
      (3)   Encourage a more efficient, aesthetic and desirable use of open
area while recognizing a reduction in development costs and allowing the
developer to by-pass natural obstacles on the site;
      (4)   Encourage the provision of open space within reasonable distance to
all lot development of the subdivision and to further encourage the development
of recreational facilities.
   (B)   Modifications to the standards as outlined in the schedule of
regulations in this article may be made in the one-family residential districts
when the following conditions are met.
      (1)   The lot area in all one-family residential districts, which are
served by a public sanitary sewer system, may be reduced up to 20%. In the R-
1 District, this reduction may be accomplished in part by reducing lot widths
up to 5 feet. In the R-2 Districts, this reduction may be accomplished in part
by reducing lot widths up to 10 feet. These lot area reductions shall be
permitted provided that the dwelling unit density shall be no greater than if
the land area to be subdivided were developed in the minimum square foot lot
areas as required for each one-family district under the schedule of
regulations in this article. All calculations shall be predicated upon the one-
family districts having the following gross densities (including roads):
   R-1   =   3.8 dwelling units per acre.
   R-2   =   2.7 dwelling units per acre.
      (2)   Rear yards may be reduced to 30 feet when such lots border on land
dedicated for park, recreation and/or open space purposes, provided that the
width of the dedicated land shall not be less than 100 feet measured at the
point at which it abuts the rear yard of the adjacent lot.
      (3)   Under the provisions of subsection (B)(1) of this section, for each
square foot of land gained within a residential subdivision through the
reduction of lot size below the minimum requirements as outlined in the
schedule of regulations, at least equal amounts of land shall be dedicated to
the common use of the lot owners of the subdivision in a manner approved by the
municipality.
      (4)   The area to be dedicated for subdivision open space purposes shall
in no instance be less than 4 acres and shall be in a location and shape
approved by the Planning Commission.
      (5)   The land area necessary to meet the minimum requirements of this
section shall not include bodies of water, swamps or land with excessive grades
making it unsuitable for recreation. All land dedicated shall be so graded and
developed as to have natural drainage. The entire area may, however, be located
in a floodplain.
      (6)   This plan, for reduced lot sizes, shall be permitted only if it is
mutually agreeable to the City Council and the subdivider or developer.
      (7)   This plan, for reduced sizes, shall be started within 6 months
after having received approval of the final plat and must be completed in a
reasonable time. Failure to start within this period shall void all previous
approval.
      (8)   Under this planned unit approach, the developer or subdivider shall
dedicate the total park area (see subsection (B)(1) of this section) at the
time of filing of the final plat or any portion of the plat.
(1993 Code, § 82-429) (Ord. passed 10-12-1992)
§ 82-430 SINGLE-FAMILY CLUSTERING OPTION.
   The intent of this section is to permit the development of single-family
residential patterns which, through design innovation, will introduce
flexibility so as to provide for the sound physical handling of site plans in
situations where the normal subdivision approach would otherwise be
unnecessarily restrictive. To accomplish this, the following modifications to
the single-family residential standards shall be permitted subject to the
conditions herein imposed.
      (1)   Under this section, the attaching of single family homes will be
permitted when the homes are attached through a common party wall which does
not have over 60% of its area in common with an abutting dwelling wall; by
means of an architectural wall detail which does not form interior room space;
or through a common party wall in only the garage portion of adjacent
structures, there being no common party wall relationship permitted through any
other portion of the residential unit.
      (2)   The number of units attached in the above manner shall not exceed
4.
      (3)   Yard requirements may be modified as follows.
         (a)   Yards abutting a street may be reduced to not less than 25 feet.
         (b)   Spacing between groups of attached units or individual units
shall be at least 20 feet in the R-1 District and 15 feet in the R-2 District.
         (c)   That side of a cluster adjacent to a service drive or private
land shall not be nearer to said drive or land than 10 feet.
      (4)   In all single-family residential districts on parcels of land
meeting certain criteria, densities in a cluster development may be increased
to the following maximum (including street right-of-way):
   R-1 District   =   4.5 dwelling units/acre.
   R-2 District   =   3.7 dwelling units/acre.
      (5)   The Planning Commission may approve the clustering or attaching of
buildings on parcels of land, under single ownership and control, which, in the
opinion of the Planning Commission, have characteristics which would make sound
physical development under the normal subdivision approach impractical because
of parcel size, shape or dimension or because of steep topography, soil
problems or similar natural conditions. In approving an area for cluster
development at the densities permitted in subsection (4) of this section, the
Planning Commission shall find at least 1 of the following conditions to exist.
         (a)   The parcel to be developed is generally parallel to, and
generally does not exceed 400 feet in depth, on those unsubdivided parcels of
land abutting a major thoroughfare or freeway of at least 120 feet of right-of-
way width so as to provide transition between the major thoroughfare and
adjacent single-family detached housing.
         (b)   The parcel contains major topographic problems which, in the
opinion of the Planning Commission, would make sound physical development under
the normal subdivision approach impractical. In approving these areas for
single-family cluster development, the Planning Commission shall find that:
            1.   Slopes within the site in excess of 10% appear as a typical
feature of the site rather than an exceptional or infrequent feature of the
site;
            2.   The achieving of the road grades of less than 10% is
impossible unless the site was mass graded. The providing of one-family
clusters will, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, allow a greater
preservation of the natural setting.
         (c)   A small parcel which is shaped in such a way that it contains
acute angles which would make a normal subdivision difficult to achieve and has
frontage on a major or secondary thoroughfare.
         (d)   A substantial part of the parcel's perimeter is bordered by a
major thoroughfare which would result in a substantial proportion of the lots
of the development abutting the major thoroughfare.
         (e)   The parcel contains a floodplain or poor soil conditions which
result in a substantial portion of the total area of the parcel being
unbuildable. Soil test borings, floodplain maps or other documented evidence
must be submitted to the Planning Commission in order to substantiate the
parcel's qualification for cluster development.
         (f)   The parcel contains natural assets which could be preserved
through the use of cluster development. Such assets may include natural stands
of large trees, land which serves as a natural habitat for wildlife, unusual
topographic features, or other natural assets which, in the opinion of the
Planning Commission, should be preserved. Requests for qualification under
these conditions must be supported by documented evidence which indicates that
the natural assets would qualify the parcel under this option.
      (6)   The area in open space accomplished through the use of one-family
clusters shall represent at least 15% of the horizontal development area of a
one-family cluster development.
      (7)   In order to provide an orderly transition where the project
proposed for use as a cluster development abuts a one-family residential
district, the Planning Commission shall determine that the abutting one family
district is effectively buffered by means of 1 of the following within the
cluster development: single-family lots subject to the standards of the
schedule of regulations, open or recreation space, changes in topography which
provides an effective buffer, a major or secondary thoroughfare, some other
similar means of providing a transition.
      (8)   Any area to be dedicated for park, recreation or open space
purposes as a result of the application of this section shall be subject to
review and approval of the Planning Commission for minimum size, shape,
location, access, the character of any improvement and assurance of the
permanence of the open space and its continued maintenance.
      (9)   In submitting a proposed layout under this section, the sponsor of
the development shall include, along with the site plan, the proposed building
elevations and typical floor plans, an indication of existing and proposed
public easements, soil information or data sufficient to determine the
buildability of the site, topography drawn at a 2 foot contour interval, all
computation relative to acreage and density, and any other details which will
assist in reviewing the proposed plan.
      (10)   Approval of a site plan under this section shall be effective for
a period of 1 year. Development not started in this period shall be considered
as abandoned and authorization shall expire requiring that any proposed
development thereafter shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning
Commission. Any proposed change in site plan or building plans, after approval
has been received, shall require review and approval by the Planning Commission
prior to effecting the change.
      (11)   Application of this option shall only be permitted when the site
plan has been reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission.

§ 82-431 CONDOMINIUM SUBDIVISION.
   (A)   The intent of this section is to permit the development of single-
family detached dwellings by site planning the layout of individual dwellings,
streets and open space. To accomplish development under this option, the
following conditions shall apply. In the one-family residential districts, the
site planning of individual single-family dwellings may be permitted after
review of a site plan by the Planning Commission in accordance with the public
hearing requirements set forth and regulated in §
82-34(C).
   (B)   The Planning Commission in making its review shall find that the
following minimum standards are fully met.
      (1)   The maximum number of individual single family dwellings per acre,
throughout the entire site, shall not exceed the dwelling unit density level of
the one-family district in which the site is located. These densities,
including roads, are as follows:
         (a)   R-1 One-Family Residential Districts   =   3.8 dwellings/acre.
         (b)   R-2 One-Family Residential Districts   =   2.7 dwellings/acre.
      (2)   An area equal to the minimum land area requirement of the district
shall be provided for each dwelling unit, including the building envelope.
      (3)   Setbacks shall be provided for each building envelope equal to the
minimum setback requirements of the district as set forth below.
         (a)   Front setback shall be measured from the street right-of-way, or
from the similar line of a private street easement, to the front of the
building envelope.
         (b)   Side setback shall be measured from building envelope to
building envelope and shall be at least equal to the total minimum side yard
setback requirement of the district between 2 single family detached dwellings.
         (c)   Rear setback shall be measured from the rear line of the
building envelope to the rear property line or to the nearest common space
area.
      (4)   All streets shall be built to public street standards and may be
dedicated to the city as public streets or remain as private streets. All
public streets shall be located within an appropriate right-of-way as set forth
in the city's Master Plan. Private streets shall be located within an easement
equal in width to the appropriate street right-of-way.
      (5)   All streets, utilities and improvements required for subdivision
shall be installed to applicable city standards.
      (6)   The condominium subdivision plan shall include all necessary
easements granted to the city for the purposes of constructing, operating,
inspecting, maintaining, repairing, altering, replacing and/or removing
pipelines, mains, conduits and other installations of a similar character for
the purpose of providing public utilities, including conveyance of sewage,
water and stormwater run-off across, through and under the property subject to
the easement, and excavating and refilling ditches and trenches necessary for
the location of the structures.
      (7)   The maximum number of stories and building height restrictions of
the district shall be met as shall the minimum floor area requirements of the
district. Any detached accessory uses shall comply with the applicable
standards of this chapter for such uses. Setbacks required for such uses shall
be measured from the outer perimeter of the land area boundaries as required in
this section for each individual single-family detached dwelling.

ARTICLE XXI. SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS
§ 82-451 CONFLICTING REGULATIONS.
   Whenever any provision of this chapter imposes more stringent requirements,
regulations, restrictions or limitations than are imposed or required by the
provisions of any other law or ordinance, then the provisions of this chapter
shall govern. Whenever the provisions of any other law or ordinance impose more
stringent requirements than are imposed or required by this chapter, then the
provisions of such law or ordinance shall govern. This provision shall not
apply to mobile home parks which are regulated in accord with Public Act 96 of
1987, being M.C.L.A. §§ 125.2301 et seq., as amended.
(1993 Code, § 82-451) (Ord. passed 10-12-1992)
§ 82-452 SCOPE.
   No building or structure, or part thereof, shall be erected, constructed or
altered and maintained, and no new use or change shall be made or maintained of
any building, structure or land, or part thereof, except in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter.
(1993 Code, § 82-452) (Ord. passed 10-12-1992)
§ 82-453 NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES OF LAND, STRUCTURES, AND USES OF STRUCTURES
AND PREMISES.
   (A)   Intent.
      (1)   Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that
may later be adopted there exist lots, structures, and uses of land and
structures which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but
which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this
chapter or future amendment.
      (2)   It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to
continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Such uses
are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the
districts involved. It is further the intent of this chapter that
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used
as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district.
      (3)   A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or
a nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged
after passage of this chapter by attachment on a building or premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition
of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district
involved.
      (4)   It is further recognized that certain nonconforming uses and
structures do not significantly depress the value of nearby properties and are
not contrary to the public health, safety and welfare and that such use or
structure was lawful at the time of its inception and that no useful purpose
would be served by the strict applications of requirements for nonconformities
under this chapter and, therefore, 2 classes of nonconforming use and structure
are designated, being class A and class B.
      (5)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building
construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is defined to
include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and
fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of an
existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such
demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that
work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building involved
and provided further that all work shall be done pursuant to a valid permit.
   (B)   Class A nonconforming uses or structures. Those nonconforming uses or
structures which have been designated by the Planning Commission, after
hearing, as class A, providing findings that the following conditions exist
with respect to the use or structure.
      (1)   The use or structure was lawful at its inception.
      (2)   Continuance of the use or structure does not significantly depress
property values of nearby properties.
      (3)   Continuance of the use or structure would not be contrary to the
public health, safety or welfare or the spirit of this chapter.
      (4)   An improvement to an existing nonconforming condition will result.
      (5)   No useful purpose would be served by strict application of the
provisions of this chapter with which the use or structure does not conform.
   (C)   Class A conditions. The decision to grant a class A designation shall
be made in writing, setting forth the findings and reasons on which it is
based. Conditions may be attached, including time limits where deemed necessary
to assure the use or structure does not become contrary to the public health,
safety or welfare or the spirit and purpose of this chapter and further to
assure that at least the following standards are met.
      (1)   Screening and landscaping should be provided in keeping with
community standards to provide compatibility with adjacent uses.
      (2)   Effects which may have a negative impact such as lighting, noise or
visual impact should be minimized.
      (3)   Where such use is in close proximity to homes, parking should not
be permitted to utilize curb side parking to an extent greater than the
immediate property frontage of the nonconforming use.
      (4)   New signage should meet zoning district requirements. Existing
nonconforming signs may be required to be eliminated or reduced in size and
number as the Commission may, in its judgment, determine.
      (5)   The exterior building materials utilized in any alteration to the
building shall be harmonious with materials on abutting properties whenever
practical.
      (6)   Enlargement of a building may be allowed provided such enlargement
does not create a more nonconforming yard setback condition which would impact
on conforming properties in the immediate vicinity.
      (7)   The Commission may require such other safeguards and improvements
as it may deem necessary to protect conforming uses in the surrounding area.
   No class A nonconforming use or structure shall be resumed if it has been
discontinued for 6 consecutive months or 18 months in any 3-year period. No
class A nonconforming use or structure shall be used, altered or enlarged in
violation of any condition imposed in its designation.
   (D)   Revocation of class A designation. Any class A designation shall be
revoked, following the same procedure required for designation, upon a finding
that as a result of any change of conditions or circumstances the use or
structure no longer qualifies for class A designation.
   (E)   Class B nonconforming uses or structures. All nonconforming uses or
structures, not designated class A, shall be class B nonconforming uses or
structures. Class B nonconforming uses and structures shall comply with all the
provisions of this chapter relative to nonconforming uses and structures. To
avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a
change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building construction has
been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined to include
the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of an existing
building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding such demolition
or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall
be diligently carried on until completion of the building involved.
   (F)   Reactivation of discontinued nonconforming use or structure. A
nonconforming use of land or structure which is discontinued or ceases to exist
as specified in subsections (H)(3) and (J)(5) of this section may be reinstated
as a class A nonconforming use or structure by the Planning Commission after
hearing and after finding that the following conditions exist or will be met
with respect to the use or structure.
      (1)   The proposed use will be the same type of use as the previous use
which occupied the property or a new use which is no more intensive than the
previous use. Example: In a residential zone a business use allowed in a B-
1 Local Business District exists, such use may be replaced by another B-1 use
or a higher use such as an OS-1 or RM use but shall not be replaced by a more
intense use such as those allowed in a B-2, B-3, CBD or Industrial District.
      (2)   That conditions specified in subsections (B)(2) through (4) of this
section will be complied with.
      (3)   A determination shall be made by the Planning Commission that the
use or structure will be a blighting influence on the neighborhood if not
allowed to be occupied.
   (G)   Nonconforming lots. In any district in which single-family dwellings
are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this
chapter, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be
erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter. This provision shall apply even though such lot
fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally
applicable in the district; provided that yard dimensions and other
requirements not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to
the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance to yard
requirements may be obtained through the Board of Appeals.
   (H)   Non conforming uses of land. Where, at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this chapter, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer
permissible under the terms of this chapter as enacted or amended, such use may
be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions.
      (1)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
      (2)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
      (3)   If such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than 30 days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to
the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such land
is located.
   (I)   Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not be built
under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot
coverage, height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or its
location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
      (1)   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity. Such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which does not increase its nonconformity.
      (2)   Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of
more than 50% of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not
be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
      (4)   Should such structure be a pre-existing porch or deck, and provided
that the structure's footprint remains the same or is made smaller, it may be
replaced due to age or structural issues.
   (J)   Nonconforming uses of structures and land. If a lawful use of a
structure, or of structure and land in combination, exists at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, that would not be allowed in the
district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued as
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
      (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
      (2)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use, and which
existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use
shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
      (3)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and land in combination, may be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same or a more restricted classification, provided the
use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the
existing nonconforming use. Where a nonconforming use of a structure, land, or
structure and land in combination is changed to a more conforming use, it shall
not thereafter be changed to a less conforming use.
      (4)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
      (5)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises
in combination, is discontinued or ceases to exist for 6 consecutive months or
for 18 months during any 3 year period, the structure, or structure and land in
combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the
regulations of the district in which it is located. Structures occupied by
seasonal uses shall be excepted from this provision.
      (6)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises
in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
   (K)   Repairs and maintenance. On any building devoted in whole or in part
to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive
months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls,
fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding 50% of the assessed
value of the building, provided that the cubic content of the building as it
existed at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter shall not be
increased. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening
or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
such official.
      (1)   Uses under exception provisions not nonconforming uses. Any use for
which a general exception or conditional use approval is required as provided
in this chapter shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall without
further action be deemed a conforming use in such district.
   (M)   Change of tenancy or ownership. There may be a change of tenancy,
ownership or management of any existing nonconforming uses of land, structures
or structures and land in combination.
   (N)   Applications for temporary use permits. Businesses located in OS-1, B-
l, B-2, B-3 and CBD Districts and churches, wherever located, within the
corporate limits of the city, may make applications for temporary use permits
where they desire to promote business sales which would normally be prohibited
in their zoning district. Such application may only be made where the sales
promotion bears a reasonable relationship to the business normally permitted in
that district. The Planning Commission shall determine whether the lawful
business bears a reasonable relationship to the prohibited business for which a
special use permit is sought. Where the Planning Commission decides that such a
reasonable relationship exists, it may grant a temporary use permit, provided:
      (1)   The principal use has previously been granted site plan approval;
      (2)   The principal use is in compliance with all current city zoning
regulations;
      (3)   The temporary use does not create a public safety problem as
determined by the Police Department;
      (4)   The temporary use does not exceed 30 days;
      (5)   Commitment is made to restore any lawn areas where temporary use
may have taken place;
      (6)   Adequate parking would remain available for the building for the
principal use;
      (7)   A zoning officer finds the application would not impair the health,
safety, and welfare of the general public.
   In conjunction with a temporary use permit, 1 sign not to exceed 20 square
feet will be allowed and may be placed on the front or side yard setback,
provided that it does not interfere with public safety as determined by the
Police Department. Upon approval of the Planning Commission and the applicant
meeting all of the conditions of approval, the Building Official is authorized
to execute a temporary use permit.
(1993 Code, § 82-453) (Ord. passed 10-12-1992; Ord. passed 1-11-1999(1); Ord.
passed 4-9-2007(1))
§ 82-454 ACCESSORY BUILDINGS AND USES.
   Accessory buildings, structures and uses, except as otherwise permitted in
this chapter, shall be subject to the following regulations.
   (A)   Where the accessory building is structurally attached to a main
building, it shall be subject to, and must conform to, all yard regulations of
this chapter applicable to main buildings.
   (B)   Accessory buildings shall not be erected in any minimum side or front
yard setback.
   (C)   A building accessory to a residential building may occupy not more
than 25% of required rear yard, provided that in no instance shall the
accessory building exceed 100% of the ground floor area of the main building.
On a corner lot all of the land to the rear of the house may be utilized in the
computation of percent of lot coverage for accessory buildings.
   (D)   A detached building accessory to a residential building shall not be
located closer than ten feet to any main building nor shall it be located
closer than five feet to any side or rear lot line. In those instances where
the rear lot line is coterminous with an alley right-of-way, the accessory
building shall be no closer than one foot to such rear lot line. In no instance
shall an accessory structure be located within a dedicated easement right-of-
way.
   (E)   No detached accessory structures in the R-1, R-2, RT, RM-1, RM-2, MH,
OS-l, B-1 and P-1 Districts shall exceed 18 feet in height; provided, however,
when the detached accessory building is located in a rear yard with a ground
elevation lower than that of surrounding the primary residential structure, the
height of the accessory building may be measured from a plane parallel to the
first floor of the primary residential structure. Accessory structures in all
other districts may be constructed to equal the permitted maximum height of
structures in such districts.
   (F)   In no case shall a residential accessory structure have a flat, level
roof. All accessory structure roofs must be sloped to allow water drainage.
   (G)   Temporary carport and storage structures, whether manufactured or
home-built, shall adhere to all requirements of §
82-545 for detached accessory structures. Permits for temporary carports and
storage structures are limited to a period of two years, and said temporary
carport or storage structure shall be removed upon expiration. Temporary
carport and storage structures shall be securely fastened to ground in a manner
sufficient to prevent its detachment due to wind or weather.
   (H)   When a building accessory to a residential building is located on a
corner lot, the side lot line of which is substantially a continuation of the

(Ord. passed 10-12-1992)
§ 82-458 USES NOT OTHERWISE INCLUDED WITHIN A SPECIFIC USE DISTRICT.
   Because the uses referred to in this section possess unique characteristics
making it impractical to include them in a specific use district
classification, they may be permitted by the city council after review by the
planning commission under the conditions specified, and after public hearing.
In every case, the uses hereinafter referred to in this section shall be
specifically prohibited from all residential districts. These uses require
special residential districts. These uses require special consideration since
they service an area larger than the city and require sizable land areas,
creating problems of control with reference to abutting use districts.
Reference to those uses failing specifically within the intent of this section
is as follows:
   (A)   Outdoor theaters. Because outdoor theaters possess the unique
characteristic of being used only after darkness and since they develop a
concentration of vehicular traffic in terms of ingress and egress from their
parking area, they may be permitted in I-1 districts. Outdoor theaters shall
further be subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   The proposed internal design shall receive approval from the
building official and the city engineer as to adequacy of drainage, lighting
and other technical aspects.
      (2)   Points of ingress and egress shall be available to the outdoor
theater from abutting major thoroughfares (86-foot right-of-way or greater),
and shall not be available from any residential street.
      (3)   All vehicles waiting or standing to enter the facility shall be
provided off-street waiting space. No vehicle shall be permitted to wait or
stand within a dedicated right-of-way.
      (4)   The area shall be so laid out as to prevent the movie screen from
being viewed from residential areas or adjacent major thoroughfares. All
lighting used to illuminate the area shall be so installed as to be confined
within, and directed onto the premises of the outdoor theater site.
   (B)   Commercial television and radio towers, public utility microwaves,
cellular transmissions towers and public utility TV transmitting towers. Radio
and television towers, public utility microwave and public utility TV
transmitting towers, and their attendant facilities, shall be permitted in I-
1 districts provided such use shall be located centrally on a continuous parcel
of not less than one times the height of the tower to all points on each
property line. The site shall in no instance be used for the storage of
vehicles or any material not required for the principal use. Outdoor storage of
any kind shall be expressly prohibited.
   (C)   Airports and landing fields. Airports and landing fields, including
structures accessory to such facilities and for the operation of an airport,
may be permitted in an area zoned for industrial purposes, provided access
directly to the site is from an abutting major thoroughfare, provided that land
under runway approaches shall not be put to any use which might later serve as
a basis for an effective argument that the space above should not be used by
aircraft, and provided by the Civil Aeronautics Administration be submitted
with the request for use.
(Ord. passed 10-12-1992)
§ 82-459 RESERVED.
(1993 Code, § 82-459)
Editor's note:
   Ord. passed 9-14-1998(3) repealed § 82-459 in its entirety. Former § 82-459
pertained to regulations to prevent blight and derived from Ord. passed 10-12-
1992, § 5.183, and from Ord. passed 3-23-1998.
§ 82-460 PLANT MATERIALS AND LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Greenbelt requirements. Whenever in this chapter a greenbelt or
planting is required, it shall be planted to completion within 180 days of
occupancy of the building or structure unless a longer period is permitted in
writing by the Zoning Official. Planting shall thereafter be reasonably
maintained, including permanence and health of plant materials to provide a
screen to abutting properties and including the absence of weeds and refuse.
Withered and/or dead plant materials shall be replaced within a reasonable
period of time, but no longer than one growing season.
   (B)   Minimum standards. The landscape standards of this article are
considered the minimum necessary. In several instances, the standards are
intentionally flexible to encourage flexibility and creative design. Applicants
are encouraged to provide additional landscaping to improve the function,
appearance and value of their property.
   (C)   Landscaping commission review. For existing and proposed uses that
require site plan approval to either expand or be built, landscaping should be
installed insofar as practical. The planning commission in its review of the
site plan has the authority to increase, decrease or otherwise modify the
landscaping and screening requirements of this article. In doing so, the
commission shall consider the following criteria:
      (1)   The amount of space on the site available for landscaping.
      (2)   Existing landscaping on the site and on adjacent property.
      (3)   The type of use on the site and size of the development.
      (4)   Existing and proposed adjacent land uses.
      (5)   The effect the required landscaping would have on the operation of
the existing or proposed land use.
   (D)   Plant material size.
      (1)   Plant material shall not be located within 4 feet of the property
line.
      (2)   Where plant materials are placed in 2 or more rows, plantings shall
be staggered in rows.
      (3)   Evergreen trees shall not be less than 7 feet in height.
      (4)   Narrow evergreen trees shall not be less than 5 feet in height when
used as screening.
      (5)   Large shrubs shall be a minimum of a #5 container (18" to 24").
      (6)   Small shrubs shall be a minimum of a #3 container (15" to 18").
      (7)   Larger deciduous trees shall not be less than 2-2 1/2 inches in
caliper measured one foot above ground level.
      (8)   Ornamental trees shall not be less than 1 3/4" – 2 1/2" in caliper
measured 1 foot above ground level.

§ 82-461 SIGNS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of these regulations is to
foster public safety along public and private streets within the community by
assuring that all signs are in safe and appropriate locations. Additionally, to
promote the creation of an attractive visual environment that promotes a
healthy economy by permitting businesses to inform, identify and communicate
effectively; and directing the general public through the use of signs while
maintaining
attractive and harmonious application of signs on the buildings and sites.
   Further, to protect and enhance the physical appearance of the community in
a lawful manner that recognizes the rights of property owners by encouraging
the appropriate design, scale and placement of signs.
   Finally, to have administrative review procedures that are the minimum
necessary to balance the community's objectives and regulatory requirements.
The intent is to ensure consistent enforcement of the sign code; minimize the
time required to review a sign application; and provide flexibility as to the
number and placement of signs so the regulations are more responsive to
business needs while maintaining the community's standards.

window or exterior glass door such that it is intended to be viewable from the
exterior beyond the sidewalk immediately adjacent to the window.
   (C)   General standards. The following standards shall apply to all signs in
any zone district.
      (1)   Requirement for permit. Except as expressly provided herein, it is
unlawful for any person to erect, re-erect, alter or relocate any sign without
obtaining zoning approval from the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission
when applicable, issuance of a sign permit as required by the Building
Official, and payment of any applicable fees.
      (2)   Changeable copy by non-electronic means may be utilized on any
permitted sign.
      (3)   Location requirements.
         (a)   No sign shall be located in, project into, or overhang a public
right-of-way or dedicated public easement without permission from the
governmental unit controlling the right-of-way or easement except for a
permitted projecting sign or canopy sign.
         (b)   No sign shall be placed in a location that obstructs the view of
traffic or pedestrians on streets or sidewalks, or the view of persons entering
or exiting the premises. Signs shall not be permitted where they obstruct a
motorist's view of regulatory signs, traffic control devices, or street signs.
         (c)   In order to ensure adequate sight distance, a minimum clear
vision area shall be maintained in accordance with §
82-463. Greater clear vision areas may be required by the Michigan Department
of Transportation or the Eaton County Road Commission in areas subject to their
jurisdiction.
      (4)   Specific dimensional standards. The dimensional standards and
regulations for sign types allowable by zone districts are as follows:

Comprehensive Signs permitted as granted by the Planning Commission in the
Sign Plan     required Comprehensive Sign Plan
Required
 
   (E)   Sign type standards. The following standards for specific sign types
shall apply in addition to the other applicable standards of this section.
      (1)   Wall signs.
         (a)   Any wall sign or combined length of signs shall not be greater
than 80% of the length of the tenant space or the length of the building
frontage for single tenant buildings.
         (b)   The area of any wall sign may be increased by 25% when the
building is setback at least 200 feet from the public right-of-way and may be
further increased an additional 25% for each additional 200 feet of setback, up
to a maximum increase of 100%.
         (c)   Additional wall sign area is permitted for a secondary frontage
(see division (B) - Definitions) which shall be equal to 100% of the primary
sign area allowance.
         (d)   Additional wall signs for multiple story buildings. An
additional building sign is permitted on each of the building's primary and
secondary frontages according to the following:
            1.   For a building with two floors the additional permitted sign
area is 100% of area for each eligible wall.
            2.   This additional permitted sign area may be increased by 50% in
area for each additional building floor.
            3.   The sign must be placed at the height for which the bonus has
been granted.
      (2)   Freestanding or ground signs.
         (a)   One additional freestanding or ground sign shall be permitted
for every 100 feet of site frontage in excess of 200 feet of lot frontage.
         (b)   The permitted sign area may be aggregated into fewer and larger
signs, at the election of the property owner/business, provided that the size
of any single sign does not exceed the area permitted by more than 100%.
         (c)   Electronic message centers are permitted on a freestanding or
ground sign provided they meet the following requirements:
            1.   Only one electronic message center (EMC) is permitted per each
street frontage.
            2.   EMC copy cannot change more often than once every eight
seconds and EMC cannot exceed 50% of the total sign area permitted on the site.
            3.   All EMCs are required to have automatic dimming capability
that adjusts the brightness to the ambient light at all times of the day and
night.
            4.   No single electronic message is permitted to be repeated by
flashing more than once every 16 seconds.
      (3)   Temporary signs.
         (a)   Except as described in divisions (E)(3)(a)1. and 2. of this
section, signs that meet the standards of this division shall comply with
standards listed in division (C)(4) of this section, General Standards,
Specific Dimensional Standards including, but not limited to, sign area,
setback and height for the applicable zone district.
            1.   Sidewalk signs shall not exceed 2.5 feet by 3 feet in size and
may only be permitted in the Central Business District provided they are
located so as not to interfere with pedestrian passage or create a public
safety hazard and must be removed at the close of the business day.
            2.   Temporary signs in shopping centers, plazas or similar multi
tenant sites shall be limited to spaces controlled by the tenant and may not be
located in any common areas. Temporary signs in such sites are prohibited from
being placed in the required front-yard setback.
         (b)   Where an existing permanent sign exists, no single temporary
sign on a site shall exceed 10% of the smaller of either the wall sign area or
freestanding sign area. The total area of all temporary signs on a site shall
not exceed 25% of the smaller of either the wall sign area or freestanding sign
area already installed on the site.
         (c)   Temporary signs affixed to the inside of a building's windows
are exempt from the provisions of this division.
         (d)   A banner sign shall not exceed 50 square feet, and is permitted
to be displayed not more than 15 consecutive days and not more than six times
per calendar year.
         (e)   Temporary signs are exempt from obtaining a permit prior to
installation but shall be required to be kept in good condition and shall be
removed when required per ordinance.
   (F)   Illumination standards. Sign illumination shall comply with all of the
following requirements:
      (1)   Signs shall be illuminated only by steady, stationary shielded
light sources directed solely at the sign, or internal to it.
      (2)   Use of glaring undiffused lights or bulbs shall be prohibited.
Lights shall be shaded so as not to project onto adjoining properties or
thoroughfares.
      (3)   Sign illumination that could distract motorists or otherwise create
a traffic hazard shall be prohibited.
      (4)   Illumination by bare bulbs or flames is prohibited.
      (5)   Underground wiring shall be required for all illuminated signs not
attached to a building.
      (6)   Electronic message centers may be permitted subject to division
(E), Sign Type Standards.
   (G)   Sign review procedures.
      (1)   Time limits. All sign applications shall be reviewed for compliance
with these regulations within ten business days from the time a completed
application has been accepted by the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   All appeals and variances regarding the sign ordinance will be
heard by the Planning Commission (see division (H) of this section).
      (3)   A Comprehensive Sign Plan (CSP) may be submitted that permits
consideration of unique conditions, flexibility and creativity. Such CSP is
subject to approval by the Planning Commission who may permit additional signs
and/or sign area based on the applicant's demonstration of unique
characteristics of the design, building, and/or site and appropriate
landscaping associated with the freestanding signs. The approval of a CSP
cannot impose more restrictive requirements than permitted by the basic
standards. Once a CSP has been approved subsequent applications for specific
signs on the site shall be approved administratively when the proposed sign is
in compliance with the approved CSP.
   (H)   Construction and safety standards. The construction, erection, safety
and maintenance of all signs shall comply with the adopted State Building Code
and all of the following:
      (1)   Construction and maintenance. Every sign shall be constructed and
maintained in a manner consistent with the building, electrical, or other
construction code provisions and maintained in good structural condition at all
times. All signs shall be kept neatly painted, stained, sealed or preserved
including all metal parts and supports.
      (2)   Sign safety. All signs erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered
or moved shall be constructed in such a manner and of such materials so
that they shall be able to withstand wind pressure of at least 20 pounds per
square foot. All signs, including any cables, guy wires or supports shall have
a minimum clearance of four feet from any electric fixture, street light or
other public utility pole or standard.
   (I)   Maintenance standards. All signs shall be maintained in accordance
with the following:
      (1)   The property owner shall maintain signs in good repair and
structurally sound, in compliance with applicable city standards or ordinances,
and in compliance with any building code or property maintenance code
requirements.
      (2)   If the sign is deemed by the Zoning Administrator or designee to be
in an unsafe condition, the owner of the business shall be immediately notified
in writing, and shall respond to the city with a plan to correct the unsafe
condition, remove the unsafe sign, or cause it to be removed within 30 days. If
after 35 calendar days, the conditions have not been corrected through repair
or removal, the sign shall be declared a public nuisance and the Zoning
Administrator may cause the repair or removal of such sign, at the expense of
the property owner or lessee. If the total costs are not paid in full within 60
days of the repairs or removal the amount owed shall be certified as an
assessment against the property owner, and lien upon that property as
prescribed for unpaid real estate taxes.
      (3)   In cases of imminent emergency, the Zoning Administrator may cause
the immediate removal of a dangerous or defective sign without notice.
      (4)   Repair, re-lettering, or repainting may be done without a permit or
without any payment of fees provided that all of the following conditions are
met:
         (a)   There is no alteration or remodeling to the structure or the
mounting of the sign itself;
         (b)   There is no enlargement or increase in any of the dimensions of
the sign or its structure; and
         (c)   The sign is accessory to a legally permitted, conditional, or
nonconforming use.
   (J)   Measurement standards. For all sign types, the following standards are
used to determine the size, area, height, and other dimensional standards.
      (1)   Sign area and dimensions.
         (a)   For a wall sign which is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise
prepared and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area and
dimensions shall include the entire portion within such background or frame.
         (b)   For a wall sign comprised of individual letters, figures or
elements on a wall or similar surface of the building or structure, the area
and dimensions of the sign shall encompass a regular geometric shape
(rectangle, circle, trapezoid, triangle, etc.), or a combination of regular
geometric shapes, which form, or approximate, the perimeter of all elements in
the display, the frame, and any applied background that is not part of the
architecture of the building. When separate elements are organized to form a
sign, but are separated by open space, the sign area and dimensions shall be
calculated by determining the geometric form, or combination of forms, which
comprises all of the display areas, including the space between different
elements. Minor appendages to a particular regular shape, as determined by the
Zoning Administrator, shall not be included in the total area of a sign.
         (c)   For a freestanding or ground sign, the sign area shall include
the frame, if any, but shall not include:
            1.   A pole or other structural support unless such pole or
structural support is internally illuminated or otherwise so designed to
constitute a display device, or a part of a display device.
            2.   Architectural features that are either part of the building or
part of a freestanding structure, and not an integral part of the sign, and
which may consist of landscaping, building or structural forms complementing
the site in general.
         (d)   When two identical sign faces are placed back-to-back so that
both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and are part of
the same sign structure, the sign area shall be computed as the measurement of
one of the two faces. When the sign has more than two display surfaces, the
area of the sign shall be the area of largest display surfaces that are visible
from any single direction.
      (2)   Sign height.
         (a)   The height of a ground sign or freestanding sign shall be
measured from the base of the sign or supportive structure at its point of
attachment to the ground, to the highest point of the sign. A freestanding or
ground sign on a man-made base, including a graded earth mound, shall be
measured from the grade of the nearest pavement or top of any pavement curb.
         (b)   Clearance for freestanding and projecting signs shall be
measured as the smallest vertical distance between finished grade and the
lowest point of the sign, including any framework or other embellishments.
      (3)   Length of building frontage.
         (a)   The length of any primary or secondary building frontage shall
be the sum of all wall lengths parallel, or nearly parallel to such frontage.
         (b)   For buildings with two or more frontages, the length of the wall
and allowable sign area shall be calculated separately for each such building
frontage.
         (c)   The building frontage for a business unit shall be measured from
the centerline of the walls defining the business unit.
   (K)   Exempt signs. The following signs shall be exempt from regulation
under this section:
      (1)   Any public purpose or public safety sign and any other notice or
warning required by federal, state, or local law, regulation, or resolution,
including directional signs.
      (2)   Works of art that do not include a commercial message, including
murals.
      (3)   Decorative displays provided that the display does not exceed 75
days.
      (4)   Flags of any country, state, municipality, university, college or
school.
      (5)   Building markers, such as historical designations or construction
dates; house or building numbers or names.
      (6)   Historical signs shall not be considered an abandoned sign after
review and designation by the Planning Commission following a public hearing as
required per §
82-33A, Notice.
      (7)   Signs designed and installed so as to be visible only to patrons of
an establishment when they are on the premises of the establishment.
      (8)   Instructional or "way-finding" signs installed by a federal, state,
or local unit of government.
      (9)   Time and temperature signs.
   (L)   Prohibited signs. The following signs are prohibited:
      (1)   Abandoned signs, as defined in division (B) of this section.
      (2)   Animated, flashing, rotating signs and festoons as defined in
division (B) of this section, portable changeable copy signs, inflatable signs,
tethered balloons, pennants, flutter flags, searchlights, streamers, exposed
light bulbs, strings of lights, and any clearly similar features, except those
specifically exempt from regulation as decorative displays.
      (3)   Roof signs, as defined in division (B) of this section.
      (4)   Signs located on vacant or unused property except permitted
billboards, including signs on vehicles when the vehicle is parked at a vacant
or unused property.
      (5)   Any sign containing any words, colors, lighting, or symbols that
would cause confusion to pedestrian or vehicular traffic because of their
resemblance to public safety traffic control or direction signals.
      (6)   Signs located on trees, utility poles, public benches or any other
form of public property or within any public right-of-way unless explicitly
permitted by these regulations.
      (7)   Other signs or similar structures that raise concerns for public
safety or welfare substantially similar to those listed above.
   (F)   Non-conforming signs.
      (1)   Non-conforming signs shall be maintained in good condition pursuant
to regulations of division (H), Construction and Safety Standards, and of
division (I), Maintenance Standards, of this section.
      (2)   A non-conforming sign shall not be altered, modified or
reconstructed except:
         (a)   When such alteration, modification or reconstruction would bring
such sign into conformity with these regulations;
         (b)   Any alteration, modification or reconstruction shall be limited
to the replacement of a sign panel, replacing individual letters and logos
within the same area, or repainting a sign face. No changes to the structure,
framing, erection or relocation of the sign are permitted unless such changes
conform to division (F)(2)(a) of this section.
      (3)   Restoration of damage. If a sign or sign structure which is
nonconforming is damaged by any means or in any manner to the extent that the
cost of reconstruction or restoration exceeds one-half (50%) the value of
replacement of the sign or sign structure prior to the damaging occurrence,
such structure may be reconstructed or restored only if its use conforms with
the provisions of this section.
      (4)   Repairs to nonconforming sign. Repair work may be done to
nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, provided that the structure is
not enlarged, extended, moved or structurally altered.
      (5)   Safety repairs. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent
the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition any structure or part
thereof upon order by an official charged with protecting the public safety.
   (G)   Appeals and variances. The Planning Commission shall hear all appeals
from an administrative decision or variance requests with regard to the sign
regulations of §
82-461 as follows:
      (1)   Appeals may be made where an applicant has been aggrieved by a
decision made by the Zoning Administrator or designee within 21 days of the
decision being rendered. The applicant must submit a written appeal detailing
the nature of the appeal. The Planning Commission may affirm, modify, or
overturn the decision of the Zoning Administrator upon a hearing at a regular
Planning Commission meeting in accordance with §
82-59.
      (2)   Variances may be granted from the regulations contained herein
provided that the Planning Commission shall not permit signs in the right-of-
way or in a location that has been determined to be a violation of required
site distance or a public safety concern. Any request for a variance must be
provided in writing and the hearing will follow the procedures of §
82-59. A request for a variance shall be the minimum necessary to provide
relief to the property owner and the approval for such request shall include
the following:
         (a)   Specific regulations the variance is requested from and relief
sought; and
         (b)   Practical difficulty or unique circumstances which necessitate
the variance.

criteria.
   (L)   Variances.
      (1)   Conditions of variances. Where there are practical difficulties or
unnecessary hardships in carrying out the strict letter of the provisions of
this section, a variance may be granted; provided that all the following
conditions are true.

   (B)   The Planning Commission may in its review of site plans for specific
uses allow or require the provision of an earth berm and/or a greenbelt
planting consisting of trees and shrubs to serve as an obscuring wall, where
such obscuring walls are required under this chapter, and where conditions are
such that a more effective and harmonious development with abutting or
neighboring land uses would result. Review and approval shall be required by
the Planning Commission of types of plant materials and their location in such
greenbelt.
   (C)   Required walls shall be located on the lot line except where
underground utilities interfere and except in instances where this chapter
requires conformance with front yard setback lines in abutting residential
districts. Upon review of the site plan, the Planning Commission may approve a
reduction in height requirements or may approve an alternate location for the
wall or may waive the wall requirement if in specific cases it would not serve
the purposes of screening the parking area effectively. Required walls may,
upon approval of the Planning Commission, be located on the opposite side of an
alley right-of-way from a nonresidential zone that abuts a residential zone
when mutually agreeable to affected property owners. The continuity of the
required wall on a given block will be a major consideration of the Planning
Commission in reviewing such request.
   (D)   Walls and screening barriers shall have no openings for vehicular
traffic or other purposes, except as otherwise provided in this chapter and
except such openings as may be approved by the Chief of Police and the Building
Official. All walls required in this section shall be constructed of materials
approved by the Building Official to be durable, weather resistant, and
rustproof, and shall be maintained by the property owner or tenant at all times
equal in condition to the completed structure at the time of initial
installation. Walls may be constructed with openings which do not in any square
section (height and width) exceed 20% of the surface. Where walls are so
pierced, the openings shall be so spaced as to maintain the obscuring character
required, and shall not reduce the minimum height requirement. The arrangement
of the openings shall be reviewed and approved by the Building Official.
   (E)   The city may require that suitable maintenance guarantee be provided
for the continued maintenance of walls required under this chapter.
   (F)   The requirement for an obscuring wall between off-street parking
areas, outdoor storage areas, and any abutting residential districts shall not
be required when such areas are located more than 200 feet distant from such
abutting residential district.
   (G)   The Board of Appeals may waive or modify the requirements of this
section where cause can be shown that no good purpose would be served.
      (1)   In consideration of request to waive all requirements between
nonresidential and residential districts, the Board shall refer the request to
the Planning Commission for a determination as to whether or not the
residential district is considered to be an area in transition and will become
nonresidential in the future.
      (2)   In such cases as the Planning Commission determines the residential
district to be a future nonresidential area, the Board may temporarily waive
wall requirements for an initial period not to exceed 12 months. Granting of
subsequent waivers shall be permitted, provided that the Planning Commission
shall make a determination, as described in this section, for each subsequent
waiver prior to the granting of such waiver by the Board. (See
Appendix I.)

an existing or proposed building or structure shall again be used as part of
the lot or parcel required in connection with any other building or structure
existing or intended to exist at the same time.

accord with Public Act 96 of 1987, being M.C.L.A. §§ 125.2301 et seq., as
amended.

§ 82-470 ACCESS TO MAJOR THOROUGHFARE OR COLLECTOR STREET.
   For uses making reference to this section, vehicular access shall be
provided only to an existing or planned major thoroughfare or collector street.
Provided, however, that access driveways may be permitted to other than a major
thoroughfare or collector street where such access is provided to a street
where the property directly across the street between the driveway and the
major thoroughfare or collector street is zoned for multiple-family use or any
nonresidential uses, is developed with permanent uses other than single-family
residences or is an area which, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, will
be used for other than single-family purposes in the future. This exception
shall apply only if the Planning Commission finds that there are special
circumstances which indicate that there will be a substantial improvement in
traffic safety by reducing the number of driveways to a thoroughfare.

      (3)   Whenever a single family dwelling is converted to a use other than
a two family dwelling and such use would not otherwise require a sealed site
plan by this section and if such use abuts a single or two family dwelling, the
Planning Commission shall review such plan to ensure that the proposed use will
not have an adverse impact on the abutting single family or two family
dwellings. In its review, the Commission may require landscaping, fencing, the
reduction of on-site lighting or similar measures to ensure that the impact of
the proposed use on nearby residents is minimized.

accordance with the approved plans. For any approved site plan, building
permits must be obtained encompassing a minimum of 25% of the gross floor area
shown on the site plan within 12 months of the date of site plan approval, or
the site plan shall be deemed null and void, without any further action by the
city. The Planning Commission may, upon application in writing stating the
reasons therefore, extend the 12-month period for an additional period of up to
12 months. Renewal must be requested in writing prior to the expiration of the
site plan approval. The site plan may be renewed twice and the Planning
Commission may require compliance with any ordinances adopted after the
applicant received the original approval.
   (G)   The intent of this subsection is to permit improvement and minor
modification to a conforming use and building which does not meet all of the
site improvement regulations of this chapter. The intent is to permit partial
compliance with the article requirements for site improvements for developed or
partially developed sites which predate the zoning ordinance standards for
landscaping, paving and non- safety site related improvements. Such
improvements or expansions may be permitted by the Planning Commission during
site plan review without a complete upgrade of all site elements under the
following conditions.
      (1)   A finding by the Planning Commission that the applicant is
proposing reasonable site improvements on the overall site in relation to the
scale and construction cost of the building and site improvements or expansion.
For a change in use requiring site plan review, the site shall be brought
toward conformity with the minimum standards of the ordinance as much as
reasonably possible.
      (2)   The applicant has addressed all safety related site issues on the
overall site.
      (3)   (a)   For landscaping, the applicant shall bring the portion of the
site proposed to be changed or expanded into full compliance with current
landscaping requirements of the article. For the remainder of the site where no
changes or expansions are proposed, the applicant shall bring the site toward
conformity with current landscaping standards at twice the rate of the building
or parking lot expansion, whichever is greater. (For example, a site plan
showing a 10% expansion of the building floor area and 15% expansion of the
number of parking spaces shall require a minimum 30% of the landscaping, in
terms of landscaping area and quantity of plants, on the portion of the site
where no changes or expansions are proposed).
         (b)   This landscaping requirement shall apply to the paving of any
portion of an existing gravel parking lot that is 5,000 square feet or greater
in area of the paving of parking lots for uses which require 17 or more parking
spaces in accordance to §
82-455.
      (4)   The improvements of minor expansion shall not increase
noncompliance with site requirements of this chapter.
      (5)   For nonconforming uses or structures in the B-3 zone, the site must
be designated as a class A nonconforming use or structure by the Planning
Commission, as set forth in §
82-453(B), and the site plan must demonstrate compliance with all applicable
class A conditions, as set forth in §
82-453(C).

§ 82-472 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   No use otherwise allowed shall be permitted within any district which does
not conform to the following standards of use, occupancy and operation, which
standards are hereby established as the minimum requirements to be maintained
within such area.
      (1)   Smoke. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to
permit the emission of any smoke from any source whatever to a density greater
than that density described as No. 2 on the Ringlemann chart; provided that the
following exceptions shall be permitted.
         (a)   Smoke, the shade or appearance of which is equal to but not
darker than No. 3 on the Ringlemann chart for a period aggregating 4 minutes in
any 30 minutes.
         (b)   Smoke, the shade or appearance of which is equal to but not
darker than No. 3 of the Ringlemann chart for a period, aggregating 3 minutes
in any 15 minutes, when building a new fire or when breakdown of equipment
occurs such as to make it evident that the emission was not reasonably
preventable.
      Method of measurement. For the purposes of grading the density of smoke,
the Ringlemann chart, as now published and used by the United States Bureau of
Mines, which is hereby made a part of this chapter, shall be the standard.
However, the umbrascope readings of smoke densities may be used when correlated
with the Ringlemann chart.
      (2)   Dust, dirt and fly ash. No person, firm or corporation shall
operate or cause to be operated, maintain or cause to be maintained, any
process for any purpose, or furnace or combustion device for the burning of
coal or other natural or synthetic fuels, without maintaining and operating
while using such process or furnace or combustion device, recognized and
approved equipment, means, method, device or contrivance to reduce the quantity
of gasborne or airborne solids of fumes emitted into the open air, which is
operated in conjunction with such process, furnace, or combustion device so
that the quantity of gasborne or airborne solids shall not exceed 0.20 grains
per cubic foot of the carrying medium at a temperature of 500 degrees
Fahrenheit.
      Method of measurement. For the purpose of determining the adequacy of
such devices these conditions are to be conformed to when the percentage of
excess air in the stack does not exceed 50% at full load. The foregoing
requirement shall be measured by the ASME test code of dust separating
apparatus. All other forms of dust, dirt and fly ash shall be completely
eliminated insofar as escape or emission into the open air is concerned. The
Building Official may require such additional data as is deemed necessary to
show that adequate and approved provisions for the prevention and elimination
of dust, dirt and fly ash have been made.
      (3)   Glare and radioactive materials. Glare from any process, such as or
similar to arc welding, or acetylene torch cutting, which emits harmful
ultraviolet rays shall be performed in such a manner as not to be seen from any
point beyond the property line, and as not to create a public nuisance or
hazard along lot lines. Radioactive materials and wastes, including
electromagnetic radiation such as x-ray machine operation, shall not be emitted
to exceed quantities established as safe by the U.S. Bureau of Standards, when
measured at the property line.
      (4)   Fire and explosive hazards.
         (a)   In the I-1 Industrial District, the storage, utilization or
manufacture of materials or products ranging from incombustible to moderate
burning, as determined by the Fire Marshal, is permitted, subject to compliance
with all other performance standards above mentioned.
         (b)   The storage, utilization or manufacture of materials, goods or
products ranging from free to active burning to intense burning, as determined
by the Fire Marshal, is permitted subject to compliance with all other yard
requirements and performance standards previously mentioned, and provided that
the following conditions are met.
            1.   The materials or products shall be stored, utilized or
produced within completely enclosed buildings or structures having combustible
exterior walls, which meet the requirements of the Building Code of the city.
            2.   All such buildings or structures shall be set back at least 40
feet from lot lines, or in lieu thereof all such buildings or structures shall
be protected throughout by an automatic sprinkler system complying with
installation standards prescribed by the National Fire Association.
            3.   The storage and handling of flammable liquids, liquified
petroleum gases and explosives shall comply with the state rules and
regulations as established by Public Act 207 of 1941, being M.C.L.A. §§ 29.1 et
seq., as amended.
      (5)   Noise. The emission of measurable noises from the premises shall
not exceed 60 decibels as measured at the boundary property lines, except where
normal street traffic noises exceed 60 decibels during such periods, the
measurable noise emanating from such premises may equal, but not exceed, such
traffic noises. This provision shall apply in all districts except as specified
in this section for the I Districts.
      I-1 District. In all I-1 Districts, the measurable noise emanating from
the premises used for activities permitted shall not exceed 75 decibels during
the normal work periods of between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. and
shall not exceed 70 decibels during the sleeping hours of 10:00 p.m. to 6:00
a.m., as measured at the property lines. Noises shall be muffled so as not to
become objectional due to intermittence, beat frequency or high frequency.
      (6)   Vibration. Machines or operations which cause vibration shall be
permitted in industrial districts, but no operation shall cause a displacement
exceeding 0.003 of 1 inch as measured at the property line.
      (7)   Odors. Creation of offensive odors shall be prohibited.
      (8)   Wastes. All discharges to the city's publicly owned sewage
treatment facility (sanitary sewer system) shall conform to appropriate
regulations in
Chapter 78 relating to sewer services. Mobile home parks shall be governed by
State Department of Health standards.

§ 82-474 WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES.
   It is the general purpose and intent of the city to carry out the will of
the United States Congress by authorizing communication facilities needed to
operate wireless communication systems. However, it is the further purpose and
intent of the city to provide for such authorization in a manner which will
retain the integrity of neighborhoods and the character, property values and
aesthetic quality of the community at large. In fashioning and administering
the provisions of this section, attempts have been made to balance these
potentially competing interests and promote the public health, safety and
welfare.
      (1)   Definitions.
         (a)   Wireless communication facilities shall mean and include all
structures and accessory facilities relating to the use of the radio frequency
spectrum for the purpose of transmitting or receiving radio signals. This may
include, but shall not be limited to, radio towers, television towers,
telephone devices and exchanges, microwave relay towers, telephone transmission
equipment, building, and commercial mobile radio service facilities. Not
included within this definition are: citizen band radio facilities; short wave
facilities; ham, amateur radio facilities; satellite dishes; and, governmental
facilities which are subject to state or federal law or regulations which
preempt municipal regulatory authority.
         (b)   Attached wireless communications facilities shall mean wireless
communication facilities that are affixed to existing structures, such as
existing buildings, towers, water tanks, utility poles, and the like. A
wireless communication support structure proposed to be newly established shall
not be included within this definition.
         (c)   Wireless communication support structures shall mean structures
erected or modified to support wireless communication antennas. Support
structures within this definition include, but shall not be limited to,
monopoles, lattice towers, light poles, wood poles or guyed wires.
         (d)   Co-location shall mean the location by 2 or more wireless
communication providers of wireless communication facilities on a common
structure, tower, or building, with the view toward reducing the overall number
of structures required to support wireless communication antennas within the
community.
      (2)   Authorization. Subject to the standards and conditions set forth in
this section, wireless communication facilities shall be permitted uses in the
following circumstances, and in the following zoning districts by right:
         (a)   Subject to the standards and conditions set forth below,
wireless communication facilities shall be authorized as a permitted use within
the following zoning districts: I-1 and I-2.
            1.   An existing structure will serve as an attached wireless
communication facility within a nonresidential zoning district, where the
existing structure is not, in the discretion of the Planning Official, proposed
to be either materially altered or materially changed appearance.
            2.   A proposed co-location upon an attached wireless communication
facility which had been preapproved for such co-location as part of an earlier
approval by the city.
            3.   An existing structure which will serve as an attached wireless
communication facility consisting of a utility pole located within a right-of-
way, where the existing pole is not proposed to be modified in a manner which,
in the discretion of the Planning Official, would materially alter the
structure and/or result in an impairment of sight lines or other safety
interests.
            4.   A proposed tower in the I-1 and I-2 zoning districts subject
to the provisions of (3), "general regulations," and the site plan review
process outlined in §
82-471.
         (b)   Subject to the standards and conditions set forth in this
section, wireless communication facilities shall be authorized as special land
uses within the following zoning districts: OS-1, B-1, B-2, B-3 and IRO.
         (c)   If it is demonstrated by an applicant that a wireless
communication facility may not be reasonably established as a permitted use
under (a) above, and, is required to be established outside of a district
identified in (b), above, in order to operate a wireless communication service,
then, wireless communication facilities may be permitted elsewhere in the
community as a special land use, subject to the criteria and standards of
subsections (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7) below.
      (3)   General regulations.
         (a)   All applications for wireless communication facilities shall be
reviewed in accordance with the following standards and conditions, and, if
approved, shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with such standards
and conditions. In addition, if the facility is approved, it shall be
constructed and maintained with any additional conditions imposed by the
Planning Commission in its discretion.
            1.   Facilities shall not be demonstrably injurious to
neighborhoods or otherwise detrimental to the public safety and welfare.
            2.   Facilities shall be located and designed to be harmonious with
the surrounding areas.
            3.   Wireless communication facilities shall comply with applicable
federal and state standards relative to the environmental effects of radio
frequency emissions.
            4.   Applicants shall demonstrate a justification for the proposed
height of the structures and an evaluation of alternative designs which might
result in lower heights.
            5.   The maximum height of a new or modified support structure and
antenna shall be the minimum height demonstrated to be necessary for reasonable
communication by the applicant (and by other entities to co-locate on the
structure). Towers over 300 feet in height will require a special use permit.
The accessory building contemplated to enclose such things as switching
equipment shall be limited to the maximum height for accessory structures
within the respective district.
            6.   No support structure shall be located closer than 30 feet to
the property line of any residential district or use, or no closer than equal
to the height of any adjacent residential building, whichever is greater. The
setback of the support structure from any existing or proposed rights-of-way or
other publicly traveled roads shall be no less than the height of the wireless
communication structure.
            7.   Where the proposed new or modified support structure abuts a
parcel of land zoned for a use other than residential, the minimum setback of
the structure, and accessory structures, shall be in accordance with the
required setbacks for main or principal buildings as provided in the zoning
district in which the support structure is located.
            8.   There shall be unobstructed access to the support structure,
for operation, maintenance, repair and inspection purposes, which may be
provided through or over an easement. This access shall have a width and
location determined by such factors as: the location of adjacent thoroughfares
and traffic and circulation within the site; utilities needed to service the
tower and any attendant facilities; the location of buildings and parking
facilities; proximity to residential districts and minimizing disturbance to
the natural landscape; and the type of equipment which will need to access the
site.
            9.   The division of property for the purpose of locating a
wireless communication facility is prohibited unless all zoning requirements
and conditions are met.
            10.   Where an attached wireless communication facility is proposed
on the roof of a building, it shall be designed, constructed and maintained to
be architecturally compatible with the principal building. The equipment
enclosure may be located within the principal building or may be an accessory
building. If proposed as an accessory building, it shall conform with all
district requirements for principal buildings, including yard setbacks.
            11.   The Planning Commission shall, with respect to the color of
the support structure and all accessory buildings, review and approve so as to
minimize distraction, reduce visibility, maximize aesthetic appearance, and
ensure compatibility with surroundings. It shall be the responsibility of the
applicant to maintain the wireless communication facility in a neat and orderly
condition.
            12.   The support system shall be constructed in accordance with
all applicable building codes and shall include the submission of a soils
report from a geotechnical engineer, licensed in the state. This soils report
shall include soil borings and statements confirming the suitability of soil
conditions for the proposed use. The requirements of the Federal Aviation
Administration, Federal Communication Commission, and Michigan Aeronautics
Commission shall be noted.
            13.   A maintenance plan, and any applicable maintenance agreement,
shall be presented and approved as part of the site plan for the proposed
facility. Such plan shall be designed to ensure the long term, continuous
maintenance to a reasonably prudent standard.
         (b)   Standards and conditions applicable to special land use
facilities. Applications for wireless communication facilities which may be
approved as special land uses shall be reviewed, and if approved, constructed
and maintained, in accordance with the standards and conditions in subsection
(3)(a). In addition, the applicant shall demonstrate the need for the proposed
facility to be located as proposed based upon the presence of 1 or more of the
following factors:
            1.   Proximity to an interstate or major thoroughfare;
            2.   Areas of population concentration;
            3.   Concentration of commercial, industrial, and/or other business
centers;
            4.   Areas where signal interference has occurred due to tall
buildings, masses of trees, or other obstructions;
            5.   Topography of the proposed facility location in relation to
other facilities with which the proposed facility is to operate;
            6.   Other specifically identified reason(s) creating facility
need.
         (c)   All proposals shall be reviewed in conformity with the co-
location requirements of this section.
      (4)   Application requirements.
         (a)   A site plan prepared in accordance with §
82-471 shall be submitted, including the location, size, screening and design
of all buildings and structures, including fences and outdoor equipment.
         (b)   The site plan shall also include a detailed landscaping plan
where the support structure is being placed. The purpose of landscaping is to
provide screening and aesthetic enhancement for the structure base, accessory
buildings and enclosure. In all cases, there shall be shown on the plan
fencing, which is required for protection of the support structure and security
from children and other persons who may otherwise access facilities.
         (c)   The application shall include a signed certification by a state-
licensed professional engineer with regard to the manner in which the proposed
structure will fall, which certification will be utilized, along with other
criteria such as applicable regulations for the district in question, in
determining the appropriate setback to be required for the structure and other
facilities.
         (d)   The application shall also include a description of security to
be posted at the time the facility is to be removed when it has been abandoned
or is no longer needed. In this regard, the security shall, at the election of
the applicant, be in the form of:
            1.   Cash;
            2.   Surety bond;
            3.   Letter of credit; or
            4.   An agreement in a form approved by the attorney for the
community and recordable at the office of the Register of Deeds, establishing a
promise of the applicant and owner of the property to remove the facility in a
timely manner as required under this section of the ordinance, with the further
provision that the applicant and owner shall be responsible for the payment of
any costs and attorney's fees incurred by the community in securing removal.
         (e)   The application shall include a map showing existing and known
proposed wireless communication facilities within the city, and further showing
existing and known proposed wireless communication facilities within 1 mile
from all borders of the city, which are relevant in terms of potential co-
location or in demonstrating the need for the proposed facility. If and to the
extent the information in question is on file with the community, the applicant
shall be required only to update as needed. Any such information which is trade
secret and/or other confidential commercial information which, if released
would result in commercial disadvantage to the applicant, may be submitted with
a request for confidentiality in connection with the development of
governmental policy. M.C.L.A. § 15.243(1)(f). This ordinance shall serve as the
promise to maintain confidentiality to the extent permitted by law. The request
for confidentiality must be prominently stated in order to bring it to the
attention of the community.
      (5)   Special requirements for facilities proposed to be situated outside
a zoning district in which the facility is permitted by right or special use
permit.
         (a)   For facilities which are not permitted uses under subsection (2)
and proposed to be located outside of a zone identified in subsection (2), an
application shall be reviewed and, if approved, facilities shall be constructed
and maintained in accordance with the following additional standards and
requirements.
            1.   At the time of the submittal, the applicant shall demonstrate
that a location within the district/overlay zone cannot reasonably meet the
coverage and/or capacity needs of the applicant.
            2.   Wireless communication facilities shall be of a design such as
(without limitation) a steeple, bell tower, or other form which is compatible
with the existing character of the proposed site, neighborhood and general
area, as approved by the city.
            3.   In single-family residential neighborhoods, site locations
shall be permitted on the following sites (not stated in any order of
priority), subject to application of all other standards contained in this
section:
               a.   Municipally owned site;
               b.   Other   governmentally owned site;
               c.   Religious or other institutional site;
               d.   Public park and other large permanent open space areas when
compatible;
               e.   Public or private school site.
      (6)   Co-location.
         (a)   Statement of policy. It is the policy of the city to minimize
the overall number of newly established locations for wireless communication
facilities and wireless communication support structures within the community
and encourage the use of existing structures for attached wireless
communication facility purposes. Each licensed provider of a wireless
communication facility must, by law, be permitted to locate sufficient
facilities in order to achieve the objectives promulgated by the United States
Congress. However, particularly in light of the dramatic increase in the number
of wireless communication facilities reasonably anticipated to occur as a
result of the change of federal law and policy in and relating to the Federal
Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is the policy of the city that all users
should co-locate on attached wireless communication facilities and wireless
communication support structures in the interest of achieving the purposes and
intent of this section. If a provider fails or refuses to permit co-location on
a facility owned or otherwise controlled by it, where co- location is feasible,
the result will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure will be
compelled, in direct violation of and in direct contradiction to the basic
policy, intent and purpose of the city. The provisions of this subsection are
designed to carry out and encourage conformity with this policy.
         (b)   Feasibility of co-location. Co- location shall be deemed to be
"feasible" for purposes of this section where all of the following are met:
            1.   The wireless communication provider entity under consideration
for co-location will undertake to pay market rent or other market compensation
for co-location;
            2.   The site on which co-location is being considered, taking into
consideration reasonable modification or replacement of a facility, is able to
provide structural support;
            3.   The co-location being considered is technologically
reasonable; for example, the co-location will not result in unreasonable
interference, given appropriate physical and other adjustment in relation to
the structure, antennas, and the like;
            4.   The height of the structure necessary for co-location will not
be increased beyond a point deemed to be permissible by the city, taking into
consideration the several standards contained in this ordinance.
         (c)   Requirements for co-location.
            1.   A special land use permit for the construction and use of a
new wireless communication facility shall not be granted unless and until the
applicant demonstrates that a feasible co- location is not available for the
coverage area and capacity needs.
            2.   All new and modified wireless communication facilities shall
be designed and constructed so as to accommodate co-location.
            3.   The policy of the community is for co-location. Thus, if a
party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication facility shall
fail or refuse to alter a structure so as to accommodate a proposed and
otherwise feasible co- location, such facility shall thereupon and thereafter
be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use, and shall not be altered,
expanded or extended in any respect.
            4.   If a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless
communication facility fails or refuses to permit a feasible co-location, and
this requires the construction and/or use of a new facility, the party failing
or refusing to permit a feasible co-location shall be deemed to be in direct
violation and contradiction of the policy, intent and purpose of the city, and,
consequently such party shall take responsibility for the violation, and shall
be prohibited from receiving approval for a new wireless communication support
structure within the city for a period of 5 years from the date of the failure
or refusal to permit the co-location. Such a party may seek and obtain a
variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals if and to the limited extent the
applicant demonstrates entitlement to variance relief which, in this context,
shall mean a demonstration that enforcement of the 5 year prohibition would
unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent wireless
communication services, or that such enforcement would have the effect of
prohibiting the provision of personal wireless communication services.
         (d)   Offer of co-location required. An application for a new wireless
communication support structure shall include a letter from the applicant to
all potential users offering an opportunity for co-location.
         (e)   Final approval for a wireless communication support structure
shall be effective for a period of 6 months.
         (f)   Incentive. Review of an application for co-location, and review
of an application for a permit for use of an existing facility shall be
expedited by the city.
      (7)   Removal.
         (a)   A condition of every approval of a wireless communication
facility shall be adequate provision for removal of all or part of the facility
by users and owners upon the occurrence of 1 or more of the following events:
            1.   When the facility has not been used for 180 days or more. For
purposes of this section, the removal of antennas or other equipment from the
facility, or the cessation of operations (transmission and/or reception of
radio signals) shall be considered as the beginning of a period of non-use;
            2.   Six months after new technology is available at reasonable
cost, as determined by the legislative body of the community, which permits the
operation of the communication system without the requirement of the support
structure.
         (b)   The situations in which removal of a facility is required, as
set forth in paragraph (a)(1) above, may be applied and limited to portions of
a facility.
         (c)   Upon the occurrence of 1 or more of the events requiring
removal, specified in paragraph (a)(1) above, the property owner or persons who
had used the facility shall immediately apply or secure the application for any
required demolition or removal permits, and immediately proceed with and
complete the demolition/removal, restoring the premises to an acceptable
condition as reasonably determined by the Planning Official.
         (d)   If the required removal of a facility or a portion thereof has
not been lawfully completed within 60 days of the applicable deadline, and
after at least 30 days written notice, the city may remove or secure the
removal of the facility or required portions thereof, with its actual cost and
reasonable administrative charge to be drawn or collected and/or enforced from
or under the security posted at the time application was made for establishing
the facility.

municipality. Overhead or underground lines and necessary poles and towers to
be erected for transmission systems defined as all lines conducting electricity
between stations, commonly called high tension towers and lines, shall receive
the review and approval, after a public hearing, of the Board of Appeals. Such
review of the Board of Appeals shall consider abutting property and uses as
they relate to easements, rights-of-way, overhead lines, poles and towers, and
further shall consider injurious effects on property abutting or adjacent
thereto and on the orderly appearance of the city.
      (2)   Voting place. The provisions of this chapter shall not be so
construed as to interfere with the temporary use of any property as a voting
place in connection with a municipal or other public election.
      (3)   Height limit. The height limitations of this chapter shall not
apply to farm buildings, chimneys, church spires, flag poles, public monuments
or wireless transmission towers; provided, however, that the Board of Appeals
may specify a height limit for any such structure when such structure requires
authorization as a conditional use.
      (4)   Lot area. Any lot existing and of record on the effective date of
this chapter may be used for any principal use permitted other than conditional
uses for which special lot area requirements are specified in this chapter,
permitted in the district in which such lot is located whether or not such lot
complies with the lot area and width requirements of this chapter. Such use may
be made provided that all requirements other than lot area and width prescribed
in this chapter are complied with, and provided that not more than 1 dwelling
unit shall occupy any lot except in conformance with the provisions of this
chapter for required lot area for each dwelling unit.
      (5)   Lots adjoining alleys. In calculating the area of a lot that
adjoins an alley for the purpose of applying lot area requirements of this
chapter, one- half the width of such alley abutting the lot shall be considered
as part of such lot.
      (6)   Yard regulations. When yard regulations cannot reasonably be
complied with, or where their application cannot be determined on lots of
peculiar shape, topography or due to architecture or site arrangement, such
regulations may be modified or determined by the Board of Appeals.
      (7)   Porches. An open, unenclosed and uncovered porch or paved terrace
may project into a front yard for a distance not exceeding 10 feet, but this
shall not be interpreted to include or permit fixed canopies.
      (8)   Projections into yards. Architectural features, not including
vertical projections, may extend or project into a required side yard not more
than 2 inches for each 1 foot of width of such side yard and may extend or

      (9)   Access through yards. For the purpose of this chapter access drives
may be placed in the required front or side yards so as to provide access to
rear yards or accessory or attached structures. These drives shall not be
considered as structural violations in front and side yards. Further, any walk,
terrace or other pavement servicing a like function, and not in excess of 9
inches above the grade upon which placed, shall for the purpose of this chapter
not be considered to be a structure and shall be permitted in any required
yard.
      (10)   Lots having water frontage. Those residential lots or parcels
having water frontage and abutting a public thoroughfare shall maintain the
yard on the water side as an open unobscured yard, excepting that a covered
and/or uncovered boat well shall be permitted. Accessory structures shall be
permitted in the setback between the abutting road right-of-way and the main
building providing the front yard setback required in §
82-426 is met.

street right-of-way, or property line.
   (C)   A processor shall install and maintain in operable condition a system
which precludes the emission of objectionable cannabis odor emanating from the
premises.
   (D)   Ventilation, by-product and waste disposal, and water management
(supply and disposal) for the facility shall not produce contamination of air,
water, or soil; or reduce the expected life of the building due to heat and

surrounding properties.
   (E)   Air contaminants must be controlled and eliminated by the following
methods:
      (1)   The building must be equipped with an activated air scrubbing and
carbon filtration system that eliminates all air contaminants prior to leaving
the building.
      (2)   Fan(s) must be sized for cubic feet per minute (CFM) equivalent to

      (3)   The filter(s) shall be rated for the applicable CFM.
      (4)   An air scrubbing and filtration system must be maintained in
working order and must be in use at all times. Filters must be changed per

infraction violations are made payable at the city Municipal Ordinance
Violation Bureau. Repeat violations are determined based on the date of the
commission of the violation. Each day that a violation continues shall be
deemed to be a separate offense.

stricter regulation shall control the cannabis operation of any cannabis
commercial entity in the city. Compliance with any applicable state law or
regulation shall be deemed an additional requirement for issuance or denial of

or regulation shall be grounds for revocation or suspension of any license
issued hereunder.
(Ord. 2023-05, passed 8-21-2023)
§ 82-524 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to the possible denial, suspension, revocation or
nonrenewal of a license under the provisions of this article, any person or
cannabis operation, including, but not limited to, any licensee, manager or

this article, shall be responsible for a municipal civil infraction and a fine
of $500, or as permitted by law, as established by resolution.
   (B)   In addition, any person, including any person, customer or member of

except as may be otherwise provided in M.C.L. § 333.27965, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor.
   (C)   Notwithstanding the above, to the extent any violation or penalty set
forth herein may be deemed inconsistent with any state law, or inconsistent
with any rule or penalty which is promulgated by the Department, now or
hereafter, including but not limited to those promulgated pursuant to M.C.L. §
333.27958, then the state law or Department rule or penalty shall govern over
the provisions of this article, as determined by state preemption.
   (D)   A violation of this article is deemed to be a nuisance, per se. In
addition to any remedies available at law, the city may bring an action for an
injunction or other process against any person to restrain, prevent or abate
any violation of this article and such other relief as may be provided by law.
   (E)   Each day on which any violation of this article occurs or continues
constitutes a separate offense, subject to separate sanctions. The paying of a
fine or sanctions under this article shall not exempt the offender from meeting
