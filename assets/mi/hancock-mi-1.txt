the City Council. The public hearing shall follow the publication by at least
seven days, may be held separately or in connection with a regular or special

interested shall have an opportunity to be heard. After the hearing, the City
Council may adopt the ordinance with or without amendment or reject it, but if

procedures hereinbefore required in the case of a newly introduced ordinance.
As soon as practicable after adoption of any ordinance, the City Clerk-
Treasurer shall have it published again together with a notice of its adoption.
   (c)   EFFECTIVE DATE. Except as otherwise provided in this Charter, every
adopted ordinance shall become effective at the expiration of 30 days after

ordinances may not levy taxes, may not grant, renew, or extend a franchise; may
not regulate the rate charged by any public utility for its services; or may
not authorize the borrowing of money except as provided in Chapter X. An

emergency ordinance and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration
stating that an emergency exists and describing it in clear and specific terms.
An emergency ordinance may be adopted with or without amendment, or rejected,
at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of at least

looseleaf form, together with this Charter and any amendments thereto, and such
codes of technical regulations and other rules and regulations as the City
Council may specify. This compilation shall be known and cited officially as

(Ord. 157, passed 7-20-83)
§ 50.08 DELAY OF PREPARATION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ROLL.
   Notwithstanding any provision of §
50.07, the City Council may in its discretion, delay the preparation of the
special assessment roll until after the completion of the improvement, in which

parcel of land or other errors appearing therein; or it may, by resolution,
annul such assessment roll and direct that new proceedings be instituted. The
same proceedings shall be followed in making a new roll as in the making of the
original roll. If, after hearing all objections and making a record of such
changes as the Council deems justified, the Council determines that it is
satisfied with said special assessment roll and that assessments are in
proportion to benefits received, it shall thereupon pass a resolution reciting
such determinations, confirming such roll, placing it on file in the office of
the City Clerk and directing the Clerk to attach his warrant to a certified
copy thereof within ten days, therein commanding the Assessor to spread and the

created by general laws for state, county and city taxes, and the lands upon
which the same are a lien shall be subject to sale therefor the same as are
lands upon which delinquent city taxes constitute a lien.
(Ord. 157, passed 7-20-83)
§ 50.17 ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS; REFUNDS.
   The City Clerk shall, within 60 days after the completion of each local or
special public improvement, compile the actual cost thereof and certify the
same to the Assessor who shall adjust the special assessment roll to correspond
therewith. Should the assessment prove larger than necessary by 5% or less, the
same shall be reported to the Council which may place the excess in the city
treasury or make a refund thereof pro rata according to the assessment. If the
assessment exceeds the amount necessary by more than 5%, the entire excess
shall be credited to owners of property as shown by the city assessment roll
upon which such assessment has been levied, pro rata according to the
assessment; provided, however, that no refunds of special assessments may be
made which impair, or contravene the provision of any outstanding obligation or

the benefits received by the lot or parcel of land.

the payment of such special assessments, and shall be used for no other
purpose.

the improvement project for which the assessment was levied, expenses
incidental thereto, including the repayment of the principal and interest on
money borrowed therefor, and to refund excessive assessments, if refunds be
authorized.
(Ord. 157, passed 7-20-83)
§ 50.21 REASSESSMENT.
   Whenever the Council shall deem any special assessment invalid or defective
for any reason whatever, or in any court of competent jurisdiction shall have
adjudged such assessment to be illegal for any reason whatever, in whole or in
part, the Council shall have the power to cause a new assessment to be made for
the same purpose for which the former assessment was made, whether the
improvement or any part thereof has been completed and whether any part of the
assessment has been collected or not. All proceedings on such reassessment and
for the collection thereof shall be made in the manner as provided for the
original assessment. If any portion of the original assessment shall have been
collected and not refunded, it shall be applied upon the reassessment and the
reassessment shall to that extent be deemed satisfied. If more than the amount
reassessed shall have been collected, the balance shall be refunded to the
person making such payment.

advisable, direct the Assessor to prepare a special assessment roll covering
all such charges which shall not have been paid. Said roll shall be filed with
the Clerk who shall present the same to the City Council. However the Council
may follow the entire procedure used for other special assessments. Upon
confirmation of any special assessment roll authorized by this section, the
Council shall determine the number of installments in which assessments may be
paid, not to exceed the highest legally permitted.

Code, or whenever the Code Official has reasonable suspicion that there exists
in any dwelling unit on any residential rental property subject to this

dwelling unit or residential rental property unsafe, dangerous, hazardous, or a
public nuisance, the Code Official shall have the right, after giving 72 hours
written notice to the licensee, to enter the premises or any dwelling unit
thereon, at all reasonable times to inspect the same or to perform any duty
imposed by this Residential Rental Property Code, provided that such entry is

the right to seek entry by way of an administrative search warrant or other
lawful means.

dwelling unit available for inspection by the Residential Rental Property
Inspector (including if the dwelling unit or residential rental property is

not possible or where there are practical difficulties that limit the
residential rental property's ability to comply strictly therewith, the Code
Official shall have the authority with the approval of the City Manager to
grant alternate compliance, but only if:
      (1)   Alternate compliance is possible;
      (2)   Alternate compliance does not compromise or diminish life, health,
safety, or fire safety requirements; and

notice of denial or notice of violation shall have the right to appeal that
action to the Rental Code Board of Appeals. Such appeal shall be taken by
filing with the Rental Code Board of Appeals a notice of appeal within 14 days
of the date of the notice of denial or notice of violation. The notice of
appeal shall be in writing and shall set forth in sufficient detail why the
person believes that the notice of denial or notice of violation was issued in
error or why the proposed penalty is excessive, inappropriate, or unreasonable.
After the notice of appeal is filed, the Rental Code Board of Appeals shall set
a time and place for a public hearing. Notice of hearing shall be given to the
appellant in the same manner as the notice of denial or notice of violation. To
prevail on appeal, the appellant must prove that the notice of denial or notice
of violation was issued in error. If the Rental Code Board of Appeals fails to
take formal action at the public hearing, the Rental Code Board of Appeals
shall, no later than 30 days after the public hearing, issue its final order,

violations of this Residential Rental Property Code. The purpose of probation
is to provide the licensee a reasonable time to remediate any condition or
conditions that cause(s) a violation of this Residential Rental Property Code.
Probation may be conditioned to include reasonable reporting requirements, a
reasonable time period to remediate violations, or other reasonable
requirements necessary to bring the residential rental property into compliance
with this Residential Rental Property Code. Failure to successfully complete
any and all conditions of probation shall be grounds for revocation of the
rental license.

aggravating circumstances, including, but not limited to whether or not the
licensee has had other revocations or convictions under this Residential Rental
Property Code, will likely inform the decision. Any revocation shall be

CHAPTER 113: REGULATION AND TAXATION OF MARIHUANA
Section
   
113.01   Purpose
   
113.02   General prohibition of marihuana establishments
   
113.03   Violations and penalties
   
113.04   Severability
§ 113.01 PURPOSE.
   On November 6, 2018, voters approved the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of
Marihuana Act, Ballot Proposal 1 of 2018 (hereinafter referred to as the
"MRTMA") which came into legal effect on December 6, 2018. The MRTMA
automatically permits marihuana establishments as described therein in all
Michigan municipalities unless municipalities "opt out" and prohibit said
establishments. As a result, the City of Hancock (hereinafter referred to as
the "city") finds that the MRTMA, as approved, does not allow the city
sufficient time to address the health, safety, property, and public peace
interests of the community that may be affected by such establishments. The
city requires time to evaluate the rules and regulations of the MRTMA and any
rules promulgated by the State of Michigan Department of Licensing and
Regulatory Affairs (pursuant to MRTMA, §§ 7 and 8) and allow public discussion
before making a decision whether or not to allow marihuana establishments in
the city. This chapter does not, nor is in any way intended to, officially
state any long-term position of the city on marihuana establishments. Rather,
the necessity for public input on this issue and the city's desire to review
any effects of permitting marihuana establishments demonstrates the need to
promulgate a chapter to preserve the public, health, property, and public peace
of the city.
(Ord. 301, passed 11-14-18; Am. Ord. 302, passed 1-16-19)
§ 113.02 GENERAL PROHIBITION OF MARIHUANA ESTABLISHMENTS.
   Pursuant to the MRTMA, § 6.1, the city prohibits marihuana establishments
within its geographic boundaries to the fullest extent allowed by law.
(Ord. 301, passed 11-14-18; Am. Ord. 302, passed 1-16-19)
§ 113.03 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
   (A)   Any person who disobeys, neglects or refuses to comply with any
provision of this chapter or who causes, allows or consents to any of the same
shall be deemed to be responsible for the violation of this chapter. A
violation of this chapter is deemed to be a nuisance per se.
   (B)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
responsible for committing a municipal civil infraction as described and
authorized under §
130.01 of the City of Hancock Code of Ordinances. This shall be in addition to
the rights of the city to proceed at law or equity with other appropriate and
proper remedies. Additionally, the violator shall pay costs which may include
all expenses, direct and indirect, which the city incurs in connection with the
municipal civil infraction.
   (C)   Each day during which any violation continues shall be deemed a
separate, subsequent offense.
   (D)   In addition, the city may seek injunctive relief against persons
alleged to be in violation of this chapter, and such other relief as may be
provided by law.
   (E)   This chapter shall be administered and enforced by the City Manager or
by such other person(s) as designated by the city from time to time.
(Ord. 301, passed 11-14-18; Am. Ord. 302, passed 1-16-19)
§ 113.04 SEVERABILITY.
   The provisions of this chapter are hereby declared to be severable. If any
clause, sentence, word, section or provision is hereafter declared void or
unenforceable for any reason by a court of competent jurisdiction, it shall not
affect the remainder of such chapter which shall continue in full force and
effect. The provisions herein shall be construed as not interfering or
conflicting with anything otherwise allowed under the MRTMA, as adopted, the
Michigan Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act, Act 281 of 2016, or the Michigan
Medical Marihuana Act, Initiated Law 1 of 2008.

Communications Act of 1934 and the FCC Rules with respect to basic cable
service rate regulation, and prescribe procedures to provide a reasonable

§ 115.03 RATE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY FCC.
   In connection with the regulation of rates for basic cable service and
associated equipment, the City shall follow all FCC Rules.
(Ord. 210, passed 9-7-93)
§ 115.04 FILING; ADDITIONAL INFORMATION; BURDEN OF PROOF.
   (A)   A cable operator shall submit its schedule of rates for the basic
service tier and associated equipment or a proposed increase in such rates in
accordance with the Act and the FCC Rules. The cable operator shall include as
part of its submission such information as is necessary to show that its
schedule of rates or its proposed increase in rates complies with the Act and
the FCC Rules. The cable operator shall file ten copies of the schedule or
proposed increase with the City Clerk. For purposes of this chapter, the filing
of the cable operator shall be deemed to have been made when at least ten
copies have been received by the City Clerk. The City Council may, by
resolution or otherwise, adopt rules and regulations prescribing the
information, data and calculations which must be included as part of the cable
operator's filing of the schedule of rates or a proposed increase.
   (B)   In addition to information and data required by rules and regulations
of the city pursuant to division (A) of this section, a cable operator shall

§ 115.05 PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.
   (A)   If this chapter, any rules or regulations adopted by the city pursuant
to §
115.04(A), or any request for information pursuant to §
115.04(B) requires the production of proprietary information, the cable
operator shall produce the information. However, at the time the allegedly
proprietary information is submitted, a cable operator may request that
specific, identified portions of its response be treated as confidential and
withheld from public disclosure. The request must state the reason why the
information should be treated as proprietary and the facts that support those
reasons. The request for confidentiality will be granted if the city determines
that the preponderance of the evidence shows that nondisclosure is consistent
with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552. The city
shall place in a public file for inspection any decision that results in
information being withheld. If the cable operator requests confidentiality and
the request is denied, where the cable operator is proposing a rate increase,
it may withdraw the proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary
information will be returned to it; or the cable operator may seek review
within five working days of the denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the
information will be stayed pending review.
   (B)   Any interested party may file a request to inspect material withheld
as proprietary with the city. The city shall weigh the policy considerations
favoring nondisclosure against the reasons cited for permitting inspection in
light of the facts of the particular case. It will then promptly notify the
requesting entity and the cable operator that submitted the information as to
the disposition of the request. It may grant, deny or condition a request. The
requesting party or the cable operator may seek review of the decision by
filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Disclosure will be stayed pending
resolution of any appeal.
   (C)   The procedures set forth in this section shall be construed as
analogous to and consistent with the rules of the FCC regarding requests for
confidentiality including, without limitation, 47 CFR § 0.459.
(Ord. 210, passed 9-7-93)
§ 115.06 PUBLIC NOTICE; INITIAL REVIEW OF RATES.

bows and arrows, crossbows and projectiles launched therefrom, and every other
device by which a projectile is launched, aimed or directed from any mechanism
under spring, string or wire tension; provided, however, that such phrase does

or other area specially designed for the shooting of a bow and arrow, provided
that such operator takes reasonable precautions to insure that the target range
is being safely operated, and that the public generally and passersby are not
exposed to danger from within the target range. A site permit shall be valid
for a period of one year from the date of issue, and shall be subject to
revocation at any time by the Chief of Police if the Chief of Police reasonably
determines that the target range is being operated in a dangerous or unsafe
manner. A site permit shall automatically authorize all persons lawfully on the
premises to shoot a bow and arrow without the need for any additional permits
from the city.
         (b)   Individual permit. An individual permit may be issued to any
person making application therefor; provided, however, that each individual
permit shall identify the authorized user, and shall specify the location or
area where bow and arrow use will be permitted. An individual permit shall be
valid for a period of 30 days from the date of issue and shall be subject to
revocation at any time by the Chief of Police if the Chief of Police reasonably
determines that the user authorized by the permit has been using a bow and
arrow in a dangerous or unsafe manner.
      (2)   All of the following conditions shall be required as part of any
permit issued:
         (a)   The user is an adult, or if the user is intended to be a minor,
adequate adult supervision will be provided at all times;

to insure that other bow and arrow users, passersby, or other members of the
public will not be harmed, threatened by, or exposed to dangerous conditions;

the use of the bow and arrow.

§ 131.05 MUNICIPAL ORDINANCE VIOLATIONS BUREAU.
   (A)   Establishment. The city establishes a Municipal Ordinance Violations
Bureau, as authorized under § 8396 of the Act, to accept admissions of
responsibility for municipal civil infractions in response to municipal
ordinance violation notices issued and served by authorized city officials, and
to collect and retain civil fines and costs as prescribed by this code or any
ordinance.
   (B)   Location; supervision, rules and regulations; employees. The Bureau
shall be located at City Hall and shall be under the supervision and control of
the Clerk/Treasurer. The City Manager, subject to the approval of the City
Council, shall adopt rules and regulations for the operation of the Bureau and
appoint any necessary qualified employees to administer the Bureau.
   (C)   Disposition of violations. The Bureau may dispose only of municipal
civil infraction violations for which a fine has been scheduled and for which a
municipal ordinance violation notice has been issued. The fact that a fine has
been scheduled for a particular violation shall not entitle any person to
dispose of the violation at the Bureau. Nothing in this section shall prevent
or restrict the city from issuing a municipal civil infraction citation for any
violation or from prosecuting any violation in a court of competent
jurisdiction. No person shall be required to dispose of a municipal civil
infraction violation at the Bureau, and may have the violation processed before
a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The unwillingness of any person to dispose
of any violation at the Bureau shall not prejudice the person or in any way
diminish that person's rights, privileges, and protection accorded by law.
   (D)   Scope of authority. The scope of the Bureau's authority shall be
limited to accepting admissions of responsibility for municipal civil
infractions and collecting and retaining civil fines and costs as a result of
those admissions. The Bureau shall not accept payment of a fine from any person
who denies having committed the offense or who admits responsibility only with
explanation, and in no event shall the Bureau determine, or attempt to
determine, the truth or falsity of any fact or matter relating to an alleged
violation.
(Ord. 292, passed 4-20-16)
§ 131.06 ISSUANCE AND SERVICE OF MUNICIPAL ORDINANCE VIOLATION NOTICES.
   (A)   Contents. Municipal ordinance violation notices shall be issued and
served by authorized city officials under the same circumstances and upon the
same persons as are provided for municipal civil infraction citations in §
131.03. In addition to any other information required by this code or any other
ordinance, the violation notice shall indicate the time by which the alleged
violator must appear at the Bureau, the methods by which an appearance may be
made, the address and telephone number of the Bureau, the hours during which
the Bureau is open, the amount of the fine scheduled for the alleged violation,
and the consequences for failure to appear and pay the required fine within the
required time.
   (B)   Appearance; payment of fines and costs. An alleged violator receiving
a municipal ordinance violation notice shall appear at the Bureau and pay the
specified fine and costs at or by the time specified for appearance in the
municipal ordinance violation notice. An appearance may be made by mail, in
person, or by representation.
   (C)   Procedure where admission of responsibility is not made or fine is not
paid. If an authorized city official issues and serves a municipal ordinance
violation notice and if an admission of responsibility is not made and the
civil fine and cost, if any, prescribed by the schedule of fines for the
violation are not paid at the Bureau, a municipal civil infraction citation may
be filed with the District Court and a copy of the citation may be served by
first class mail upon the alleged violator at the alleged violator's last known
address. The citation filed with the Court does not need to comply in all
particulars with the requirements for citations as provided by §§ 8705 and 8709
of the Act, but shall consist of a sworn complaint containing the allegations
stated in the municipal ordinance violation notice and shall fairly inform the
alleged violator how to respond to the citation.

BUILDING OR STRUCTURE DEMOLISHED, MADE SAFE OR PROPERLY MAINTAINED; FAILURE TO
APPEAR OR NONCOMPLIANCE WITH ORDER; HEARING; ENFORCEMENT; REIMBURSEMENT AND
NOTICE OF COST; LIEN; REMEDIES.
   (A)   At a hearing prescribed by §
150.12, the hearing officer shall take testimony of the City Manager, Building
Inspector, or other city employee authorized by the City Manager, the owner of
the property, and any interested party. Not more than 5 days after completion
of the hearing, the hearing officer shall render a decision, either closing the
proceedings or ordering the building or structure demolished, otherwise made
safe or properly maintained.
   (B)   If the hearing officer determines that the building or structure
should be demolished, otherwise made safe or properly maintained, the hearing
officer shall enter an order that specifies what action the owner, agent or
lessee shall take and sets a date by which the owner, agent or lessee shall
comply with the order. If the building is a dangerous building under §
150.10, the order may require the owner or agent to maintain the exterior of
the building and adjoining grounds owned by the owner of the building,
including, but not limited to, the maintenance of lawns, trees and shrubs.
   (C)   If the owner, agent or lessee fails to appear, or neglects or refuses
to comply with the order issued under division (B), the hearing officer shall
file a report of the findings and a copy of the order with the City Council,
not more than 5 days after the date for compliance set in the order, and
request that necessary action be taken to enforce the order. If the City
Council has established a Board of Appeals under §
150.16, the hearing officer shall file the report of the findings and a copy of
the order with the Board of Appeals, and request that necessary action be taken
to enforce the order. A copy of the findings and order of the hearing officer
shall be served on the owner, agent or lessee in the manner prescribed in §
150.12.
   (D)   The City Council or the Board of Appeals shall set a date not less

opportunity to show cause why the order should not be enforced. The City
Council or the Board of Appeals shall either approve, disapprove or modify the
order. If the City Council or the Board of Appeals approves or modifies the
order, the City Council shall take all necessary action to enforce the order.
If the order is approved or modified, the owner, agent or lessee shall comply
with the order within 60 days after the date of the hearing under this
division. For an order of demolition, if the City Council or the Board of
Appeals determines that the building or structure has been substantially
destroyed by fire, wind, flood, deterioration, neglect, abandonment, vandalism
or other cause, and the cost of repair of the building or structure will be
greater than the state-equalized value of the building or structure, the owner,
agent or lessee shall comply with the order of demolition within 21 days after
the date of the hearing under this division. If the estimated cost of repair
exceeds the state-equalized value of the building or structure to be repaired,
a rebuttable presumption that the building or structure requires immediate
demolition exists.
   (E)   The cost of demolition includes, but is not limited to, fees paid to
hearing officers, costs of title searches or commitments used to determine the
parties in interest, recording fees for notices and liens filed with the County
Register of Deeds, demolition and dumping charges, court reporter attendance
fees, and costs of the collection of the charges authorized under this

conformance with this subchapter shall be reimbursed to the city by the owner
or party in interest in whose name the property appears.
   (F)   The owner or party in interest in whose name the property appears upon
the last local tax assessment records shall be notified by the City Assessor of
the amount of the cost of the demolition, of making the building safe, or of
maintaining the exterior of the building or structure or grounds adjoining the
building or structure, by first class mail at the address shown on the records.
If the owner or party in interest fails to pay the cost within 30 days after
mailing by the City Assessor of the notice of the amount of the cost, the city
shall have a lien for the cost incurred by the city to bring the property into
conformance with this subchapter, The lien shall not take effect until notice
of the lien has been filed or recorded as provided by law. A lien provided for
in this division does not have priority over previously filed or recorded liens
and encumbrances. The lien for the cost shall be collected and treated in the
same manner as provided for property tax liens under the General Property Tax
Act, 1893 PA 206, M.C.L.A. §§ 211.1 to 211.157.
   (G)   In addition to other remedies under this subchapter, the city may
bring an action against the owner of the building or structure for the full
cost of the demolition, of making the building safe, or of maintaining the
exterior of the building or structure or grounds adjoining the building or
structure. The city shall have a lien on the property for the amount of a
judgment obtained under this division. The lien provided for in this division
shall not take effect until notice of the lien is filed or recorded as provided
by law. The lien does not have priority over previously filed or recorded liens
and encumbrances.

150.11, or (b) who fails or refuses to comply with an order approved or
modified by the City Council or the Board of Appeals under §
150.13 within the time prescribed by that section, is guilty of a civil
infraction, and shall be subject to the provisions provided for in

limit the remedies available to the city. In addition to any other remedy
available at law, the city may bring an action for an injunction or other
process against a person to restrain, prevent or abate any violation of this

PROHIBITED STRUCTURES
§ 150.60 OUTDOOR FURNACES AND BOILERS.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   It is the purpose of this section to ban and prohibit the
installation and use of outdoor furnaces and outdoor boilers within the city
limits of the city for the purpose of securing and promoting public health,
comfort, convenience, safety and welfare of city residents. It is recognized
that the type of furnaces and boilers, generally fired with wood, create
noxious and hazardous smoke, soot, fumes, odors, air pollution, particles.
Temperature inversions and wind can cause smoke to stay close to the ground or
migrate to neighboring houses and buildings. These units generally incorporate
smoldering and frequent fire flare ups as the units adjust to local temperature
settings.
      (2)   Typically, the outdoor residential wood-burning hot water furnace
or boiler is a freestanding unit situated outside the envelope of the structure
to be heated. The unit consists of a closed combustion chamber surrounded by a
water tank and vented through a stack. A wood-burning fire is contained and
controlled in the combustion chamber or firebox of the furnace. During the
combustion process, heat is transferred through the walls of the chamber into
the water. The hot water from the furnace tank can then be circulated through
radiators or air-handling heat exchangers to transfer heat into a residence.
Some outdoor heating furnaces are equipped with additional plumbing to provide
domestic hot water.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following definition
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      OUTDOOR FURNACE.  Any device, appliance, equipment, apparatus or
structure that:
         (a)   Is designed, intended and/or used to provide heat and/or hot
water to any associated structure or dwelling;
         (b)   Operates by burning wood or any other solid fuel including but
not limited to: coal, paper, cardboard, pellets, and agricultural products;
         (c)   Is not located within the structure to be heated;
         (d)   Includes, but not limited to, devices referred to as outdoor
furnaces, outdoor boilers, and outdoor stoves.
   (C)   Regulations. Outdoor furnaces and outdoor boilers shall not be placed
or located on any property, land or lots within the city limits of the city.
   (D)   Penalty. Failure to abate a violation of this section as prescribed by
the City Manager, code enforcement officer, police officer or other city-
authorized representative shall result in a fine of up to $100 for each day
during which the property owner is in violation of this section and/or up to 90
days in jail.
(Ord. 260, passed 4-5-06)
§ 150.99 PENALTY.

conviction, be subject to a fine not exceeding $500 and costs of prosecution,
or by imprisonment for not more than 90 days or both such fine and imprisonment

that of the street so extended. Local residential streets shall be laid out as
to discourage their use by through traffic.
   (B)   Major thoroughfares. When a subdivision abuts or contains an existing

intersection angle is as nearly as possible to 90 degrees. Streets converging
at one point shall be reduced to the least practicable number.
   (F)   Dead-end streets. When adjoining an area not platted, the arrangements
of streets in new subdivisions shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to make provision for the future projection of streets into adjacent
areas. A one-foot public reserve may be required to be placed between stub
streets and subdivision boundaries.
   (G)   Street names. Street names shall not be permitted which might cause
confusion for purposes of assessing, mail delivery, or locating by the public
with names of existing streets in or near the city. Streets that will be

shall be provided in accordance with specifications prescribed by the City
Engineer. Modification of surface and subsurface drainage systems may be
requested by the City Engineer within the maintenance period.

REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS AND UTILITIES
§ 153.30 OWNER/DEVELOPER UTILITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE ARRANGEMENTS.
   It is the intention that the owner/developer may work together with the city
to encourage, promote and implement new developments in the city. The decision
on whether to work together is entirely at the discretion of the city and only
if funds are available to the city in addition to its currently-approved
budget. Any expenditures require the city amend its budget for the proposed new
expenses.
   (A)   If the city decides to and funds are available, the city offers to
cost share one-half the cost of extending water mains and laterals, sewer mains
and laterals, and road development to areas of the city not currently served
with this infrastructure, using city labor and equipment with city-approved
cost estimates revised on a regular basis to reflect cost changes.
   (B)   If owner/developer demand exists over current resources of the city
for infrastructure extensions, the City Council will determine the amount of
city investment based on annual budgeted funds in the applicable fund. Based on
budgeted funds, the city reserves the right to restrict the amount of
allocation of work in a given fiscal year, and to schedule development over a
multi-year period.
   (C)   The owner/developer would pay the city one-half the cost of the
appropriate water, sewer and/or road infrastructure extension using the city
cost estimates prior to the city commencing work. Nothing in this section
precludes an owner/developer from doing all the infrastructure work without
city participation or negotiating a lower city participation rate (less than
50%).
   (D)   This section applies to water, sewer or road extension, regardless if
its a new subdivision platted area or if it is a land division development.
   (E)   If city funds are utilized, the owner/developer shall average creation
of at least one lot per 150 feet of infrastructure extension.
   (F)   Any new development shall comply with city ordinances and the State
Subdivision and Land Development Act.
   (G)   All gas, electricity, cable, phone and other utilities would be the
responsibility of the owner/developer.
   (H)   All infrastructure shall be on existing city rights-of-way, city
streets, city easements or new rights-of-way easements deeded to the city on
city standards.
   (I)   Each improvement shall be constructed either by the proprietor or the
city, as determined by prior agreement, within a length of time agreed upon
from the date of approval of the final plat by the City Council. The City
Council shall release funds for the payment of work as it is completed and
approved by the city. Prior to acceptance by the city of improvements, a two-
year maintenance bond in an amount set by the City Council shall be posted by
the proprietor.
   (J)   The proprietor shall give the city the right to inspect all
construction work done by men to whatever extent the city deems necessary.

City Engineer.
   (A)   Requirements for underground wiring. This proprietor/developer shall
make all arrangements necessary for all utility lines (electric, telephone,
cable television or other services distributed by wire or cable) placed
underground entirely throughout a subdivided area. Where a major thoroughfare
is affected, such conduits or cables shall be placed within private easements
provided to such service companies by the developer or within dedicated public
ways. Overhead lines shall only be permitted upon the approval of the Planning
Commission and City Council where there is no harm to the health, safety,
welfare, plat design and character of subdivision. All facilities placed in
dedicated public ways shall be planned so as not to conflict with other
underground utilities. All facilities should be constructed as per the
requirements of the Michigan Public Service Commission. All drainage and
underground utilities which traverse privately owned property shall be
protected by easements granted by the proprietor/developer.
   (B)   Street pavement. Street improvements shall be provided by the
proprietor/developer in accordance with standards and specifications of the
City Engineer and the Houghton County Road Commission where jurisdiction is

owners and cause for enforcement by the governing unit.
         (d)   The proposed method of notifying the municipality when any

ADMINISTRATION
§ 153.70 VARIANCES.
   The Planning Commission shall recommend to the City Council a variance from
the provisions of this chapter on a finding that application of such provision
or requirement is impracticable. The Planning Commission shall only recommend
variances that it deems necessary to or desirable for the public interest. In
making its findings, as required hereinbelow, the Planning Commission shall
take into account the nature of the proposed use of land and the existing use
of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the
proposed subdivision, and the probable effect of the proposed subdivision upon
traffic conditions in the vicinity. No variance shall be recommended unless the
Planning Commission finds after a public hearing:
   (A)   That there are such special circumstances or conditions affecting said
property that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would
clearly be impracticable or unreasonable. In such cases, the subdivider shall
first state his reasons in writing as to the specific provision or requirement
involved and submit them to the Planning Commission;
   (B)   That the granting of the specified variance will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which said
property is situated;
   (C)   That such variance will not violate the provisions of the State
Subdivision Control Act;
   (D)   The Planning Commission shall include its findings and the specific
reasons therefor in its report of recommendations to the City Council and shall

   (E)   That such variance will not have the effect of nullifying the interest
and purpose of this chapter and the Comprehensive Development Plan.

fined not to exceed the sum of $500 and the cost of the prosecution or
imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both, at the discretion of the
court. Each day such violation shall exist shall constitute a separate offense.
