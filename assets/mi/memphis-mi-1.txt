may be, or to “sections _____ to _____” (inserting section numbers to indicate
the sections of the code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance
incorporated into the code); and
      (5)   Make other non-substantive changes necessary to preserve the

for the erection of a building or structure, or part thereof, within the lines

in which the Board finds, upon the evidence and arguments presented to it on
such appeal, that the entire property of the appellant located in whole or in
part within the lines of such mapped street, park, playground or other public
ground, cannot yield a reasonable return to the owner unless such permit be
granted and that balancing the interest of the city in preserving the integrity
of the adopted map and the interest of the owner of the property in the use and
benefit of his or her property, the granting of such permit is required by
consideration of justice and equity.

scheduled shall not entitle the alleged violator to disposition of the
violation at the Bureau and, in any case, the person in charge of such Bureau
may refuse to dispose of such violation in which case any person having
knowledge of the facts may make a sworn complaint before any court having
jurisdiction of the offense as provided by law.

determine, the truth or falsity of any fact or matter relating to such alleged
violation. No person shall be required to dispose of a parking violation at the
Parking Violations Bureau and all persons shall be entitled to have any such
violation processed before a court having jurisdiction thereof if they so
desire. The unwillingness of any person to dispose of any violation at the
Parking Violations Bureau shall not prejudice him or her or in any way diminish
the rights, privileges and protection accorded to him or her by law.
(1979 Code, § 10.34) (Ord. 37, passed 3-4-1969)
§ 32.05 TRAFFIC TICKETS; FORM.
   The issuance of a traffic ticket or notice of violation by a police officer
of the city shall be deemed an allegation of a parking violation. Such traffic
ticket or notice of violation shall indicate the length of time in which the
person to whom the same was issued must respond before the Parking Violations
Bureau. It shall also indicate the address of the Bureau, the hours during
which the Bureau is open, the amount of the penalty scheduled for the offense
for which the ticket was issued and advise that a warrant for the arrest of the
person to whom the ticket was issued will be sought if such a person fails to
respond within the time limited.

Violations Bureau for an annual fee, as determined by resolution of the City
Council, which payment shall be for a particular vehicle (nontransferable) to
be allowed to be parked in any nonmetered city-owned parking lot without limit
as to time during the validity period of the permit. Such permits shall be for
operable vehicles only and no person shall use such a permit to park an
inoperable vehicle in a city-owned parking lot. The city reserves the right to
direct where in any particular city-owned lot a permit holding vehicle may be
parked.

of the reserve components of the United States armed forces and who is called

or her employment as a commission certified law enforcement officer. The
person’s certification shall not become void during their term of active
military service. However, the certification of a certified law enforcement
officer described in this division may be revoked if the officer committed an
offense during the period of active duty in the armed forces that resulted in a
conviction. As used in this division, RESERVE COMPONENTS OF THE UNITED STATES
ARMED FORCES means that term as defined in Section 2 of the Military Family
Relief Fund Act, M.C.L.A. § 35.1212. This division does not apply to a
commission certified law enforcement officer who volunteers for a term of
active military service or who voluntarily extends a term of active military

(1979 Code, § 1.110) (Ord. 38, passed 4-1-1969)
§ 33.11 ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS; REFUNDS.
   Should any special assessment prove insufficient to pay for the improvement
and related costs of the project for which it was levied, or to pay the
principal and interest on bonds issued in anticipation of such special
assessment roll, the Council may make additional pro rata assessments. Should
any special assessment prove larger than necessary by less than 5%, the Council
may place the excess in the General Fund of the city; if more than 5%, the
entire excess shall be refunded pro rata to the owners of the property
assessed, as shown by the current assessment roll of the city, and to the city
to the extent it has been assessed.
(1979 Code, § 1.111) (Ord. 38, passed 4-1-1969)
§ 33.12 LIEN; COLLECTION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
   (A)   Upon the confirmation of each special assessment roll, the special
assessments shall become a debt to the city from the persons to whom they are
assessed and shall, until paid, be a lien upon the property assessed for the
amount of such assessments and all interest and charges thereon. Such liens
shall be of the same character and effect as created by the City Charter for
taxes.
   (B)   The Council may provide for the deferred payment of special
assessments from persons who, in the opinion of the Council and Assessor, by
reason of poverty, are unable to contribute to the cost thereof. In all such
cases, as a condition to the granting of such deferred payment, the city shall
require mortgaged security on the real property of the beneficiary payable on
or before his or her death, or in any event, on the sale or transfer of the
property.
   (C)   Special assessments shall become due on such date as the Council shall
prescribe.
   (D)   Any assessment may be made payable in yearly installments not to
exceed ten in number. The initial installment shall be due on such date as the
Council shall prescribe. Subsequent yearly installments shall be spread on the
annual city tax roll. The second installment shall be collected as part of the
first city tax roll, which becomes due six months or more after the due date of
the initial installment. All unpaid installments, from such date as the Council
shall prescribe, shall bear interest at a rate of not exceeding 6% per annum,
which interest computed to the following January 10 shall be spread yearly on
the city tax roll together as one item, with the amount of the installment then
being spread. The Council may provide for advance payment of unpaid
installments with interest computed to such date as the Council prescribes.
   (E)   Each special assessment, or the initial installment of such assessment
when installment payments are provided for, shall be collected by the Treasurer
without collection fee for a period ending on the tenth day of the second month
following the month in which the assessment or initial installment falls due.
On the eleventh day of the second month following such due date, the Treasurer
shall add to any such unpaid assessment, or initial installment, a collection
fee of 4% of the amount thereof and shall add an additional 2% collection fee
on the eleventh day of each succeeding month that such assessment or initial
installment remains unpaid. All collection fees shall belong to the city and be
collectible in the same manner as a collection fee on city taxes.
   (F)   Special assessments or initial installments which become due, other
than on December 1, shall, if unpaid for 30 days or more on October 1 of any
year, be certified as delinquent to the Council by the Treasurer and the
Council shall place such delinquent assessments on the tax roll for that year
together as one item with accrued collection fees thereon to January 10 of the
following year.
   (G)   Special assessments, or installments thereof, which become due on
December 1 of any year, and delinquent assessments together with accrued
interest and collection fees thereon which have been placed upon the city tax
roll, shall be collected in all respects as are city taxes due on such date and
shall be returned to the County Treasurer with such taxes, if uncollected, on
the following March 1.
(1979 Code, § 1.112) (Ord. 38, passed 4-1-1969)
§ 33.13 CORRECTION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
   (A)   Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of the Council,
be invalid by reason of irregularity or informality in the proceedings, or if
any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge such assessment to be
illegal, the Council shall, whether the improvement has been made or not, or
whether any part of the assessments have been paid or not, have power to cause
a new assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former
assessment was made.
   (B)   All proceedings on such reassessment, and for the collection thereof,
shall be conducted in the same manner as provided for the original assessment
and whenever any sum or part thereof levied upon any property in the assessment
so set aside has been paid and not refunded, the payment so made shall be
applied upon the reassessment or, if the payments exceed the amount of the
reassessment, refund shall be made.
   (C)   No judgment or decree, nor any act of the Council vacating a special
assessment, shall destroy or impair the lien of the city upon the premises
assessed for such amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged against
the same or as by regular mode of proceeding might have been lawfully assessed
thereupon.
(1979 Code, § 1.113) (Ord. 38, passed 4-1-1969)
§ 33.14 CONTESTED ASSESSMENTS.
   No suit or action of any kind shall be instituted or maintained for the
purpose of contesting or enjoining the collection of any special assessment
unless within 30 days after the confirmation of the special assessment roll
written notice is given to the Council of intention to file such suit or action
stating the grounds on which it is claimed such assessment is illegal and

the assessment was levied and expenses incidental thereto or to repay any
principal and interest money borrowed therefor.
(1979 Code, § 1.115) (Ord. 38, passed 4-1-1969)

required.

respect to, any single premises, which expense is chargeable against said
premises and the owner thereof under the provisions of this chapter and is not
of that class required to be pro-rated among the several lots and parcels of
land in a special assessment district, an account of the labor, material and
service for which such expense was incurred, with a description of the premises
upon or in respect to which the expense was incurred and the name of the owner,
if known, shall be reported to the Treasurer, who shall immediately charge and
bill the owner, if known.
   (B)   The Treasurer, at the end of each quarter, shall report to the City
Council all sums so owing to the city and which have not been paid within 30
days after the mailing of the bill therefor. The Council shall, at such times
as it may deem advisable, direct the Assessor to prepare a special assessment
roll covering all such charges reported to it together with a penalty of 10%.
Such roll shall be filed with the Clerk, who shall advise the Council of the
filing of the same, and the Council shall thereupon set a date for the hearing
of objections to such assessment roll. The assessment roll shall be open to
public inspection for a period of seven days before the Council shall meet to
review the roll and hear complaints.
   (C)   The City Clerk shall give notice in advance by publication of the
opening of the roll to public inspection and of the meeting of the Council to
hear complaints and shall also give like notice to the owners of the property
affected by first class mail at their addresses as shown on the current general
assessment roll of the city, at least ten days prior to the date of such
hearing. Such special assessments, and all interest and charges thereon, shall,
from the date of confirmation of the roll, be and remain a lien upon the
property assessed of the same character and effect as a lien created by general
law for state and county taxes, until paid.
   (D)   The same penalty and interest shall be paid on such assessments when
delinquent from such date after confirmation, as shall be fixed by the Council,
as are provided by the City Charter, to be paid on delinquent general city
taxes and such assessments with penalties and interest and shall be added by
the Treasurer to the next general city tax roll or general county and school

   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any residential rental structure or
residential rental unit who has received a notice of violation of any ordinance
of the city, to transfer, convey, lease or sell, including by land contract,
his or her ownership and/or interest in any other way to another, unless such
owner shall have first furnished the grantee, lessee, vendee, or transferee a
true copy of any notice of violation and shall have furnished to the Building
Official a signed and notarized statement from the grantee, vendee, lessee or
transferee acknowledging the receipt of such notice of violation and

(Ord. 224, passed 4-2-2024)
§ 97.09 CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   No person shall lease, rent, or cause to be occupied a residential rental
structure or residential unit unless there is a valid certificate of compliance
issued by the City Rental Housing Official in the name of the owner and issued
for the specific residential rental structure and each residential unit. The
certificate shall be displayed in a conspicuous place in each residential
rental structure or residential unit at all times and in a common area shared
by all occupants of a residential rental structure. The certificate shall be
issued after an inspection by the Rental Housing Official which may include
inspections by the building inspector, mechanical inspector, housing inspector,
electrical inspector, plumbing inspector and Fire Department inspectors (in
instances in which fire inspectors have jurisdiction) or other building
officials to determine each rental dwelling and rental unit complies with the
provisions and codes and ordinances of the city. Such inspections shall be
commenced within 60 days of rental property registration and shall continue
until all rental dwellings and all rental units in the city have been
inspected. A certificate of compliance shall expire two years from the date of
the issuance. The inspection process will then be continued for all such units
on a periodic basis of not more than once every two years or as provided for in
§
97.11.
(Ord. 224, passed 4-2-2024)
§ 97.10 APPLICABILITY TO EXISTING RESIDENTIAL RENTAL STRUCTURES.
   (A)   This applies to all residential rental structures or residential units
in the city after the publication of this chapter, and to those subsequently
constructed or created. For residential rental structures or residential units,
which have been registered in accordance with the provisions of §
97.05, the prohibitions against leasing, renting, and occupying contained in §
97.08 and the posting requirements of § 97.09 shall be inapplicable to such
dwellings or units until 60 days after the city makes it initial inspection of
such dwellings or units. This will permit the owner time to make necessary
repairs and obtain a certificate of compliance while maintaining occupancy of
the rental unit; however, if the defects which must be corrected pose an
imminent threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the occupants, the
inspector shall commence procedures to vacate the dwelling, and the provisions
of §
97.09 prohibiting occupancy shall be immediately applicable.
   (B)   Any residential rental structure which is a new construction or
renovation which required a comprehensive inspection, and which is issued a
certificate of occupancy pursuant to an inspection after, will also be issued a
certificate of compliance simultaneous with the certificate of occupancy and an
inspection fee pursuant to §
97.12 shall not then be required. Residential rental structures which are new
construction shall comply with registration requirements pursuant to §
97.05.
(Ord. 224, passed 4-2-2024)

premises are in violation of this chapter;
      (2)   Upon receipt of a report or referral from the Police Department,
other public agencies or departments, or any individual indicating that the
premises are in violation of this chapter, and which is based on the personal
knowledge of the person making the report;
      (3)   If an exterior survey of the premises gives the enforcing officer
probable cause to believe that the premises are in violation of this chapter;
or
      (4)   Upon receipt of information by the enforcing officer that a rental
unit is not registered with the city as required by this chapter.
   (B)   Scheduling of inspections shall be as follows:
      (1)   The inspector shall notify the owner of a residential rental
structure of the date and time such structure is to be inspected. Such notice
may be personally delivered or may be sent by first class mail.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice, the owner must either:
         (a)   Appear at the time and date scheduled for the inspection; or
         (b)   Object within ten days of the mailing or delivery of the notice:
            1.   Schedule an alternative date for the appointment. The
alternative date must be within 30 days from the date identified in the initial
notice; or
            2.   Direct the inspector to contact the occupants of the rental
unit directly to schedule the inspection and provide the occupants' name and
address.
      (3)   If an owner of a residential rental structure asks the inspector to
schedule the appointment with the occupant, the inspector shall notify the
occupant of the residential renal unit of the date and time such unit is
scheduled to be inspected. Such notice may be personally delivered or may be
sent by first class mail. Upon receipt of the notice, the occupant must either:
         (a)   Appear at the date and time scheduled for the inspection; or
         (b)   Object within ten days and schedule an alternative date for the
appointment. The alternative date must be within 30 days from the data
identified in the initial notice.
      (4)   If an owner or occupant subsequently learns he will not be present
for a scheduled appointment, the individual must provide the inspector with at
least 24 hours advance notice and must schedule a second inspection date within
30 days from the scheduled appointment. Failure to appear for a scheduled
appointment without providing advance notice shall be a violation of this
division and a municipal civil infraction. Failure to appear for a scheduled
second inspection date shall be a violation of this division and a municipal
civil infraction.
   (C)   If an owner or occupant refuses to allow a city rental housing
official entrance to a residential rental structure or unit, the inspector
shall:
      (1)   Prior to seeking a warrant, advise the owner or occupant of the
city's intention to obtain a warrant and request entry for the purposes of
conducting an inspection.
      (2)   If entry is not permitted under the circumstances set forth in
division (C)(1) above, the inspector shall request the assistance of the City
Attorney in obtaining a warrant. The warrant request shall be on the standard
form used by the court and shall state the basis for requesting the warrant.
      (3)   If a warrant is obtained, the inspector shall use the warrant to
obtain entry through the least objectionable means possible and with the
assistance of a court officer or police officer as may be required. The warrant
shall only be used to conduct an inspection pursuant to this chapter and for no
other purpose.
   (D)   Failure to permit entry after notification that a warrant for entry
has been obtained by the inspector shall be a municipal civil infraction.
   (E)   During the inspection, the City Rental Housing Official shall note any
violations of this chapter or other provisions of this code and give notice of
such violations to the responsible local agent in accordance with §
97.04. The enforcing officer shall direct the agent and owner to correct
violations within the time set forth in the notice. A reasonable time for
correcting violations shall be determined by the enforcing officer considering
the nature of the violations and all relevant circumstances but may not extend
the time for correcting violations if the enforcing officer deems such action
appropriate under all relevant circumstances, but not to exceed an additional
60 days.
(Ord. 224, passed 4-2-2024)
§ 97.12 INSPECTION FEES.
   (A)   The operating fees for periodic inspection of each residential rental
unit shall be established by resolution of the City Council. The inspection fee
shall be $100 ($70 to the inspector and $30 for administrative costs).
   (B)   If the City Rental Housing Official determines that a complaint was
filed without a factual basis, and such inspection is made on a complaint
basis, a $100 fee shall be charged to the complainant.
(Ord. 224, passed 4-2-2024)
§ 97.13 LATE FEES AND LIENS.
   (A)   An administrative fee of 10% of the unpaid balance shall be paid to
the city by the person obligated to pay an inspection fee under § 97.12 if such
fee is not paid within 60 days from the billing date. After 90 days from the
date of billing, those fees shall become a lien on the property pursuant to
division (B) below and may be collected in the same manner as real property
taxes.
   (B)   When any fee is unpaid or expense incurred by the city upon or in
respect to any separate or single lot, parcel of land or premises, the City
Council is authorized to charge and collect as a lien against any separate or
single lot, parcel of land or premises an account of the fees, labor or
services for which the expense was incurred. The City Rental Housing Official
shall notify the City Council of any expenses or fees levied against the
property, the name or the person chargeable therewith, and the cost of labor
and service performed.
   (C)   The City Council shall review the rental inspection and determine what
amount or part of every reported expense shall be charged, and the premises
upon which the charge shall be levied as a lien against the property. The City
Council shall then notify the City Assessor, who shall include such chargeable
amounts against the rental property chargeable therewith on the next tax roll
for the collection of general city taxes.
(Ord. 224, passed 4-2-2024)
§ 97.14 ISSUANCE OR RENEWAL OF CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   Between 30 and 60 days before the expiration date on the certificate
of compliance issued for a rental property, every owner shall apply to the city
Inspection Department for the issuance of a new certificate of compliance for
that residential rental structure.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a timely application for issuance or renewal of a
certificate of compliance, the city shall inspect the premises before the
certificate of compliance expires or is initially issued. Upon failure of the
city to conduct an inspection prior to occupancy or expiration of the
certificate of compliance, the owner may rent the property until the city has
conducted an inspection, and the owner will not be deemed in violation of §
97.09 during that time. If, however, the city's failure to inspect is due to
the owner's or operator's action, failure to act or refusal to permit an
inspection after reasonable notice of intent to inspect, the owner shall not
rent the property without a current certificate of compliance as required by §
97.09.
(Ord. 224, passed 4-2-2024)

fees so that it shall not be discriminatory, unreasonable or unfair as to such
commerce. Such application may be made before, at or within six months after
payment of the prescribed license fee. The applicant shall, by affidavit, and
supporting testimony, show his or her method of business and gross volume, or
estimated gross volume, of business and such other information as the Mayor may
deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden
on such commerce.
   (B)   The Mayor shall then conduct an investigation, comparing the
applicant’s business with other businesses of like nature and shall make
findings of fact from which he or she shall determine whether the fee fixed for
the solicitor’s license is unfair, unreasonable or discriminatory as to
applicant’s business and shall fix as the license fee for the applicant an
amount that is fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory or, if the fee has
already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and above the fee so
fixed. In fixing the fee to be charged, the Mayor shall have the power to base
the fee upon a percentage of gross sales or any other method which will assure
that the fee assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like
nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the fee as prescribed by
§
110.08.
   (C)   Should the Mayor determine the gross sales measure of the fee to be
the fair basis, he or she may require the applicant to submit, either at the
time of termination of applicant’s business in the city or at the end of each
three-month period, a sworn statement of the gross sales and pay the amount of
fee therefor, provided that no additional fee during any one license year shall
be required after the licensee shall have paid an amount equal to the annual
license fee as prescribed in §
110.08.

mail, to the address provided by the grantee, a notification containing the
following information.
      (1)   The proposed schedule of rates shall become effective 30 days after
the date of the submission unless such schedule is tolled pursuant to, and in
conformity with, the applicable FCC rules and this subchapter.
      (2)   The grantee has the burden of proof in demonstrating that the

more information is necessary or that a public hearing should be held or the
City Clerk believes, in his or her discretion, that a public hearing should be
held, the City Clerk shall issue a tolling order to the grantee, delaying the

order and setting forth the length of the tolling period. The City Clerk shall

occur within 60 days of the date of the tolling order.
   (E)   Public hearing. Following the issuance of the tolling order, the City
Clerk shall immediately schedule a public hearing before the City Council to be
held within 60 days of the date of the tolling order. Notification of the
hearing date, time and location shall be transmitted to the grantee via first
class mail. The following provisions are made for public hearings as to a cable

      (1)   The notice of such public hearing shall be in writing and posted as
required by applicable law.
      (2)   At such public hearing, the grantee shall have the opportunity to
present arguments and documentation in person and/or in writing supporting its
proposed rate schedule. Following this presentation, the City Council shall
hear arguments and consider documentation as presented by the City Attorney,
other city officials and members of the general public as to the proposed rate
schedule. The grantee may then be allowed to present arguments and
documentation in rebuttal.
      (3)   In the event the City Council needs additional information,
documentation or materials from the grantee or any other person, it shall
direct that the same be supplied to the City Council within 14 days of the date

considered. The grantee or other person shall supply these materials to the
City Council and the City Clerk shall process these materials in compliance
with division (B) above. Concurrently, the City Council shall schedule a second
public hearing to be held at the next available City Council meeting.
      (4)   Upon receipt of the additional materials, the City Clerk shall
distribute such materials to the members of the City Council. The City Clerk
shall then prepare a written recommendation as to the proposed rate schedule.
In evaluating the rates to be set for services, the City Clerk shall consider
the federal benchmark standards as may be established by the Federal
Communications Commission, if the grantee seeks a rate modification based upon
these standards or, if grantee seeks a modification based upon its cost of
service, the City Clerk shall allow a fair return on investment, taking into
account appropriate costs including, but not limited to, the grantee’s capital
costs, basic cable programming, customer service, labor and ancillary costs
attributable to obtaining and transmitting signals carried on the basic
service.

basic cable costs factors itemized in the “fair return on investment” standard.
      (6)   At the adjourned hearing, the City Council shall review all
information and materials together with the written recommendation of the City
Clerk. The City Council may adopt such recommendation or, after setting forth a
basis for adopting a modification to that recommendation, and considering all
factors outlined within division (A) above, may make and adopt a modified
recommendation. Any modification and the basis for the recommendation, shall be
promptly reduced to writing and supplied to the City Clerk and sent promptly to
the grantee via first class mail.
      (7)   The recommendation of the City Council shall become final and
binding upon the grantee within seven days of the date that the written
recommendation is adopted. The City Clerk shall cause the rate schedule to be

violation of this subchapter, it may be ordered to reduce its basic rates to
75% of the FCC Benchmark of Rates and its services/rental charges to those
specified within the initial franchise agreement or proposal to provide a

service/rental charges, to such amounts as may be adopted by the City Council
as set forth below.
   (B)   City Council; authority to set rates.
      (1)   In the event the grantee fails to submit a proposed rate schedule,
as set forth above, within 60 days, the City Council shall meet to review the
FCC benchmark of rates as well as the charges for services/rentals within the
original franchise agreement and the FCC materials regarding the service/rental
expenses and issue a rate schedule binding upon the grantee.
      (2)   In evaluating these rates, the City Council shall consider that the
grantee is entitled to a fair return on its investment and shall take into
account the appropriate costs including, but not limited to, the grantee’s
capital costs, basic cable programming, customer service, labor and ancillary
costs attributable to obtaining and transmitting signals carried on the basic
service. Increases in such costs, and the costs of any franchise-imposed
requirements not directly related to the provision of cable television service,
as well as a reasonable profit to the grantee shall also be considered. The
grantee may submit written documentation to the City Council prior to the
meeting date as to any aspects of its costs. The City Council shall presume the
reasonableness of any documented increases supplied by the grantee in those
basic cable cost factors itemized in this “fair return on investment” standard.

schedule shall be in effect with the beginning date being the date the grantee
modified its rate schedule in violation of this subchapter or as otherwise
allowed by law and the ending date being the date arrived at by subsequent
implementation of this subchapter.
      (4)   The rate schedule shall be mailed to the grantee and published in
conformance with applicable law. The rate schedule shall be effective upon its
being reduced to writing and placed in the form of a resolution.

shall be the sole authority to authorize public disclosure of alleged
proprietary materials. In determining whether any such materials shall be
disclosed, the City Council shall grant the grantee’s request to maintain the
confidentiality of the materials only if such request is consistent with the
purposes of 5 USC 552 and applicable FCC regulations.

submission shall be in writing specifying what materials sought to be disclosed
to the public and the basis for requesting such public disclosure. The City

§ 117.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to implement the provisions of 2018
Initiated Law No. 1, being the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana
Act, the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act and the Michigan Marihuana Facilities
Licensing Act so as to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of
residents of the city by setting forth the manner in which certain marihuana
establishments can be operated in the city. Further, the purpose of this
chapter is to:
      (1)   Authorize the establishment of marihuana establishments within the
city and provide standards and procedures for the review, issuance, renewal,
and revocation of city issued permits for the same;
      (2)   Impose fees to defray and recover the cost to the city of the
administrative and enforcement costs associated with marihuana establishments;
and
      (3)   Coordinate with state laws and regulations addressing marihuana
establishments.
   (B)   This chapter authorizes the establishment of certain adult use
marihuana businesses within the city consistent with the provisions of the
Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act, the Michigan Medical
Marihuana Act and the Michigan Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act subject to
the following:
      (1)   Use, distribution, cultivation, production, possession, and
transportation of marihuana remains illegal under federal law, and marihuana
remains classified as a "controlled substance" by federal law. Nothing in this
chapter is intended to promote or condone the production, distribution, or
possession of marihuana in violation of any applicable law. Nothing in this
chapter is intended to grant immunity from any criminal prosecution under state
or federal law. This chapter does not protect users of marihuana or the owners
of properties on which a marihuana establishment is located from prosecution or
having their property seized by federal law enforcement authorities. This
chapter is to be construed to protect the public health, safety and welfare
over marihuana establishments' interests. The operation of a licensed marihuana
establishment in the city is a revocable privilege and not a right. Nothing in
this chapter is to be construed to or shall grant a property right for an
individual or business entity to engage, obtain, or have renewed a city issued
permit to engage in the use, distribution, cultivation, production, possession,
transportation or sale of marihuanain the city.
      (2)   Any individual or business entity which purports to have engaged in
the use, distribution, cultivation, production, possession, transportation or
sale of marihuana as a commercial enterprise in the city without obtaining the
required authorization required by this chapter is deemed to be an illegally
established nuisance, and as such is not entitled to legal nonconforming status
under this chapter, the city zoning code, or state statutory or common law.
      (3)   Nothing in this chapter is intended to grant immunity from criminal
or civil prosecution, penalty or sanction for the cultivation, manufacture,
possession, use, sale, distribution or transport of marihuana in any form, that
is not in strict compliance with all applicable rules and laws promulgated by
the State of Michigan regarding the commercialization of marihuana. Strict
compliance with all applicable state laws and regulations is deemed a
requirement for the issuance or renewal of any permit issued under this
chapter, and noncompliance with any applicable state law or regulation is
grounds for the revocation or nonrenewal of any permit issued under the terms
of this chapter.
   (C)   Any person or entity that accepts an authorization to operate a
marihuana establishment pursuant to this chapter waives and releases the city,
its officers, elected officials, and employees from any liability for injuries,
damages or liabilities of any kind that result from any arrest or prosecution
of marihuana establishment owners, operators, employees, clients or customers
for a violation of state or federal laws, rules or regulations. The holder of
such authorization shall, as a condition to authorization, indemnify, defend

§ 117.05 APPLICATION RECEIPT PERIOD AND CONDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION.
   (A)   The period during which the City Clerk may accept applications for
conditional authorization to operate marihuana establishments, if any, shall be
set by the City Clerk pursuant to the direction of City Council and shall be
referred to as the “Receipt Period.” During the Receipt Period, the City Clerk
will accept and receive applications as detailed in this chapter.
   (B)   As of the close of business on the last date of the Receipt Period,
the Clerk shall assemble all completed applications for conditional
authorizations to operate a marihuana establishment which were timely received
and are complete and present the same to City Council for review and/or
consideration at the next regularly scheduled City Council meeting, or at such
other time as City Council directs. The Clerk shall inform all applicants who
timely submit completed applications when the applications will be first
presented to City Council.
   (C)   In an open meeting(s) the City Council shall consider timely submitted
complete applications for conditional authorization to operate a marihuana
establishment within the city. The City Council may, but is not obligated to,
request additional information from some or all the applicants. The City
Council may, but is not required to, take action to approve or deny
applications at the first meeting in which they are presented. If, after
reviewing the applications City Council desires to grant conditional
authorization to operate a marihuana establishment(s) within the city, the City
Council will decide among applicants by using a competitive process intended to
select applicants who are best suited to operate in compliance with the MRTMA
and/or MMMFLA, as applicable, in the city. The factors considered and format of
the competitive process shall be up to the discretion of City Council, subject
to the requirements of the law. The City Council is not required to approve any
applications or grant any conditional authorizations to operate a marihuana
establishment within the city and may decide to deny all applications. The
determination of City Council to grant or deny conditional authorization to
applicant is based upon the majority vote of the members of Council presenting
and voting on the issue.
   (D)   The Clerk will grant final authorization for an establishment only if
the applicant:
      (1)   Was granted conditional authorization by the City Council which has
not expired or been revoked;
      (2)   Submits the paperwork for the establishment-specific step of the
application for a state operating license (and all related applications for
stacked licenses) to LARA within 30 days of receiving conditional
authorization;
      (3)   Submits an application for a zoning compliance certificate from the
city building inspector within 30 days of receiving conditional authorization
and obtains a zoning compliance certificate within six months of receiving
conditional authorization;
      (4)   Receives all required licenses and approvals from LARA to operate
the establishment within 18 months after conditional authorization is granted;
and
      (5)   Enters into a written agreement with the city confirming that the
marihuana establishment will operate in accordance with the business plans,
building plans, design standards, and all other operational standards described
by the applicant in the application and in any supplemental materials provided
to the city. The agreement shall further provide that if the establishment
breaches the agreement, then the city may revoke authorization of the
establishment following notice and a public hearing, and that in such event,
the city shall be entitled to injunctive relief barring further operation of
the establishment in the city.
   (E)   Expiration of conditional authorization. If the applicant for a
conditionally authorized establishment fails to satisfy any of the deadlines
established under division (D) above, the conditional authorization will
automatically expire, unless the time to comply is extended by the City Council
in its sole discretion.
   (F)   Availability. The Clerk shall only accept applications for conditional
authorization upon the direction of the City Council. The City Council is not
required to accept applications or issue conditional authorizations sufficient
to fill all available establishment types permitted under this chapter or
subsequent resolution of City Council. Rather, such limitations are maximum
numbers of licenses and not minimums or requirements. If the City Council, in
its discretion, directs the City Clerk to accept applications for conditional
authorizations to operate marihuana establishments within the city, the
receipt, review and consideration of such applications shall be pursuant to the
procedure detailed herein.
(Ord. 209, passed 10-7-2020; Ord. 218, passed 4-4-2023)
§ 117.06 RELOCATION OF ESTABLISHMENTS AND TRANSFERS OF AUTHORIZATIONS.
   (A)   As detailed in this chapter, conditional authorizations and final
authorizations to operate marihuana establishments within the city are awarded
based upon a competitive process designed to select the applicant(s) best
suited to operate a marihuana establishment within the city in compliance with
MRTMA and/or MMMFLA. As a result, such authorizations are approved based upon
details specific to the specific applicant and the proposed location of the
[text missing]. Accordingly, conditional authorization and/or final
authorizations to operate a marihuana establishment(s) are not transferable, as
a matter of right, to persons or entities, other than the authorization holder,
or to other locations. If an authorization holder desires to transfer the
location of the marihuana establishment or ownership of such authorization,
such is subject to the prior approval of City Council.
   (B)   Transfer of ownership or a final authorization or conditional
authorization and of the location of an establishment without prior approval of
City Council shall result in an automatic revocation of the final authorization
or conditional authorization.
      (1)   The holder of a final authorization or conditional authorization to
operate a marihuana establishment may request the City Council approve the
transfer of such authorization to different location within the city by
submitting a written request to the city. The City Council shall review such
request, and approve or deny the same, after considering the following:
         (a)   Whether the proposed new location is properly zoned for a
marihuana establishment;
         (b)   The impact of the proposed new location on the community as a
whole;
         (c)   The scope improvements required before the proposed new location
may be operational;
         (d)   The existing establishment's compliance with city ordinances and
with state law and administrative rules; and
         (e)   Such other factors and information deemed relevant by the City
Council.
      (2)   The holder of a final authorization or conditional authorization to
operate a marihuana establishment in the city may request the City Council
approve the transfer of such authorization to a different person or entity by
submitting a written request to the city. The request shall include all
information for the proposed new owner(s), including stakeholders, that is
required for a new applicant under this chapter. The City Council will consider
such request to transfer and grant or deny such request. In considering a
request to transfer ownership, the City Council shall consider whether the
proposed new owner is suited to operate within the city in compliance with
MRTMA and/or MMMFLA.
(Ord. 209, passed 10-7-2020; Ord. 218, passed 4-4-2023)
§ 117.07 GENERAL REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Submission of supplementary information to the city. Applicants for
conditional authorizations and those operating existing establishments pursuant
to final authorizations must provide the City Clerk with copies of all
documents submitted to LARA in connection with the initial license application,
subsequent renewal applications, or investigations conducted by LARA. The
documents must be provided to the Clerk within seven days of submission to LARA
and may be submitted by electronic media unless otherwise requested by the
Clerk.
   (B)   Compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Marihuana
establishments must be operated in compliance with all applicable rules,
ordinances and regulations, including, MRTMA, MMMFLA and MRTMA.
   (C)   No consumption on premises. No smoking, inhalation, or other
consumption of marihuana shall take place on or within the premises of any
establishment. It shall be a violation of this chapter to engage in such
behavior, or for a person to knowingly allow such behavior to occur. Evidence
of all of the following gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that a person
allowed the consumption of marihuana on or within a premise in violation of
this section:
      (1)   The person had control over the premises or the portion of the
premises where the marihuana was consumed;
      (2)   The person knew or reasonably should have known that the marihuana
was consumed; and
      (3)   The person failed to take corrective action.
   (D)   Annual fee. Unless the City Council approves a different fee by
resolution, a licensee must pay to the city the maximum annual fee as permitted
by MRTMA, MMMFLA and MRTMA (as applicable) for each license within the city in
order to help defray administrative and enforcement costs. The initial annual
fee(s) must be paid to the City Clerk when the application for city approval is
submitted. In each subsequent year, fees are due on the date on which the
licensee submits an application to LARA for renewal of the state operating
license.
   (E)   Renewal of city issued establishment final authorization.
      (1)   If the holder of a valid city issued final authorization to operate
a marihuana establishment desires to renew such authorization, it must request
the authorization be renewed on an annual basis by submission of a renewal
application upon a form provided by the City Clerk and payment of the annual
nonrefundable license fee set by city resolution or as provided in this
chapter. Requests for renewal must be submitted to the city within 60 days of
the expiration of the authorization. The failure to timely file for renewal is
sufficient grounds to deny renewal of an authorization to operate a marihuana
establishment in the city. The City Council has discretion to renew or not
renew authorizations. In making its determination, the City Council shall
consider the following:
         (a)   Compliance with the statements provided with the initial
application and submission with its request for renewal of the following
information;
         (b)   The staffing plan for the business which describes the actual
number of employees;
         (c)   An explanation, with supporting factual data, of the economic
benefits to the city;
         (d)   Whether the business is in default to the city for any property
tax, special assessment, utility charges, fines, fees or other financial
obligation owed to the city;
         (e)   Violations of laws, ordinances and regulations related to the
establishment; and
         (f)   Other information deemed relevant by City Council.
      (2)   If the City Council approves a request to renew an authorization,
the City Clerk shall renew the existing authorization for a period of one year,
on the condition that the state operating license for the establishment is
renewed. If the City Council does not recommend renewal, it may, after notice
and opportunity for a hearing to the holder, suspend, revoke or refuse to renew
a license.
(Ord. 209, passed 10-7-2020; Ord. 218, passed 4-4-2023)
§ 117.08 TEMPORARY MARIHUANA EVENTS.
   Temporary marihuana events, as defined by Michigan law, are not permitted in
the city.
(Ord. 209, passed 10-7-2020; Ord. 218, passed 4-4-2023)
§ 117.09 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Request for revocation of state operating license. If at any time an
establishment violates this chapter or any other applicable city ordinance, the
City Council may request that LARA revoke or refrain from renewing the
establishment's state operating license. The City Council may also, in its
discretion, notify LARA of any violations of this chapter.
   (B)   Civil infraction. It is unlawful to disobey, neglect, or refuse to
comply with any provision of this chapter. A violation of this chapter is a
civil infraction subject to a fine of up to $500 per day. Each day the
violation continues shall be a separate offense.
   (C)   Other remedies. The foregoing sanctions are in addition to the city's
right to seek other appropriate and proper remedies, including actions in law
or equity, including injunctive relief to compel compliance with this chapter.
(Ord. 209, passed 10-7-2020; Ord. 218, passed 4-4-2023)
§ 117.10 POLICY REVIEW.
   Upon request of the City Council, the City Clerk shall submit a report to
the City Council regarding the administration of this chapter and the
provisions of the zoning ordinance pertaining to marihuana establishments in
the city.

   (A)   The business and occupation of drilling and exploring for, producing,
obtaining, transporting, gathering and storing of oil, gas, petroleum and
hydrocarbons within the limits of the City of Memphis is a hazardous and
dangerous business and occupation. As such, it is necessary that such business
and occupation be regulated, controlled and limited for the purpose of
providing protection for the lives, health, welfare and safety of the citizens
of the city and of the public generally and for the protection of property from
the danger of fire, explosion, gas, leaks, nuisances and other hazards,
injurious to the public peace, health, welfare and safety. The provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed to be the minimum requirements for the
preservation of the public peace, health, safety and welfare, and compliance
with all terms thereof shall not be deemed to relieve any person from any duty
imposed by law to use all necessary care and take all necessary precautions for
the safeguarding of the public peace, health and safety and the rights of any
individual or group of individuals, and it shall be the duty of any person
drilling, operating or maintaining any well to use all necessary care and take
all precautions reasonably necessary under the circumstances to protect the
public or the rights of any part thereof.
   (B)   This chapter applies to the location, installation, drilling and
operation of any well for the commercial extraction of oil, gas or other
hydrocarbons in the city. No well owner or operator or property owner shall
allow any activity which is not in compliance with the requirements of this
chapter.
   (C)   Words used in this chapter, unless otherwise defined, shall be the
common meaning of such words as generally understood in the oil and gas
industry, unless the content of this chapter clearly implies otherwise.
(Ord. 211, passed 1-5-2021)
§ 118.02 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, association of persons,
syndicate, combination, corporation or estate to drill, explore or commence to
drill any well for oil, gas, petroleum or other hydrocarbons in any area within
the corporate limits of the city or for the secondary recovery thereof, or to
extend to deepen one already drilled without first having applied for and
received a permit therefor by the authority of the City Council in accordance
with the terms of this chapter and the applicant having complied with the terms
of this chapter.
(Ord. 211, passed 1-5-2021) Penalty, see §
118.99
§ 118.03 PERMIT APPLICATION.
   (A)   The producer or owner of any proposed well shall fill out, sign and
file an application in writing therefor upon forms provided by the City Clerk.
The application shall contain the information as to the location where the
proposed well is to be drilled, and attached thereto shall be a map, plat or
survey of the area to be drilled and the location of the well on said spacing
and the exact location of tanks, flowlines, fences and details incident to the
proposed location. The location of said well shall be stated in relation to
established street or plat lines, or in lieu thereof quarter section lines. The
application shall show the names of owners of the oil and gas in all of the
area to be drilled and the lease or leases thereon. Said application shall also
be accompanied by the consent in writing of the owner or owners of the drill
site to be drilled consenting to the drilling of the well on his, or their
property as well as any approvals or denials received from the State of
Michigan. Attached to said application shall be duly certified, sworn or photo
copies of all leases for the discovery and removal of oil and gas and
ratifications thereof, executed by the owners of the oil or gas in such area,
owned or controlled by the application, and also a statement of other leases
insofar as known setting forth the names of the lessors and lessee of each such
respective lease. In the event said lease or leases shall by express terms and
provisions provide for and consent to such drilling, the consent therein
provided shall qualify for and be deemed sufficient compliance with the
requirements for consent of lessor as herein provided. Bond as hereinafter set
forth shall also accompany and be filed with such application.
   (B)   All applicants for a permit to drill a well for oil or gas shall at
the time of making such applications pay to the City Clerk the sum of $500 as
an application fee to apply on the cost and expenses of the administration of
this chapter, of which amount $400 thereof shall be refunded if the application

   (A)   If it appears, either upon the face of such application or by other
satisfactory proof, that the applicant for permission to drill a well for oil
and gas is the owner of or has under his control, either as owner or lessee, or
both, all interests in said area to be drilled, and said application showing
compliance with the requirements of this chapter, the City Council, or its
designee, may grant the permit without further notice.
   (B)   If said application shows that the applicant to drill a well for oil
or gas is not the owner, or does not have under his control for drilling
purposes as owner or lessee, or both, or assignee under a valid and recorded
assignment of lease, all the interest in all the oil or gas in the area which
it is proposed to drill, or in the event the City Council shall for other cause
shown refuse an application for a permit, then the City Council shall fix a
time and place for the hearing thereon and enter the same of record. The
following shall apply if City Council determines a hearing is necessary:
      (1)   The applicant shall cause notice of such hearing on forms to be
furnished by the City Clerk to be given by certified mail to all known owners
of the lands containing oil and gas within the area to be drilled and the
lessees thereof under valid oil and gas leases of record addressed to their
last known place of residence, not less than seven days prior to the date of
the hearing. In addition thereto, said applicant shall publish a notice in a
public newspaper published and printed in the city at least five days prior to
the hearing and shall post notices thereof in not less than five public places
in the city at least five days prior to said hearing. Such notices shall be
dated and contain a description of the property affected, state the time, date,
place and purpose of the hearing. An affidavit of the applicant or someone in
his behalf shall be executed showing such mailing, posting and publishing and
shall be prima facie evidence of the compliance with all the requirements of
this for notice and the same shall be filed with the City Clerk at or prior to
the time set for the hearing.
      (2)   The City Council shall at the time set and place designated in said
notice, or at some later date to which the hearing may be adjourned, conduct
the hearing upon the application to drill such well for oil, gas, petroleum or
other hydrocarbons. At such hearing all persons interested may be heard. All
witnesses shall be examined under oath and documentary evidence may be
introduced. The City Council shall keep a record of its proceedings as regards
the granting of said permits and the hearings thereon and may require the
pooling of properties, or parts thereof, within the area or areas to be drilled
and shall make any and all reasonable requirements necessary to protect and
safeguard the rights of all parties affected by such order or orders. The City
Council shall have the power and reserve the authority to refuse any
application for a permit where by the reason for the location of the proposed
well, and the character and value of the permanent improvements already erected
in or adjacent to the area in question and the use of which the land and
surroundings are adapted for civic purposes or for sanitary reasons, the
drilling of any oil or gas well will be serious disadvantage or hazard to the
city and its inhabitants as a whole. It shall be discretionary with the City
Council to grant or deny a permit in any industrial area or in any area in
which residences or other buildings may have been erected when the granting of
said permit shall be creative of fire hazards or otherwise destructive of
property interests.

resulting from the drilling, operating, maintaining or abandoning of any well
or any structures, equipment, machinery, vehicles, lines or appurtenances
thereto used or allowed in the drilling or producing operations of the
applicant and his or its assignees.
   (C)   In case any bond or insurance policy required herein shall lapse or
become void for any reason whatever, the permit issued under the terms of this
chapter shall immediately become inoperative and void until a new bond or

(1979 Code, § 5.92) (Ord. 62, passed 5-16-1978) Penalty, see §
150.999
§ 150.003 NONCONFORMANCE.
   (A)   Intent. 
      (1)   It is the intent of this section to permit nonconformities to
continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Within
the districts established by this chapter, or amendments that may later be
adopted, there exist lots, structures and uses of land and structures which
were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but which would be
prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future
amendment. Such uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with
permitted uses in the district involved.
      (2)   It is further the intent of this section that nonconformities shall
not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding
other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. A
nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged
after passage of this chapter by attachment on a building or premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises or by the addition
of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district
involved.
      (3)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of the provisions of this chapter and upon which actual
building construction has been diligently carried on. ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION is
hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent
position and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or
removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to
rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided that work shall be diligently carried on until
completion of the building involved.
   (B)   Nonconforming lots.
      (1)   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter, a
single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any
single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the
requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the
district; provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving
area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the
district in which such lot is located. A variance to yard requirements shall be
obtained through approval of the Board of Appeals.
      (2)   If two or more lots, or combinations of lots and portions of lots,
with continuous frontage in single-ownership are of record at the time of
passage or amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots do not
meet the requirements for lot width and area as established by this chapter,
the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the
purposes of this chapter and no portion of said parcel shall be used or
occupied which does not meet lot width and area requirements established by
this chapter, nor shall any division of the parcel be made which leaves
remaining any lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this
chapter.
   (C)   Nonconforming uses of land. Where at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer
permissible under the terms of this chapter as enacted or amended, it shall be
subject to the following provisions.
      (1)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
      (2)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved, in whole or in part, to
any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
      (3)   If such nonconforming use of land ceases, for any reason, for a
period of more than six months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform
to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such
land is located.
   (D)   Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not be built
under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot
coverage, height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or its
location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
      (1)   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity.
      (2)   Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of
more than 60% of its reasonable value, exclusive of the foundation at the time
of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   Should such structure be moved for any reason, for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
   (E)   Nonconforming uses of structures and land. If a lawful use of a
structure, or of structure and land in combination, exists at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that would not be allowed in the
district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
      (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
      (2)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use and which
existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use
shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
      (3)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another conforming use
provided that the Board of Appeals, either by general rule or by making
findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally
appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming
use. In permitting such change, the Board of Appeals may require appropriate
conditions and safeguards in accord with the purpose and intent of this
chapter.
      (4)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
      (5)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or a structure and
premises in combination, is discontinued or ceases to exist for six consecutive
months or for 18 months during any three-year period, the structure, or
structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in
conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
Structures, or structures and premises in combination, occupied by seasonal
uses which are discontinued or cease to exist for 12 consecutive months shall
not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the
district in which it is located.
      (6)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises
in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
   (F)   Repairs and maintenance. On any building devoted, in whole or in part,
to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive
months on ordinary repairs or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls,
fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding 50% of the assessed
value of the building, provided that the cubic content of the building as it
existed at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter shall not be
increased. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening
or restoring to a safe condition of any building, or part thereof, declared to
be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order
of such official.
   (G)   Uses under exception provisions not nonconforming uses. Any use for

building ready for occupancy and provided further that such portion of the
building, structure or premises is in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter.

occupancy shall be made in writing to the Building Inspector on forms furnished
by the Department and such certificates shall be issued if, after final
inspection, it is found that the building or structure, or part thereof, or the
use of land is in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. If such

decision or refusal made by the Building Inspector or any other administrative
official in carrying out or enforcing any provision of this chapter.
      (2)   The Zoning Board of Appeals may hear and decide in accordance with

adverse impact on the surrounding property or alter the essential character of
the neighborhood.

which it justifies the granting of the variance and may attach conditions to
the variance as it may deem reasonable in furtherance of the purpose of this

stipulating all conditions as to time, nature of development permitted and
arrangements for removing the use at the termination of said temporary permit.

had exceptional historical significance; or
         (c)   All of the exterior architecture has existed for 80 or more
years without noticeable change from its appearance 80 years ago. Exterior
architecture involves the placement and size of openings (doors, windows, and
the like) in the exterior walls of the building. It also involves the materials
with which the outside surfaces of the building are constructed, and the shape
and size of the building.
      (2)   To qualify under division (A)(1)(a), the following requirement must

a historical designation by the city may not lose their designation because of
revisions to the requirements. If a building, having previously received a
historical designation under division (A)(1)(c) above, is modified in its
outward appearance in the judgement of the city, the city may withdraw the
previously awarded historical designation.

§ 151.56 UTILITIES.
   (A)   Requirements for underground wiring. 
      (1)   The proprietor shall make arrangements for all lines for telephone,
electric, television and other similar services distributed by wire or cable to
be placed underground entirely throughout a subdivided area, except for major
thoroughfare right-of-way, and such conduits or cables shall be placed within
private easements provided to such service companies by the developer or within
dedicated public ways, provided only that overhead lines may be permitted upon
written recommendation of the Engineer, planner, Commission and the approval of
the City Council at the time of final plat approval where it is determined that
overhead lines will not constitute a detriment to the health, safety, general
welfare, plat design and character of the subdivision.
      (2)   All such facilities placed in dedicated public ways shall be
planned so as not to conflict with other underground utilities. All such
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with standards of construction
approved by the State Public Service Commission. All drainage and underground
utility installations which traverse privately owned property shall be
protected by easements granted by the proprietor.
   (B)   Sewage disposal. 
      (1)   A sanitary sewer system, including all appurtenances, shall be
required in all subdivisions which shall connect and outlet into the city
sanitary sewer system. When a proposed subdivision is located within, adjacent
to or within a distance defined in the then existing city code or the service
area of an available public sanitary sewer system, then, sanitary sewers and
other appurtenances thereto, as approved by the City Engineer and built to
standards identified and defined by the city, shall be installed by the
developer in such a manner as to serve all subdivision units in the initial
phase of construction and designed to serve all subsequent phases if subsequent
phases are contemplated.
      (2)   The city shall require all public sanitary sewer lines extending to
the point of a tap, including the tap, to private use to be installed within
the right-of-way or withing the general commons and conveyed and/or dedicated
to the public when, in the opinion of the city, conveyance and/or dedication of
the same would be in the best interest of the public. Sanitary accepted by the
city shall thereafter be regulated by the city code and subject to design
standards of the city and have associated assessments assigned to the
appropriate property owner(s), if such assessments should be required.
      (3)   Where a public sewer system is not available, on-site sewage
disposal may only be employed if approved by the county in which they are to be
installed and/or the state.
   (C)   Water supply. 
      (1)   A water supply system including appurtenances shall be required in
all subdivisions which shall be connected to the city water supply system. When
a proposed subdivision is located within, adjacent to or within a distance
defined by the then existing city code of the service area of an available
public water system then water mains, fire hydrants and required water system
appurtenances thereto, as approved by the City Engineer and built to standards
defined and identified by the city, shall be installed by the developer in such
a manner as to adequately serve all subdivision units in the initial phase of
construction and designed to serve subsequent phases if subsequent phases are
contemplated as shown on the final subdivision plan, both for domestic use or
business use and fire protection.
      (2)   The city shall require all public water lines and appurtenances
extending to the point of a tap, and further to include the shut off box, to a
private use be built to city standards and installed within the right-of-way or
within the general commons and conveyed dedicated to the public when, in the
opinion of the city, conveyance and/or dedication of the same would be in the
best interest of the public. City water services which have been dedicated to
the public and accepted by the city shall thereafter be regulated by the city
code and subject to design standards of the city and associated assessments
assigned to the appropriate property owner(s), if such assessments should be
required. In the event of the nonavailability of a public water supply system,
a private water supply system shall be provided by the developer as regulated
by the city and county in which the private water supply is to be installed and
the state, if applicable.
   (D)   Storm drainage system. 
      (1)   An adequate storm drainage system including necessary storm sewers,
catch basins, manholes, culverts, bridges and other appurtenances shall be
required in all subdivisions. Adequate provision shall be made for proper
drainage of storm water run-off from residential rear yards. Each yard shall be
self-contained and shall be drained from rear to front except where topography
or other natural features require otherwise.
      (2)   The city may require that all storm sewers be installed within the
right-of-way or within the general commons and conveyed and/or dedicated to the
public when, in the opinion of the city, conveyance and/or dedication of the
same would be in the best interest of the public. Storm drains which have been
dedicated to the public and accepted by the city shall thereafter be regulated
by the city code and subject to design standards of the city and have
associated assessments assigned to the appropriate property owner(s), if such
assessments should be required.
      (3)   A detention basin is required for all subdivisions, unless the
property is located adjacent to an existing body of water and the petitioner
submits a hydraulic study prepared by a registered engineer which shows the
run-off from the development will not adversely affect any downstream
properties. Any run-off from a subdivision project which enters a body of water
under the jurisdiction of the MDEQ must be approved by the MDEQ. A
sedimentation basin shall be provided for all subdivisions that do not require
detention.
      (4)   No detention or retention pond shall be placed within a residential
lot or yard. Detention and retention ponds in residential developments shall be
placed in outlots (an area within a development which is restricted from use
for building), so dedicated with appropriate easements for drainage purposes.
   (E)   Easements for utilities. The subdivision plan shall include all
necessary easements granted to the city for the purpose of constructing,
operating, inspecting, maintaining, repairing, altering, replacing and/or
moving pipelines, mains, conduits and other installations of a similar nature
(hereafter called, “public structures”) for the purpose of providing public
utilities, including conveyances of sewage, water and storm run-off across,
through and under the property subject to such easement, and excavating and
refilling ditches and trenches necessary for the location of such public
structures.

would be served. Unless, otherwise approved by the city, street trees, when
required, shall be planted within the strip between the sidewalk and the
pavement.
      (4)   Tree species should be selected for tolerance of the harsh roadside
conditions, for compliance with sight distance requirements, to ensure
maintenance of accessibility to fire hydrants, to provide minimum overhead
clearance of 15 feet over any street and eight feet over a sidewalk or bike
path and to avoid interference with overhead or underground utility lines.
      (5)   Plantings within 15 feet of a fire hydrant shall be no taller than
six inches.

§ 152.18 ISSUANCE OF PERMITS.
   (A)   After reviewing all of the information submitted by the applicant,
other pertinent information and the recommendations of the Planning Commission,
the City Council shall, at a regular or special meeting, determine whether or
not a permit will be issued. The permit shall be issued in the event the City
Council shall determine that the issuance of the permit would not detrimentally

§ 152.19 OPERATIONS INSPECTIONS.
   As a condition for issuance of a permit under this chapter, the operator
shall agree to two annual inspections by the City Engineer. Such inspections
are for the purpose of determining compliance with all requirements of this
chapter and any specific conditions applied to the individual permits. The two

   (A)   Where an excavation in excess of five feet will result from such
operations, the applicant shall erect a fence with appropriate “KEEP OUT -
DANGER” signs completely surrounding the portion of the site where the
excavation extends, said fence to be not less than four feet in height,
complete with gates, which gates shall be kept locked when operations are not
being carried on. Where an operator can demonstrate that no attractive nuisance
exists, the City Council may waive the requirement for fencing.
   (B)   Any roads used for the purpose of ingress and egress to said
excavation site which are located within 300 feet of occupied residences, shall
be kept dust free by surfacing with concrete, bituminous aggregate or approved
chemical treatment. The City Council may waive the requirements hereof.
   (C)   Side slopes around the perimeter of the site and the banks adjacent to
ponded water shall not have a slope exceeding one vertical foot for each two
horizontal feet. The slope extending into the water shall also not exceed this
ratio from the edge of the water out to a depth of five feet.
   (D)   Where quarrying operations result in a body of water, the owner or
operator shall place appropriate “KEEP OUT - DANGER” signs on the perimeter
fence not more than 200 feet apart. If the water supply of the city is
adversely affected by any pumping or draining of water from such a quarrying
operation, the city shall issue a cease and desist order and the operator shall
comply therewith. A method of quarrying approved by the City Council shall be
followed.
   (E)   No cut or excavation shall be made closer than 100 feet from the
nearest street or highway right-of-way line nor nearer than 50 feet to the
nearest property line; provided, however, that the City Council may prescribe
more strict requirements in order to give sublateral support to surrounding
property where soil or geographic conditions warrant it. In any reuse plan, the
excavation may cut within 25 feet of any property line so long as the required
slope commences at that point. Under no circumstances may such a cut be made
for mining or stripping purposes.
   (F)   Sufficient topsoil shall be stockpiled on said site so that the entire
site may be recovered with a minimum of four inches of topsoil. Revegetation of
the pit shall be started as soon as the first ten acres are completely
excavated and shall progress in stages as the excavation progresses. The slopes
of the pit shall be graded and seeded in accordance with the approved reuse
plan and in a manner that prevents erosion. Topsoil shall not be removed from
the site until it is demonstrated that this requirement has been met.
   (G)   The City Council shall require more stringent requirements where the
impact assessment and/or statement demonstrates the need for such in the
interest of the public health, safety and general welfare.

danger or a menace to the public health. The premises shall at all times be
graded so that surface water drainage off-site is maintained and is not
interfered with.
   (B)   Sufficient topsoil shall be stockpiled on said site so that the entire
site, when stripping operations are completed, may be recovered with a minimum
of four inches of topsoil and the replacement of such topsoil shall be made
immediately following the termination of the stripping operations each year. In
the event, however, that such stripping operations continue over a period of
time greater than 30 days, the operator shall replace the stored topsoil over
the stripped areas, in two-acre increments, as he or she progresses.
   (C)   Any roads used for the purpose of ingress and egress to said stripping
site which are located within 150 feet of occupied residences shall be kept
dust free by surfacing with concrete, bituminous aggregate or approved chemical
treatment.
   (D)   No stripping shall take place within 200 feet from any street right-
of-way line or an adjoining residence, nor within 50 feet of any other property
line; provided, however, that the City Council may prescribe more strict
requirements in order to protect nearby residences from any potential adverse
impacts of the stripping operation.
   (E)   In order to prevent all unnecessary dust and blowing of sand or other
soil materials, there shall be no stockpiling of sand in excess of 5,000 cubic
yards and all stockpiles shall be restricted to a maximum height of 25 feet.
   (F)   The City Council shall prescribe more stringent requirements if deemed
necessary in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare, as
demonstrated by the impact assessment and/or statement.

permit as required under this chapter, except as otherwise provided, previously
existing operations shall comply with all provisions of this chapter, except in
cases where excavations already exist which are closer to property lines or
road rights-of-way than permitted in this chapter, such noncompliance will be
permitted, but the excavation may not be extended in any manner which would
increase the noncompliance and, to the extent topsoil is unavailable for
storage, to such extent topsoil storage is waived.

reputable surety company authorized to do business in the state.
   (B)   The amount of such surety shall be at least $1,000 for each acre of
land owned or leased by the operator and may be greater if deemed necessary by
the City Council to ensure compliance with this chapter. In fixing the amount
of such surety, the probable cost of rehabilitating the premises upon default
of the operator, estimated expenses to compel the operator to comply with court
orders and any other relevant factors shall be considered.
   (C)   Excess funds, if any, shall be returned with interest to the
depositor, upon completion of the rehabilitation of the premises. Upon
presentation to the City Council of hardship circumstances, in conjunction with
a plan giving a method whereby security is offered sufficient to assure the
city that the reuse plan can be completed, the City Council may accept said
alternative means of security.
