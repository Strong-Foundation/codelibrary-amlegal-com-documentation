   WHEREAS, Council has had the matter of codification and general revision of
the legislation of the Village before it for some time; and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with The Justinian
Publishing Company to prepare and publish such codification; and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such legislation, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed, is now
before the Council; NOW, THEREFORE:

authority of the Village through July 10, 2001, as revised, codified, arranged,
edited and consolidated into component codes, titles, chapters and sections, is

   Section 2. The following sections and subsections in the Codified Ordinances
are or contain new matter not previously enacted by Council in its presently

preparing the Codified Ordinances, to reconcile Village legislation, to conform
Village law with State law, to update technical codes adopted by the Village by
reference, and to remove uncertainties and ambiguities in the legislative
record with respect to numbering and passage of legislation, and such new
matter is hereby approved, adopted and enacted:
      202.01 to 202.03,
      202.07 to 202.09,

July 10, 2001, which are inconsistent with any provision of the Codified
Ordinances, including the new matter approved, adopted and enacted by Section 2
of this ordinance, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
ordinance, except as follows:

Sec. 9.15 COLLECTION FEES.
   All taxes paid on or before August thirty-first of each year shall be

add to all taxes then unpaid two percent of said taxes as a collection fee and
on the first day of October and of each succeeding month he shall add to all
taxes unpaid then an additional one-half of one percent of said taxes as a
collection fee. Such collection fee shall belong to the Village and constitute
a charge and shall be a lien against the property to which the taxes themselves
apply, collectable in the same manner as the taxes to which they are added.
   It is provided, however, that if delivery of the Tax Roll to the Treasurer
is delayed for any reason by more than thirty days after June twenty-fifth, the
application of the schedule of collection fees provided therein shall be
postponed thirty days for the first thirty days of such delay and shall be
postponed an additional thirty days for each additional thirty days, or major
fraction thereof, of such delay.
(Char. eff. June 7, 1954)
Sec. 9.16 DELINQUENT TAX ROLL TO COUNTY TREASURER.
   All Village taxes remaining uncollected by the Treasurer on the first day of
March following the date when said Tax Roll was received by him shall be
returned to the County Treasurer to the extent and in the same manner and with
like effect as provided by statute for returns by Township Treasurers, of
Township, school and County taxes. Such returns shall include all the
additional assessments, charges and fees herein provided, which shall be added
to the amount assessed in said Tax Roll against each property or person. The
taxes thus returned shall be collected in the same manner as other taxes
returned to the County Treasurer are collected, in accordance with statute, and
shall be and remain a lien upon the property against which they are assessed
until paid.

Sec. 10.1 GENERAL POWER TO BORROW.
   Subject to the applicable provisions of State law and this Charter, the
Council, by proper ordinance or resolution, may authorize the borrowing of
money for any purpose within the scope of the powers vested in the Village and
the issuance of bonds of the Village or other evidence of indebtedness
therefor, and may pledge the full faith, credit, and resources of the Village
for the payment of the obligation created thereby; provided, that the net
bonded indebtedness incurred for all public purposes shall not at any time
exceed ten (10) per centum of the assessed value of all real and personal
property in the Village. The Village shall also have power to issue special
assessment, mortgage, revenue, or other types of bonds beyond the debt limits
fixed by law for the issuance of bonds or other evidence of indebtedness which
are a general obligation of the Village, in the manner and for the purpose
permitted by the Charter and the Constitution, and the general laws of the
State of Michigan, including Act No. 278, P.A. 1909, under which the Village is
incorporated. Bonds issued in anticipation of the payment of special
assessments may be an obligation of the special assessment district and a
general obligation of the Village. All collections on special assessment rolls
shall be set apart in a special fund and shall be used only for the purpose or
purposes for which they were levied and for the payment of the principal and
interest of any bonds issued in anticipation of the payment of such special
assessment fund to meet the payment of such principal and interest, monies
shall be advanced from the general funds of the Village to meet such deficiency
and shall be replaced in such general fund when the special assessment fund
shall be sufficient therefor. No bond of the Village shall bear interest at a
rate to exceed six (6) per cent per annum.
(Char. eff. June 7, 1954)
Sec. 10.2 UNISSUED BONDS.
   No unissued bonds of the Village shall be issued or sold to secure funds for

   (a)   In the employment of professional services, and
   (b)   When the Purchasing Agent or the Council as hereinafter provided shall
determine that no advantage to the Village would result therefrom.
   The Council may authorize the Purchasing Agent to make purchases and sales
within a prescribed dollar limit without prior approval of the Council.
However, Council may, by resolution, establish the amount over which the
Village must enter into a written contract for the purchase of supplies,
equipment or other contractual services, and such contract shall be awarded to
the lowest competent bidder meeting specification and whose bid is most
advantageous to the Village after such public notice and competition as may be
prescribed by ordinance. Provided, however;
   (a)   The Council shall have the power to reject all bids and advertise
again,
   (b)   The Council may forego competitive bidding if, by resolution, it
determines that no advantage to the Village will result. The Council may
authorize the making of public improvements or the performance of any other
Village work by any Village department or agency without competitive bidding.

franchise ordinance shall be approved by the Council for referral to the
electorate before thirty days after application therefor has been filed with

grantee named therein has filed with the Clerk his unconditional acceptance of
all terms of such franchise. No special election for such purpose shall be
ordered by the Council unless the expense of holding such election, as
determined by the Council shall have first been paid to the Treasurer by the
grantee.
   A franchise ordinance or renewal or extension thereof or amendment thereto
which is subject to revocation at the will of the Council may be enacted by the
Council without referral to the voters, but shall not be enacted unless it
shall have been in the form in which it is finally enacted and shall have so

SPECIAL ASSESSMENT
Sec. 15.1 POWER TO DETERMINE; COST OF IMPROVEMENT.
   The Council shall have power to determine that the whole or any part of the
cost of a public improvement shall be defrayed by special assessments upon the
property especially benefited. The cost of surveys and plans for a public
improvement and all expenses incident to the proceedings for the making of such
improvements and the special assessments therefor and for the issuance of bonds
in anticipation of such special assessments shall be deemed to be a part of the
cost of the improvement. The cost of any improvement shall also include the
cost of acquiring any lands necessary therefor.
(Char. eff. June 7, 1954; amend. eff. Aug. 14, 1956)
Sec. 15.2 PLANS; ESTIMATE OF COST; DESIGNATION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENT DISTRICT;
HEARING; PETITION.
   When the Council shall propose to make any public improvement, any part of
the cost of which is to be defrayed by special assessment, it shall refer the
matter to the Village President who shall prepare or cause to be prepared plans
showing the improvement and the location thereof, and an estimate of the cost
thereof. Upon receipt of such plans and estimate the Council shall order the
same to be filed with the Village Clerk and if it shall desire to proceed with
the improvement it shall by resolution declare its intention to make such
public improvement and shall designate the special assessment district and what
part or proportion of the cost of said improvement shall be made by special
assessment against the lots and parcels of land in said special assessment
district and what part, if any shall be paid from the general funds of the
Village. The Council shall also fix a time and place when it will meet and hear
any objections to such improvement and to the special assessment district, and
shall cause notice of such hearing to be given by publication thereof twice
prior to such hearing in a newspaper circulating in the Village, the first
publication to be at least one (1) week prior to the time of such hearing. Such
notice shall state that the plans and estimate are on file with the Village
Clerk and shall contain a description of the proposed assessment district. At
the time of such hearing, or any adjournment thereof, which may be without
further notice, the Council shall hear any objections to such improvement and
to the special assessment district, and may without further notice, revise,
correct, amend or change the plans, estimate and/or district provided that no
property shall be added to the district until notice be given as above provided
or by personal service upon the owners thereof, and a hearing afforded such
owners. The Council, in order to ascertain whether or not a reasonable number
of property owners to be assessed desire a public improvement to be made under
the provisions of this chapter, may request that a petition therefor be
presented to it but in event a petition be so filed it shall be advisory only
and shall not be jurisdictional.
[Note: See PA 162 - 1962.]
(Char. eff. June 7, 1954; amend. eff. Aug. 14, 1956)
Sec. 15.3 APPROVAL OF PLANS AND ESTIMATE; PREPARATION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENT
ROLL.
   After the hearing provided for in the preceding section, if the Council
desires to proceed with such improvement it shall by resolution determine to
make such improvement and shall approve said plans and estimate, as originally
presented or as revived, corrected, amended or changed. The Council shall also
direct the Village Assessor to make a special assessment roll in which shall be
entered and described all the lots and parcels of land to be assessed, with the
names of the respective owners thereof, if known, and the amount to be assessed
against each such lot or parcel of land, which amount shall be such relative
portion of the whole sum to be levied against all the lots and parcels of land
in the special assessment district as the benefit to such lot or parcel of land
bears to the total benefits to all lots and parcels of land in the special
assessment district. There shall also be entered upon said roll the amount
which has been assessed to the Village-at-large. When the Village Assessor
shall have completed the assessment roll, he shall affix thereto a certificate
stating that it was made pursuant to a resolution of the Council of said
Village adopted on a specified date and that in making such assessment roll he
has according to his best judgment, conformed in all respects to the directions
contained in such resolution and to the Charter of the Village.
(Char. eff. June 7, 1954; amend. eff. Aug. 14, 1956)
Sec. 15.4 SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ROLL; REVIEW, HEARING, CONFIRMATION.
   When any special assessment roll shall be reported by the Assessor to the
Council, the same shall be filed in the Office of the Clerk. Before confirming
such assessment roll, the Council shall appoint a time and place when it will
meet and review the same, and hear any objections thereto, and shall cause
notice of such hearing and of the filing of such assessment roll, to be
published twice prior to such hearing in a newspaper circulating in the
Village, the first publication to be at least one week before such hearing.
Such hearing may be adjourned without further notice. Any person objecting to
the assessment roll shall file his objections thereto in writing with the Clerk
before the close of such hearing or within such further time as the Council may
grant. After such hearing the Council may confirm such special assessment roll
as reported to it by the Assessor, or may correct the same as to any matter
appearing therein and confirm it as so corrected, or may refer it back to the
assessor for revision or may annul it and direct a new roll to be made. When a
special assessment roll shall be confirmed, the Clerk shall endorse thereon the
date of the confirmation. After such confirmation, the special assessment roll
and all assessments therein shall be final and conclusive.
(Char. eff. June 7, 1954; amend. eff. Aug. 14, 1956)
Sec. 15.5 PAYMENT; DELINQUENT PAYMENTS.
   Special assessments shall be payable as follows: Paving and street projects,
annual installments of not more than ten (10) years; construction or extension
of sanitary sewers and water mains for fire protection and domestic uses and
construction of filtration plants, annual payments of not more than twenty (20)
years; purchase or construction of water works or sewage disposal plants,
annual payments of not more than forty (40) years; public work projects not
otherwise governed by State law, not more than twenty (20) years. The amount of
each installment (if more than one) need not be extended upon the special
assessment roll until further confirmation. The first installment of a special
assessment shall be due on or before such time after confirmation as the
Council shall fix, and the several subsequent installments shall be due at
intervals of twelve (12) months from the date of the first installment or from
such other date as the Council shall fix. All unpaid installments prior to
their transfer to the Village Tax Roll, shall bear interest, payable annually,
at a rate to be fixed by the Council not exceeding six (6) per cent per annum,
fixed by the Council. The whole assessment against any lot or parcel of land
may be paid to the Village Treasurer at any time in full with interest and
penalties accrued to the date of the payment of the next installment. If any
installment of a special assessment is not paid when due, then the same shall
be deemed to be delinquent and there shall be collected thereon, in addition to
interest as above provided, a penalty at the rate of one-half of one (1/2 of 1)
per cent for each month or fraction thereof that the same remains unpaid before
being reported to the Council for reassessment upon the Village Tax Roll. The
Village's portion of the cost of any improvement may be divided into
installments the same as the assessments against lands in the district and in
such case the provisions of this chapter relative to such installments shall
apply to the Village installments insofar as they are applicable.

Sec. 15.6 LIEN.
   All special assessments contained in any special assessment roll, including
any part thereof deferred as to payment, shall from the date of the
confirmation of such roll, constitute a lien upon the respective lots or
parcels of land assessed and until paid shall be a charge against the
respective owners of the several lots and parcels of land. Such lien shall be
of the same character and effect as the lien created for Village taxes and
shall include accrued interest and penalties. No judgment or decree, or any act
of the Council vacating a special assessment, shall destroy or impair the lien
of the Village upon the premises assessed, for such amount of the assessment as
may be equitably charged against the same, or as by a regular mode of
proceeding might be lawfully assessed thereon.
(Char. eff. June 7, 1954; amend. eff. Aug. 14, 1956)
Sec. 15.7 WARRANT AUTHORIZING COLLECTION.
   When any assessment shall be confirmed, the Council shall direct the
assessments so made in the special assessment roll to be collected.
   The Village Clerk shall thereupon deliver to the Village Treasurer said
special assessment roll to which he shall attach his warrant commanding the
Village Treasurer to collect from each of the persons assessed in said roll the
amount of money assessed to and set opposite his name therein, and in case any
such person shall neglect or refuse to pay his assessment, or any part thereof,
upon demand after the same has become due, then to levy and collect the same by
distress and sale of the goods and chattels of such person. Said warrant shall
further require the Village Treasurer on the first day of May following the
date when any such assessments, or any part thereof, have become due, to submit
to the Council a sworn statement setting forth the names of the persons
delinquent, if known, a description of the lots and parcels of land upon which
there are delinquent assessments, and the amount of such delinquency, including
accrued interest and penalties computed to May first of such year.
(Char. eff. June 7, 1954; amend. eff. Aug. 14, 1956)
Sec. 15.8 UNPAID ASSESSMENTS; SEIZURE AND SALE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY.
   Upon receiving such special assessment roll and warrant, the Treasurer shall
proceed to collect the several amounts assessed therein. If any person shall
neglect or refuse to pay his assessment upon demand, the Treasurer shall seize
and levy upon any personal property belonging to such person, found, within the
Village or elsewhere within the State of Michigan, and sell the same at public
auction, first giving six (6) days' notice of the time and place of such sale
by posting such notice in three (3) of the most public places in the Village,
city or township where such property may be found, the proceeds of such sale,
or so much thereof as may be necessary for that purpose, shall be applied to
the payment of the assessment and the cost and expenses of such seizure and
sale and the surplus shall be paid to the person entitled thereto.
(Char. eff. June 7, 1954; amend. eff. Aug. 14, 1956)
Sec. 15.9 UNPAID ASSESSMENTS; REASSESSMENT.
   In case the Treasurer, pursuant to the provisions of Section 15.7, shall
report as delinquent any assessment or part thereof, the Council shall certify
the same to the Assessor who shall reassess on the next annual Village Tax Roll
in a column headed special assessments, the sum so delinquent with interest and
penalty to May first of such year and an additional penalty of five (5) per
cent of such total amount and when so reassessed upon said Tax Roll shall be
collected in all respects as provided for the collection of Village taxes,
except from and after the 31st day of August of the year or such reassessment
and until March first of the following year, there shall be added a penalty of
one (1) per cent for each month or fraction thereof that the same remains
unpaid. Unpaid special assessments reassessed upon a Village Tax Roll shall be
returned to the County Treasurer for collection, at the same time and in the
same manner as Village taxes.
(Char. eff. June 7, 1954; amend. eff. Aug. 14, 1956)
Sec. 15.10 ACTION OF ASSUMPSIT.
   In addition to any other remedies and without impairing the lien therefor
any delinquent special assessment together with interest and penalties may be
collected in an action of assumpsit in the name of the Village against the
person assessed, in any court having jurisdiction of the amount. If in any such
action it shall appear that by reason of any irregularities or informalities
the assessment has not been properly made against the defendant or upon the
premises sought to be charged, the court may, nevertheless, on satisfactory
proof that expense has been incurred by the Village, which is a proper charge
against the defendant or the premises in question, render judgment for the
amount properly chargeable against such defendant or upon such premises.
(Char. eff. June 7, 1954; amend. eff. Aug. 14, 1956)
Sec. 15.11 DIVISION OF LOT; APPORTIONING UNCOLLECTED ASSESSMENTS.
   Should any lot or parcel of land be divided after a special assessment
thereon has been confirmed and before the collection thereof, the Council may
require the Assessor to apportion the uncollected amounts upon the several
parts of such lot or parcel of land. The report of such apportionment when
confirmed shall be conclusive upon all parties, provided that before such
confirmation, notice of hearing shall be given to all the interested parties
either by personal service or by publication as above provided in case of an
original assessment roll.
(Char. eff. June 7, 1954; amend. eff. Aug. 14, 1956)
Sec. 15.12 ADDITIONAL PRO-RATA ASSESSMENTS; EXCESS AMOUNTS COLLECTED.
   Should the assessments on any special assessment roll prove insufficient for
any reason, including the noncollection thereof to pay for the improvement for
which they were made or to pay the principal and interest on the bonds issued
in anticipation of the collection of such assessments, then the Council shall
make additional pro-rata assessments to supply the deficiency, but the total
amount assessed against any lot of land shall not exceed the value of the
benefits received from the improvement. Should the amount collected on
assessments prove larger than necessary by five (5) percent or less the amount
of the original roll, the Council may place the excess in any of the funds of
the Village, but if such excess shall exceed such five (5) percent, then the
same shall be credited pro-rata on the assessments against the several parcels
of land according to the amounts thereof, such credit as to each parcel to be
made upon the unpaid installments in inverse numerical order; provided, that if
as to any parcel there shall be no unpaid installments, or, if the unpaid
installments are less than the amount of credit shall be applied toward the
payment of the next Village tax levied against such property. If the Village
shall have been assessed for any portion of the cost of the improvements then
it shall be considered in the same category as the owner of private lands and
shall be entitled to its share of any such excess that any amount due the
Village, which in case of private lands would be applied to the payment of
Village taxes, shall be refunded to the Village in cash.
(Char. eff. June 7, 1954; amend. eff. Aug. 14, 1954)
Sec. 15.13 INVALIDATED ASSESSMENTS; REASSESSMENT.
   Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of the Council, be
invalid by reason of irregularity or informality in the proceedings, or if any
court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge such assessment to be illegal,
the Council shall, whether the improvement has been made or not, or whether any
part of the assessment has been paid or not, have power to cause a new
assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was
made. All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall
be conducted in the same manner as provided for the original assessment, and
whenever the assessment, or any part thereof, levied upon any premises has been
so set aside, if the same has been paid and not refunded, the payment so made
shall be applied upon the reassessment and the reassessment shall to that
extent be deemed satisfied.
(Char. eff. June 7, 1954; amend. eff. Aug. 14, 1956)
Sec. 15.14 EXPENSE CHARGEABLE TO SINGLE PREMISES.
   When any expense shall have been incurred by the Village upon or in respect
to any single premises, which expense is chargeable against such premises and
the owner thereof under the provisions of this Charter or any ordinance of the
Village or law of the State of Michigan, and is not of that class required to
be prorated among the several lots and parcels of land in a special assessment
district, an account of the labor, material and service for which such expense
was incurred, with a description of the premises upon or in respect to which
the expense was incurred, and the name of the owner, if known, shall be
reported to the Treasurer, who shall immediately charge and bill the owner, if
known. The Treasurer at the end of each quarter shall report to the Council all
sums so owing to the Village and which have not been paid within fifteen (15)
days after the mailing of the bill therefor. The Council shall at such time as
it may deem advisable, direct the Assessor to prepare a special assessment roll
covering all such charges reported to it, together with a penalty of ten (10)
per cent. Such roll shall be filed with the Clerk, who shall present the same
to the Council. Thereafter the same proceedings shall be followed in respect of
such special assessment roll as are provided in Section 15.4 et seq. of this
chapter and all the provisions of said sections with reference to special
assessments generally shall apply to special assessments under this section,
insofar as the same may be applicable.
(Char. eff. June 7, 1954; amend. eff. Aug. 14, 1956)
Sec. 15.15 ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES.
   In any case where the provisions of this chapter may prove to be
insufficient to carry into full effect the making of any special assessment,
the Council may by ordinance provide any additional steps or procedure required
to effect the improvement by special assessment.
(Char. eff. June 7, 1954; amend. eff. Aug. 14, 1956)
Sec. 15.16 EXEMPTIONS.
   No lands in a special assessment district which are benefited by the
improvement therein shall be exempt from assessment, but if the same are owned
by a public or other corporation exempt by law from the payment of special
assessments, then the special assessments against such lands, or the
installments thereof, shall be paid by the Village as the same become due or
may be paid in advance of their due dates.

CHAPTER 16:
BONDS
Sec. 16.1 LIMITS ON BONDED INDEBTEDNESS.
   The Village Council may borrow money on the credit of the Village and issue
the bonds of the Village therefor, for any purpose within the scope of its
powers; provided, that the net bonded indebtedness incurred for all public
purposes shall not at any time exceed ten (10) per centum of the assessed
valuation of all real and personal property in the Village; provided, further,
that in case of fire, flood or other calamity the legislative body may borrow
for the relief of the inhabitants of the Village and for the preservation of
municipal property, a sum not to exceed one-quarter (1/4) of one (1) per centum
of the assessed valuation of all real and personal property in the Village due
in not more than three (3) years, even if such loan would cause the
indebtedness of the Village to exceed the said ten (10) per centum limitation;
and provided, further, that in computing the net bonded indebtedness for the
purposes hereof there shall not be included bonds issued in anticipation of the
payment of special assessments even though they are also a general obligation
of the Village, mortgage bonds which are secured only by a mortgage on the
property or franchise or a public utility, and any other bonds which are
excluded therefrom by law; and the resources of any debt retirement or sinking
fund pledged for the retirement of any outstanding bonds which are included
within said ten (10) per centum limitation shall be deducted from the amount of
such bonded indebtedness.
(Char. eff. June 7, 1954; amend. eff. Aug. 14, 1956)
Sec. 16.2 SPECIAL ASSESSMENT BONDS.
   The Council may borrow money and issue the bonds of the Village therefor in
anticipation of the payment of special assessments made for defraying the cost
of public improvements; after the special assessment roll shall have been
confirmed such bonds may be an obligation of the special assessment district
only or may be both an obligation of the special assessment district and a
general obligation of the Village. Such bonds shall not exceed the amount of
the special assessments in anticipation of the collection of which they are
issued, and shall bear such interests as the Council may determine, not
exceeding five (5) per centum per annum. Collections on special assessments
pledged for the payment of bonds shall be set aside in a special fund for the
payment of such bonds. In no event shall such bonds be sold or otherwise
disposed of at less than their par value. The issuance of special assessment
bonds shall be governed by the provisions of the general laws of the State
applicable thereto. Bonds may be issued in anticipation of the collection of
special assessments levied in respect to two or more public improvements, but
no special assessment district shall be compelled to pay the obligation of any

   Any expenditures for supplies, materials, equipment, a construction project

be approved only after competitive bidding as provided by the provisions of
this chapter, unless such is covered by Section
208.09.
   (a)   Such expenditure shall be made the subject of a written contract
unless excepted from such requirements by the Council in writing. A purchase
order shall be a sufficient written contract in cases where the expenditure is
in the usual and ordinary course of the Village's business.
   (b)   Notices inviting sealed competitive bids shall be published in the
official newspaper at least five calendar days prior to the final date for
submitting bids.
   (c)   Such notice shall briefly designate the supplies, materials or

time and place of filing and opening of bids. The right shall BC reserved to
reject any or all bids, or parts thereof.
   (d)   In all cases where sealed bids are invited, a copy of the official
newspaper notice shall be posted on a public bulletin board in the Village
Hall. The Agent shall mail copies of the official notice to such qualified
vendors as he or she may deem necessary to give actual notice to interested
bidders and to obtain competitive bidding.
   (e)   Unless prescribed by the Council, the Administrator shall prescribe
the amount of any security to be deposited with any bid. Such deposit shall be

of such security shall be expressed in terms of percentage of the bid
submitted. Unless fixed by Council, the Administrator shall fix the amount of
the performance bond and in the case of construction contracts the amount of
the labor and materials bond to be required of the successful bidders.
   (f)   Bids shall be opened in public at the time and place designated in the
notice requesting bids in the presence of the Agent, the Clerk and at least one
other Village official, preferably the head of the department most closely
concerned with the subject of the contract. The bids shall thereupon be
carefully examined and tabulated and reported to the Council, with the
recommendation of the Agent (as approved by the Administrator, if the
Administrator is not acting as the Agent for this purchase) at the next Council
meeting. After tabulation, all bids may be inspected by the competing bidders.
In lieu of the procedure for opening bids herein specified, the Council may
direct that bids be opened at a Council meeting.
   (g)   When such bids are submitted to the Council, if the Council shall find
any of the bids to be satisfactory it shall accept the bid of the lowest
responsible bidder as described in Section
208.06. However, the Council shall have the right to reject any or all bids and
to waive irregularities in bidding and to accept bids which do not conform in
every respect to the bidding requirements.
   (h)   Subsections (b) through (g) of Section
208.06 shall apply to this section, provided however, that the word "Council"
shall be inserted for the word "Agent" or "Administrator."
   (i)   At the time the contract is executed by the contractor, he or she
shall file a bond executed by a surety company authorized to do business in the
State of Michigan, to the Village, conditioned to pay all laborers, mechanics,
subcontractors and materialmen as well as all just debts, dues and demands
incurred in the performance of such work and shall file a performance bond when
one is required. Said contractor shall also file evidence of public liability
insurance in an amount satisfactory to the Administrator, and shall also agree
to save the Village harmless from loss or damage caused to any person or
property by reason of the contractor's negligence.
   (j)   All bids and deposits of certified or cashier's checks may be retained
until the contract is awarded and signed. If any successful bidder fails or
refuses to enter into the contract awarded to him or her within five days after
the same has been awarded, or file any bond required within the same time, the
deposit accompanying his or her bid shall be forfeited to the Village and the
Council may, in its discretion, award the contract to the next lower
responsible bidder or said contract may be re-advertised.
(Ord. 84. Passed 4-12-72.)

bidding:

competitive bidding, and the Council authorizes execution of a contract without
competitive bidding by resolution passed by unanimous vote of the Village
Council present at the meeting.
   (b)   In the employment of professional services.
   (c)   Where the Council shall determine that the public interest will be

to waive compliance with this section when it finds such action to be in the
best interests of the Village. However, if such is waived then a letter stating
the reason for waiver should be filed with the Village Clerk.

prohibited from accepting directly or indirectly from any person or company,

(Ord. 155. Passed 1-13-16.)
216.05 COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   This Ethics Chapter for the Village of Wolverine Lake expresses
standards of ethical conduct expected for the officials and employees of the
Village of Wolverine Lake. Village Council members themselves have the primary
responsibility to assure that they understand and meet the ethical standards
expressed in this code of ethics and that the public can continue to have full
confidence in the integrity of government.
   (b)   Complaints alleging a violation of this chapter by an employee shall
be filed with the Village administrator. The Village administrator shall
investigate the complaint to establish whether a violation of this section
occurred and any appropriate sanction that should be imposed. In cases where an
employee is a member of a union, compliance with applicable union policies and
procedures shall occur.
   (c)   Complaints alleging a violation of this section by any elected or
appointed officials shall be filed with the Village administrator, who shall
investigate the complaint If the Village administrator has a reasonable belief
that a violation of this section occurred, then he or she shall report the
complaint and the initial investigation findings to the Village Council.
   (d)   In addition to receiving complaints from the Village Administrator,
all Village Council members shall have a responsibility to intervene when they
learn of actions of another Village Council member or other Village official
that appear to be in violation of the Ethics Ordinance.
   (e)   Upon acquiring reasonable suspicion of a violation of the Ethics
Ordinance, by complaint or otherwise, the Village Council president shall set,
or any three council members may require the setting of, a public hearing at a
regular or special meeting of the Village Council to determine whether a
violation of the Ethics Ordinance occurred and, if so, what sanctions shall be
imposed for the violation. In complaints alleging a violation of this chapter
by a member of the Village Council, that member shall not take part in any
proceedings related to the complaint as a Village Council member.
   (f)   The Village Council may impose sanctions on Village officials whose
conduct does not comply with the Village's ethical standards. A violation of
this chapter by any Village official shall be deemed misconduct in office as
set forth in Section 5.3 of the Village Charter. Sanctions may include
reprimand, formal censure, loss of committee assignment, restrictions on budget
or travel, and removal from office. Upon removal of a member of Council from
office, Council shall appoint a successor in the manner described in the
Village Charter for appointments.
(Ord. 155. Passed 1-13-16.)
216.06 IMPLEMENTATION.
   As an expression of the standards of conduct for Village officials and
employees expected by the public, this code of ethics is intended to be both
responsive to complaints and self-enforcing. It therefore becomes most
effective when Village officials and employees are thoroughly familiar with it
and embrace its provisions. Therefore, ethical standards shall be included in
the regular orientations for newly elected, appointed or hired Village
officials and employees. In addition, the Village Council shall annually review
the code of ethics for the Village of Wolverine Lake.

(Ord. 153-A. Passed 12-14-16.)
606.02 DEFINITIONS.
   The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context
clearly indicates a different meaning:
   (a)   “Animal” means a nonhuman zoological species classified for purposes
of this chapter as follows:
      (1)   “Household pet” means any of the various animals domesticated by
humans such as to live and breed in a tame condition (such as a household dog
or cat).
      (2)   “Farm animal” means an animal which is normally part of the
livestock maintained on a farm, including bovine, equine, swine, ovine and like
animals;
      (3)   “Exotic animal” means any wild or undomesticated animal which is
not of a species customarily used as an ordinary household pet or farm animal,
but one which would ordinarily be confined to a zoo, or one which would
ordinarily be found in the wilderness of this or any other country.
Verification from the Village Administrator is required that such an animal
would not cause a reasonable person to be fearful of bodily harm or property
damage, and is not considered a dangerous animal.
      (4)   “Dangerous animal” means any wild or undomesticated animal which is
not of a species customarily used as an ordinary household pet or farm animal,
but one winch would ordinarily be confined to a zoo, or one which would
ordinarily be found in the wilderness of this or any other country.
Verification from the Village Administrator is required that such an animal
would cause a reasonable person to be fearful of bodily harm or property
damage, and is prohibited in the Village.

606.10 of this chapter.
   (b)   “Owner or possessor” means any person who either has right of property

606.03 HOUSEHOLD PETS.
   Household pets may be maintained in all zoning classification districts,
provided that they are licensed as may be required by the laws of the State of
Michigan or Oakland County, kept in accordance with Village regulations, and do
not create a public nuisance. Unless otherwise allowed by Village Council, no
more than three household pets, which are commonly kept outside, shall be
permitted per housing unit.
(Ord. 153-A. Passed 12-14-16.)
606.04 DANGEROUS ANIMALS PROHIBITED.

verification from the Village Administrator. Prior to housing, caging, allowing
to roam or otherwise keeping any animal in the Village which may be deemed
dangerous or exotic pursuant to this chapter, the owner or possessor of that
animal shall obtain verification from the Village Administrator regarding
animal classification. Any animal classified as a dangerous animal may not be
housed, caged, allowed to roam or otherwise kept in the Village. Any animal
classified as an exotic animal must comply with the regulations contained in

(Ord. 153-A. Passed 12-14-16.)
606.05 REGULATION OF EXOTIC ANIMALS.
   (a)   Recognizing that, because of availability of training, breeding and
animal husbandry, certain species of animals classified as exotic animals may
become viewed by society as domesticated animals or household pets, such
animals may qualify to be housed, caged or otherwise kept within the Village.
Any evaluation or finding made in this regard will be made on a case by case
basis. Previous approvals or denials will not impact the evaluation and
decision of new reviews, regardless of animal type or species.
   (b)   In the event the Village Administrator verifies that an animal is
exotic and not ordinarily kept as a household pet or farm animal, but is not
dangerous in nature, the Village Administrator may then recommend to Village
Council that a person be allowed to own or possess that exotic animal within
the Village. The Village Administrator's recommendation will be based upon
findings related to:
      (1)   The size, nature and character of the exotic animal;
      (2)   The breed of the exotic animal and its birth origin;
      (3)   The temperament of the exotic animal and any propensity it may have
for becoming dangerous;
      (4)   The proximity of the exotic animal to adjoining properties;
      (5)   The nature of the surrounding neighborhood (i.e., how the land is
used, the intensity of that use, etc.);
      (6)   Potential traffic congestion caused by the exotic animal;

surrounding area.
      (9)   The nature and character of the land, building or structures to be
utilized for the keeping, housing or caging of the exotic animal;
      (10)   The plan of care intended for the exotic animal, and any control
measures which will be used in the keeping, housing or caging of that animal.
      (11)   Any other applicable and relevant standards which are determined
by the Village Administrator to be reasonably related to the public health,
safety and welfare.
   (c)   The Village Administrator shall consult with the Wolverine Lake police
department, and any other public safety officials deemed necessary, and secure
a written report of review to submit to Village Council in connection with the
Administrator's recommendation.
   (d)   In connection with the Village Administrator's submission of his or
her recommendation to Village Council, a notice of hearing shall be given not
less than 15 days before the Council meeting, delivered by mail or other public
or private delivery service, to the owner(s) of property assessed within 500
feet of the property that is subject of the exotic animal request.
   (e)   Village Council may approve, deny or amend the recommendation of the
Village Administrator as to whether an exotic animal may be kept, housed or

section is less than 18 years of age and not emancipated under Public Act No.
293 of 1968 (M.C.L.A. 722.1 et seq.). The notice may be made by any means

contemporaneous purchase or receipt of alcoholic liquor by the minor was not
under the direction of the State Police, the Commission, or the local police
agency and was not part of the undercover operation.
   (m)   The State Police, the Commission, or a local police agency shall not

operation at the scene of a violation of subsection (a) of this section.
   (n)   In a municipal civil infraction proceeding or criminal prosecution for
the violation of subsection (a) of this section concerning a minor having any
bodily alcohol content, it is an affirmative defense that the minor consumed
the alcoholic liquor in a venue or location where that consumption is legal.
   (o)   As used in this section, "any bodily alcohol content" means either of

695.03   Invasive Species Control.
695.04   Conditions mandating invasive species treatment.
695.05   Notice of invasive species infestation.
695.01 DEFINITIONS.
   The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context
clearly indicates a different meaning:
   “Invasive Species” includes the following plant and animal species:
      (1)   European Frogbit means the non-native plan species with the
scientific name Hydrocharis morsus-ranae.
      (2)   Japanese Knotweed means the non-native plant species with the
scientific name Fallopia japonica, and is a larger perennial plant with hollow
stems with distinct raised nodes that give the appearance of bamboo.
      (3)   Phragmites or phragmites plant means the invasive plant species
with the scientific name Phragmites australis, also known as the common reed,
which is a large perennial grass native to wetland sites throughout temperate
regions of the world.
      (4)   Swallow-wort, Black and Pale means the non-native plant species
with the scientific names Cynanchum louiseae and Cynanchum rossicum and are
herbaceous perennial twining vines.

(Ord. 160. Passed 8-21-19.)
695.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide procedures to address invasive
species infestations on properties within the Village that cause a hazardous
condition as defined. The spread of invasive species can drive out native plant
species, destroy wildlife habitat and negatively impact property values.
Invasive Species infestations are not halted by traditional legal boundaries
between parcels, and if left unchecked, the invasive species infestations can
become very large and dense, creating a fire hazard, encroaching on and
obstructing waterways, and reducing visual quality for the community.
Phragmites is of particular concern within the village because of the lake and
watercourses.
(Ord. 160. Passed 8-21-19.)
695.03 INVASIVE SPECIES CONTROL.
   (a)   Establishment and authority of ad hoc invasive species control
committee. On an annual basis or as otherwise requested by the Village Council,
an invasive species control committee composed of the Village Administrator,
Public Works employee(s), and a resident of the village, to be appointed by the
Village Administrator shall undertake a mapping of properties within the
village for the purpose of identifying parcels on which an invasive species
infestation is present. Properties included in the mapping process will not be
limited by type of ownership. At a date determined by the Village Council, a
report shall be submitted to the Village Council.
   (b)   At the recommendation of the Village Administrator, a description of
the properties identified as having an invasive species infestation may be
brought before the Village Council to approve notice to be sent to each
property owner.
   (c)   Upon the Village Administrator's determination that a property has
invasive species infestation that qualifies as a hazardous condition, as
defined in Sec. 695.04 below, the Village Administrator, shall provide written
notice to the property owner indicating that, due to a present hazardous
condition, as defined below, invasive species treatment may be mandated at the
property owner's cost.

   The Village Administrator shall determine whether any properties have an
invasive species infestation that qualifies as a hazardous condition, mandating
treatment of the condition, which is defined, but not limited to, as follows:
   (a)   Ecological impacts associated loss of habitat, impaired water quality
and or disruption of storm water management and drainage.
   (b)   Conditions where the unchecked growth of invasive species has blocked
sight visibility at roadway, safety path or driveway intersections and impedes
the safe movement of cars and/or pedestrians, or has the potential to do so.
   (c)   Hazardous fire conditions or the potential to create a hazardous fire
condition due to the unchecked growth of invasive species.
(Ord. 160. Passed 8-21-19.)
695.05 NOTICE OF INVASIVE SPECIES INFESTATION.
   If the Village Council approves for notices to be sent out to property
owners, the Village Administrator will ensure that the notices are sent in a
timely manner. The notice shall include, but is not limited to, the following:
   (a)   Educational information regarding invasive species and/or invasive
species infestation;
   (b)   Information regarding the methods of treatment and the voluntary
invasive species treatment process promulgated by the Michigan Department of
Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (“EGLE”), requiring a permit and
application of treatment by a state certified contractor be certified to
perform the work;
   (c)   Information regarding the methods of treatment and voluntary invasive
treatment as outlined by Oakland County Cooperative Invasive Species Management
Area (“CISMA”);
   (d)   A deadline for a property owner to elect to voluntarily participate in
invasive species treatment;
   (e)   The opportunity for a public hearing in front of the Village Council,
including a deadline for requesting a public hearing on the treatment mandate.
   (f)   Upon the Village Administrator's determination that treatment must be
mandated, the property owner shall either contact the Village Administrator to
schedule treatment or contact EGLE to obtain an individual permit required to
treat invasive species. Failure to do so within the time specified by the
Village Administrator may result in the village performing invasive species
treatment and assessing the treatment costs to the property owner.
   (g)   EGLE permit application for treatment. The Village Administrator or
his or her designee may apply annually to EGLE for a permit authorizing
invasive species treatment upon those parcels upon which an invasive species
infestation is discovered and provided notice of an invasive species
infestation pursuant to the notice provisions detailed above.
   (h)   Violation deemed civil infraction. Noncompliance with the terms and
conditions of this section shall be deemed a municipal civil infraction as that
term and penalties are defined in this Code.

LANDLORD/TENANT RELATIONSHIP
820.44 PURPOSE.
   The Village declares that this chapter has as one of its principal
objectives the lawful public purpose of rapidly developing and maximizing the
educational, community service, cultural and public safety potential of the
Village. The Village further finds that the public interest and necessity
require that no owner of any multiple unit residential dwelling (nor its agent
or representative) be permitted to directly or indirectly prevent any resident
of such dwelling from receiving cable communications service installation,
maintenance and services from a Grantee operating under a valid franchise
issued by the Village.
(Ord. 141. Passed 2-12-03.)
820.45 NEGOTIATION OF AGREEMENT.
   (a)   In order to provide the opportunity for the residents of any multiple
unit residential dwelling to obtain service from Grantee, such Grantee may
negotiate an agreement with the owner of that dwelling or, failing agreement,
may request that the Village exercise its power of eminent domain for the
necessary public purpose of enabling Grantee to serve residents of that
multiple unit residential dwelling. Upon request of such Grantee, the Village
may commence condemnation proceedings in accordance with applicable law. In the
event of such proceeding, in preparing its good-faith offer of just
compensation, the Village may consider:
      (1)   The amount and fair market value of space occupied by Grantee's
cable and related facilities. The fair market value of the space shall be
assessed in light of the prior use, if any, of that space, together with any
evidence of nonspeculative alternative uses;
      (2)   The present value of any funds that the owner will reasonably
expend over time in ensuring that Grantee conforms to all laws, regulations and
reasonable conditions necessary to ensure the safety, convenient functioning
and appearance of the multiple unit residential dwelling;
      (3)   The continued physical availability of other space on the premises
for the installation of alternative modes of television program reception or
delivery;
      (4)   As an offset to the amounts set forth in divisions (a) (1) and (a)
(2) of this section, any increase in the fair market value of the multiple unit
residential dwelling attributable to the availability of Grantee's service to
the property's tenants; and
      (5)   Any other reasonable, nonspeculative factors which the Village may
find relevant.
   (b)   The requesting Grantee shall indemnify the Village for expenses and
costs incurred by the Village in the condemnation proceedings as well as for
the full amount of the condemnation proceedings are completed or otherwise
settled.
(Ord. 141. Passed 2-12-03.)
820.46 ADDITIONAL CHARGES.
   (a)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this chapter or
the franchise agreement, Grantee shall be permitted to charge each resident of
a multiple unit residential dwelling an additional charge, above and beyond the
service rate for a single family dwelling as specified in the franchise
agreement, solely to defray the exact additional per-resident cost to Grantee
of compensating the owner for access to the multiple unit residential dwelling.
   (b)   Any such additional charge shall be subject to the approval of the
Village. Such additional charge shall not be included in the computation of
franchise fees due to the Village pursuant to this chapter or the franchise
agreement.
(Ord. 141. Passed 2-12-03.)
820.47 DENIAL OF SERVICE.
   Notwithstanding any other language in this section or elsewhere in this
chapter, Grantee shall not be obligated to provide service to any multiple unit
residential dwelling so long as the owner of that dwelling demands compensation
from Grantee in an amount that is unreasonable or imposes financial or other
conditions that would, in Grantee's reasonable business judgment, render
provision of service to that dwelling uneconomic. Should Grantee subsequently
agree to render service to such multiple unit residential dwelling, there shall
be no installation charges to the residents of such dwelling beyond those set
forth in the franchise agreement. Grantee shall not be obligated, in such
circumstances, to request the Village to institute condemnation proceedings.
(Ord. 141. Passed 2-12-03.)
820.48 DISCRIMINATION AGAINST TENANT PROHIBITED; PENALTY.
   Neither the owner of any multiple unit residential dwelling nor its agent or
representative shall penalize, charge or surcharge a tenant or resident or
forfeit or threaten to forfeit any right of such tenant or resident or
discriminate in any way against such tenant or resident who requests or
receives cable communications service from a company operating under a valid
and existing cable communication franchise issued by the Village. Any person
convicted of violating any provision of this subchapter is subject to a fine of
not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each offense.
(Ord. 141. Passed 2-12-03.)
820.49 RESALE PROHIBITED.
   No person shall resell, without the express written consent of both Grantee
and the Village, any cable service, program or signal transmitted by Grantee
operating under a franchise issued by the Village.
(Ord. 141. Passed 2-12-03.)

communications system facilities conform to laws and regulations and reasonable
conditions necessary to protect safety, functioning and appearance.
(Ord. 141. Passed 2-12-03.)
820.51 INDEMNIFICATION.

   The Village reserves the right to delegate from time to time any rights or
obligations under the franchise to any body or organization: Any such
delegation shall be effective upon written notice thereof to Grantee. Upon

the delegation not in conflict with the franchise. Any such delegation or

amendment to the franchise or require Grantee's consent.

      (2)   The written instructions and information provided for herein shall

(Ord. 141. Passed 2-12-03.)
820.59 CABLE SERVICE.

extended pursuant to the requirements of any applicable law or regulation:
      (1)   Subscriber problem: "Same day" service, seven days a week for all
requests for service received prior to 12:00 p.m. each day. In no event shall

notification stating the time of arrival and requesting that Grantee be
contacted again to establish a new appointment
window. In such case, the required response time for the request for service
shall be 24 hours from the time Grantee is contacted to establish the new
appointment window. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Grantee's technician
telephones the subscriber's home before or during the appointment window and is
advised that the technician will not be given access to the subscriber's home
during the appointment window, then the technician shall not be obliged to
travel to the subscriber's home or to leave the written notification referred
to above; and the burden shall again be upon the subscriber (or adult

   (e)   Except as otherwise provided in division (d) of this section, Grantee,
under the provisions of this Section 820.58, shall be deemed to have responded

sufficient technicians arrive at the service location, begin work on the
request for service or remedial work, as the case may be, and proceed
diligently to complete such work.
   (f)   No charge shall be made to the subscriber for any service call unless
the problem giving rise to the service request can be demonstrated by Grantee
to have been:
      (1)   Caused by subscribed negligence;
      (2)   Caused by malicious destruction of cable equipment; or
      (3)   A problem previously established as having been noncable in origin.

any other communication from Grantee to its subscribers, shall not contain any
material misstatement or omit to state a material fact which omission would
make the information furnished misleading.
   (b)   The billing form and content in use by Grantee as of the date of

bills so as to remedy the defects specified by the Authority. The modification
shall be implemented by Grantee effective with the first billing after the
expiration of 45 days after receipt by Grantee of the Authority's notice of
disapproval, unless the Authority extends such time.
(Ord. 141. Passed 2-12-03.)

discontinuance of service or, except as may be otherwise authorized by law, a
net downgrade of service whereby the subscriber requests a lower tier of basic
service and/or a net reduction in premium service.
   (b)   Grantee may only disconnect a subscriber if at least 45 days have
elapsed after the due date for payment of the subscriber's bill and Grantee has
provided at least ten days written notice to the subscriber prior to
disconnection specifying the effective date after which cable services are
subject to disconnection; provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing,

reasonable grounds determines that the subscriber has tampered with or abused
Grantee's equipment, or is or may be engaged in the theft of cable services.
   (c)   Grantee shall promptly disconnect any subscriber who so requests
disconnection. No period of notice prior to requested termination of service

charge may be imposed upon the subscriber for any cable service delivered after
the effective date of the disconnect request.

shall be reasonably related to Grantee's cost of administering delinquent
accounts. No late payment charge shall be imposed upon a subscriber, and a
subscriber shall not be deemed to be in arrears on a bill, unless at least 30
days have elapsed after the due date specified on the bill; and, for purposes
of this section and Section
820.61, the due date specified on the bill shall not be earlier than the first
day of the monthly period to which the bill is attributable.
(Ord. 141. Passed 2-12-03.)
820.63 NOTICE OF PROGRAMMING OR CHANNEL CHANGE.
   Grantee shall provide at least 45 days written notice to subscribers prior
to disconnecting any channel or programming service or to realigning any
channel and shall provide written notice of the same to the Authority no later
than Grantee's notice to subscribers. This provision shall not preclude the
right of the Village or the Authority on behalf of the Village to contest or
prohibit any such action by Grantee if, and to the extent, such right exists.
The foregoing notice requirement shall not apply in cases in which a
programming service is discontinued because a nonaffiliated provider thereof
discontinues furnishing the same to Grantee on less than 45 days notice to
Grantee. In any such case Grantee shall nevertheless furnish notice to its
subscribers and the Authority promptly upon Grantee receiving notice of the
discontinuance of the programming service from such unaffiliated provider.
(Ord. 141. Passed 2-12-03.)
820.64 NOTICE OF PRICE INCREASE OR REDUCTION OF SERVICE.
   Grantee shall provide at least 45 days written notice to subscribers prior
to implementing any increase in subscriber rates or reduction in subscriber
services and shall provide written notice of the same to the Authority no later
than Grantee's notice to subscribers. The provisions of this section shall not
preclude the right of the Village or the Authority on behalf of the Village to
contest or prohibit any such action by Grantee if, and to the extent, permitted
by law.
(Ord. 141. Passed 2-12-03.)
820.65 GRANTEE'S COMMUNICATIONS.
   Prior to or simultaneously with any communication made by Grantee to the
general public or to Grantee's subscribers announcing or explaining any
increase in subscriber rates or reduction in programming services, Grantee
shall furnish a copy of such communication to the Authority. Such communication
shall not contain any material misstatement or omit to state a material fact
which omission would make the information furnished misleading.
(Ord. 141. Passed 2-12-03.)
820.66 DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ON GRANTEE'S COSTS.
   In the event Grantee, in any communication to the general public, to the
Village, to subscribers, or to the Authority, justifies a price increase or
reduction in service on the basis of increased costs to which Grantee has been
or will be subjected, then Grantee, on written request of the Authority, shall
promptly furnish the Authority the underlying information on which such claim
of increased costs is based in such form as the Authority may request. The
information furnished shall not contain any material misstatement or omit to
state a material fact which omission would make the information furnished
misleading.
(Ord. 141. Passed 2-12-03.)
820.67 SUBSCRIBER REBATES.
   (a)   Except for planned outages where subscribers are provided reasonable
notification in advance, upon a subscriber's request Grantee shall provide not
less than a one day credit for each day in which there is a period of four
hours or more during which the subscriber experienced a significant impairment
of cable service not attributable to any action or omission of the subscriber
or to any defect in the subscriber's equipment. The credit specified herein
shall be equal to one-thirtieth of the subscriber's total monthly bill for all
services and equipment other than pay- per-view; provided, however, if such
monthly bill includes a charge for a pay-per-view program subject to such
outage or significant impairment, then the credit shall be increased by the
amount of such charge.
   (b)   In the event of a violation of the provisions of this chapter by
Grantee which results in a subscriber not receiving cable programming service
or receiving only significantly impaired service, the Authority may order and
direct Grantee to issue a rebate to such subscriber in an amount determined by
the Authority to provide monetary relief to the subscriber substantially equal
to the subscriber's unliquidated detriment or loss resulting from such
violation, not to exceed the subscriber's monthly bill.
   (c)   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to preclude a subscriber from
requesting and receiving from Grantee a rebate greater than that provided in
divisions (a) and (b) of this section.
(Ord. 141. Passed 2-12-03.)
820.68 SECURITY FUND.
   (a)   Subsequent to the effective date of this chapter, within ten days
after the award of a new franchise or the transfer, extension or renewal of an
existing franchise, Grantee thereunder shall furnish the Authority, on behalf
of all of the Authority's member communities, and thereafter maintain with the
Authority, throughout the term of the franchise, a cash deposit of twenty-five
thousand dollars ($25,000) as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by it of all the provisions of this
chapter and the franchise;
      (2)   Compliance with all orders, permits and directions of any agency,
commission, board or department of the Village having jurisdiction over its
acts or defaults under the franchise; and
      (3)   The payment by Grantee of any claims, liens and taxes due the
Village which arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of
the system.
   (b)   Within ten days after notice to it that any amount has been withdrawn
from the security fund, Grantee shall pay to or deposit with the Authority a
sum of money in the full amount withdrawn.
   (c)   If Grantee fails to pay to the Village any fees within the time fixed
herein; or fails, after ten days written notice, to pay to the Village any
taxes due and unpaid; or fails to repay the Village within such ten days, any
damages, costs or expenses which the Village shall be compelled to pay by
reason of any act or default of Grantee in connection with a franchise; or
fails, after three days notice of such failure, to comply with any provisions
of the franchise which the Village reasonably determines can be remedied by a
withdrawal from the security fund, the Authority, on request of the Village may
immediately withdraw the amount thereof, with interest and any additional
charges, from the security fund. Upon such withdrawal, the Authority shall
notify Grantee of the amount and date thereof and shall remit to the Village
the amount so withdrawn.
   (d)   The security fund deposited pursuant to this section, including all
interest thereon, if any, shall be held by the Authority, for the benefit of
its member communities, in the event that the franchise is rescinded or revoked
by reason of the default of Grantee. Grantee, however, shall be entitled to the
return of such security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit at
the expiration of the term of the franchise, provided that there is then no
outstanding default on the part of Grantee. Any interest earned by the
investment of the security fund shall become part of the security fund and
unless consumed by the payment of liquidated damages, fees or other charges
under this article, shall be returned to Grantee at the expiration of the
franchise term, provided that there is then no outstanding default on the part
of Grantee.
   (e)   The Authority shall maintain the security fund in a segregated account
and shall not commingle the same with any other moneys of the Authority. The
Authority may, but shall not be required to, invest the security fund so as to
earn interest thereon and shall not be liable to Grantee on any claim based
upon the lack or insufficiency of interest earned by such fund.
   (f)   Payment from the security fund shall not constitute a cure of any
violation or any act of noncompliance by Grantee. The rights reserved to the
Village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights
of the Village whether reserved by this article or authorized by law, and no
action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund
shall affect any other right the Village may have.
   (g)   The security fund provided for in this section shall be in addition to
any performance bond, letter of credit or other security provided for in the
franchise agreement.
(Ord. 141. Passed 2-12-03.)
820.69 LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.
   (a)   The Authority may assess liquidated damages of up to one hundred
dollars ($100.00) per day against Grantee for each day Grantee is in violation
of this chapter. Such assessment may be levied against the security fund
specified in Section
820.68 or any letter of credit, performance bond or other security provided for
in the franchise agreement.
   (b)   Assessment of liquidated damages shall not constitute a waiver by the
Village of any other right or remedy it may have under the franchise agreement
or applicable law, including the right to recover from Grantee any costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, which are incurred by the
Village on account of Grantee's violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 141. Passed 2-12-03.)
820.70 EVALUATION OF VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   The violation of this chapter by Grantee, Grantee's agents, employees
and/or independent contractors employed or retained by Grantee shall be grounds
for evaluating:
      (1)   Grantee's compliance with any existing agreement and with
applicable law;
      (2)   The quality of Grantee's service and whether it has been reasonable
in light of community needs;
      (3)   The technical ability of Grantee to provide the services,
facilities and equipment as set forth in an operator's proposal for future or
renewed cable services; and
      (4)   The reasonableness of Grantee's proposal to meet the future cable-
related community needs and interests of the residents and cable television
consumers of the Village.
   (b)   These evaluations shall be proper and germane for the Village to
consider formally when reviewing a proposal for renewal of any agreement to
provide cable services within the Village.
(Ord. 141. Passed 2-12-03.)
820.71 REMEDIES AVAILABLE.
   If the Authority determines that Grantee has violated this chapter, the
Authority may order appropriate rebates to subscribers as provided in this
chapter and/or assess liquidated damages against Grantee as provided in Section
820.69. In addition, the Village may pursue any additional or other legal or
equitable remedies available to it under the franchise agreement or any
applicable law.
(Ord. 141. Passed 2-12-03.)
820.72 APPEAL PROCESS.
   With respect to matters affecting the Village individually, and excluding
matters affecting all of the Authority's member communities equally, Grantee
may appeal any action of the Authority to the Village by submitting a written
appeal within twenty-one days from the date of the Authority's action to which
Grantee objects. Upon such appeal, the Village Council shall conduct a de novo
review of the action of the Authority being appeals and shall set a hearing

appealed until the appeal has been decided by the Village Council.

870.01 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the Village's Lawn Fertilizer Ordinance.
(Ord. 149. Passed 9-13-06.)
870.02 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to maintain and promote the improvement
of lake, pond, and wetland resources that the residents of the Village enjoy by
reducing the impact of runoff from applications of lawn fertilizer on turf
containing phosphorous, nitrogen, and other minerals. Based upon scientific
research and general knowledge, the Village has determined that certain
compounds containing nitrogen and phosphorous, which are contained in lawn
fertilizers used on turf when applied within the Village, enter into the
Village's water resources, including wetlands and watercourses, resulting in
excessive and accelerated growth of algae and aquatic plants (eutrophication)
that is detrimental to such resources, including but not limited to reduction
of available oxygen for fish and other aquatic organisms. Therefore, the
Village has determined it necessary and appropriate to regulate the rate and
application of lawn fertilizers on turf.
   (b)   It is the further purpose and intent of this chapter to require
licensure of commercial and institutional applicators of lawn fertilizers on
turf within the Village.
(Ord. 149. Passed 9-13-06.)
870.03 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise,
certain words and phrases shall mean the following:

lawn fertilizer on turf in the Village in exchange for money, goods, services,
or other valuable consideration.
   (b)   "Department" is the Village of Wolverine Lake Building Department.
   (c)   "Eutrophication" is the process by which lakes and streams are
enriched by nutrients (usually phosphorus and nitrogen) which leads to
excessive plant growth – algae in open water, periphyton (attached algae) along
the shoreline, and macrophytes (the higher plants called weeds) in the
nearshore zone.
   (d)   "Fertilizer" is a substance containing one or more recognized plant
nutrients, which substance is used for its plant nutrient content and which is
designed for use, or claimed to have value, in promoting plant growth.
   (e)   "Institutional applicator," except as limited by the last sentence of
this definition, means any individual or entity that applies fertilizers for
the purpose of maintaining turf areas of more than one acre. Institutional
applicators shall include, but shall not be limited to, owners, operators, and
caretakers of public lands, schools, parks, religious institutions, utilities,
industrial or business sites and any residential properties maintained in
condominium and/or common ownership. Owners of individual parcels in single-
family residential districts shall not be considered as institutional
applicators.
   (f)   "Lake frontage property" means property with frontage on a lake or a
river, stream or canal that leads to a lake.
   (g)   "Lawn fertilizers" means any fertilizer, manufactured fertilizer, or
mixed fertilizer that is produced, marketed or labeled for use on turf with
instructions as to application of the fertilizer to turf or any substance known
to contain recognized nutrients for plant growth, that may be applied to turf.
Lawn fertilizer does not include marl, lime, limestone, or natural compost.
   (h)   "Manufactured fertilizer" is a commercially manufactured substance
which enriches the soil containing elements essential for turf growth, being
primarily nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium.
   (i)   "Mixed fertilizer" means a fertilizer containing any combination or
mixture of fertilizer materials designed for use or claimed to have value in
promoting plant growth, including mixtures of fertilizer and pesticide.
   (j)   "Turf" is a covering of grass vegetation which has both aesthetic and
functional benefits maintained at a given level of management: managed grasses
including, but not limited to, residential and commercial property, property
owned by federal, state, or local units of government, including parks and
recreation areas. Turf does not mean pasture, hayland, hay, turf grown on turf
farms, or any other form of agricultural production.
   (k)   Note: In keeping with the general practice of manufacturers of
fertilizer, the elements of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and Potassium (K)
may be expressed by their respective chemical symbol.
(Ord. 149. Passed 9-13-06.)
870.04 APPLICATION OF CHAPTER.
   (a)   It is the intent of this chapter to regulate the application of lawn
fertilizers on turf areas and not on or in areas such as gardens, farms, or
landscape amenities, with the exception that gardens, farms, and landscape
amenities are subject to the buffer zone requirements of Section
870.05(a)(5).
   (b)   The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to newly established
turf areas for the turf's first growing season or in turf areas that soil tests
confirm are below phosphorous and nitrogen levels established by the Michigan
State University Extension Service or other qualified or recognized authority
in the area of soil analysis. The lawn fertilizer applied shall not exceed the
levels recommended in the soil test evaluation. Exemptions for application of
lawn fertilizer containing phosphorous based on soil testing shall expire
annually. The amount of phosphorous applied shall not exceed one pound per
1,000 square feet annually and 0.3 square feet per application. Phosphorous
applied as lawn fertilizer pursuant to exemptions shall be watered into the

protect the quality and safety of the lake and shoreline and the rights of
adjoining riparian owners and users in the vicinity of such road ends at the
lake, to promote safe use of such road ends, and to promote the public health,
safety and welfare of all persons making use of the lake and lands within the
Village at or near the road ends involved. Accordingly, it is the intent and
purpose of the Village Council to adopt reasonable regulations for the use of
certain road ends at the lake within the Village.

the Village. If the meter is found to be defective it shall be repaired or an
accurate meter installed without charge to the customer.
   (f)   Meter Variance. A meter shall be considered accurate if, when tested,
it registers not to exceed five (5%) percent more or five (5%) percent less
than the actual quantity of water passing through it. If a meter registers in
excess of five (5%) percent more than the actual quantity of water passing
through it, it shall be considered "fast" to that extent. If a meter registers
in excess of five (5%) percent less than the actual quantity of water passing
through it, it shall be considered "slow" to that extent.
   (g)   Water Bill Adjustment. If a meter has been tested at the request of a
customer and is determined to register "fast" the Village shall credit the
customer with a sum equal to the percent "fast" multiplied by the amount of all
bills incurred by the customer, within the three months prior to the test. If a
meter is determined to register "slow" the Village shall charge the Customer
with a sum equal to the percent "slow" multiplied by the amount of all bills
incurred by the customer within three months prior to the test. If the
Department on its own initiative tests a water meter, it shall be done without
cost to the customer, other than the payment of the amount due the Village for
water used by the customer if the meter is found to be "slow."

1040.06 CROSS CONNECTIONS.
   (a)   Cross Connections Prohibited. Cross connections between water supply
systems are prohibited, and the control, discovery, prevention and elimination
thereof shall be governed by the provisions of this section, the Michigan
Plumbing Codes, and such other federal, state and local regulations that may
apply.
   (b)   Regulations Adopted By Reference:
      (1)   The Water Supply Cross Connection rules of the Michigan Department
of Environmental Quality, R 325.11401 through R 325.11407 of the Michigan
Administrative Code; and
      (2)   The Oakland County Drain Commissioner Cross Connection Control
Regulations, as approved by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.
   (c)   Inspections. It shall be the duty of the Commissioner, on behalf of
the Village, to cause inspections to be made of all properties served by the

deemed possible. The frequency of inspections and re-inspections based on
potential health hazards involved shall be as established in the Commissioner's
Plan as approved by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.
   (d)   Inspection Authority. The representative of the Commissioner shall
have the right to enter at any reasonable time any property served by a
connection to the public water supply system of the Village, for the purpose of
inspecting the piping system or systems thereof for cross connections. On
request, the owner, lessee or occupant of any property so served shall furnish
to the inspection agency any pertinent information regarding the piping system
or systems on such property. The refusal of such information or of access to
the property, when requested, shall be deemed evidence of the presence of a
cross connection.
   (e)   Discontinuation of Water Service. The Commissioner is hereby
authorized and directed to discontinue water service after reasonable notice to
the owner and occupant of any property upon which a connection in violation of
this chapter is found to exist, and to take such other precautionary measures
deemed necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination to the public water
supply system. Water service to such property shall not be restored until all
cross connections have been eliminated in compliance with the provisions of
this chapter.
   (f)   Warning of Potentially Contaminated Water Outlets. The potable water
supply made available on the properties served by the public water supply shall
be protected from possible contamination as specified by this Ordinance and by
the federal, state and local laws. Any water outlet which could be used for

(Ord. 146. Passed 6-8-05.)
1040.07 EMERGENCY RESTRICTIONS.
   (a)   Water Emergency Regulations. If, for any reason, the available supply
of water is insufficient, or threatens to be insufficient, to supply the total
demand on the water distribution system, the Village Council may regulate,
limit or prohibit the use of water for any purpose. Such regulations shall
restrict less essential water uses to the extent deemed necessary to assure an
adequate supply for essential domestic and commercial needs and for fire
fighting. Such regulations may authorize discontinuance of service to any or
all areas outside of the Village. No such regulation, limitation or provision
shall be effective until twenty four (24) hours after publication thereof in a
newspaper of general circulation in the Village.
   (b)   Temporary Emergency Sprinkling Restrictions.
      (1)   Upon written notification from Commerce Township or the Detroit
Water and Sewerage Department in conjunction with the Water Bureau of the
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality that the supply or pressure demand
for water cannot be accommodated, the following emergency regulation shall
apply in the Village of Wolverine Lake for all properties connected to the
municipal water system: Sprinkling of lawns and landscaping and all outdoor
water use shall only be allowed for properties with even numbered addresses on
even numbered days within a month and for properties with odd numbered
addresses on odd numbered days within a month.
      (2)   If, in the opinion of the Commerce Township, Detroit Water and
Sewerage Department, and upon written notification from the Detroit Water and
Sewerage Department in conjunction with the Water Bureau of the Michigan
Department of Environmental Quality that provisions in Subsection (b)(1) are
not sufficient, the following emergency regulations shall apply in the Village
of Wolverine Lake for all properties connected to the Village water system:
         A.   The odd/even schedule set forth in Paragraph (b)(1) may be
expanded to restrict water use at specific times; or
         B.   Sprinkling of lawns and landscaping and all outdoor water use
shall not be allowed.
   (c)   Publication. The Village of Wolverine Lake shall, within twenty-four
(24) hours of notification from Commerce Township or the Detroit Water and
Sewerage Department, cause these regulations to be publicly announced by means
of posting at the Village Hall and broadcasting or telecasting by the stations
with a normal operating range covering the Village, and may cause such
announcements to be further declared in newspapers of general circulation and
on the Village website when feasible. The regulations shall become effective
immediately after notice of enforcement of the ordinance posted at the Village
Hall. Upon notification from Commerce Township or the Detroit Water and
Sewerage Department in conjunction with the Water Bureau of the Michigan
Department of Environmental Quality that the emergency regulations are no
longer necessary, the Village of Wolverine Lake shall cause a public
announcement lifting the water restrictions in a like manner to their
imposition.

serve more than one premises shall be constructed, reconstructed or altered in
the Village unless a permit has been issued by the Department.
   (b)   Application. Application for permits shall be accompanied by complete
plans, designed per the Village Design and Construction Standards, and cost
estimates all of which shall be submitted to the Manager, or his or her
designee, for review and approval before a permit is issued. The review will
include:
      (1)   Checking water main plans for size of mains and adequacy of gates
and fire hydrants.
      (2)   Determining types of joints on the basis of the characteristics of
the particular area.
      (3)   Determining protection of pipe, width of trench, and strength of
pipe by depth of sewer and type of soil conditions.

      (5)   General review of cost estimate for the purpose of payment of fees.
      (6)   Review of compliance with Village standards and specifications.
   (c)   Issuance of Permit. If the plans and specifications are approved by
the Manager, or his or her designee, Commerce Township, the Oakland County
Drain Commissioner, Detroit Water Department and the Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality, as applicable, the construction permit shall be issued
upon payment of the fees as provided in this chapter. If the Manager, or his or
her designee, does not approve the plans and specifications, he or she shall
give his/her recommendations in writing to the Village with a copy to the
applicant. The applicant may amend the plans and specifications in accordance
with the recommendations or may appeal the decision of the Manager, or his or
her designee, to the Village Administrator in writing.
   (d)   Inspection and Investigation. The Manager, or his or her designee,
shall make, or cause to be made, inspections of the project during its
construction. Inspections shall include the receipt of material tests and
requests for compaction tests by an approved independent testing laboratory (at
the cost of the owner) as the work progresses and as he or she shall deem
necessary to insure that the sewer or water main will be built in accordance
with the approved plans and specifications and in accordance with all
provisions of this chapter and ordinances and regulations of the County of
Oakland. The Manager, or his or her designee, shall have the right to authorize
minor departures from the approved plans and specifications where necessary
because of unforeseen circumstances, but no departures from the approved plans
and specifications shall be made without the prior knowledge of the consulting
engineers that prepared the original plans. If the Manager, or his or her
designee, shall find that the improvements are not being installed or
constructed in accordance with the aforementioned standards, he/she shall issue
a written notice of violation requiring the installation or construction to be
corrected. In the notice the Manager, or his or her designee, shall specify a
time limit for the correction of the violations. If the violations are not
corrected within the specified time, the Manager, or his or her designee, may
order all work stopped.
   (e)   "As Built" Drawing Required. Upon completion of the project the
Manager, or his or her designee, shall make a final field inspection
accompanied by the owner's consulting Engineer. The Consulting Engineer shall
furnish the Department with copies of "as built" drawings of the project and
shall furnish the Manager, or his or her designee, with one set of reproducible
Mylar plans and/or an electronic file compatible with the Village's software.
   (f)   Right to enter premises. By connecting premises to the Village water
system the owner thereof irrevocably grants to the Village and the Department
or their agents the right to enter at all reasonable times onto or in the
premises for the purposes of reading meters and installation, inspection,
repair and maintenance of water supply and water use facilities on the
premises.
   (g)   Facilities to be Extended Across Entire Frontage of Property Served.
Water facilities, including mains and laterals, shall be extended across the
entire frontage of the property to be served and taken to the furthest boundary
of the property to be served in a manner consistent with the Village Water

the Drain Commission. Said connection permit shall show the location of the
work, the extent of the work, information regarding the contractor, the owner
and the engineer, and any other pertinent information as shall be determined
necessary by the Drain Commissioner.
   (c)   Individual building sewers which are directly connected into the
Village sanitary sewer system shall conform to all applicable requirements of
this chapter. A connection permit, for which a charge of fifty dollars ($50.00)
will be made by the Drain Commissioner, shall be obtained before such
connection is made. Prior to the issuance of such connection permit, the person
obtaining such permit shall have obtained the written approval of the Village.
Connection shall be made in a workmanlike manner and in accordance with methods
and procedures established by the Drain Commissioner.
The party to whom such a permit is issued shall be responsible for notifying
the Drain Commissioner forty-eight hours in advance of the date and time when
such a connection is made so that proper inspection of the same can be made by
the Drain Commissioner.
   (d)   Prior to the adjustment, reconstruction or any other altering of the
Village sanitary sewer system, including manhole structures, the contractor or
person responsible for the work shall first obtain a permit to do such work
from the Drain Commissioner. Said permit fee shall be determined by the Drain
Commissioner.
   (e)   Prior to construction and during the life of permits obtained in
accordance with subsections (b), (c) and (d) hereof, all owners or contractors
shall:
      (1)   Yearly furnish to the Drain Commissioner a satisfactory surety bond
in the amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000) as security for the faithful
performance of the work in accordance with the plans and specifications and
departmental standards; and
      (2)   Yearly furnish to the Drain Commissioner a cash deposit in the
amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00). Such deposit shall provide funds for
emergency work and/or such other work as may be deemed necessary by the Drain
Commissioner arising as a result of construction by the owner or contractor.
Such deposit shall not be canceled by the owner or contractor without first
having given ten days written notice to the Drain Commissioner. Cash deposits
may be returned to the owner or contractor within ten days of receipt of
written request therefor, except that no deposits will be returned until such
time as all outstanding permits have received final inspection and approval. In
the event that it becomes necessary for the Drain Commissioner to expend funds
for work arising as a result of construction by the owner or the contractor,
then the cost of such work shall be deducted from the aforementioned cash
deposit.
   The owner or contractor shall have the right and opportunity to correct any
deficiencies promptly before any deposit funds will be spent by the Drain
Commissioner. The owner or contractor shall, within thirty days of the mailing
of written notice thereof, pay to the Drain Commissioner the entire amount of
such cost. Failure to comply with these rules and regulations and the standards
of the Drain Commissioner may result in the immediate forfeiture of the cash
deposit.

shall pay the fine, costs, damages or expenses, and their failure to do so
shall be civil contempt unless they make the showing required in this

ordered under subsection (a) or (b) within thirty days after the date upon
which the payment is due for a violation of this chapter involving the use or
occupation of land, a building or other structure, the Village of Wolverine
Lake may obtain a lien against the land, building or structure involved in the

      (5)   The Village may institute an action in a court of competent
jurisdiction for collection of the fines and costs imposed by a court order for
a violation of this chapter. However, an attempt by the Village to collect the
fines or costs does not invalidate or waive the lien upon the land, building or

1060.01 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (a)   Act 641 of the Public Acts of 1978 [M.C.L. 299.401 et seq.], as
amended, requires municipalities to assure that all solid waste is removed from
sites of generation frequently enough to protect the public health, and
delivered to authorized solid waste disposal areas. The Village Council of
Wolverine Lake has determined that the collection of solid waste is most
appropriately undertaken by the Village, acting by and through contract with
the private sector. Because solid waste collection directly affects the public
health, safety and general welfare, the Village shall contract with a single
contractor in order to facilitate Village governance and control of its solid
waste program.
   (b)   The Village Council has further determined that its solid waste
program should include recycling consistent with the Oakland County Municipal
Solid Waste Management Plan.
   (c)   For purposes of establishing and carrying out a program of solid waste
collection, recycling and disposal, the Village Council has adopted this
chapter to provide standards and specifications for services to be provided,
provide for administration of the program and operational specifications, and
provide penalties for failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter.

tree on their property at their own expense. The Village may remove or treat
such trees at the owner’s expense if the owner does not comply with a notice

1222.12 STREETS AND ALLEYS.
   The specifications herein set forth are hereby declared to be the standards
and general plan adopted by the Village of Wolverine Lake Council for the width
and location of all highways, streets, and alleys, which may hereafter, be
platted or accepted within the Village of Wolverine Lake. All such regulations
are intended to be in harmony with all road and right-of-way standards and
policies of the Oakland County Road Commission and the Village of Wolverine
Lake engineering standards. Design of streets and alleys shall conform to all
road and right-of-way standards and policies of the Road Commission for Oakland
County and the Village of Wolverine Lake engineering standards, and to the
latest publication and revision of A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and
Streets by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials. Where there is a conflict between any of the aforementioned, the
more restrictive shall govern.
   (a)   Layout. The layout of proposed streets shall provide for the
continuation of existing streets in surrounding areas and/or shall conform to a
plan for the neighborhood approved by the Village Planning Commission in cases
where topographical or other conditions preclude the continuation of existing
streets. In general, such streets shall be of a width as great as that of the
street so extended. Due consideration shall be given to traffic safety. Due
consideration shall be given to the subdivider to the attractiveness of the
street layout in order to obtain the maximum livability and amenity of the
subdivisions. Consideration shall also be given to the proposed use of the
subdivision and proper allowance made in commercial and industrial
subdivisions, for potential and existing railroad right-of-way as conditions
will permit. Any intersection occurring on a street which crosses a railroad
track shall not be less than 400 feet from the nearest railroad right-of-way.
Greater distances may be required if it is deemed necessary for safety,
approach gradients or future grade separations.
   (b)   Major Streets. Where the subdivision abuts or contains an existing or
proposed major street, the Village Planning Commission may, at its discretion,
require the construction of marginal access streets, double frontage of lots
with provision of a screen planting contained in a no-access reservation along
the rear property lines, deep lots with rear service alleys, or other treatment
which the said Commission considers essential to adequate protection of
residential lots and to separation of through and local traffic.
   (c)   Private Streets. Private streets and alleys shall not be permitted,
but rather all streets and alleys shall be dedicated to the public.
   (d)   Access to Property. Each residential lot within a subdivision shall be
provided with a satisfactory means of access. Building permits shall not be
issued for the construction of buildings, which do not have access onto a
public street. All lots must have frontage on a public street. There shall be
no reserve strips controlling access to a street, except where the control of
such is definitely placed with the Village Council. Driveways and curb cuts
shall conform to the Road Commission for Oakland County standards and the
Village of Wolverine Lake engineering standards.
   (e)   Intersections. Intersecting streets shall be laid out so that the
intersection angles are ninety degrees. Deviations from this may be considered
by the Village Engineer. No more than two streets shall cross at one
intersection.
   (f)   Visibility. No fence, wall, structure, or planting shall be erected,
established or maintained on any corner lot which will obstruct the sight
distance of the driver of a vehicle approaching the intersection. The minimum
clearance of any overhanging portion of a tree thereof shall be ten feet over
sidewalks and fourteen feet over all streets.
   (g)   Half-street. Half-streets shall not be permitted where a subdivision
adjoins underdeveloped property, except for such major streets as may be
recommended in the Village general development plan or by the Road Commission
for Oakland County. They shall be permitted only when the Village Planning
Commission considers the use of a half-street essential to the reasonable
development of the subdivision in accordance with the intent of these
regulations and where said Commission finds it practicable to require the
dedication of the other half of the right-of-way when the adjoining property is
subdivided. Wherever there already exists a dedicated and recorded half-street
or half alley on an adjoining plat, the other half shall be dedicated on the
proposed plat to make the street or alley complete. A one-foot reserve may be
required to be placed between a half-street and the subdivision boundaries.
This reserve shall be designated as an outlot and shall be deeded in fee simple
to the Village at such time as the Village so requests in writing.
   (h)   Street Jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet
shall be avoided. Where streets intersect major streets, their alignment shall
be continuous.
   (i)   Cul-de-sac and Cul-de-sac Streets. Where required for the full and
best utilization of the property, cul-de-sacs may be utilized. The maximum
permissible length of cul-de-sacs streets shall be 500 feet measured from the
right-of-way line of the nearest intersecting street to the farthest point on
the right-of-way.
   (j)   Dead-end Streets. Dead-end streets shall be permitted only in cases
where the Village Planning Commission is of the opinion that there is a
reasonable expectation that such streets will be extended to a suitable outlet
when the adjacent property is platted. If the Commission permits the platting
of dead-end streets with the expectation of such future extension, the
Commission shall determine whether the subdivider shall provide a temporary
turnaround at the closed end of the street. A one-foot reserve may be required
to be placed at the end of a dead-end street, which terminates at subdivision
boundaries. This reserve shall be designated as an outlot and shall be deeded
in fee simple to the Village at such time as the Village so requests in
writing.
   (k)   Alleys. Alleys shall not be permitted in residential areas, but may be
permitted or required in commercial or industrial areas for the purpose of
service access, such as for off-street parking and loading. All such alleys
shall have a minimum width of twenty-six feet. A diagonal cut-off shall be made
at all acute and right-angle intersections of two alleys sufficient to provide
an inside turning radius of thirty feet.
   (l)   Street Names. Street names shall not be permitted which might cause
confusion with names of existing streets in or near the Village of Wolverine
Lake. Streets that will be continuations of existing streets shall be called by
the same names as such existing streets. All names shall be approved by the
Village Planning Commission, the Fire Chief, and the Road Commission for
Oakland County.
   (m)   Building Lines and Setback Lines. Building lines shall conform to the
requirements of the Village zoning ordinance.
   (n)   Right-of-ways Width. Minimum right-of-way width shall be sixty-six
feet. Greater right-of-way widths for major streets as required by the Road
Commission for Oakland County or designated on the Village development plan may
be required as necessary.
 
Type of Street                             Right-of-Way Width
Major Streets                              86' (no on-street parking)
Collector Streets                          66' (no on-street parking)
Local Streets                              66'
Local Streets in an Industrial Subdivision 66"
   (o)   Horizontal Alignment. The centerline of pavement shall coincide with
the centerline of right-of-way, except for roads with irregular right-of-way
widths and with the approval of the Village Planning Commission.
   (p)   Street Grades and Curvature. Horizontal and vertical alignment shall
be provided on all proposed streets.
   (q)   Radii at Intersections. Minimum edge of pavement or curb radii shall
be uniform at intersections and shall be forty feet at intersections of major
streets, thirty-five feet at intersections with collector streets and twenty-
five feet on local streets.
   (r)   Surface Drainage. Surface drainage and detention shall be provided in
accordance with the Village of Wolverine Lake engineering standards. In the
event it is found to be essential to the economical development of substantial
portions of a project, drainage easements may be permitted.
   (s)   Street Drainage. All streets and alleys shall be provided with
facilities for adequate surface drainage. Storm drains shall be underground and
only curb-type design shall be permitted. Plans for such drainage shall be
approved by the Village Engineer.
   (t)   Other Required Streets. Where a subdivision borders on or contains a
railroad right-of-way or a limited access highway right-of-way, the Planning
Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on one or both
sides of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of
the intervening land (such as for park purposes in residential areas, or the
commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts). Such distances
shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach
grades and future grade separations.
   (u)   Streets Standards and Specifications. Streets and roads shall be
provided in accordance with the street and road standards adopted by the
Michigan Department of Transportation, the Road Commission for Oakland County,
and the Village of Wolverine Lake.
(Ord. 106-A86. Passed 4-9-14.)
1222.13 PEDESTRIAN WAYS.
   A right-of-way for pedestrian crosswalks in the middle of long blocks may be
required where necessary to obtain convenient pedestrian circulation to
schools, parks or shopping areas. They shall be placed in locations with
appropriate sight distance as certified by an engineer. The right-of-way shall
be at least ten feet wide and extend entirely through the block. Appropriate
signing and pavement markings shall be provided.
   (a)   Sidewalks. Sufficient right-of-way shall be provided so that sidewalks
may be installed on both sides of all streets. Access easements may be required
should the sidewalks be installed outside of the public right-of-way.
(Ord. 106-A86. Passed 4-9-14.)
1222.14 UTILITY AND OTHER EASEMENTS.
   A subdivider shall contact the Village of Wolverine Lake for preferred
locations of utilities. Water main and sanitary sewer service shall be placed
within public right-of-way, except with written approval of Village staff and
Village Council. If public utilities are placed outside of the public right-of-
way, easements shall be granted in accordance with the Village of Wolverine
Lake engineering standards. All public utilities within the subdivision shall
be underground. Storm sewer, drainage and surface drainage easements shall be
provided along sewers, any natural water course, drainage ditch, channel or
stream. Such easements shall be of adequate width for the particular conditions
of the site. The subdivider shall work with private utilities to determine the
placement of such utilities and easements.
(Ord. 106-A86. Passed 4-9-14.)
1222.15 LOTS.
   The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the
location of the subdivision as for the type of development and use
contemplated. Lots shall be of such size as to permit a variety of house types,
to provide side yards for desirable access, light, air, privacy, and safety
from fire hazard, and to provide for setbacks from the street line and allow
sufficient space for household purposes. All lots shall conform to the
requirements of the Village zoning ordinance. All lots, when developed, shall
be connected to Village sewer and water systems.
   (a)   Area. The width and depth of lots shall be such that the minimum lot
areas will be in accordance with the adopted Village of Wolverine Lake Zoning
Ordinance.
   (b)   Width. The minimum width of any lot shall be sixty feet, except that
greater widths may be required in the zoning ordinance. Where desirable to plat
wedge-shaped lots so as to best utilize a parcel of land, the required lot
width shall be measured at a line located twenty-five feet from the front of
property line.
   (c)   Depth. No lot shall be less than 120 feet in depth. The depth of a lot
should not exceed a depth to width ratio of 2½ to 1.
   (d)   Side Lot Lines. Side property lines of lots shall generally be
perpendicular to straight lines or radial to curved street line unless a
variation from this rule will give a better lot plan. Property lines on sides
and rear of lots should be straight.
   (e)   Corner lots shall have extra width to permit appropriate building
setbacks from both streets. If the zoning ordinance does not require a greater
width, this ordinance shall control in which case the corner lot should be ten
to twenty percent wider than minimum interior lots. Lots abutting a pedestrian
mid-block crosswalk shall be treated as corner lots unless the width of the
crosswalk right-of-way is not less than one-third of the width of the street
right-of-way that the crosswalk intersects.
   (f)   Lots shall not open or face directly onto a freeway right-of-way, an
arterial street or other heavily traveled street, shopping centers, or other
large nonresidential area. In such situations, lots shall be laid out in one of
the following ways:
      (1)   Lots can back onto the above features, but shall be separated
therefrom by a permanent fence or wall and a twenty-foot wide landscaped strip
along the rear property line. The twenty-foot wide strip shall not be
considered part of the lot's minimum length or area. The landscaping shall be
such as to create a screen to insure the privacy of each lot.
      (2)   Lots may face onto a marginal access street. Such a street shall be
separated from the right-of-way of the main street or the edge of the
nonresidential area by a landscaped median strip not less than twenty feet
wide. The median may be dedicated to the governing body or other appropriate
public agency.
      (3)   Lots may be faced onto intersecting streets with driveways opening
onto the intersecting streets. These corner lots, which abut the major street
right-of-way or the non-residential area, shall each have the twenty-foot wide
landscape strip as required in subsection (f)(2) of this section. Where the
landscaped strip abuts a residential street at a major street right-of-way, a
clear vision (sight) easement shall be designated on the plat.
      (4)   Lots may be grouped around short cul-de-sac or loop streets, which
open onto the major street. In such situations, the corner lots abutting the
major street right-of-way shall each contain the landscaped strip required in
Chapter 1270.
      (5)   The layout of lots, whichever method is used, is intended to
restrict the number of access points to the major streets and thereby reduce
the number of traffic hazard points and preserve the traffic carrying capacity
of the major street and to protect each lot's privacy and its freedom from
noise and litter. Any landscaped strip required above shall not be part of the
normal road right-of-way or utility easement, but be designated as an outlot.
   (g)   Business or Commercial Lots. No lot or parcel within a plat classified
as business or commercial shall be platted that is less than 200 feet in width,
nor less than one acre in area, nor shall it exceed four acres or ten percent
of the total planned acreage to be developed whichever is greater. Exceptions
to the above may be approved by the Planning Commission. Off-street parking and
loading shall be in accordance with the requirements of the zoning ordinance.
   (h)   Lot Division. The division of a lot in a recorded plat is prohibited,
unless approved following application to the Village Council. The application
shall be filed with the Village Clerk, and shall state the reasons for the
proposed division. The resulting lots shall be not less in area than permitted
by the Village of Wolverine Lake zoning ordinance. No building permit shall be
issued, or any building construction commenced, until the division has been
approved by the Village Council and the suitability of the land for building
sites has been approved by the county. The division of a lot resulting in a
smaller area than prescribed herein may be permitted, but only for the purpose
of adding to the existing building site or sites. The application shall so
state and shall be in affidavit form.
   (i)   Division of Unplatted Parcel. The division of unplatted land shall
conform to the Village land division ordinance.
(Ord. 106-A86. Passed 4-9-14.)
1222.16 BLOCKS.
   The size and shape of blocks shall be appropriate for the type of lots and
land use proposed. Blocks shall be designed so as to permit good lot
orientation, safe street design and economical use of the land.
   (a)   Length. Length of blocks between intersecting streets shall normally
be from 800 to 1,000 feet. This form shall be altered only where the topography
of the land makes it advisable to do so in order to protect the public safety
and convenience, and in no event should blocks be less than 500 feet or more
than 1,300 feet in length. In blocks exceeding 800 feet in length, the Planning
Commission may require the reservation of a twenty-foot wide easement through
the block to provide for the crossing of underground utilities and pedestrian
traffic of ten feet wide for pedestrian traffic only where needed or desirable,
and may specify further, at its discretion, the five-foot wide paved footpath
be provided by the proprietor. Blocks intended for non-residential purposes
shall be especially designed for such purposes, and in accordance with zoning
ordinance provisions. In such cases, the above dimensions do not apply.
   (b)   Arrangement. A block shall be so designed as to provide two tiers of
lots, except where lots back into an arterial street, natural feature or
subdivision boundary.
   (c)   Non-residential Blocks. Blocks intended for purposes other than
residential shall be especially designed for such purposes and shall have
adequate provision for off-street parking and loading in accordance with the
requirements of the zoning ordinance.
(Ord. 106-A86. Passed 4-9-14.)
1222.17 USES.
   (a)   Control. No property shall be subdivided for residential use if such
is considered unsuitable for building purposes by existing State of Michigan
Local Ordinance and Statutes. Restrictions. Wherever property is subdivided
with the intention that it shall have a use different than that designed in the
zoning ordinance, such use shall be stated in an application for an amendment
to the zoning ordinance in a separate statement filed with the Planning
Commission. Conformance with the objectives of the Village general development
plan shall be required so as to insure general uniformity of land uses within
blocks and neighborhoods.
   (b)   Conformance with Zoning Ordinance. Property use and area restrictions
must be in accordance with the zoning ordinance.
   (c)   Land Subject to Flooding. Any area of land within the proposed
subdivision which is subject to flooding or inundation by storm water shall be
clearly shown on final plat. Such land shall not be platted for residential
occupancy, or for such uses as may increase danger to health, life or property,
or unduly aggravate the flood hazard. No building shall be placed within the
100-year floodplain. Any earth change within the 100-year floodplain shall only
be allowed with permission of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.
(Ord. 106-A86. Passed 4-9-14.)
1222.18 OPEN SPACES.
   In the design of the plat, thorough and equitable consideration shall be
given by the subdivider and the Planning Commission for the provision of
suitable sites for recreation; including tot lots, both active and passive
recreation areas, schools, and for other public purposes. The area reserved for
recreation shall be provided for all plats having twenty or more residential
dwelling units the size of such reserved area for recreation shall be no less
than 300 feet by 300 feet or 90,000 square feet. This reserved area shall be
increased in size by 200 square feet for each residential dwelling unit in the
development exceeding thirty dwelling units.
(Ord. 106-A86. Passed 4-9-14.)
1222.19 COMMERCIAL OR INDUSTRIAL MODIFICATION.
   These subdivision design standards may be modified in accordance with this
chapter in the case of subdivisions specifically for commercial or industrial
development, including shopping district, wholesaling areas, and planned
industrial districts. In all cases, however, adequate provision shall be made
for off-street parking and loading areas as well as for traffic circulation.
(Ord. 106-A86. Passed 4-9-14.)
1222.20 CLUSTER DEVELOPMENTS.
   (a)   Where the zoning ordinance permits, a proposed residential subdivision
may be designed instead as a cluster subdivision for the purpose of creating a
more desirable living environment than is possible under the ordinances as
applied to individual residential lots; encouraging the provision and
maintenance of open space and recreational areas for the residents of the
subdivision; obtaining creativity, variety, efficiency, and economy in the
physical development pattern of the community and their inclusion into the
development pattern of the subdivision and community.
   (b)   The plan for a cluster development shall be submitted in accordance
with the procedures and standards of the ordinance from which this section was
derived.
   (c)   The development must be designed to produce a stable and desirable
residential character. Overall densities shall not exceed those permitted in
appropriate districts in the zoning ordinance. Open space areas shall meet the
standards of open space and recreation areas established in the adopted
comprehensive development plan. The governing body, with advice from the
Planning Commission, shall have the right and responsibility to reject a
proposed cluster development if the open space areas are, in its opinion, of
such size and shape as to be unusable or unmaintainable for open and recreation
purposes. Open space provided under cluster or planned unit development and
retained by the developer or deeded to an association of homeowners shall
remain permanently open for recreation purposes. The open space character of
the area shall be secured by restrictive covenant or other means to protect the
public's interest in maintaining the density of development and open space
character. Such open space and recreation areas shall be set aside as common
land for the sole benefit, use, and enjoyment of the subdivision lot owners,
present, and future. All open space, tree cover areas, where acreage is
utilized in determining the size and extent of common land, shall be included
in the covenant or other measures as permanent open space.
   (d)   Open space in any one cluster development shall be laid out, to the
maximum feasible extent, so as to connect with other open space, existing or
proposed, in the vicinity, whether such areas are or will be public or private.
In the case of two or more adjacent developments, proprietors may cooperatively
allocate open space areas, if such areas are coordinated in design and location
to an extent acceptable to the Planning Commission.
   (e)   Cluster developments shall be laid out so as to reduce the lineal feet
of street for economy and safety that would otherwise be needed to serve the
area; to economize on cost of utility installations; to retain and take
advantage of existing natural features and vistas; to reduce the amount of
grading required; to take maximum advantage of storage, absorption, and
drainage characteristics of the natural landscape; and to otherwise secure the
objectives set forth in this section. In so doing, the minimum lot areas, lot
widths, and other standards may be modified in accordance with the ordinance
from which this section was derived and the Village zoning ordinance.
   (f)   The cluster development shall be laid out so that its development can
be staged in an efficient and economical manner with respect to the opening and
maintenance of new streets, the provision of utilities, access to schools and
other public and private service facilities, and similar considerations.
   (g)   Utility easements may be included in the open space area calculation
only if they are available to residents of the development. The easements may
be landscaped and developed for open space or recreational purposes provided
that the landscaping does not adversely impact the utilities, and are safe for
use by persons engaging in open space and recreation activities.
   (h)   Open drainage courses, suitably graded and stabilized with sod or
other ground cover, and planted with trees, shrubs, and other landscape
materials, and made an integral part of the overall open space and recreation
system may be acceptable, if approved by the Village Engineer and the Village
staff.
   (i)   In cluster subdivisions, the common space shall remain and be
maintained in open space in perpetuity. The proprietor shall insure the
permanence of both the existence and proper maintenance of the open space by
either dedicating it to public agency responsible for areas and activities or
by dedicating it to a homeowner's association to be made up of the residents of
the subdivision. The latter method is, in general, to be preferred.
   (j)   Where homeowner's associations are to be used, the following
conditions shall be met:
      (1)   The association shall be established before dwellings are sold.
      (2)   Membership shall be mandatory for each homebuyer and any successive
buyer.
      (3)   Open space must be held and maintained as open space in perpetuity.
      (4)   The association shall be responsible for local taxes, maintenance
of grounds and facilities, liability insurance, and other similar duties of
ownership. Proprietor shall file declaration of covenants and restrictions with
the preliminary plats, setting forth these and other features of the
association. He shall also supply to the governing body a copy of articles of
incorporation and a complete set of bylaws of the association.
   (k)   The governing body may require that, in addition to the restrictive
covenants and the homeowner's association, an easement over the open space area
be given to the public to insure that the area will remain open in perpetuity.
Such an easement is intended only to preserve open space, and is not intended
to provide public access thereto.
(Ord. 106-A86. Passed 4-9-14.)
1222.21 COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENTS.
   (a)   Where commercial developments such as shopping centers, or office
parks fall within the definition of subdivision as set forth in Act 288, P.A.
1967, as amended, such development shall conform to all provisions of the
ordinance from which this section was derived that may be reasonably applied.
Such development shall conform to all zoning ordinance requirements.
   (b)   In addition to other requirements of the ordinance from which this
section was derived, the plan shall show the basic building pattern to be
constructed and the general pattern of tenants or types of stores and shops.
The parking and circulation pattern shall be clearly delineated and shall be
designed so that the circulation system is safe and convenient to customers,
can be used with a minimum of congestion, and permits ease of entry and exit
from parking spaces. Parking traffic and traffic entry, exit, and general
circulation should be separated (but interconnected) to the maximum feasible
extent. Trucking and other service traffic should have its separate circulation
pattern. Traffic entering or leaving parking spaces should be controlled so
that it cannot move in random patterns, but should be channeled into clearly
marked and designed traffic ways. Entry drives shall be so designed and located
so as to be a safe access point, and not to create congestion or hazardous
conditions on the streets serving the center. Traffic ways from parking areas,
in their intersections with entry/exit drives shall be located so as not to
interfere with traffic entering or leaving the center.
   (c)   Parking areas shall be divided into sections and shall be landscaped
by planting boxes with trees and shrubs. Wheel spots or other devices shall be
used to channel traffic movements within the parking bays.
   (d)   Buffer strips, at least twenty feet wide and landscaped, shall be
provided along the perimeter of the center. The Planning Commission may require
provision of a fence, wall, or screen, if it determines such is necessary to
protect the adjacent areas from litter, trespass, and other nuisances. The
Planning Commission may also require a wider buffer strip for community and
regional shopping centers.
   (e)   Landscaping features around the building should be provided pursuant
to the Village of Wolverine Lake Zoning Ordinance.
   (f)   Any intended future expansion should be provided for in the layout of
the initial center and should be shown on the pre-preliminary plat. The area to
be included in the expansion, and all connections thereto shall be indicated on
the preliminary and final plats. Parking areas, utilities, landscaping, etc.,
shall be designed with future expansion in mind.
   (g)   All separate buildings in the center, not connected to the principal
center buildings, such as but not limited to supermarkets, gasoline service
stations, theaters, offices, drive-ins, and facilities, shall be shown on the
plans, along with the circulation and parking patterns to service such
facilities.
   (h)   Pedestrian movement from parking bays to the center and other
buildings should be clearly defined and so laid out as to separate, to the
greatest extent possible, pedestrians from moving vehicles.
(Ord. 106-A86. Passed 4-9-14.)
1222.22 RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS.
   (a)   Covenants designed to preserve the character of the subdivision and to
help retain its stability, permanence, and marketability are encouraged. Such
covenants should be recorded with the plat and should be blanket covenants that
apply to the entire subdivision. Such covenants are intended to complement the
Village's continuing regulation of the subdivision through its zoning and
building code powers.
   (b)   Blanket covenants may contain items such as, but not limited to, land
use control; architectural control, including walls and fences as well as
buildings; yards and setback requirements; minimum lot size; prohibition of
nuisances; regulation of signs; control of type, duration, location, etc., of
temporary buildings or vehicles, such as travel trailers, etc., to be stored on
each site; scenic or open space easements; and other similar controls.
   (c)   Covenants shall be discussed with the Planning Commission during the
initial procedures and/or preliminary plat stages and shall be coordinated with
existing or anticipated police power controls.
   (d)   Covenants shall be recorded prior to the sale of any lot within the
subdivision. The Village Council has authority to enforce covenants as
conferred by the Land Division Act, Act 288, 1967, as amended.

(Ord. 106-A86. Passed 4-9-14.)
1222.28 VARIANCES - GENERAL.
   The Village Planning Commission may recommend to the Village Council a
variance from the provisions of the ordinance from which this section was
derived on a finding that undue hardship may result from strict compliance with
specific provisions or requirements of the ordinance from which this section
was derived or that application of such provision or requirement is
impracticable. The Planning Commission shall only recommend variances that it
deems necessary to or desirable for the public interest. In making its
findings, as required herein below, the Planning Commission shall take into
account the nature of the proposed use of land and the existing use of land in
the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the proposed
subdivision, the impact to public utilities and area drainage, and the probable
effect of the proposed work in the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions
in the vicinity. No variance shall be recommended unless the Planning
Commission finds after a public hearing:
   (a)   That there are such special circumstances or conditions affecting said
property that the strict application of the provisions of the ordinance from
which this section was derived would clearly be impracticable or unreasonable.
In such cases, the subdivider shall first state his reasons in writing as to
the specific provision or requirement involved and submit them to the Planning
Commission;
   (b)   That the granting of the specified variance will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which said
property is situated;
   (c)   That such variance will not violate the provisions of the State Land
Division Act, Act 288, 1967, as amended;
   (d)   The Planning Commission shall include its findings and the specific
reasons therefore in its report of recommendations to the Village Council and
shall also record its reasons and actions in its minutes;
   (e)   That such variance will not have the effect of nullifying the interest
and purpose of the ordinance from which this section was derived and the
general development plan of the Village.
(Ord. 106-A86. Passed 4-9-14.)
1222.29 TOPOGRAPHICAL/PHYSICAL LIMITATION VARIANCE.
   Where in the case of a particular proposed subdivision, it can be shown that
strict compliance with the requirements of the ordinance from which this
section was derived would result in extraordinary hardship to the subdivider
because of unusual topography, other physical conditions, or other such
conditions which are not self-inflicted, or that these conditions would result
in inhibiting the achievement of the objectives of the ordinance from which
this section was derived, the Planning Commission may recommend to the Village
Council that variance modification or a waiver of these requirements be granted
contingent upon the following:
   (a)   The proposed project will constitute a desirable and stable community
development.
   (b)   The proposed project will be in harmony with adjacent areas.
(Ord. 106-A86. Passed 4-9-14.)
1222.30 SCHEDULE OF FEES.
   The schedule of fees for subdivision plat shall be as follows:
   (a)   Application Fees. Pre-preliminary, preliminary and final plat review
fees, planning fees, engineering fees, attorney fees, inspection fees and other
applicable development charges shall be paid by the subdivider/developer as may
be provided for as follows, or by other ordinances of the Village. The
subdivider/developer shall, upon first submission of a pre-preliminary plat pay
to the Village Clerk a fee as listed in a fee schedule adopted by the Village
Council. There shall be an additional fee as listed in a fee schedule adopted
by the Village Council.
   (b)   Engineering Review Fees. Such fees shall be established by resolution
of the Village Council.

which this section was derived, whether such person be the agent of the owner
of the property, shall be fined not to exceed the sum of one hundred dollars
($100.00), and the cost of the prosecution or by imprisonment for not more than
ninety days or both, at the discretion of the court. Each day such violation
shall exist shall constitute a separate offense. Furthermore, all persons shall
be subject to the penalties set forth in the State Land Division Act, Act 288,
1967, as amended.
(Ord. 106-A86. Passed 4-9-14.)

1240.01 TITLE.
   This Title Four – Zoning, of Part Twelve – the Planning and Zoning Code,
shall be known and may be cited, and referred to as the "Village of Wolverine
Lake Zoning Code" and shall be referred to throughout this Title Four as this
Zoning Code.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1240.02 AUTHORITY; PURPOSE; INTENT.
   (a)   This Zoning Code is hereby adopted pursuant to the authority conferred
by the Public Acts of the State of Michigan with the purpose of promoting and
protecting the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare
of the people. The fulfillment of this purpose is to be accomplished by
seeking:
      (1)   To meet needs for places of residence, recreation, industry, trade,
service, and other uses of land.
      (2)   To ensure that uses of the land shall be situated in appropriate
locations and relationships.
      (3)   To limit inappropriate overcrowding of the land and congestion of
population, transportation systems, and other public facilities.
      (4)   To facilitate adequate and efficient provision for transportation
systems, sewage disposal, water, energy, education, recreation, and other
public facility and service needs.
      (5)   To establish adequate standards for the provision of light, air,
and open spaces.
      (6)   To zone all properties with a view to conserving the value of
buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the
community.
      (7)   To protect residential, commercial, and industrial uses alike from
harmful encroachment by incompatible uses and to ensure that land allocated to
a class of uses shall not be usurped by other inappropriate uses.
      (8)   To provide for adequate drainage, curbing of erosion, and reduction
of flood damage.
      (9)   To fix reasonable standards to which buildings and structures shall
conform.
      (10)   To prevent such additions to, and alterations or remodeling of,
existing buildings or structures as would not comply with the restrictions and
limitations imposed herein.
      (11)   To isolate or control the location of unavoidable nuisance
producing uses.
      (12)   To define the powers and duties of the administrative and
enforcement officers and bodies.
      (13)   To prescribe penalties for any violation of the provisions of this
Zoning Code, or of any amendment thereto.
   (b)   The standards and requirements contained in this Zoning Code, and the
district mapping reflected on the Village of Wolverine Lake Zoning Map, are
intended to further the implementation of the objectives of the Land Use Plan,
as well as protect all desirable existing structures and uses.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1240.03 INTERPRETATION; CONFLICTS OF LAW.
   (a)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Zoning
Code shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the
public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (b)   Where the conditions imposed by any provisions of this Zoning Code,
upon the use of land or buildings or upon the bulk of buildings, are either
more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any
other provision of this Zoning Code or of any other law, ordinance, resolution,
rule, or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive or
which impose higher standards or requirements shall govern.
   (c)   Although the district requirements are very specific in most
instances, reasonable flexibility is offered through such devices as
conditional use, planned development, floor area ratio, and variances. A
principal objective of this Zoning Code is the encouragement of appropriate
innovation.
   (d)   This Zoning Code is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant,
or other private agreement, provided that where the regulations of this Zoning
Code are more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements than such
easements, covenants, or other private agreements, the requirements of this
Zoning Code shall govern.
   (e)   No building, structure, or use which was not lawfully existing at the
time of the adoption of this Zoning Code shall become or be made lawful solely
by reason of the adoption of this Zoning Code; and to the extent that, and in
any manner that, said unlawful building, structure, or use is in conflict with
the requirements of this Zoning Code, said building, structure, or use remains

the regulations of this Zoning Code, unless it shall make findings based upon
the evidence presented to it in each specific case that all of the following
standards are met:
      (1)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship will result to the owner if the strict letter of the regulations are
carried out. Inconveniences or increased development costs shall not be deemed
hardships under the terms of this section.
      (2)   The conditions upon which an application for a variance is based
are unique to the property for which the variance is sought, and are not
applicable generally, or to other property within the same zoning
classification.
      (3)   The purpose of the variance is not based exclusively upon a desire
to increase financial gain.
      (4)   The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this Zoning Code
and has not been created by any persons presently or previously having an
interest in the property.
      (5)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in
which the property is located.
      (6)   The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion of the
public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or
substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
   (d)   Conditions. The Zoning Board of Appeals may impose such conditions and
restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variance as may be necessary to
comply with the standards established in this section and the objectives of
this Zoning Code.
   (e)   Compliance With State Laws; Time Limit. Variances from the regulations
of this Zoning Code shall be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals only in
accordance with the standards established in Act 638 of the Public Acts of
1978,as amended, and the City and Village Zoning Act.
   No order of the Zoning Board of Appeals granting a variance shall be valid
for a period longer than six months from the date of such order unless the
building permit is obtained within such period and the erection or alteration
of a building is started or the use is commenced within such period.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81; Ord. 106A-83. Passed 4-9-14.)

   An appeal from any decision or action of the Building Inspector shall be
taken not later than thirty days after the start of construction or alterations
or a change in use authorized by any permit or certificate issued by the
Building Inspector, or within 30 days after the decision or the action
complained of, by filing with the Building Inspector and the Board a notice of
appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Building Inspector shall forthwith
transmit to the Board all of the papers constituting a record upon which the

complained of, by filing with the Planning Commission and the Zoning Board of
Appeals a notice specifying the grounds thereof.
   Decisions or actions of the Building Inspector to deny issuance of building
permits or certificates of occupancy based on denial of special land use
approval by the Planning Commission shall be subject to appeal.
   (b)   Stay of Proceedings. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from unless the Building Inspector certifies
to the Board, after the notice of the appeal has been filed with him or her,
that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his or her
opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property, in which case the
proceedings shall not be stayed unless otherwise by a court of record on
application, on notice of the Building Inspector and on due cause shown.
   (c)   Public Hearing. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public
hearing on all appeals. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing

the occupants of single- and two-family dwellings within 300 feet. Such notice
shall be delivered personally or by mail addressed to the respective owners at
the address given in the last assessment roll. If a tenant's name is not known,
the term “occupant” may be used.
   (d)   Decisions of the Zoning Board of Appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals
shall thereafter reach its decision within ninety days from the date of the
public hearing on the appeal. The decision of the board shall not become final
until the expiration of five days from the date of the entry of such order
unless the Board shall find the immediate effect of such order is necessary for
the preservation of property or personal rights and shall so certify on the
record.
   (e)   Disposition of Appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals may affirm or may
reverse, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or
determination of the Building Inspector or the Planning Commission as specified

1242.07 AMENDMENTS
   (a)   Purposes. For the purposes of promoting the public health, safety, and
general welfare, conserving the value of property throughout the community, and
lessening or avoiding congestion in the public streets and highways, the
Village Council may, from time to time, in the manner hereinafter set forth,
amend the regulations imposed in the districts created by this Zoning Code or
amend district boundary lines, provided that in all amendatory ordinances
adopted under the authority of this section, due allowance shall be made for
existing conditions, the conservation of property values, the direction of
building development to the best advantage of the entire community, and the
uses to which property is devoted at the time of the adoption of such
amendatory ordinance.
   (b)   Initiation of Amendment. Text amendments may be proposed by any
governmental body or any interested person or organization. Map amendments may
be initiated by any governmental body or by persons having a freehold interest
in the subject property, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive
possession, a contractual interest which may become a freehold interest or an
exclusive possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, a contractual
interest which may become a freehold interest or an exclusive possessory
interest and which is specifically enforceable.
   (c)   Application for Amendment. An application for an amendment to this
Zoning Code shall be filed with the Building Inspector in such form and
accompanied by such information as required by the Building Inspector. The
Building Inspector, upon receiving an application for amendment, shall transmit
the application, along with all pertinent data filed therewith, to the Planning
Commission.
   (d)   Hearing on Application. The Planning Commission shall hold at least
one public hearing on each application for an amendment at such time and place
as shall be established by the Planning Commission. The hearings shall be
conducted and a record of such proceedings shall be preserved in such manner as
the Planning Commission shall, by rule, prescribe from time to time, or as may
be required by Charter.
   (e)   Notice of Hearing. Not less than fifteen days before the date the
application will be considered at the public hearing, notice of such hearing
shall be published at least once in the official newspaper or a newspaper of
general circulation within the Village. If an individual property or several
adjacent properties are proposed for rezoning, notice of the hearing shall be

      (3)   State when and where the application will be considered.
      (4)   Indicate when and where written comments will be received
concerning the application.
   (f)   Findings of Fact and Recommendation of the Planning Commission. The
Planning Commission shall make written findings of fact and shall submit the
same together with its recommendations to the Village Council. Where the
purpose and effect of the proposed amendment is to change the zoning
classification of particular property, the Planning Commission shall make
findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case with
respect to the following matters:
      (1)   Existing uses of property within the general area of the property
in question.
      (2)   The zoning classification of property within the general area of
the property in question.
      (3)   The suitability of the property in question to the uses permitted
under the existing zoning classification.
      (4)   The trend of development, if any, in the general area of the
property in question, including changes, if any, which have taken place in its
present zoning classification.
      (5)   The objectives of the Village of Wolverine Lake Land-Use Plan.
   The Planning Commission shall not recommend the adoption of a proposed
amendment unless it finds that the adoption of such amendment is not
detrimental to the public interest. The Planning Commission may recommend the
adoption of an amendment changing the zoning classification of the property in
question to any higher classification than that requested by the applicant. For
the purpose of this section, the order of classification shall be as follows
with the R1-A District being highest, and the C-3 the lowest: R1-A, R1-B, R1-
LF, RM-1, PL, P-1, O-1, C-1, C-2, and C-3.
   (g)   Action by the Village Council.
      (1)   The Village Council shall not act upon a proposed amendment to this
Zoning Code until it shall have received a written report and recommendation
from the Planning Commission on the proposed amendment.
      (2)   The Village Council may grant or deny any application for an
amendment provided, however, that in case of a written protest against any
proposed amendment of the regulations or districts, signed and acknowledged by
the owners of twenty percent of the area of land to be altered, or by the
owners of twenty percent of the area of land included within an area extending
outward 100 feet from any point on the boundary of the land included in the
proposed change, such amendment shall not be passed except by a vote of three-
fourths, of the Village Council.
   (h)   Effect of Denial of Amendment. No application for a map amendment
which has been denied by the Village Council shall be resubmitted for a period
of two years from the date of the order of denial, except on the grounds of new
evidence or proof of change of condition found to be valid by the Planning
Commission and the Village Council.
    (i)   Notice of Adoption. Following adoption of a Zoning Code amendment by
the Village Council, one notice of adoption shall be published in a newspaper
of general circulation in the Village of Wolverine Lake within fifteen days
after adoption. The notice shall include the following information:
      (1)   Either a summary of the regulatory effect of the amendment
including the geographic area affected, or the text of the amendment.
      (2)   The effective date of the Zoning Code amendment.
      (3)   The place and time where a copy of the Zoning Code may be purchased
or inspected.
   (j)   Conditional Rezoning of Land. As an alternative to a rezoning
amendment as described in subsections (a) through (i) hereof; the Village may
allow conditional rezoning to help ensure the proper use of land and natural
resources and to allow for a more flexible approach to the rezoning process in
accordance with Public Act 110 of 2006 (MCL 125.3101 et seq.). It is recognized
that, in certain instances, it would be an advantage to both the Village and
petitioners seeking rezoning of land if a site plan, along with conditions and
limitations that may be relied upon by the Village, could be proposed as part
of a petition for rezoning. Conditional rezoning of land must follow the
standards and procedures as noted below.
      (1)   The amendment procedure for a conditional rezoning shall follow the
same procedure as a traditional rezoning amendment pursuant to this section.
      (2)   In addition to the procedures as noted in this section, the
following specific procedures, standards, and requirements shall apply to all
proposed conditional rezoning requests.
         A.   A conditional rezoning request must be voluntarily offered by an
owner of land within the Village. All offers must be made in writing and must
provide the specific conditions to be considered by the Village as a part of
the rezoning request. All offers shall be in the form of a written agreement
approvable by the Village and property owner, incorporating the conditional
rezoning site plan and setting forth any conditions and terms mutually agreed
upon by the parties relative to the land for which the conditional rezoning is
sought.
         B.   Conditional rezoning shall not allow a use or activity that would
not otherwise be allowed in the proposed zoning district.
         C.   Conditional rezoning shall not alter any of the various zoning
requirements for the uses in question, i.e., parking, landscaping, lot area,
lot width, building height, setbacks, lot area coverage, etc. Conditional
rezoning shall not grant zoning variances of any kind. Any zoning variance must
follow the provisions of
Chapter 1244.
         D.   Conditional rezoning shall not grant special land use approval.
The process for review and approval of special land uses must follow the
provisions of
Chapter 1274.
         E.   All conditions offered by a land owner in relation to a rezoning
request must have a direct relationship to the rezoning itself. The provisions
to allow conditional rezoning shall not be construed to allow rezoning by
exaction.
         F.   In addition to the informational requirements provided for in
section 36-461 the applicant must provide a conditional rezoning site plan
prepared by a licensed professional allowed to prepare such plans under this
chapter, that may show the location, size, height or other measures for and/or
of buildings, structures, improvements and features, including natural features
on, and in some cases adjacent to, the property that is the subject of the
conditional rezoning of land. The details to be offered for inclusion in the
conditional rezoning site plan shall be determined by the applicant, subject to
approval of the Village. A conditional rezoning site plan shall not replace the
requirement under this chapter for site plan review and approval, or
subdivision or site condominium approval, as the case may be.
      (3)   Time limits and reversion of land to previous district.
         A.   If the proposed conditions of rezoning are acceptable to the
Village, the Village may establish a time period during which the conditions
apply to the property and must be met. If the conditions are not satisfied
within the time specified under this section, the property shall revert to its
former zoning classification unless an extension is granted as noted below.
Reversion of a property back to its former classification must follow the
rezoning amendment provisions as provided in subsections (a) through (i)
hereof.
         B.   Unless a reversion of the zoning takes place as described in
subsections (a) through (i) hereof, the approved conditional rezoning shall be
binding upon the subject property owner, his heirs, successors, assigns, and
transferees.
         C.   Upon approval of a conditional rezoning, a copy of the written
agreement between the property owner and Village shall be filed with the county
register of deeds, which shall act to provide notice to all subsequent owners
of the property of the conditions approved and agreed to by the Village.
         D.   The Village may not add to or alter any conditions approved as a
part of a rezoning during the time period specified above.
         E.   The time limits specified and approved by the Village may be
extended upon the application of the landowner and approval of the Village.
      (4)   Review procedures. The factors found in subsection (f) hereof must
be considered in any conditional rezoning request.

11-14-07; Ord. 106A-83. Passed 4-9-14.)
1242.08 SITE DESIGN REVIEW.
   For all structures except single-family detached and two-family residential
structures, site design review and approval shall be obtained from the Planning
Commission before issuance of a building permit. Site design review shall be
carried out by the Planning Commission in accordance with the provisions of
Chapters 1270 and
1272.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1242.09 SPECIAL LAND USES.

before issuance of a building permit for any special land use. Special land-use
approval shall be granted by the Planning Commission in accordance with the
provisions of
Chapter 1274.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1242.10 FEES.
   Any application for an amendment to the text of this Zoning Code, or for
appeals, variances, special land-use approval, site-plan review and approval
shall be accompanied by a fee as established by resolution of the Village
Council.
   There shall be no fee, however, in the case of applications filed in the
public interest by the Village or any Village official.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1242.99 PENALTY.
   Any person who violates any provision of this Zoning Code is responsible for
a municipal civil infraction, subject to payment of a civil fine as specified
in Section
202.99 of the Administration Code, plus costs and other sanctions, for each
infraction. Repeat offenses shall be subject to increased fines as provided in
Section
202.99. In addition, any violation of the terms of this Zoning Code shall be
and the same is hereby declared to be a nuisance per se and the Village, by and
through its proper officers and agents, shall have the authority and power by
proper court procedure to maintain and conduct legal action for the abatement
of such violation.

§ 125.3607
1244.01 ESTABLISHMENT; COMPOSITION; TERM; VACANCIES; ALTERNATES AND MEMBERSHIP.
   There is hereby established a Zoning Board of Appeals, which shall perform
its duties and exercise its powers as provided in Article VI of Act 110 of the
Public Acts of 2006 and in such a way that the objectives of this Zoning Code
shall be observed, public safety secured, and substantial justice done. The
Board shall consist of seven members appointed by the Village Council, one of
whom shall be a member of the Planning Commission. Each appointment shall be
for a period of three years, with the exception of the Planning Commission
Liaison, which shall be appointed annually. Each member of the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall have been a resident of the Village for at least one year prior
to the date of his or her appointment and shall be a qualified and registered
elector of the Village on such day and throughout his or her tenure of office.
A member of the Zoning Board of Appeals may be removed by the Village Council
for misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office upon written charges and
after public hearing. A member shall disqualify himself or herself from a vote
in which the member has a conflict of interest. Failure of a member to
disqualify himself or herself from a vote in which the member has a conflict of
interest constitutes malfeasance in office. Any appointive vacancies in the
Zoning Board of Appeals shall be filled by the Village Council for the
remainder of the unexpired term. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall annually
elect its own Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, and Secretary. The compensation of
the appointed members of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be fixed by the
Village Council.
   The Village Council may appoint not more than two alternate members of the
Board of Appeals. The alternate members may be called on a rotating basis as
determined by the Board of Appeals to sit as regular members of the Board of
Appeals in the absence of a regular member. An alternate member may also be
called to serve in the place of a regular member for the purpose of reaching a
decision on a case in which the regular member has abstained for reasons of
conflict of interest. The alternate member having been appointed shall serve in
the case until a final decision has been made. The alternate member shall have
the same voting rights as a regular member of the Board of Appeals. The first
alternate who is seated as of the date of the adoption of Ordinance 106A-22,
passed February 13, 1991, shall serve as first alternate until December 31,
1991, at which time the first alternate member of the Zoning Board of Appeals
will be appointed for a three-year period and appointments shall be made every
three years thereafter. The second alternate who is seated as of the date of
adoption of Ordinance 106A-22, passed February 13, 1991, shall serve until
December 31, 1992, at which time the second alternate shall be appointed for a
three-year period and shall be appointed thereafter for succeeding three-year
periods.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81; Ord. 106A-14. Passed 7-8-87; Ord. 106A-22. Passed 2-
13-91; Ord. 106-A48. Passed 11-14-07; Ord. 106-A52. Passed 8-12-09.)
1244.02 MEETINGS; MINUTES; QUORUM.
   All meetings of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be held at the call of the
Chairperson and at such times as such Board may determine. All hearings
conducted by said Board shall be open to the public. The Board shall keep
minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each question,
or if absent, or failing to vote, indicating such fact; and shall also keep
records of its hearings and other official action. Five members of the Board
shall constitute a quorum for the conduct of its business. The Board shall have
the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses, administer oaths
and compel testimony and the production of books, papers, files, and other
evidence pertinent to the matters before it.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1244.03 JURISDICTION AND AUTHORITY.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals is hereby vested with the following jurisdiction
and authority:
   (a)   To hear and decide appeals from and review any order, requirement,
decision, or determination made by the Building Inspector or the Planning
Commission under this Zoning Code;
   (b)   To hear and pass upon the applications for variances from the terms
provided in this Zoning Code in the manner prescribed by and subject to the
standards established herein;
   (c)   To hear and decide all matters referred to it or upon which it is
required to pass under this Zoning Code;
   (d)   To authorize, upon an appeal, a non-use (dimensional) variance from
any dimensional standard or requirement of this chapter, such as but not
limited to, density, height, bulk, setback or parking and landscaping
requirements whereby reason of unique physical characteristics a specific piece
of property at the time of enactment of this section or other extraordinary or
exceptional conditions of such property, the strict application of such
regulations if enacted would result in practical difficulties upon the owner of
such property provided such relief may be granted without substantial detriment
to the public good and without substantially impairing the intent and purpose
of this section. In granting a variance, the Board may attach conditions
regarding the location, character, and other features of the proposed uses as
it may deem reasonable in furtherance of the purpose of this section. In
granting a variance, the Board shall state the grounds upon which it justified
the granting of a variance. The Board shall not grant a nonuse variance unless
it shall have made a finding of fact based upon the evidence as presented to it
in each specific case as specified below:
      (1)   Practical difficulties. Compliance with the strict letter of the
restrictions governing area, setbacks, frontage, height, bulk, density or other
dimensional provisions would create practical difficulties, unreasonably
prevent the use of the property for a permitted purpose or render conformity
with such restrictions unnecessarily burdensome. The showing of mere
inconvenience is insufficient to justify a variance. Practical difficulties
include:
         A.   The exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific
property;
         B.   The exceptional topographic or environmental conditions or
manmade constraints or other extraordinary situation on the land, building, or
structure; and
         C.   The use or development of the property immediately adjoining the
property in question; whereby the literal enforcement of the requirements of
this chapter would involve practical difficulties.
      (2)   Substantial justice. Granting of a requested variance or appeal
would do substantial justice to the applicant as well as to other property
owners in the district; or, as an alternative, granting of lesser variance than
requested would give substantial relief to the owner of the property involved
and be more consistent with justice to other property owners.
      (3)   Public safety and welfare. The requested variance or appeal can be
granted in such fashion that the spirit of these regulations will be observed
and public safety and welfare secured.
      (4)   Not self-created. The problem and resulting need for the variance
has not been self-created by the applicant and/or the applicant's immediate
predecessor may or may not be considered depending upon whether the practical
difficulty would have existed regardless of the action.
      (5)   No safety hazard or nuisance. The granting of a variance or appeal
will not increase the hazard of fire or otherwise endanger public safety or
create a public nuisance.
      (6)   Relationship to adjacent land uses. The development permitted upon
granting of a variance shall relate harmoniously in a physical and economic
sense with adjacent land uses and will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood.
   In evaluating this criterion, consideration shall be given to the
established type and pattern of land uses in the area, the natural
characteristics of the site and surrounding area, prevailing shopping patterns,
convenience of access for patrons, continuity of development and the need for
particular services and facilities in specific areas of the Village.
      (7)   Minimum variance necessary. The variance requested is the minimum
necessary to permit reasonable use of the land.
      (8)   Use variances shall not be approved in the Village. A use variance
shall be defined as any variance which permits a use not specifically permitted
by the Zoning Ordinance for the district in which it is located. Any other
variance shall be a dimensional variance.
   (e)   To hear and decide in accordance with the provisions of this section,
requests for interpretations of the Zoning Ordinance and Map, as the Board may
require to preserve and promote the character of the zoning provision or
district in question and otherwise promote the purposes of this section and
those of the Village's Master Plan. Decisions of the Planning Commission
pertaining to special land uses and planned developments shall be subject to
the Zoning Board of Appeals review.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81; Ord. 106-A48. Passed 11-14-07.)
1244.04 NOTICE OF APPEAL/PUBLIC HEARING.
   (a)   Following receipt of a written request concerning a request for a
variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the
hearing of the request and give notice.
   (b)   The Village Clerk's Office shall publish notice of the request for
appeal in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village. Notice shall also
be sent by mail or personal delivery to the owners of property for which the
appeal is being considered. Notice shall also be sent to all persons to whom
real property is assessed within 300 feet of the property and to the occupants
of all structures within 300 feet of the property regardless of whether the
property or occupant is located in the zoning jurisdiction.
   (c)   The notice shall be given not less than fifteen days before the date
the application for appeal will be considered for approval. If the name of the
occupant is not known, the term "occupant" may be used in making notification
under this subsection. The notice shall do all of the following:
      (1)   Describe the nature of the appeal.
      (2)   Indicate the property that is the subject of the appeal. The notice
shall include a listing of all existing street addresses within the property.
Street addresses do not need to be created and listed if no such addresses
currently exist within the property. If there are no street addresses, other
means of identification may be used.
      (3)   State when and where the appeal will be considered.
      (4)   Indicate when and where written comments will be received
concerning the appeal.
(Ord. 106-A48. Passed 11-14-07.)
1244.05 REQUIRED VOTE.
   The concurring vote of a majority of all of the members of the Zoning Board
of Appeals shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or
determination of the Building Inspector, or to decide in favor of the applicant
any matter upon which the Board is required to pass under this Zoning Code,
except that to effect any use variance a concurring vote of five of the members
of the Board shall be necessary.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81; Ord. 106-A48. Passed 11-14-07.)
1244.06 FINALITY OF DECISIONS.

1252.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the RM-1 Multifamily Residential District is to provide for
the development of multifamily housing in suitable areas. Such areas should be
of adequate size to enable establishment of a substantial multiple-family
environment. In general, the RM-1 District is intended for mapping on
individual parcels of at least 15,000 square feet. Preferably, the RM-
1 District should be mapped on parcels which alone or together with other
contiguous multifamily parcels occupy an entire block face or larger area. The
RM-1 District is also intended for mapping on individual parcels which are
located in close proximity to amenities such as public park and open-space
areas or established shopping areas which can conveniently serve the
concentrations of residents which live in multiple-family areas. There is a
limited area available for mapping the RM-1 District; therefore, the RM-
1 District does not provide for the wide range of nonresidential conditional
uses permitted in Single-Family Residential Districts.

1252.08 ALTERNATIVE SITE DESIGN TECHNIQUES.
   Alternative site design techniques may be employed and are encouraged in the
RM-1 Multifamily Residential District upon review and approval by the Planning
Commission and Village Council. The following design techniques are generally
considered preferable, but must be reviewed to determine whether the integrity
of the RM-1 Multifamily Zoning District is not compromised, and that the
health, welfare, and safety of the Village are not at risk:
   (a)   Clustering of the buildings with reduced side yard setbacks to a
minimum of eight feet between buildings to preserve significant open space of
at least forty percent of the site.
   (b)   Curving and meandering the streets and driveways to limit sight
distances, especially from major thoroughfares.
   (c)   Designing side opening garages on fifty percent of the units or
screening parking from the collector roads or primary driveways within the
development.
   (d)   Establishing variable building setbacks from the road and from unit to
unit where applicable to provide variety in aesthetic value.
   (e)   Establishing an architectural façade material and color chart in order
to vary the image of each building and/or each dwelling unit based on the
development pattern of the complex.

1258.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   This chapter sets forth four business districts: the O-1 Office
Business District, the C-l Local Business District, the C-2 Community Shopping
Center District, and the C-3 General Business District. The purpose of these
four districts is to provide for as wide a range of office and commercial uses
as possible while still protecting the quality of the existing residential
environment of the Village. It is the determination of the Wolverine Lake
Village Council that the Village residential environment can best be protected
by limiting business uses to sites which are sufficiently wide and deep to
create a business environment which can function and be perceived as separate
and apart from nearby residential areas. Where sites exist which are not
sufficiently wide and deep, the Council has determined that the residential
environment can best be protected by limiting permitted business uses to those
which serve primarily residents of adjoining neighborhoods or which will have
the least external impact on adjacent residences.
   (b)   The O-1 Office Business District provides for both low-intensity and
higher-intensity office uses, and is intended for mapping in certain locations
adjacent to residential neighborhoods.
   (c)   The C-1 Local Business District provides for the most limited range of
commercial uses. The C-l District is mapped on shallow sites, which back up to
residences. In determining uses for inclusion in the C-1 District, the council
has considered trip-generating characteristics, trade and service area
characteristics, typical hours of operation and other determinants of
neighborhood compatibility. Many uses which would not otherwise be appropriate,
have been provided for in limited numbers or through establishment of special
conditions and design standards.
   (d)   The C-2 Community Shopping Center District provides for a broad range
of business uses, including comparison commercial uses. The C-2 District is
mapped on the few wide and deep sites located adjacent to major thoroughfares
in the Village.
   (e)   The C-3 General Business District is designed to provide for a limited
range of fringe commercial uses which may be appropriate in certain limited
locations in the Village.

accessory use or principal use is located within a 200-foot distance of the
proposed building, in any straight line direction from the closest point of a
building to the closest point of the other building of such regulated accessory
use.
   (g)   Other noncomparison commercial uses which are compatible under the
appropriate circumstances. These uses shall be limited to:
      (1)   Automobile service stations, when not more than one other such
high-intensity use is located within a C-1 or C-2 District within a 1,000-foot
distance of the proposed site and subject to the requirements of Section
1265.08.
      (2)   Drive-in facilities for permitted uses, when not more than one
other such high-intensity use is located within a C-1 or C-2 District within a
1,000-foot distance of the proposed site.
      (3)   Hotels and motels.
      (4)   Meeting halls, when not more than one other such use is located

a 1,000-foot distance of the proposed site.
   (h)   Adult entertainment uses which can be permitted under certain
conditions when all of the requirements for these uses have been met. It has
been demonstrated that the establishment of adult businesses in business
districts which are immediately adjacent to and which serve residential
neighborhoods, has deleterious effect on both business and residential segments
of the neighborhood, causing blight and a downgrading of property values. A
prohibition against the establishment of more than two regulated uses within
1,000 feet of each other serves to avoid the clustering of certain businesses,
which, when located in close proximity to each other, tend to create a negative
atmosphere. The concern for and pride in the orderly planning and development
of a neighborhood should be encouraged and fostered in those persons who
comprise the business and residential segments of that neighborhood. The
Planning Commission and the Village Council should be guided by the expressed
will of those businesses and residences which are immediately adjacent to the
proposed locations of, and therefore most affected by the existence of, any
adult book store, adult motion picture theater, adult mini-motion picture
theater, adult cabaret, etc.
   (i)   For purposes of this section, the following shall control:
      (1)   Definitions.

entertainment uses shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
            1.   Adult motion picture theater
            2.   Adult mini-motion picture theater
            3.   Adult motion picture arcade
            4.   Adult book store
            5.   Adult cabaret, nightclub, topless lounge, etc.

         B.   Significant portion - As used in the above definition, the term
"significant portion" shall mean any one or more portions of the display having
continuous duration in excess of five minutes, and/or the aggregate of portions
of the display having a duration equal to ten percent or more of the display,
and/or the aggregate of portions of the collection of any materials or exhibits
composing the display equal to ten percent or more of the display.

any of the following uses:

         J.   Any public or private school having a curriculum including
kindergarten or any one or more of the grades, one through twelve.

      (3)   Display content. No adult use shall be conducted in any manner that
permits the observation of any material depicting, describing or relating to
"specified sexual activities" or "specified anatomical areas" from any public
way or from any property not regulated as an adult entertainment use. This
provision shall apply to any display, decoration, sign, show window or other
opening.
      (4)   Variance requirements. In addition to all other requirements for
the obtaining of a variance from the provisions herein, as set forth in other
portions of this Zoning Code, the Village Council may waive the limiting
regulations of this section if all of the following findings are made:
         A.   That the proposed use will not be contrary to the public interest
or injurious to the nearby properties, and that the spirit and intent of this
Zoning Code will be observed.
         B.   That the proposed use will not enlarge or encourage the
development of a "skid row" area.
         C.   That the person seeking to establish the adult entertainment use
shall include a petition which affirmatively demonstrates the approval of the
proposed adult entertainment use by fifty percent of the persons owning and
occupying premises within a radius of 600 feet of the proposed use. The
petitioner shall attempt to contact all occupied premises within this radius,
and must maintain a list of all addresses at which no contact was made. The
circulator of the petition requesting a variance shall subscribe to a sworn
affidavit attesting to the fact that the petition was circulated and that the
circulator personally witnessed the signatures on the petition and that to the
best of their knowledge, the same were affixed to the petition by the person
whose name appeared thereon. The Village Council shall not consider the
requested waiver under the previous section until the above-described petition
shall have been filed and verified to the satisfaction of that Council.

1265.01 USES PERMITTED BY RIGHT.
   All uses permitted by right in the C-1 and C-2 Commercial Districts shall be
permitted by right in the C-3 General Business District.
(Ord.106. Passed 12-9-81; Ord. 106A-123. Passed 6-14-23.)
1265.02 SPECIAL LAND USES.
   Following are special land uses in C-3 General Business District:
   (a)   Uses permitted subject to special conditions in the C-1 and C-
2 Districts. Such uses shall be subject to the same conditions as set forth in
Section
1264.02.
   (b)   High-intensity fringe commercial uses which are compatible under the
appropriate circumstances, but which should be limited in their frequency of
occurrence in any one area. No other such use shall be permitted within the
Village within a 1,000 foot distance. Such uses shall be limited to:
      (1)   Automobile accessory stores, when no other such high-intensity use
is located within the Village within a 1,000 foot distance of the proposed
site.
      (2)   Clubs and lodges, private or otherwise, when not more than one
other such high-intensity use is located within the Village within a 1,000 foot
distance of the proposed use.
      (3)   Businesses with drive-through windows, when not more than one other
such use is located within the Village within a 1,000 foot distance of the
proposed use.
   (c)   Other fringe commercial uses which are compatible under the
appropriate circumstances. Such uses shall be limited to:
      (1)   Automobile and light truck sales establishments, when no other such
high-intensity use is located within the Village within a 1,000 foot distance
of the proposed site.
      (2)   Automobile washing establishments.
      (3)   Dry cleaning and laundry establishments.
      (4)   Greenhouses and nurseries.
      (5)   Locksmith shops.

the serious deterioration of the commercial area in which they are located as
well as surrounding residential areas. Such uses are permitted in Wolverine
Lake because of constitutional protections. They are limited in frequency of
occurrence and proximity to residential areas in order to permit maximum
protection of property values and the quality of life for property owners and
residents of the Village. Such uses exert their most serious blighting
influence when concentrated in close proximity to one another and when located
near residential areas. Therefore, not more than two adult-oriented uses shall
be permitted within a 1,000 foot distance. No adult-oriented use shall be
permitted within 500 feet of a Residential District or use. No adult-oriented
use shall be permitted within 500 feet of any site on which is located a
church, school, park or playground, or any area where minors regularly
congregate. Advertisements, displays, or other promotional materials shall not
be shown or exhibited so as to be visible to the public from pedestrian
sidewalks or walkways, or from other public areas. All entries, windows, and
other building openings for adult uses shall be located, covered, or screened
in such a manner as to prevent a view into the interior from any public area.
      Adult-oriented uses shall include:
      (1)   Bookstores which have more than 15% of their stock in trade in
books, magazines or other publications, the sale of which is prohibited to
minors.
      (2)   Theaters and mini-theaters which have more than 15% of their
screening time over a six month period devoted to motion pictures, the
attendance at which is prohibited to minors.
      (3)   Cabarets or bars with live topless-type entertainment, hostesses,
waitresses, or other employees.
      (4)   Nude photographic studios.
      (5)   Massage establishments.

1266.01 PURPOSE.
   This district is designed for areas that currently have a mix of uses, and
it is desirable to maintain this mix. It encourages a complementary mixture of
small-scale, pedestrian-oriented uses that are compatible in a neighborhood
setting that is adjacent to residential neighborhoods. It is intended to ensure
a neighborhood character and place a proper balance of activities within
walking distance of one another while serving the day-to-day needs of
residents. The M-U Mixed-Use District is a unique mix of low-impact commercial
uses (similar to C-1, Local Commercial), low-impact office uses (similar to O-
1, Office), and single-family residential areas (similar to R-1A Single-Family
Residential), with unique provisions that will allow for single-family
residential uses to continue and to be established, while also allowing low-
intensity commercial and office uses and buildings to continue that can serve
the residential area.

      (1)   Uses already established on the effective date of this chapter and
rendered nonconforming by the provisions of this chapter may continue; however,
they shall be subject to the provisions of this section and
Chapter 1282.
      (2)   For sites developed for non-residential purposes on the effective
date of this chapter and rendered nonconforming by the provisions of the site
design requirements, the site may be occupied by a new non-residential purpose
permitted in the district or redeveloped for a non-residential purpose
permitted in the district, but will require improvements that increase
compliance with the ordinance site design requirements, according to the
standards below.
      (3)   For sites that are developed for residential purposes on the
effective date of this chapter and rendered nonconforming by the provisions of
the site design requirements, the site may be occupied by a new residential
purpose permitted in the district.
   (b)   Existing Nonconforming Sites: It is recognized that certain sites do
not comply with the current paving, lighting, landscaping, and other non-safety
related site development requirements. This section is intended to:
      (1)   Allow for reasonable re-use, maintenance and improvements to these
sites that will gradually improve compliance with these requirements.
      (2)   Permit a proportionate amount of improvements to nonconforming
sites relative to the amount of expansion or improvement proposed to the use or
building.
      (3)   Allow the needed flexibility in the regulations to encourage
gradual site improvements and increased compliance with the intent of the
zoning ordinance requirements.
      (4)   Required reviews. This section provides for the conditions under
which re-occupancy, improvement and modification to nonconforming sites may
occur. It does not replace other reviews and requirements contained elsewhere
in this chapter. Therefore, where improvements and modifications are proposed
to nonconforming sites, they shall be subject to site design review according
to Section
1242.08  and Chapters
1270  and
1272 .
      (5)   Standards for review. Applications to improve or modify
nonconforming sites shall be reviewed in accordance with Chapters
1242  and

            1.   Modifications to nonconforming structures or buildings comply
with
Chapter 1282.
            2.   Changes to nonconforming uses comply with
Chapter 1282.
            3.   Improvements/modifications to a nonconforming site shall
include reasonable site improvements to the overall site in relation to the
scale and construction cost of any proposed building improvements or expansion
on site. Full redevelopment of the site shall comply with all relevant
regulations.
            4.   The applicant has addressed safety related site issues on the
overall site.
            5.   The improvements or minor expansion will not increase
noncompliance with other site requirements.
         B.   Driveways. Driveways that do not conform to current safety design
standards, as determined by the Village Engineer, shall be removed or
redesigned to the greatest extent possible. Where required to maintain
reasonable access to sites, driveway designs shall be evaluated by the Village
Engineer for conformance with safety standards.
         C.   Parking. Existing parking areas must be in good condition, as
determined by the Village Engineer, and any improvements necessary to provide a
safe durable surface have been proposed. For projects involving new
development, redevelopment, or change of use, parking areas that are
nonconforming in terms of required number of spaces, landscaping, setbacks,
lighting or other requirements of this section, shall be brought into full
compliance with this section if any of the following occur:
            1.   The nonconforming parking area is expanded or altered by an
area that is 50% or more of the original area.
            2.   Twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the surface area of the
parking area is reconstructed (existing pavement removed and replaced).
            3.   Where full compliance is not possible due to existing site
conditions, a variance may be requested from the Zoning Board of Appeals.
            4.   Whenever re-occupancy is proposed, or the parking area is not
proposed to be expanded or reconstructed beyond the percentages noted in
subsections 1. and 2. above, then any necessary repairs shall be made to the
existing parking lot pavement, as determined by the Village Engineer.
         D.   Screening. Whenever modifications are proposed, or any expansion
to the building or site proposed, then required screening walls for waste
receptacles or screening of adjacent residential uses shall be provided.
            1.   Where existing screening walls, fences or landscaping are in
disrepair, they shall be improved to a sturdy and attractive condition.
            2.   All parking areas shall be screened from adjacent residential
uses, and all waste receptacles shall be screened.
         E.   Landscaping. For projects involving new development,
redevelopment, or a change of use on sites that are nonconforming by reason of
landscaping, the site shall be brought into compliance under the following
conditions:
            1.   Whenever the size of the nonconforming site (building or
parking) is redeveloped or expanded by an area that is 50% or more of the

1267.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The Planned Unit Development (PUD) is provided as a design and planning
option, intended to permit flexibility in the regulation of land development;
to encourage innovation in land use, form of ownership (such as site
condominiums) and variety in design, layout, and type of structures
constructed; to preserve significant natural, historical, and architectural
features and open space; to promote efficient provision of public services and
utilities; to minimize adverse traffic impacts; to provide adequate housing and
employment; to encourage development of convenient recreational facilities; and
to encourage the use and improvement of existing sites or existing buildings
when the uniform regulations contained in other zoning districts alone do not
provide adequate protection and safeguards for the site or its surrounding
areas or flexibility to consider adaptive re-use of existing structures.
(Ord. 106A-85. Passed 4-9-14.)
1267.02 PUD REGULATIONS.
   (a)   A PUD may be applied for in any zoning district. The grant of a
planned unit development application shall require a rezoning by way of
amendment of this chapter upon the recommendation of the Planning Commission
and approval of the Village Council.
   (b)   A PUD shall be subject to adequate public health, safety, and welfare
protection mechanisms designed into the development to ensure the compatibility
of varied land uses both within and outside the development.
(Ord. 106A-85. Passed 4-9-14.)
1267.03 PUD ELIGIBILITY.
   The applicant for a PUD must demonstrate all of the following criteria as a
condition to being entitled to planned unit development treatment:
   (a)   Grant of the planned unit development will result in one of the
following:
      (1)   A recognizable and material benefit to the ultimate users of the
project and to the community, where such benefit would otherwise be unfeasible
or unlikely to be achieved without application of the planned unit development
regulations; or
      (2)   Long-term protection and preservation of natural resources and
natural features of a significant quantity and/or quality, where such benefit
would otherwise be unfeasible or unlikely to be achieved without application of
the planned unit development regulations; or
      (3)   Long-term protection of historic structures or significant
architecture worthy of historic preservation; or
      (4)   A non-conforming use shall, to a material extent, be rendered more
conforming, or less offensive, to the zoning district in which it is situated.
   (b)   The proposed type and density of use shall not result in an
unreasonable increase in the need for or burden upon public services,
facilities, roads and utilities.
   (c)   The proposed planned unit development shall be harmonious with public
health, safety and welfare of the Village.
   (d)   The proposed planned unit development shall not result in an
unreasonable negative environmental impact or loss of a historic structure on
the subject site or surrounding land.
   (e)   The proposed planned unit development shall not result in an
unreasonable negative economic impact upon surrounding properties.
   (f)   The proposed planned unit development shall be under single ownership
and/or control such that there is a single person, corporation, or partnership
having responsibility for completing the project in conformity with this
chapter.
   (g)   The proposed planned unit development shall be consistent with the
Goals and Policies of the Village of Wolverine Lake Master Plan.
   (h)   The proposed use or uses shall be of such location, size, density and
character as to be in harmony with the zoning district in which it is situated,
and shall not be detrimental to the adjoining zoning districts.
   (i)   The PUD is not proposed in an attempt by the applicant to circumvent
the strict application of zoning standards.
(Ord. 106A-85. Passed 4-9-14.)
1267.04 RESIDENTIAL AND NON-RESIDENTIAL PUD STANDARDS.
   (a)   Residential uses shall be permitted with the density standards, based
upon the zoning district in which the property is situated immediately prior to
classification under this chapter. Land area under water, public road rights-
of-way and private road easements shall not be included in the gross density
calculation.
   (b)   An additional density greater than specified above may be allowed at
the discretion of the Planning Commission and Village Council based upon a
demonstration by the applicant of design excellence and conformance to the
standards listed in Section
1267.03 as well as conformance to the Village of Wolverine Lake Master Plan.
   (c)   The Planning Commission and Village Council may allow a residential
PUD in areas having a non-residential base zoning subject to compliance with
the Village Master Plan or a determination by the Planning Commission and
Village Council that the proposed development meets the general intent of
Section
1267.03.
   (d)   A planned unit development incorporating non-residential uses such as
commercial or office, or a mix of non-residential and residential uses shall
also be allowed subject to the design standards of this chapter.
(Ord. 106A-85. Passed 4-9-14.)
1267.05 GENERAL DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   All regulations within the Village Zoning Ordinance applicable to
setback, parking and loading, general provisions, and other requirements shall
be met in relation to each respective land use in the development based upon
the zoning districts in which the use is listed as a permitted use. In all
cases, the strictest provisions shall apply.
   Notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, deviations with respect
to such regulation may be granted as part of the overall approval of the
planned unit development, provided there are features or elements demonstrated
by the applicant and deemed adequate by the Village Council upon the
recommendation of the Planning Commission designed into the project plan for
the purpose of achieving the objectives of this section.
   (b)   The uses proposed will have a beneficial effect, in terms of public
health, safety, welfare, or convenience, on the present and future potential
surrounding land uses.
   (c)   The uses proposed will not adversely affect the existing public
utilities and circulation system, surrounding properties, or the environment.
   (d)   The public benefit shall be one which could not be achieved under the
regulations of the underlying district alone, or that of any other zoning
district.
   (e)   The number and dimensions of off-street parking shall be sufficient to
meet the minimum required by the ordinances of the Village of Wolverine Lake.
However, where warranted by overlapping or shared parking arrangements, the
Planning Commission or Village Council may reduce the required number of
parking spaces.
   (f)   All streets and parking areas within the planned unit development
shall meet the minimum construction and other requirements of Village
ordinances, unless modified by the Planning Commission and Village Council.
   (g)   Landscaping shall be preserved and/or provided to ensure that proposed
uses will be adequately buffered from one another and from surrounding public

standards otherwise applicable in connection with each of the respective types
of uses served.
   (j)   There shall be underground installation of utilities, including
electricity, telephone, and cable TV.
   (k)   The pedestrian circulation system, and its related walkways and safety
paths, shall be separated from vehicular thoroughfares and ways.
   (l)   Signage, lighting, landscaping, building materials for the exterior of
all structures, and other features of the project, shall be designed and
completed with the objective of achieving an integrated and controlled
development, consistent with the character of the community, surrounding
development or developments, and natural features of the area.
   (m)   Where non-residential uses adjoin off-site residentially zoned or used
property, noise reduction and visual screening mechanisms such as earthen and/
or landscape berms and/or decorative walls, shall be employed in accordance
with
Chapter 1270.
   (n)   The proposed density of the planned unit development shall be no
greater than that which would be required for each of the component uses
(measured by stated acreage allocated to each use) of the development by the
district regulations of the underlying zoning district unless otherwise
permitted by the Planning Commission and Village Council.
(Ord. 106A-85. Passed 4-9-14.)

Commission and the Village Council shall state the reasons for approval,
conditional approval, postponement or denial within the body of the motion.
   (e)   Approval of the final PUD by the Village Council shall constitute
amendment of the Village of Wolverine Lake Zoning Map. The applicant shall then
be authorized to proceed with any necessary permits such as final platting or
construction submittals, for Building Official approval.
(Ord. 106-85. Passed 4-9-14.)
1267.09 PUD CONDITIONS.
   (a)   Reasonable conditions may be required by the Planning Commission
before the approval of a planned unit development, to the extent authorized by
law, for the purpose of ensuring that existing public services and facilities
affected by a proposed land use or activity will be capable of accommodating
increased service and facility loads caused by the land use or activity,
protecting the natural environment and conserving natural resources and energy,
ensuring compatibility with adjacent uses of land, and promoting the use of
land in a socially and economically desirable manner.
   (b)   Permit conditions may be drafted in writing specifying conditions of
approval and use. Conditions may stipulate that the PUD may only be used for
selective land uses provided the restraint(s): advance, rather than injure, the
interests of adjacent landowners; are a means of harmonizing private interests
in land thus benefitting the public interest; are for the purposes of ensuring
that the PUD fulfills the purposes and intent of this section and thus benefits
the public interest; and/or possesses a reasonable relationship to the
promotion of the public health, safety, and welfare. A change of land use
during operation of the PUD will render the PUD null and void or will require
application for a revised PUD.
   (c)   Conditions imposed shall be designed to protect natural resources and
the public health, safety, and welfare of individuals in the project and those
immediately adjacent, and the community as a whole; are reasonably related to
the purposes affected by the planned unit development; and, necessary to meet
the intent and purpose of this chapter, and be related to the objective of
ensuring compliance with the standards of this chapter. All conditions imposed
shall be made a part of the written record of the approved planned unit
development which shall include a site plan and written PUD permit conditions
signed by the Village and the applicant.
   (d)   In the event that conditions set forth herein are not complied with,
then the Building Official shall have the right to compel a show cause hearing
by the Planning Commission, or issue a violation pursuant to Chapter 1242. At
the show cause hearing, additional conditions may be imposed by the Planning
Commission, or the Village may require submittal of a new PUD application.
(Ord. 106A-85. Passed 4-9-14.)
1267.10 PHASING AND COMMENCEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION.
   (a)   Phasing. Where a project is proposed for construction in phases, the
planning and designing shall be such that, upon completion, each phase shall be
capable of standing on its own in terms of the presence of services,
facilities, and open space, and shall also contain the necessary components to
ensure protection of natural resources and the health, safety, and welfare of
the users of the planned unit development and the residents of the surrounding
area. In addition, in developments which include residential and non-
residential uses, the relative mix of uses and the scheduled completion of
construction for each phase shall be disclosed and determined to be reasonable
in the discretion of the Village Council after recommendation from the Planning
Commission.
   (b)   Commencement and Completion of Construction. Construction shall be
commenced within one year following final approval of a planned unit
development and shall proceed substantially in conformance with the schedule
set forth by the applicant. If construction is not commenced within such time,
any approval of a site plan on the project shall expire and be null and void
unless an extension has been granted by the Planning Commission. Moreover, in
the event a site plan has expired, the Village Council may take action, in
accordance with Section
1242.07 of the Village of Wolverine Lake Zoning Ordinance, and may reclassify
the property to the previous zoning classification or to a different zoning
classification in accordance with amendment procedures, including Planning
Commission review and public hearing(s), as required by the Ordinance.
(Ord. 106A-85. Passed 4-9-14.)
1267.11 EFFECT OF APPROVAL.
   When approved, the planned unit development amendment, with all conditions
imposed, if any, shall constitute the land use authorization for the property,
and all improvements and uses shall be in conformity with such amendment.
Notice of adoption of the final PUD site plan and PUD permit conditions shall
be recorded with the Oakland County Register of Deeds at the applicant's
expense.
(Ord. 106A-85. Passed 4-9-14.)
1267.12 DEVIATIONS FROM APPROVED FINAL PUD SITE PLAN.
   Deviations from the approved final PUD site plan may occur only under the
following conditions:
   (a)   An applicant or property owner who has been granted final PUD site
plan approval shall notify the Building Official of any proposed amendment to
such approved site plan or PUD conditions.
   (b)   Minor changes may be approved by the Village Building Official upon
certification in writing to the Planning Commission that the proposed revision
does not alter the basic design nor any conditions of the plan imposed upon the
original approval, by the Planning Commission. In considering such a
determination, the Building Official shall consider the following to be a minor
change:
      (1)   For residential buildings, the size of structures may be reduced,
or increased by five percent provided that the overall density of units does
not increase.
      (2)   Square footage of non-residential buildings may be decreased, or
increased by up to five percent or 10,000 square feet, whichever is smaller;
      (3)   Horizontal and/or vertical elevations may be altered by up to five
percent;
      (4)   Movement of a building footprint by no more than ten feet as long
as required setbacks are not compromised;
      (5)   Designated "Areas not to be disturbed" may be increased;
      (6)   Plantings approved in the final PUD landscape plan may be replaced
by similar types of landscaping on a one-to-one or greater basis;
      (7)   Improvements to site access or circulation, such as inclusion of
deceleration lanes, boulevards, curbing, pedestrian/bicycle paths, etc.;
      (8)   Changes of building materials to another of higher quality, as
determined by the Building Official;
      (9)   Changes in floor plans which do not alter the character of the use;
      (10)   Slight modification of sign placement or reduction of size;
      (11)   Relocation of sidewalks and/or refuse storage stations;
      (12)   Internal rearrangement of parking lots which do not affect the
number of parking spaces or alter access locations or design;
      (13)   Changes required or requested by the Village for safety reasons
shall be considered a minor change.
   (c)   Should the Building Official determine that the requested modification
to the approved final PUD site plan is not minor or if a change in land use has
occurred which is different than land uses previously approved, resubmittal to
the Planning Commission shall be necessary and new public hearing and
notification under Section
1267.08 shall be required.
   (d)   Should the Planning Commission determine that the modifications to the
final PUD site plan significantly alter the intent of the preliminary PUD site
plan, a new submittal illustrating the modification shall be required.
   (e)   Any deviation from the approved PUD site plan, except as authorized in
this section, shall be considered a violation of this chapter and treated as a

1270.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to set minimum standards for the
protection and enhancement of the environment through requirements for site
design and the use of landscape materials.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1270.02 APPLICATION.
   The requirements set forth in this chapter shall apply to all lots, sites,
and parcels which are developed or expanded following the effective date of
this Zoning Code. No site plan or land use shall be approved unless said site
plan shall show landscaping consistent with the provisions of this chapter. In
cases where the use of an existing building changes or an existing building is
expanded or otherwise altered, all of the site design standards set forth
herein shall be met. In cases where the existing structure or its site presents
practical difficulties to meeting all of the site design standards, the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall approve variances from the site design standards and in
so doing shall consider recommendations of the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1270.03 LANDSCAPE BUFFER AND OPEN-SPACE STANDARDS.
   (a)   Buffering of Nonresidential Uses; Protective Screen Wall or Landscape
Buffer Required Adjacent to Residential Property. The owner of property which
is used for business, semipublic, public or other nonresidential purposes shall
install and maintain in good condition along the entire edge of said property
adjacent to property which is used or zoned for residential purposes either a
protective screen wall or, upon Planning Commission determination, a landscape
buffer strip. Protective screen walls and buffer strips required hereby shall
have the following specifications:
      (1)   Protective screen wall: 
         A.   The wall shall be of concrete or masonry construction at least
five feet high and eight inches thick, and it shall be reinforced with steel
pilasters, or the equivalent.
         B.   It shall contain no openings whatsoever except for such gates as
may be approved by the Planning Commission in the course of site plan review.
         C.   It shall extend the full length of the nonresidential property
where such property is also adjacent to the residential district or property
used for residential purposes, except that it shall not be erected within
twenty feet of a residential front property line.
      (2)   Landscape buffer strip: 
         A.   The buffer strip shall be a minimum of twelve feet in depth.
         B.   It shall be graded with a continuous berm at least three feet
above the grade elevation at the common property line. A three-foot high
concrete or masonry screen wall may be substituted for the berm.
         C.   All portions of the buffer strip shall be planted with grass,
ground cover, shrubbery, or other suitable live plant material.
         D.   A minimum of one deciduous tree plus one additional deciduous
tree shall be planted for each thirty linear feet of required buffer strip
length. Required deciduous trees shall be planted at approximately thirty foot
intervals, or shall be clustered if the Planning Commission determines that a
cluster configuration will provide a more effective buffer.
      (3)   Fence:
         A.   The fence shall be constructed of natural materials at least five
feet in height. This provision includes landscape fences comprised of living
material, such as a hedge, but not a landscape buffer strip, as described in
division (2) above. Landscape fences shall meet the minimum height of five feet
upon planting, and shall achieve an opaque screen within three years after
planting. Constructed fences shall be no taller than six feet in height.
Landscape fences shall be allowed to grow beyond the six foot maximum height.
         B.   The fence or landscape fence shall contain no openings whatsoever
except for such gates as may be approved by the Planning Commission in the
course of site plan review.

district or property used for residential purposes, except that it shall be
reduced in height to thirty inches within twenty feet of a residential front
property line.
   (b)   Buffering of Business, Semipublic, Public, or Other Nonresidential
Uses Adjacent to a Public Thoroughfare. The owner of property used for
business, semipublic, public or other nonresidential uses shall install and
maintain in good condition a landscape buffer strip along the entire edge of
said property adjacent to a public thoroughfare right-of-way. The buffer strip
shall be designed and landscaped as follows:
      (1)   The buffer strip shall be a minimum of six feet in depth.
      (2)   It may be interrupted at not more than fifteen percent of its
required length to provide for vehicular access, except that the buffer strip
may be interrupted at more than fifteen percent of its required length if
necessary to provide for one vehicular access and one egress lane.
      (3)   Grass, ground cover, or other suitable live plant material shall be
planted over the entire buffer strip area, except that paving may be used in
areas of intensive pedestrian circulation.
      (4)   A minimum of one deciduous tree, plus one additional deciduous tree
shall be planted for each thirty linear feet of required buffer strip length.
Paved areas used for pedestrian circulation and vehicular access shall be
counted in measuring the length of the buffer strip for the purpose of
determining the required number of trees. Trees shall be planted at thirty-foot
intervals, or shall be clustered if the Planning Commission determines that a
cluster configuration will provide a more effective buffer.
      (5)   Brick or other decorative paving material shall be utilized over
ten percent of the pedestrian circulation area incorporated in the site plan.
   (c)   Screening and Landscaping of Parking Areas Adjacent to or Visible From
Public Thoroughfares and Residential Districts. The owner of an off-street
parking area adjacent to or visible from a public right-of-way or residential
area shall install and maintain in good condition the following landscaping:
      (1)   Off-street parking areas shall be screened from public
thoroughfares and Residential Districts by a thirty-six inch high brick wall
around the periphery of the parking area. Other masonry may be substituted with
Planning Commission approval. The wall may be interrupted at not more than
twenty percent of its required length if necessary to provide for vehicular
access, except that the wall may be interrupted at more than twenty percent of
its required length if necessary to provide for one vehicular access and one
egress lane. The wall may be omitted along the portion of the parking and
vehicular-use area periphery which lies adjacent to a protective screen wall or
landscape buffer strip of the type required in subsection (a) hereof, and along
the portion of the parking and vehicular use area periphery which lies adjacent
to a building on the same lot as the parking area. The thirty-six inch high
berm completely covered with live landscape material may be substituted for the
wall with Planning Commission approval.
      (2)   Off-street parking areas shall have a minimum of one deciduous tree
for every ten parking spaces.
   (d)   Buffering of Multiple Dwellings Adjacent to Streets and Single-Family
Residential Areas. The owner of property used for multiple-dwelling purposes
shall install and maintain in good condition a landscape buffer at least twenty
feet in depth along the entire edge of said property adjacent to a public
right-of-way line or a single-family residential area.
   The buffer strip shall be designed and landscaped as follows:
      (1)   The buffer strip may be interrupted at not more than twenty percent
of its required length to provide for vehicular access, except that it may be
interrupted at more than twenty percent of its required length if necessary to
provide for one vehicular access and one egress lane.
      (2)   All portions of the buffer strip shall be planted with grass,
ground cover, shrubbery, or other suitable plant material.
      (3)   A minimum of one deciduous tree plus one additional deciduous tree
shall be planted for each thirty linear feet of required buffer strip length.
Required trees need not be planted at thirty foot intervals, but may be located
along the buffer strip as desired by the complying property owner.
      (4)   Paved areas used for pedestrian circulation and vehicular access
shall be counted in measuring the length of the buffer strip for the purpose of
determining the required number of trees. Trees need not be planted at uniform
intervals, but may be grouped at certain locations along the buffer strip.
   (e)   Landscape Open-Space Area. Whenever in this Zoning Code a landscaped
open-space area is required, it shall be landscaped according with the
following standards:
      (1)   All portions of the landscaped open-space area shall be planted
with grass, ground cover, shrubbery, or other suitable plant material, except
that paved active recreation areas, patios, terraces, pedestrian circulation
areas, swimming pools, and other similar site components may be incorporated
with the approval of the Planning Commission. Where paved patios, terraces,
pedestrian circulation areas, and decks adjacent to swimming pools, spas, hot
tubs and similar facilities are used, at least 10% of these areas shall be
paved with brick or other decorative paving material.
      (2)   A minimum of one deciduous tree plus one additional deciduous tree
shall be planted for each 1,000 square feet of required landscaped open-space
area. Required trees may be planted at uniform intervals, at random or in
groupings.
      (3)   The total landscaped open-space area required shall be the basis
for determining the number of trees irrespective of the portion of the required
landscaped open-space area which is devoted to active recreational purposes,
patios, terraces, or pedestrian circulation.
   (f)   Landscaping of Rights-of-Way and Other Adjacent Public Open-Space
Areas. Public rights-of-way and other public open-space areas adjacent to
required buffer strips and landscaped open-space areas shall be planted with
grass or other suitable ground cover and maintained by the owner of the
adjacent property as if they were part of required buffer strips and landscaped
open-space areas.
   (g)   Regulations Pertaining to Landscaping Areas Used for Sight Distance.
When a driveway intersects a public right-of-way or when the subject property
abuts the intersection of public rights-of-way, all landscaping within the
corner triangular areas described below shall permit unobstructed cross-
visibility. Shrubs located in the triangular areas shall not be permitted to
grow to a height of more than thirty inches above the pavement grade at the
edge of the pavement. Required protective screen walls must be installed
outside sight distance triangular areas. Portions of required berms located
within sight distance triangular areas shall not exceed a height of thirty
inches above the pavement grade at the edge of the pavement. Trees may be
planted and maintained in this area, provided that all branches are trimmed to
maintain a clear vision for a vertical height of eight feet above the roadway
surface. Landscaping, except grass or ground cover, shall not be located closer
than three feet from the edge of an accessway pavement.
   The triangular areas referred to above are:
      (1)   The area formed at a corner intersection of a public right-of way
and a driveway, two sides of the triangle area being ten feet in length
measured along the right-of-way line and driveway line and the third side being
a line connecting these two sides.
      (2)   The area formed at a corner intersection of two public right-of-way
lines, the two sides of the triangular area being thirty feet in length
measured along the abutting public right-of-way line and the third side being a
line connecting these two sides.

mature crown spread of greater than fifteen feet in Oakland County and having
trunks which can be maintained with over five feet of clear stem, if conditions
of pedestrian and vehicular traffic visibility require, except, however, at
intersections where the requirement of eight-foot clear stems shall be
followed. Trees having an average mature crown spread of less than fifteen feet
may be substituted by grouping the same so as to create the equivalent of a
fifteen-foot crown spread. Deciduous tree species shall be a minimum of ten
feet in overall height and a minimum caliper of two and one-half inches at the
point on the trunk, six inches above the ground immediately after planting.
   (e)   Ground Covers. Ground covers used in lieu of grass in whole or in part
shall be planted in such a manner as to present a finished appearance and
reasonably complete coverage after one complete growing season.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1270.05 INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   In cases where an owner of property is required to install and maintain
landscape materials, said owner shall observe the following standards:
   (a)   Installation. Landscaping shall be installed in a sound, workmanlike
manner and according to accepted good planning procedures with the quality of
plant materials as hereinafter described. Landscaped areas must be protected
from vehicular encroachment, by such means as, but not limited to, wheel stops.
If building or paving construction is completed during a planting season, then
no certificates of occupancy will be issued unless the landscaping meets the
requirements herein provided. If building or paving construction is completed
in an off-planting season, the certificates of occupancy will be issued only
after the owner provides a performance bond to ensure installation of required
landscaping in the next planting season. Temporary certificates of occupancy
will be issued only after the owner provides a performance bond to ensure
installation of required landscaping in the next growing season.
   (b)   Maintenance. The owner of landscaping required by this Zoning Code
shall maintain such landscaping in good condition so as to present a healthy,
neat, and orderly appearance, free from refuse and debris. All unhealthy and
dead material shall be replaced within one year or the next appropriate
planting period, whichever comes first. All landscape areas shall be provided
with a readily-available and acceptable water supply, or with at least one
outlet located within 100 feet of all plant material to be maintained.
Maintenance of landscaped areas in public right-of-ways adjacent to required
landscape areas shall be the responsibility of the owner of the adjacent
private property.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1270.06 OUTDOOR STORAGE IN NONRESIDENTIAL AREAS, AND IN MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL
AREAS.
   (a)   No incinerator, garbage or trash receptacle, oil or propane tank, or

a concrete surface of such thickness and design to support the containers.
      (4)   When, in the discretion of the Planning Commission, an alternate
wood or metal enclosure of adequate height would be consistent with the
architecture of the principal building or buildings on the property and when
protected from damage by cars or trucks gaining access to the enclosure,
passing by the enclosure or parking adjacent to the enclosure.
   (b)   No storage of goods, merchandise or materials outside the building
shall be permitted, except when enclosed on all sides by a solid concrete
simulated brick, decorative masonry or brick wall of adequate height to
completely obscure all stored materials. Openings in such wall shall be
approved by the Planning Commission through the site plan review process.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81; Ord. 106A-20. Passed 7-12-89.)
1270.07 REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO EXISTING PLANT MATERIAL
   (a)   Consideration of Existing Plant Material. In instances where healthy
plant material exists on a site prior to its development, the Planning
Commission, pursuant to site plan approval, may adjust the application of the
above standards to allow credit for such plant material if such an adjustment
is in keeping with and will preserve the intent of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Preservation of Existing Plant Material. Site plans shall show all
existing trees 13/ inches in diameter located within the proposed development's
contract limits. Any tree to be removed shall be labeled as such on the site
plans. All trees to be removed must be approved by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1270.08 FENCES, ARBORS AND TRELLISES.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to maintain an open, park-like

the lake.
   (b)   Approval Required.
      (1)   The erection, re-erection, altering or relocating of a fence, arbor
or trellis shall be unlawful unless a sketch or design of the proposed fence,
arbor or trellis and its location on the property, including a description of
materials to be used and specification of height, shall be submitted, and any
applicable fees paid to the village. Approval will not be issued if the village
determines that the proposed fence, arbor or trellis does not meet the
requirements of this zoning code.
      (2)   Fence, arbor or trellis approval shall become null and void if the
work for which the approval was issued is not completed within six months of
the date of approval.
   (c)   Approved Fences, Arbors, Trellises, and Landscape Fences/Screens.
      (1)   Residential fences, arbors, trellises, and landscape fences are

where they would not otherwise be permitted. Masonry fences must conform to the
Building and Housing Code.
         C.   Fences, arbors, trellises and landscape fences may be located
along the property line. All exposed horizontal and vertical members of a
fence, arbor or trellis shall be located on the inside of the property they are
intended to fence. If adjoining property owners jointly apply for a permit to
erect a fence, arbor or trellis upon their common property line, such fence,
arbor or trellis may be so erected.
         D.   The maximum height of permitted fences and landscape fences shall
be measured from the ground level adjacent to the highest point of the fence.
Fill shall not be used for the purpose of achieving a higher fence than
otherwise permitted. Maximum height of permitted fences and landscape fences
shall be subject to the following provisions:

only allowed within a required or unrequired rear yard, and must comply with
subparagraph 3. above.
            7.   Arbors, trellises, or any other structures of the like must be
free standing, i.e., they should stand alone and not be contiguous with a fence
row. Arbors, trellises or any other structure or items that are positioned to
circumvent this chapter shall not be allowed.
         E.   In the event there are abutting yards with conflicting applicable
provisions, the shortest maximum height requirement will apply.
      (2)   Invisible fences for the control of pets are allowed on one's own
property.
      (3)   Fences on property in residential zoning districts, but used for
other purposes, such as a public park or other permitted use, shall meet the
landscape buffer requirements of Section
1270.03.

additional requirements are necessary to protect the public health, safety, and
general welfare. It is hereby recognized that peculiarities of lot contour,
existing and potential adjacent development, existing and potential vehicular
and pedestrian circulation and other determinants may require special
regulation of the location and external design of buildings, open spaces,
parking areas, and driveways that cannot be achieved by detailed
specifications. The site design review process should provide an opportunity
for consultation and cooperation between the applicant and the Planning
Commission so that maximum utilization of land consistent with minimum adverse
effects on adjoining areas can be achieved. Site design review and approval is
an integral part of the approval process for uses subject to special conditions
and planned developments and therefore separate site design review as provided
herein shall not be required for uses subject to special conditions and planned
developments.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1272.02 APPLICATION.
   Site design approval by the Planning Commission shall be required for every
nonresidential site design and for every single-family attached and every
multiple-family residential site design containing three or more units. Site
design approval shall be required whenever a new use is established, whenever
an existing use is changed to a different use, and whenever an existing use is
enlarged.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)

   (e)   Submission to Village Clerk and Referral to Planning Commission. The
application for site design approval shall be submitted to the Village Clerk
who shall forward it to the Planning Commission at its next regularly scheduled
meeting, provided such meeting takes place seven calendar days after the
initial submission of the application to the Village Clerk.
   (f)   Date and Notification of Planning Commission Consideration. The
Planning Commission shall set as a date for consideration of the site design,
its next regularly scheduled meeting following the Commission's formal receipt
of the application from the Village Clerk, provided such date provides adequate
time to publish a notice in a newspaper of general circulation not less than
five nor more than fifteen days before the application will be considered. The
notice shall:
      (1)   Indicate the property which is the subject of the site design
approval request.
      (2)   State when and where the application for site design approval will
be considered.
      (3)   Indicate when and where written comments will be received
concerning the application.
   (g)   Professional Reports. Before approving an application for site design
approval, the Planning Commission may elect to obtain a report or reports from
professional planners, landscape architects, architects, or engineers as to
whether the site design meets all requirements and standards of this Zoning
Code.
   (h)   Planning Commission Review and Determination. The Planning Commission
shall review the application for site design approval, together with any
professional reports thereon and the comments of all interested parties, and
shall make the final determination on the application. Such determination shall
be based solely on the requirements and standards of this Zoning Code.
Approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval, shall be made by resolution
setting forth the Planning Commission's findings regarding the pertinent
requirements and standards.
   If the site design is approved by the Planning Commission the applicant may
then submit the written approval to the Zoning Enforcement Officer who will
then sign and issue the building permit if all other building permit
requirements have been met, and all required signatures have been obtained. If
site design approval is denied, the Planning Commission may, by resolution,
require that a revised site design be resubmitted for review and approval in
accordance with the process outlined above. If, in the judgment of the Planning
Commission, the site design can be approved if minor modifications are made,
the Planning Commission may, by resolution, issue a conditional site design
approval in writing and provide for resubmission of a revised site design to
the Enforcement Officer who shall sign and issue the building permit upon
determination that all appropriate site design modifications have been made in
accordance with Planning Commission stipulations, and that all other building
requirements have been met.
   (i)   Recording of Planning Commission Action. Each action taken with
reference to site design review and approval shall be duly recorded in the

owner of a property for which site design approval is required to maintain his
or her property in accordance with the approved site design on a continuing
basis until the property is razed, or until a new site design approval has been
obtained as a basis for modifying the site design. Any property owner who fails
to so maintain an approved site design shall be deemed in violation of the use
provisions of this Zoning Code and shall be subject to the same penalties
appropriate to such a use violation
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81; Ord. 106A-98. Passed 10-14-15.)
   (k)   Site Plan Approval Period and Revocation.
      (1)   Expiration of site plan. If construction has not commenced within
eighteen months of final approval of the site plan, the site plan approval
becomes null and void and a new application for site plan review shall be
required.
      (2)   Revocation of site plan approval. Approval of a site plan may be
revoked by the Village Planning Commission if construction is not in
conformance with the approved plans. In such a case, the Village Clerk shall
place the site plan on the agenda of the Planning Commission for consideration
and give written notice to the applicant at least ten days prior to the
meeting. The applicant shall be given the opportunity to present information to
the Planning Commission and answer questions. The Village Planning Commission
may revoke the approval of the site plan if it finds that a violation exists
and has not been remedied prior to the hearing.

1272.05 STANDARDS FOR SITE DESIGN APPROVAL.
   The Planning Commission shall grant site design approval only if the site
design fully meets all applicable standards set forth in this Zoning Code, and
only upon a finding that the site design will not, on the basis of the facts
known at the time of submission of the site design, have an unduly harmful
external impact on surrounding property owners or the residents of the Village
as a whole. The Planning Commission may, as a basis for making such a finding,
require whatever site design modifications it deems necessary, including the
provision of additional site design amenities not specifically required by this
Zoning Code.
   (a)   All elements of the site design shall be harmoniously and efficiently
organized in relation to topography, the size and type of plot, the character
of adjoining property and the type and size of buildings. The site will be so
developed as not to impede the normal and orderly development or improvement of
surrounding property for uses permitted in this Zoning Code.
   (b)   The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state, insofar as
practicable, by minimizing tree and soil removal.
   (c)   The site design shall provide reasonable visual and sound privacy for
all dwelling units located therein and adjacent thereto. Fences, walks,
barriers, and landscapings shall be used, as appropriate, for the protection
and enhancement of property and the privacy of its occupants.
   (d)   All buildings or groups of buildings shall be so arranged as to permit
emergency vehicle access by some practical means to all sides.
   (e)   Every structure or dwelling unit shall have access to a public street,
walkway, or other area dedicated to common use.

system. In order to ensure public safety, pedestrian underpasses or overpasses
may be required in the vicinity of schools, playgrounds, local shopping areas
and other uses which generate a considerable amount of pedestrian traffic.
   (g)   The arrangement of public or common ways for vehicular and pedestrian
circulation shall respect the pattern of existing or planned streets and
pedestrian or bicycle pathways in the area.
   (h)   Appropriate measures shall be taken to ensure that removal of surface
waters will not adversely affect neighboring properties or the public storm
drainage system. Provision shall be made for the construction of sewer
facilities, including grading, gutters, piping, and the treatment of turf to
handle storm water, and to prevent erosion and the formation of dust. Surface
water on all paved areas shall be collected at intervals so that it will not
obstruct the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic and will not create
puddles in paved areas.
   (i)   Exterior lighting shall be so arranged that it is deflected away from
adjacent properties and so that it does not impede the vision of traffic along
adjacent streets. Flashing or intermittent lights shall not be permitted.

1274.01 PURPOSE.
   This chapter sets forth review procedures for Planning Commission approval
of special land uses. These procedures are instituted to provide an opportunity
to use a lot for an activity which, under usual circumstances, would be
detrimental to other permitted land uses and cannot be permitted within the
same district, but which use can be permitted under circumstances unique to the
proposed location and subject to conditions acceptable to the community and
providing protection to adjacent land uses. These procedures are adopted to
provide guidelines for the Village Planning Commission to follow in arriving at
any decision over which the Commission has jurisdiction, and to provide for the
public health, safety, morals, and general welfare.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1274.02 PROCEDURES
   (a)   Application; Submission to Village Clerk. An application for the
approval of a special land use may be made by an owner of an interest in the
land on which the use is to be located, to the Village Clerk accompanied by the
necessary fees and documents as provided herein.
   (b)   Application Forms and Documentation. The application shall be
accompanied by the same documentation required for site design approval as set
forth in Section
1272.03.
   (c)   Zone Change. The application for approval of a special land use may be
accompanied by an application for a zone change, where such a zone change is
necessary to the consideration of the special approval application, provided
all applicable provisions of a zone change application have been complied with.
   (d)   Referral of Application to Planning Commission. The application for
approval of a special land use and the zone application, if any, shall be
referred to the Planning Commission at its next regularly scheduled meeting
which takes place seven calendar days or more after the initial submission of
the application to the Village Clerk. The Commission shall review and
communicate its recommendation on the zone change application in accordance
with procedures prescribed by applicable statute.
   (e)   Public Hearing. The Commission shall hear any person wishing to
express an opinion on the application and review the application at its next
regular meeting, following the Commission's formal receipt of the application
from the Clerk, provided such date provides adequate time to notify property
owners and post a notice of public hearing, as required below:
      (1)   The Village Clerk shall publish a notice of such public hearing for
a special land use in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village and
shall send a notice of such public hearing by mail or personal delivery to the
owners of property for which approval is assessed within 300 feet of the
boundary of the property in question, and to the occupants of all structures
within 300 feet.
      (2)   The notice shall be given not less than fifteen days before the
application will be considered at the public hearing.
      (3)   If the name of the occupant is not known, the term "occupant" may
be used in making notification. Notification need not be given to more than one
occupant of a structure, except that if a structure contains more than one
dwelling unit or spatial area owned or leased by different individuals,
partnerships, businesses, or organizations, one occupant of each unit or
spatial area shall receive notice. In the case of a single structure containing
more than four dwelling units or other distinct spatial areas owned or leased
by different individuals, partnerships, businesses, or organizations, notice
may be given to the manager or owner of the structure who shall be requested to
post the notice at the primary entrance to the structure.
      (4)   The notice shall do all of the following:
         A.   Describe the nature of the special land use request.
         B.   Indicate the property which is the subject of the special land
use request. The notice shall include a listing of all existing street
addresses within the property. Street addresses do not need to be created and
listed if no such addresses currently exist within the property. If there are
no street addresses, other means of identification may be used.
         C.   State when and where the public hearing on the special land use
request will be considered.
         D.   Indicate when and where written comments will be received
concerning the request.
   (f)   Planning Commission Review and Determination. The Planning Commission
shall review the application for special land use approval, together with any
professional reports thereon and the comments of all interested parties, and
shall make the final determination on the application. Such determination shall
be based solely on the requirements and standards of this Zoning Code. The
decision on a special use shall be incorporated in a statement of findings and
conclusions relative to the special land use which specifies the basis for the
decision and any conditions imposed. Approval, approval with conditions, or
disapproval, shall be made by resolution setting forth the Planning
Commission's findings regarding the pertinent requirements and standards.
   (g)   Building Permit. If the special land use is approved by the Planning
Commission, the applicant may then submit the written approval to the Building
Inspector who will then sign and issue the building permit if all other
building permit requirements have been met, and all required signatures have
been obtained. If special land use approval is denied on grounds pertaining to
the site design of the proposed use, the Planning Commission may, by
resolution, provide that a revised site design be resubmitted for review and
approval in accordance with the process outlined above. If, in the judgment of
the Planning Commission, the special land use can be approved if minor
modifications are made to the site design, the Planning Commission may, by
resolution, issue a conditional approval in writing and provide for
resubmission of a revised site design to the Enforcement Officer who shall sign
and issue the building permit upon determination that all appropriate site
design modifications have been made in accordance with Planning Commission
stipulations, and that all other building permit requirements have been met.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81; Ord. 106-A46. Passed 11-14-07.)
1274.03 GENERAL STANDARDS FOR GRANTING SPECIAL LAND USE APPROVAL.
   The Planning Commission shall approve special land uses upon Planning
Commission determination that the proposed use will comply with all
requirements of this Zoning Code, including the applicable standards for
specific uses and the following general standards:
   (a)   Location. The location of the proposed use within the zoning district
will minimize the impact of the traffic generated by the proposed use on
surrounding uses. The Planning Commission shall presume that this standard has
not been met if the proposed use is not located immediately adjacent to
Benstein, Glengary, or South Commerce Roads. This presumption may be set aside
by the presentation of substantial evidence indicating that the traffic
generated by the proposed use will have a minimal impact despite the failure to
meet this locational standard.
   (b)   Site Design. The site design of the proposed use will minimize the
impact of site activity on surrounding properties. In determining whether this
requirement has been met, the Planning Commission will consider:
      (1)   The location and screening of outdoor storage or activity areas and
mechanical equipment in relationship to surrounding development.
      (2)   The location and screening of vehicular circulation and parking
areas in relationship to surrounding development.
      (3)   The hours of operation of the proposed use. In granting the
approval of a use subject to special conditions, the Planning Commission may
set such restrictions upon the hours of operation as it deems appropriate to
ensure minimal impact on surrounding uses.
      (4)   The bulk, placement, and materials of construction of the proposed
use in relationship to surrounding uses.
   (c)   Enhancement of Neighborhood Environment. The site design of the
proposed use will be such as to provide the maximum feasible enhancement of the
neighborhood environment of the surrounding area. In determining whether this
requirement has been met, the Planning Commission shall consider:
      (1)   The provision of landscaping or other site amenities over and above
those required by specific stipulations of this Zoning Code. The Planning
Commission may require provision of additional landscaping amenities over and
above the specific stipulations of this Zoning Code, but such additional
landscaping may not be required in an amount which would exceed in cost the
greater of fifty percent of the total development cost which would be
necessitated by the site improvements specifically stipulated by this Zoning
Code, or four percent of the total construction cost of the structure,
excluding site clearance or other site preparation costs and excluding paving
of parking vehicular circulation and loading areas, except to the extent that
such paving may be deemed aesthetically enhancing by use of decorative features
such as brick pavers or other similar devices. In determining site development
costs, the Planning Commission may accept the presentations of the applicant or
may require cost estimates by an independent registered landscape architect
obtained at the applicant's expense.
      (2)   The bulk, placement, and materials of construction of the proposed
use in relation to surrounding uses.
   (d)   Not Detrimental to Surrounding Development. The location of the
proposed use shall not be detrimental to the orderly development of surrounding
areas.
   (e)   Professional Review. In determining whether the above standards have
been met, the Planning Commission may obtain a written evaluation from a
professional community planner registered in the State of Michigan.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1274.04 CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS
   (a)   Modification of Requirements; Additional Requirements. Prior to
granting approval of a special land use, the Planning Commission may modify any
of the existing requirements or may impose any additional conditions or
limitations upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance, or
operation of the use authorized by the approval as in its judgment may be
necessary for the protection of the public interest. Conditions and
requirements stated as part of the approval of the use subject to special
conditions shall be a continuing obligation of holders of approval. The Zoning
Enforcement Officer shall make periodic investigations of developments
authorized by approval of uses subject to special conditions to determine
compliance with all requirements.
   (b)   Bond. In authorizing a special land use, the Planning Commission may
require that a bond or other financial guarantee acceptable to the Village, of
ample sum, be furnished by the developer to ensure compliance with such
requirements.
   (c)   Continuance. Continuance of special land use approval by the Planning
Commission shall be withheld only upon a determination by the Building
Inspector to the effect that:
      (1)   Such conditions as may have been prescribed in conjunction with the
issuance of the original approval included the requirement that the use be
discontinued after a specified time period.
      (2)   Violations of conditions pertaining to the granting of the permit
continue to exist more than thirty days after an order to correct has been
issued.
   (d)   Plans and Specifications Part of Conditions. All plans,
specifications, and statements submitted with the application shall become,
with any changes ordered by the Planning Commission, a part of the conditions
of any approval issued by the Planning Commission pursuant thereto.

1278.01 SCOPE OF REGULATIONS.
   The off-street parking and loading provisions of this Zoning Code shall
apply as follows:
   (a)   For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land
established after the effective date of this chapter, accessory parking and
loading facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations of the
districts in which such buildings or uses are located. However, where a
building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this Zoning
Code, and provided that construction is begun within six months of such
effective date and diligently prosecuted to completion, parking and loading
facilities in the amounts required for the issuance of said building permit may
be provided in lieu of any different amounts required by this Zoning Code.
   (b)   When the intensity of use of any building, structure, or premises
shall be increased, parking and loading facilities as required herein shall be
provided to accommodate such increase in intensity of use and for 100 percent
of any existing building, structure, or premises even if less than 100 percent
of the required parking and loading facilities was provided before the increase
in intensity. Whenever an existing use has less than 100 percent of the
required parking and loading spaces and said deficiency is or has been approved
by a duly granted variance, then the intensity of the use may be increased by
providing additional parking and loading spaces sufficient to meet the
requirements for the enlargement. When additional parking and loading areas are
provided, said additional parking and loading areas and all existing parking
and loading areas shall be made to conform to the appropriate site design
regulations set forth in
Chapter 1470.
   (c)   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall hereafter
be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be provided as
required for such new use regardless of any deficiency in parking spaces which
may have existed prior to the change in use. Any previously granted variance
for the parking or loading requirements for a particular use shall be void when
such use is changed. For the purposes of this section, a change in use shall be
any change which results in a change in the parking and loading requirements
set forth herein.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1278.02 EXISTING PARKING AND LOADING FACILITIES.
   Accessory off-street parking and loading facilities in existence on the
effective date of this Zoning Code and located on the same lot as the building
or use served shall not hereafter be reduced below, or if already less than,
shall not be further reduced below, the requirements of a similar new building
or use under the provisions of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1278.03 PERMISSIVE PARKING AND LOADING FACILITIES.
   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary
establishment of off-street parking or loading facilities to serve any existing
use of land or buildings, provided that all regulations herein governing the
location, design, and operation of such facilities are adhered to.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1278.04 DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION.
   For any conforming building or use which is in existence on the effective
date of this Zoning Code, which subsequently thereto is damaged or destroyed by
fire, collapse, explosion, or other cause, and which is reconstructed, re-
established, or repaired, off-street parking or loading facilities need not be
provided, except that parking or loading facilities equivalent to any
maintained at the time of such damage or destruction shall be restored or
continued in operation. For any legally nonconforming building or use which is
in existence on the effective date of this Zoning Code, which subsequently
thereto is damaged by fire, collapse, explosion, or other cause, and which is
permitted to rebuild under the terms of
Chapter 1282, off-street parking or loading facilities need not be provided,
except that parking or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the
time of such damage shall be restored or continued in operation. However, in no
case shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities
in excess of those required by this Zoning Code for equivalent new uses or
construction.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1278.05 SUBMISSION OF PLOT PLAN.
   Any application for a building permit, or for an occupancy certificate where
no building permit is required, shall include therewith a plot plan, drawn to
scale and fully dimensioned, showing any off-street parking or loading
facilities, as well as all structures, to be provided in compliance with this
Zoning Code. Whenever a site design plan is required in accordance with the
provisions of
Chapter 1272, said site plan shall meet the requirements of this section.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1278.06 OFF-STREET PARKING
   (a)   General Requirements. 
      (1)   Location. All parking spaces required to serve buildings or uses
erected or established after the effective date of this Zoning Code shall be
located on the same zoning lot as the building or use served, except that
parking spaces to serve office or commercial buildings or uses may be located
within 500 feet of such use if said spaces and uses are located in an Office or
Commercial District. However, parking spaces for handicapped persons shall be
located on the same zoning lot as the use served. Buildings or uses existing on
the effective date of this Zoning Code which are subsequently altered or
enlarged so as to require the provision of parking spaces under this Zoning
Code, may be served by parking facilities located on land other than the zoning
lot on which the building or use served is located, provided such facilities
are within 500 feet walking distance of a main entrance to the use served.
Owners of property, non-conforming as to parking, who elect to provide parking
and become conforming may locate such parking on land other than the zoning lot
on which the building or use is located, as allowed in this section. However,
parking spaces for handicapped persons shall be located on the same zoning lot
as the use served. Off-street parking spaces, open to the sky, may be located
in any yard, except the required front yard in a Residential District. Enclosed
buildings and carports containing off-street parking shall be subject to
applicable yard requirements.
      (2)   Control of off-site parking facilities. In cases where parking
facilities are permitted on land other than the zoning lot on which the
building or use served is located, such facilities shall be in the same
possession as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which the
parking facilities are accessory. Such possession shall be by deed or lease,
and such deed or lease shall be filed with the Village Clerk. If possession is
by lease, said lease shall be for a term extending not less than twenty years
beyond the date on which the property receives final approval for meeting the
parking requirements of this Zoning Code. The deed or lease shall require such
owner or his or her heirs and assigns to maintain the required number of
parking facilities for the duration of the use served or of the deed or lease,
whichever shall terminate sooner.
      (3)   Size. Except for parallel parking spaces, each required off-street
parking space shall be at least eight feet in width and at least nineteen feet
in length, exclusive of access drives or aisles, ramps, columns, or office or
work areas. Such space shall have a vertical clearance of at least seven feet.
For parallel parking, the length of the parking space shall be increased to
twenty-four feet. All other requirements as to size shall be as hereinafter set
forth in the attached Off-Street Parking Chart.
      (4)   Access. Except on lots accommodating single-family dwellings, each
off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway at least
twelve feet wide or such additional width and design as to provide safe and
efficient means of vehicular access to such parking space. All off-street
parking facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access
to a street in a manner which will least interfere with traffic movement.
      (5)   Collective provision. No parking space or portion thereof shall
serve as a required space for more than one use. Off-street parking facilities
for separate uses may be provided collectively. If parking facilities for
separate uses are provided collectively, the total number of spaces so provided
shall not be less than the number which would be required if the spaces were
provided separately, except that the total number of spaces may be reduced by
up to twenty-five percent if such a reduction is specifically approved as a
special land use. Such an approval shall be granted only on a showing that the
parking demands of the two uses do not overlap in time.
      (6)   Computation. When determination of the number of off-street parking
spaces required by this chapter results in a requirement of a fractional space,
any fraction of less than one-half may be disregarded, while a fraction of one-
half or more shall be counted as one parking space. Parking spaces required on
an employee basis shall be based on the maximum number of employees on duty or
residing, or both, on the premises at any one time.
      (7)   Design and maintenance. 
         A.   Plan. For uses subject to site design review, the plan of parking
areas shall be subject to the approval of the Planning Commission. For other
uses, the plan of parking areas shall be subject to the approval of the
Building Inspector. All parking areas shall be designed to provide adequate
fire lanes and access for emergency vehicles. Fire lanes shall be identified
with signs which prohibit parking therein.
         B.   Character. Accessory parking spaces may be open to the sky or
enclosed in a building.
         C.   Surfacing. All open off-street parking areas shall be surfaced
with a dustless all-weather material capable of carrying a wheel load of 4,000
pounds. A two-inch blacktop on a four-inch base or five inches of Portland
cement will meet this requirement, except where special soil-bearing problems
exist.
         D.   Screening and landscaping. All open vehicle parking areas shall
be screened and landscaped as required in
Chapter 1270.
         E.   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking
areas shall be directed away from residential properties and public streets in
such a way as not to create a nuisance. However, in no case shall such lighting
exceed three foot-candles measured at the lot line.
         F.   Wheelstops. Except for single and two-family residential uses,
all parking spaces shall be provided with wheel stops or bumper guards so
located that no part of parked vehicles will extend beyond the property line or
into required landscaped areas.
         G.   Shelter building. No parking lot for accessory off-street parking
shall have more than one attendant shelter building. All shelter buildings
shall conform to all setback requirements for structures in the district.
         H.   Signs. Accessory signs shall be permitted on parking areas in
accordance with the provisions specified in
Chapter 1276.
         I.   Repair and service. No commercial motor vehicle repair work or
service of any kind shall be permitted in association with accessory parking
facilities, except that emergency service required to start vehicles shall be
permitted.
         J.   Loud speakers prohibited. The operation of loud speakers shall be
prohibited in all parking areas.
   (b)   Parking of Commercial Vehicles in Residential Areas. The outdoor
parking of commercial vehicles on any property zoned or used for residential
purposes shall be permitted as follows:
      (1)   The parking of commercial vehicles having a gross vehicle weight
rating of 10,000 pounds or less shall be permitted on private property as
described in this subsection. Other than the exception in
1278.06(b)(5), the overnight parking of all other types of commercial vehicles
is prohibited.
      (2)   The vehicle must be used as the principle means of transportation
for the resident of the property in that resident’s employment or profession or
must be the resident’s sole means of motor vehicle transportation.
      (3)   If parked out of doors, one commercial vehicle is permitted per
lot, and shall be parked on the driveway. A second commercial vehicle is
permitted per lot if parked in an enclosed building.
      (4)   The parking or storage of trailers, parts, equipment, or materials
related to operation of a commercial vehicle is prohibited.
      (5)   The provisions of this section shall not prohibit the parking of
commercial vehicles on a single-family lot for the sole purpose of rendering an
immediate and/or current service on the lot (e.g. construction or repair,
landscaping, cleaning, etc.)
   (c)   Storage in or Sale of Goods From Parked Vehicles Restricted. The
storage in a sale of merchandise from parked vehicles shall be prohibited
except that such storage or sale of goods may be permitted as a special land
use for one period of not more than two weeks during any six-month period,
provided that it is done in conjunction with an existing conforming commercial
use.
   (d)   Specific Requirements. All off-street parking spaces hereinafter
required by this Zoning Code, except those required for one and two-family
dwellings, shall be designed in accordance with one of the formulas set forth
in the Off-Street Parking Table (Parking Classes). Parking spaces for accessory
uses not specifically enumerated within a parking class shall be assumed to be
included in the principal (permitted or special land) use requirement. If, for
any reason, the classification of any use, for the purpose of determining the
amount of off-street parking, or the number of spaces to provide for such use,
is not readily determinable hereunder, the parking class of such use shall be
fixed by the Zoning Board of Appeals.

1282.01 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   This Zoning Code establishes separate districts, each of which is an
appropriate area for the location of the uses which are permitted in that
district. It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of those
districts that those nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses which
substantially and adversely affect the orderly development and assessed value
of other property in the district not be permitted to continue without
restriction.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the regulation of
nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses and to specify those
circumstances and conditions under which those nonconforming buildings,
structures, and uses shall be permitted to continue.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1282.02 AUTHORITY TO CONTINUE NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES.
   Any nonconforming building, structure or use which existed lawfully at the
time of the adoption of this Zoning Code and which remains nonconforming, and
any such building, structure or use which shall become nonconforming upon the
adoption of this Zoning Code, or of any subsequent amendment thereto, may be
continued subject to the regulations which follow.
(Ord. 106. Passed 12-9-81.)
1282.03 REPAIRS AND ALTERATIONS.
   (a)   Building or Structure Designed or Intended for a Nonconforming Use.
Repairs and alterations may be made to a nonconforming building or structure,
provided that no structural alterations which increase the bulk of the building
or structure shall be made in or to a building or structure, all or
substantially all of which is designed or intended for a use not permitted in
the district in which it is located, except those required by law or except to
make the building or structure, and the use thereof, conform to the regulations
of the district in which it is located. For the purpose of this section,
repairs shall include the replacement of storage tanks where the safety of
operation of the installation requires such replacement, and other replacements
of, or substitutions for, machinery or equipment not involving structural
changes to the building or structure, except as hereinabove provided.

   Medical Marihuana Act - see M.C.L.A. §§ 333.26421, et seq.
1284.01   INTENT.
   (a)   It is the intent of this chapter to give effect to the intent of
M.C.L.A. §§ 333.26421, et seq, (the Act) as approved by the electors, and not
to determine and establish an altered policy with regard to marihuana. The Act
authorizes a narrow exception to the general rule and state policy that the
cultivation, distribution, and use of marihuana amount to criminal acts. It is
the further intent of this chapter to protect the public health, safety, and
general welfare of persons and property, and to license certain locations as
specified below. It is the further intent of this chapter to comply with the
Act while concurrently attempting to protect the health, safety, and welfare of
law enforcement officers and other persons in the community, and also to
address and minimize reasonably anticipated secondary effects upon children,
other members of the public, and upon significant areas of the community, that
would be reasonably expected to occur in the absence of the provisions of this
chapter. This chapter is designed to recognize the fundamental intent of the
Act to allow the creation and maintenance of a private and confidential
patient-caregiver relationship to facilitate the statutory authorization for
the limited cultivation, distribution, and use of marihuana for medical
purposes; and to regulate around this fundamental intent in a manner that does
not conflict with the Act so as to address issues that would otherwise expose
the community and its residents to significant adverse conditions, including
the following: adverse and long-term influence on children; substantial serious
criminal activity; danger to law enforcement and other members of the public;
discouragement and impairment of effective law enforcement with regard to
unlawful activity involving the cultivation, distribution, and use of
marihuana; the creation of a purportedly lawful commercial enterprise involving
the cultivation, distribution, and use of marihuana that is not reasonably
susceptible of being distinguished from serious criminal enterprise; and the
uninspected installation of unlawful plumbing and electrical facilities that
create dangerous health, safety, and fire conditions.
   (b)   This chapter permits authorizations for activity based on the Act.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as allowing persons to engage in
conduct that endangers others or causes a public nuisance, or to allow use,
cultivation, growth, possession or control of marihuana not in strict
accordance with the express authorizations of the Act and this chapter; and,
nothing in this chapter shall be construed to undermine or provide immunity
from federal law as it may be enforced by the federal or state government
relative to the cultivation, distribution, or use of marihuana. Thus, the
authorization of activity, and the approval of a license under this chapter
shall not have the effect of superseding or nullifying federal law applicable
to the cultivation, use, and possession of marihuana, and all applicants and
grantees of licenses are on notice that they may be subject to prosecution and
civil penalty, including forfeiture of property.

1284.03   REQUIREMENTS FOR LICENSE.
   Licensure requirements.
   (a)   The cultivation of marihuana by a caregiver or any other person
permitted under the Act, and the provision of caregiver services relating to
medical marihuana use, shall be permitted in accordance with the Act. No
cultivation, distribution, and other assistance to patients shall be lawful in
this community at a location unless and until such location for such
cultivation, distribution, and assistance is a permitted use, as specified in
the Village Zoning Ordinance, and shall have been licensed under this chapter.
Licensure shall be required and in accordance with these regulations for the
following:
      (1)   The location of a facility used for the cultivation of marihuana by
caregivers or by other persons permitted under the Act.
      (2)   The location of a facility used for distribution.
      (3)   The location of a facility used to provide any other assistance to
patients by caregivers or any other person permitted under the Act relating to
medical marihuana.
      (4)   By way of exception, it is not the intent of this chapter to
require a license for the principal residence of a patient where marihuana is
cultivated or used exclusively for the patient's personal consumption, however,
a location other than a patient's principal residence where a patient
cultivates or uses marihuana shall be subject to the licensure requirements of
this chapter.
   (b)   Application for License.
      (1)   The requirement of this chapter is to license a location, and not
to license persons. The information acquired through the licensing process
prescribed herein shall be accessible to the Zoning Administrator, Michigan
Construction Code and Fire Code enforcement officials, and law enforcement
officials and their support personnel in the performance of their duties and
shall otherwise remain confidential and not subject to public disclosure except
as otherwise required by law. The confidential information required for a
license application shall:
         A.   Not require the name, home address, or date of birth of a patient
or caregiver.
         B.   Include the address and legal description of the precise
premises, other than a patient's principal residence, at which there shall be
possession, cultivation, distribution or other assistance in the use of
marihuana. The fact that a caregiver or other person providing assistance to
patients also has an ID card as a patient shall not relieve the obligation to
provide this information.
         C.   Specify the address of the place where all unused portions of
marihuana plants cultivated in connection with the use of marihuana or
caregiver activity at the premises shall be disposed.
         D.   Describe the enclosed, locked facility in which any and all
cultivation of marihuana is proposed to occur, or where marihuana is stored,
with the description including: location in building; precise measurements in
feet, of the floor dimensions and height; the security device for the facility.
         E.   Describe all locations in the premises where a caregiver or other
person authorized under the Act shall render assistance to a qualifying
patient.
         F.   Specify the number of patients to be assisted, including the
number of patients for whom marihuana is proposed to be cultivated, and the
number of patients to be otherwise assisted on the premises, and the maximum
number of plants to be grown or cultivated at any one time. If the location at
which patients will be assisted is different from the licensed premises, the
application shall provide the address of all such other locations (other than
the address of a patient being assisted). The maximum number of patients and
plants is specified in Section
1284.03(b)(2)B. of these regulations.
         G.   Specify a waste disposal plan that describes how material,
chemical, and plant waste from the growing, cultivating, packaging, or use of
medical marihuana is disposed of.
         H.   For safety and other code inspection purposes, it shall describe
and provide detailed specifications of all lights, equipment, and all other
electrical, plumbing, and other means proposed to be used to facilitate the
cultivation of marihuana plants as the specifications relate to the need for
the installation of facilities. As noted in Section
1284.03(b)(2)D., all new construction including structural, electrical, and
plumbing shall meet current Village building codes and shall be inspected for
compliance.
      (2)   The standards of approval as noted below will be used to review
each application. An inspection will be made at each location noted in the
application to verify the standards.
      (3)   Requirements and standards for approval of licensure and for the
activity permitted.
         A.   Locations used for the cultivation of marihuana by caregivers and
any other person permitted under the Act, and the location used for the
provision of assistance to patients by caregivers or any other person
authorized under the Act relating to medical marihuana use, including
distribution or other assistance, but in all events not including a patient's
principal residence which is not used to cultivate marihuana or assist in the
use of medical marihuana for persons other than the patient at the residence,
shall be prohibited:
            1.   Within 500 feet from a public or private pre-school,
elementary school, middle school, high school, community college, and all other
schools that have different name references but serve students of the same age.
            2.   Within 500 feet of adult entertainment uses, as defined in the
Village Zoning Ordinance.
            3.   Within 500 feet from the site at which any other caregiver or
any other person cultivates marihuana, or assists in the use of marihuana, not
including a patient's principal residence which is not used to cultivate
marihuana or assist in the use of medical marihuana for persons other than the
patient at such residence.
            4.   Measurements for purposes of this subsection shall be made
from property boundary to property boundary.
         B.   The location of the facility at which a caregiver or any other
person permitted under the Act cultivates marihuana, or assists a patient in
the use of marihuana shall not be the same facility at which any other
caregiver or person cultivates marihuana, or assists a patient in the use of
marihuana. Accordingly, at a patient's principal residence used by the patient
to cultivate marihuana for his or her personal use as permitted under the Act,
there shall be not more than twelve marihuana plants being cultivated at any
one time; only at a licensed Facility may there be more than twelve marihuana
plants being cultivated at any one time; and, at a facility at which a
caregiver or any other person permitted under the Act cultivates marihuana for
use by patients, there shall not be more than twelve marihuana plants being
cultivated at any one time per patient, and in no event more than sixty
marihuana plants being cultivated at any one time (which assumes cultivation
for five patients), plus an additional twelve plants if the caregiver is also a
patient that has not designated a caregiver to assist in providing medical
marihuana.
         C.   In order to insulate children and other vulnerable individuals
from such actions, all medical marihuana cultivation, and all assistance of a
patient in the use of medical marihuana by a caregiver, shall occur within the
confines of a building licensed under this section, and these activities shall
occur only in locations not visible to the public. This subsection shall not
prohibit a caregiver from assisting a patient at the patient's principal
residence or at a hospital.
         D.   All lights, plumbing, equipment, and all other means proposed to
be used to facilitate the growth or cultivation of marihuana plants shall be in
accordance with all applicable Village building codes.
         E.   Considering that the distribution of marihuana is generally
unlawful, and that the Act authorizes "caregivers," and reading the Act as a
whole, the activities of caregivers are interpreted as being limited to private
and confidential endeavors. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to allow
dispensaries or collective ingestions facilities, which are hereby strictly
prohibited. Moreover, the location and identity of a caregiver is known to
patients. Accordingly:
               1.   There shall be no signage identifying a caregiver use or a
place at which medical marihuana is distributed.
               2.   Unless conducted as part of a related licensed professional
medical or pharmaceutical practice, caregiver activity shall not be advertised
as a "clinic," "hospital," "dispensary," or other name customarily ascribed to
a multi-patient professional practice.
         F.   Storage of toxic, flammable or hazardous materials at a licensed
facility is prohibited. The disposing of any toxic, flammable or hazardous
materials into the sewer system is also prohibited.
   (c)   No application for a license hereunder shall be approved without
payment of a non-refundable application fee to help defer the cost of
administering and enforcing this chapter. The application fee shall be set by
resolution of Village Council and may be adjusted from time to time thereafter
as the Village Council deems appropriate.
   (d)   Use of land in accordance with approved application.  If approved, all
use of property shall be in accordance with an approved application, including
all information and specifications submitted by the applicant in reliance on
which the application shall be deemed to have been approved.
   (e)   A facility that exists on the effective date of this chapter must make
application for and receive approval to continue to operate; provided, an
application shall be filed within fifteen days following the effective date of
this chapter. If an application for licensure under this chapter is denied due
to the minimum distance requirement standards, and a timely application has
been filed seeking licensure under this chapter, the facility shall have sixty
days from the date of application denial to cease operating at the denied site.
(Ord. 106A-59. Passed 7-11-12.)
1284.04   RESTRICTION ON DISTRIBUTION.
   (a)   The restrictions in this section are based on the following findings:
      (1)   The Act as a whole reflects the intent to a private and
confidential patient-caregiver relationship to facilitate the lawful
cultivation, distribution, and use of marihuana strictly for medical purposes,
that is, an authorization for confidential and private use of marihuana by
patients, and for confidential and private assistance in such use by caregivers
with whom individual patients are connected through the Department's
registration process. That is, the Act does not authorize the broad
legalization of the cultivation, distribution, or use of marihuana, and a
reading that permits such broad legalization is inconsistent with the
fundamental intent of the Act read as a whole in context with generally
applicable Michigan law. Thus, it would be reasonable to expect and require
that all undertakings of caregivers and other persons in assisting a patient
are intended to occur on a confidential and private one-to-one basis.
      (2)   The Act does not reflect the intent for distributions of marihuana
by more than one caregiver or other person to one patient, or by one or more
caregivers or other persons to more than one patient at any given time and
place.
      (3)   The confidentiality provisions of the Act reflect the intent for
all caregivers and patients to remain anonymous in terms of their name and
address, thus further reflecting the private and confidential nature of the
activities contemplated between a caregiver and the patient he or she is
assisting.
      (4)   In view of the fact that the Act effectively requires law
enforcement officers to seek to prevent unlawful cultivation, distribution or
consumption of marihuana, while concurrently permitting substantially the same
actions by those who meet the terms of the Act, and considering that law
enforcement officials are prohibited from having access to important
information that could be used to distinguish unlawful and lawful actors, it is
deemed necessary by the legislative body of the community to maintain by
licensure and restriction an environment that seeks to promote the protection,
efficiency, and effectiveness of law enforcement officers and their work
performed in connection with the cultivation, distribution or consumption of
marihuana.
      (5)   All of the findings stated above in support of the requirement for
licensure are incorporated by reference to this subsection of the chapter.
   (b)   Restrictions:
      (1)   A caregiver and any other person authorized under the Act to assist
patients, if any, shall distribute medical marihuana only on a confidential,
one-to-one, basis with no other caregiver being present at the same facility at
the same time, and no other patient or other person being present at the same
facility at the same time, provided, that a patient's immediate family members
or guardian may be present within the patient's private residence, and one
family member or guardian may be present in any facility other than the
patient's private residence. For purposes of this subsection, the phrase "same
time" shall mean and include concurrently as well as within a time interval of
one hour.
      (2)   Considering the health issues presented, no food shall be sold from
the facility used for the distribution of medical marihuana.
(Ord. 106A-59. Passed 7-11-12.)
1284.05   INSPECTION OF PATIENT CULTIVATION.
   Upon the request of a patient who is cultivating medical marihuana, the
medical marihuana officer of the community shall confidentially coordinate
electrical and plumbing inspectors (and other inspector(s) within whose
expertise an inspection is needed) with regard to site of the cultivation for
the purpose of determining whether all lights, plumbing, equipment, and all
other means used to facilitate the cultivation of marihuana plants is in
accordance with applicable code. In carrying out the provisions of this
subsection, community officials shall not require the name and address of the
patient. Rather, the intent of this subsection is to focus on the premises, and
to insure fire, electrical, plumbing, and other safety for the benefit of the
resident of the premises and others who may be affected by one or more code
violations.
(Ord. 106A-59. Passed 7-11-12.)
1284.06   DISCLAIMER OF IMMUNITY.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as allowing the use, cultivation,
distribution or possession of marihuana not in strict compliance with the
express provisions of the Act and this chapter. Further, nothing in this
chapter shall be construed to undermine or provide immunity from federal or
state law as it may be enforced by the federal or state government relative to
the use, cultivation, distribution or possession of marihuana or to prevent
prosecution thereunder.
(Ord. 106A-59. Passed 7-11-12.)
1284.07   NO VESTED RIGHTS.
   A property owner shall not have vested rights or nonconforming use rights
that would serve as a basis for failing to comply with this chapter or any
amendment of this chapter.
(Ord. 106A-59. Passed 7-11-12.)
1284.08   REVOCATION OF LICENSE.
   (a)   A license issued pursuant to this chapter may be revoked for any of
the following reasons:
      (1)   The license holder has violated any of the provisions of this
chapter or any statute of the State of Michigan relative to the cultivation of
marihuana by a caregiver or the provision of caregiver services relating to
medical marihuana use.
      (2)   Fraud, misrepresentation, or incorrect statements have been made by
the license holder in the course of carrying on an activity or in application
for the licensed activity.
      (3)   The license holder has conducted an activity in such a manner as to
constitute a breach of the peace or a menace to the health, safety or general
welfare of the public.
   (b)   If upon investigation by the Village, it is discovered that a license
holder has violated any regulations of this chapter, written notice of the
violation shall be issued, by certified mail, to that person. Immediately upon
the giving of the notice, the license shall become null and void.
   (c)   Denials may be appealed to the Village Council. The Village Council
shall make a determination after presentation by the applicant, supported by a
preponderance of the evidence, as to whether or not the grounds for denial
should be upheld. The Village Council's decision may be reviewed by a court of
competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 106A-59. Passed 7-11-12.)
1284.99   PENALTY.
   Any person violating any provisions of this chapter shall be deemed
responsible for committing a municipal civil infraction and shall be
responsible for a municipal civil fine. In addition to ordering the offender
determined to be responsible for a municipal civil infraction to pay a civil
fine, costs, damages and expenses, the judge or magistrate shall be authorized
to issue any judgment, writ or order necessary to enforce or enjoin violation
of this Code. Each day on which any violation of this Code or any ordinance
continues is a separate offense and shall be subject to penalties or sanctions
as a separate offense. In addition to any penalties provided for in this Code,
any equitable or other remedies available may be sought.

   (b)   The person requesting a permit under this chapter shall set forth in
his or her application the streets, alleys and other public places upon and
through which the proposed building will be moved and the name of the owner of
the building. An application for such permit shall be accompanied by a permit
fee as established from time to time by Council. All applications to move
buildings into the Village from another city, village or township shall be

preliminary inspections.
   (c)   The applicant shall submit a schedule of the time and routes approved
by the Chief of Police when said proposed building or structure shall be moved.
The applicant shall also notify all utility companies and the Building

application. The person moving the building shall post on such building, in a
conspicuous place, the permit which shall be given by the Building Inspector
after compliance with this chapter.
   (d)   In the moving of said building the Building Inspector shall issue a

compliance with the terms and conditions contained in this chapter and as
provided herein. In the event a permit to move a building is requested the
applicant shall accompany his or her application with a cash deposit, in such
sum as determined from time to time by Council, to protect the Village of
Wolverine Lake against any delays, negligence in removing said building from
its location and/or Village expense incurred in the moving or in cleaning up
the premises and removing rubbish or debris from its former location. Said cash
deposit shall also be conditioned to reimburse the Village for any expenses
incurred by the Fire, Police, Building or Public Works Department or any other
Village department in connection with such moving, and such Departments shall

Village to bring the building into compliance with Village ordinances or to
place the premises where the building has been removed in a neat and level
condition free from rubbish and debris. The cash bond shall be held by the
Village until after payment of all Village expenses has been made and after the
premises have been restored to a safe, neat, clean and tidy condition and in

($1,000,000) for any one accident, and five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000)
property damage.
   (g)   In the event a permit is requested to wreck a building, the cash
deposit shall be as provided in Section

and gas services shall be removed by the utility company.
(Ord. 35. Passed 12-8-58.)

alley or public place on skids.
(Ord. 35. Passed 12-8-58.)

1478.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and
welfare of Village residents and to protect property values, quality of life,
and natural systems relating to storm water runoff control and management. The
Village finds it is a matter of public concern and benefit to protect water
bodies and properties within the Village and to reduce the future need for
public expenditures relating to flooding, water quality, and storm water system
maintenance. Both the quality and quantity of storm water runoff are a matter
of public concern.
(Ord. 154. Passed 10-12-11.)
1478.02   FINDINGS AND OBJECTIVES.
   (a)   Findings. The Village finds that storm water regulation and management
is a matter of public health, safety, and welfare because:
      (1)   Water bodies, roadways, structures, and other property within, and
downstream of the Village are at times subjected to flooding;
      (2)   Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is
also a danger to the natural resources of the Village and the region;
      (3)   Changes in land use alter the hydrologic response of watersheds,
resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which further
result in increased flooding, increased stream channel erosion, and increased
sediment transport and deposition;
      (4)   Stormwater runoff produced by changes in land use contributes to
increased quantities of water-borne pollutants;
      (5)   Increases of stormwater runoff, soil erosion, and non-point source
pollution have occurred as a result of changes in land use, and cause
deterioration of the water resources within and downstream of the Village;
      (6)   Increased storm water runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments
and pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future earth change
projects within the Village will, absent reasonable regulation and control,
adversely affect the Village water bodies and water resources, the resources
contained therein, and those of downstream municipalities;
      (7)   Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, and non-point source pollution can
be controlled and minimized by the regulation of stormwater runoff from earth
changes and by the use of best management practices and other innovative means;
      (8)   Adopting and implementing the standards, criteria and procedures
contained in this chapter will address many of the deleterious effects of
stormwater runoff, both from a water quality and a water quantity perspective;
      (9)   Adopting these standards is necessary for the preservation of the
public health, safety, and welfare and mitigation of adverse impacts from
stormwater runoff.
   (b)   Objectives. Based on the findings listed above, the Village has
established the following objectives to guide administration, decision-making,
and enforcement of this chapter. It is therefore the purpose of this chapter to
establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to
accomplish, among others, the following objectives:
      (1)   To reduce flood damage;
      (2)   To minimize increased storm water runoff rates and volumes due to
changes in land use;
      (3)   To minimize the physical deterioration of existing watercourses,
culverts and bridges, and other structures;
      (4)   To encourage water recharge into the ground where geologically
favorable conditions exist;
      (5)   To prevent an increase in non-point source pollution;
      (6)   To maintain the integrity of stream channels for their biological
functions, as well as for drainage and other purposes;
      (7)   To minimize the impact of changes in land use upon stream bank and
streambed stability;
      (8)   To reduce erosion from earth change or construction projects;
      (9)   To preserve and protect water supply facilities and water resources
by means of controlling increased flood discharges, stream erosion, and runoff
pollution;
      (10)   To reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, and
non-point source pollution, wherever practicable, from lands proposed for
redevelopment that were not previously developed with stormwater management
controls meeting the purposes and standards of this chapter;
      (11)   To reduce the adverse impact of changing land use on neighboring
properties and water bodies and, to that end, this ordinance establishes
minimum standards to protect water bodies from degradation resulting from
changing land use.
(Ord. 154. Passed 10-12-11.)
1478.03   DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have
the meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section unless the context
in which they are used specifically indicates otherwise:
   (a)   “Best Management Practices (BMPs).” A practice, or combination of
practices and design criteria that comply with the Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality’s Guidebook of BMPs for Michigan Watersheds, or
equivalent practices and design criteria that accomplish the purposes of this
chapter (including, but not limited to minimizing stormwater runoff and
preventing the discharge of pollutants into stormwater) as determined by the
Village Engineer, and, when applicable, the standards of the Oakland County
Water Resources Commissioner.
   (b)   “Changes in Land Use.” Any land use change, including, but not limited
to, construction, earth change, and redevelopment.
   (c)   “Cutting.” An earth change, which lowers topography or removes soil.
   (d)   “Design Storm.” A precipitation event of a designated amount and/or
frequency. Typically used in a regulatory setting to designate required design
criteria for stormwater facilities.
   (e)   “Detention.” A system, which is designed to capture stormwater and
release it over a given period of time through an outlet structure at a
controlled rate.
   (f)   “Detention Basin.” A designed (although may be a natural area)
facility which stores and detains runoff and releases water at a controlled
rate. Size will depend on the design storm event (ten-, 25-, 100-year storm).
These basins may be dry between runoff events or may be “wet bottom,” where a
base water level occurs below the elevation of the outlet structure.
   (g)   “Developed” or “Development.” The installation or construction of
impervious surfaces on a development site that require, pursuant to state law
or local ordinance, the Village approval of a site plan, plat, site
condominium, special land use, planned unit development, land division
approval, private road approval or other approvals required for the development

less than 10% of the original face value of the irrevocable letter of credit
for a period of one year and one day after the Village Engineer’s designation
noted above. The purpose of this retainage is to guarantee that the stormwater
facilities perform as designed. This chapter shall not be construed or
interpreted as relieving an applicant of its obligation to pay all costs
associated with onsite private stormwater facilities as well as those costs
arising from the need to make other drainage improvements in order to reduce an
earth change’s impact to property owners and watercourses.
(Ord. 154. Passed 10-12-11.)
1478.10   APPEALS.
   A person aggrieved by the decision of the Planning Commission or Village
Council with respect to an action regarding the stormwater management plan may
appeal the action to the Zoning Board of Appeals pursuant to the process
defined in
Chapter 1244 of the Village Code.
(Ord. 154. Passed 10-12-11.)
1478.11   GENERAL DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   Responsibility. The Village is not responsible for providing drainage
facilities on private property for the management of stormwater on the private
property. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain
private stormwater facilities serving the property and to prevent or correct
the accumulation of debris, which interferes with the drainage or stormwater
management function of the system. All developments and earth changes subject
to review under the requirements of this chapter shall be designed,
constructed, and maintained to control runoff, prevent flooding and protect
water quality. The particular facilities and measures required onsite shall
reflect the natural features, wetland, and watercourses on the site; the
potential for onsite and offsite flooding, water pollution, and erosion; and
the size of the site.
   (b)   General Standards for Onsite and Offsite Stormwater Management.
      (1)   Stormwater facilities shall be designed to prevent flood hazards
and water pollution related to stormwater runoff, soil erosion and channel
erosion from the proposed earth change.
      (2)   Existing stormwater from upstream and offsite locations shall be
conveyed around or through the site, or stored onsite.
      (3)   Every stormwater facility shall control the release of stormwater
in accordance with the design standards adopted by Village Council resolution.
      (4)   Unless otherwise approved, stormwater runoff shall be conveyed
through swales and vegetated buffer strips so as to decrease runoff velocity,
allow for natural infiltration and passive storage, allow suspended sediment
particles to settle, and to remove pollutants.
      (5)   Alterations to natural drainage patterns shall not increase runoff,
create flooding or water pollution for adjacent or downstream property owners.
      (6)   Cutting, filling, and grading shall be minimized and the natural
topography of the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable,
except where specific findings demonstrate that major alterations will still
meet the purposes and requirements of this chapter.
      (7)   Grading of lands at locations that are adjacent to or near lands,
streets, alleys, sidewalks, or other public or private property shall be done
in a manner to protect the property from settling, cracking or sustaining other
damage.
      (8)   All development and other earth changes shall be designed,
constructed, and completed so that the exposed area of any disturbed land is
limited to the shortest possible period of time.
      (9)   Damage to public utilities or services and damage to or impairment
of any water body on or near the location of any water body shall be prevented.
      (10)   Natural wetlands shall be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable.
      (11)   Increased offsite release of stormwater shall be minimized to the
maximum extent practicable. Therefore, the volume of stormwater shall be
managed and stored to the maximum extent practicable.
      (12)   The increased volume of water discharged due to earth changes and/
or development of the site shall not create adverse impacts to property owners
and watercourses. These adverse impacts may include, but are not limited to
flooding, excessive soil saturation, crop damage, erosion, and/or degradation
in water quality or habitat.
      (13)   Discharges or flows from firefighting activities to the Village's
storm sewer system are not prohibited, provided, however, that they must be
addressed if they are identified as significant sources of pollution to the
waters of the State of Michigan.
      (14)   If identified as a significant contributor of pollutants to the
Village's storm sewer system, the following categories of non-stormwater
discharges or flows shall be prohibited:
         A.   Water line flushing and discharges from potable water sources;
         B.   Landscape irrigation runoff, lawn watering runoff, and irrigation
waters;
         C.   Diverted stream flows and flows from riparian habitats and
wetlands;
         D.   Rising groundwaters and springs;
         E.   Uncontaminated groundwater infiltration and seepage;
         F.   Uncontaminated pumped groundwater, except for groundwater
cleanups specifically authorized by NPDES permits;
         G.   Foundation drains, water from crawl space pumps, footing drains,
and basement sump pumps;
         H.   Air conditioning condensation;
         I.   Waters from noncommercial car washing;
         J.   Street wash water; and
         K.   Dechlorinated swimming pool water, including water from spas, hot
tubs and similar facilities, from single, two, or three family residences. (A
swimming pool, spa, hot tub or similar facility operated by the permittee shall
not be discharged to a separate storm sewer or to surface waters of the state
without NPDES permit authorization from EGLE.)
   (c)   Stormwater Facilities. The types of stormwater facilities are listed
in order of preference, with the most desirable listed first.
      (1)   Infiltration Facilities. This chapter encourages the use of
infiltration systems as a part of stormwater management plan design. Stormwater
storage and/or infiltration facilities, which protect water quality and
minimize flooding, shall be designed to meet the standards of this chapter.
Storage facilities may include, but are not limited to, detention basins,
retention basins, infiltration trenches, swales with check dams, bioretention
structures and other facilities and/or BMP's proposed by the applicant. It
shall be the responsibility of the applicant to demonstrate that all proposed
facilities meet the intent, goals, and standards of this chapter. As the rate
of percolation/infiltration of water into the soil column varies depending on
the soil type, the type of infiltration system used may be site specific.
Stormwater management plan designers shall consider soil permeability when
designing storm water infiltration components of a management system. The site
developer shall attempt to minimize compaction of soil, which decreases
infiltration and groundwater recharge and contributes to increased stormwater
runoff.
      (2)   Stormwater Storage Facilities. All detention and/or retention
basins shall be designed to meet the standards of this chapter. The types of
basins are listed in order of preference, with the most desirable listed first:
         A.   Wet basins, or detention basins with a fixed minimum water
elevation between runoff events. Wet basins, which serve to trap soil particles
onsite, are preferable to dry basins.
         B.   Detention basins, which detain the first flush of an event and
attenuate its release over an extended period.
         C.   Extended detention basins, which hold stormwater from a less
frequent storm event over an extended period before completely draining to
become a dry basin. Dry basins without extended detention shall not be
permitted.
         D.   Detention and/or retention basins shall be designed to hold
