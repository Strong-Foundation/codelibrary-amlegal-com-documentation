WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with The Justinian
Publishing Company to prepare and publish such codification; and
WHEREAS, the codification of such legislation, together with the new matter to

THE CITY OF REED CITY ORDAINS:
   Section 1.   Approval, Adoption and Enactment of Codified Ordinances. All
general and permanent legislation enacted by the legislative authority of the

   Section 2.   Approval, Adoption and Enactment of New Matter. The following
sections and subsections in the Codified Ordinances are or contain new matter
not previously enacted by Council in its presently codified form, such new
matter having been found to be necessary, in the course of preparing the
Codified Ordinances, to reconcile City legislation, to revise City law to
conform to State law and local conditions, to update technical codes adopted by
the City by reference, and to remove uncertainties and ambiguities in the
legislative record with respect to numbering and passage of legislation, and,
pursuant to Section 7.9 of the City Charter, such new matter is hereby

   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances, including the new matter
contained therein, shall not be construed to affect a right or liability
accrued or incurred under any legislative provision prior to the effective date
of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for the enforcement of such right
or liability. Such enactment shall not be construed to relieve any person from
punishment for an act committed in violation of any such legislative provision,
nor to affect a prosecution or indictment therefor. For such purposes, any such
legislative provision shall continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal
for the purpose of revision and codification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
         (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement

         (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or
guarantee of payment;
         (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation;
         (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness;
         (6)   The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges;
         (7)   The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street
or public way;

Charter, either separately or as part of the published Council proceedings.
   Pursuant to Section 7.9 of the City Charter, the City Clerk shall publish
notice of the printing and availability of the Codified Ordinances before the
effective date thereof. Further, and also pursuant to Section 7.9 of the City
Charter, the City Clerk shall make copies of the Codified Ordinances available
for inspection by, and distribution to, the public at a reasonable charge. No
further publication of the Codified Ordinances shall be necessary.

EDITOR'S NOTE
The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is consistent with the
best accepted practice for codification. Each section is self-identifying as to
code, chapter and section number. For example, 238.01 indicates that the code
number is 2, the chapter number is 238 (or the 38th chapter within code 2), and
the section number is .01. The code and chapter numbers appear left of the
decimal, with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the
decimal, and the chapter number being the first two digits left of the decimal.
The section number appears to the right of the decimal. As another example,
410.01 indicates that the code number is 4, the chapter number is 410 (or the
10th chapter within code 4), and the section number is .01.
With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99. Newly created sections subsequent to the original
codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event
the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For
example, newly created 662.021, 662.022 and 662.023 follow 662.02 and precede
662.03 to be placed in their logical position.
Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the
section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the adopting ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

Section 5.10 Every officer, elective or appointive, before entering upon the
duties of his office, shall take the oath of office prescribed for public
officers by the Constitution and shall file the oath with the Clerk, together
with any bond required by statute, this charter or by the Council. In case of
failure to comply with the provisions of this section within ten days from the
date he is notified in writing of his election or appointment, such officer
shall be deemed to have declined the office and such office shall thereupon
become vacant unless the Council shall by resolution extend the time in which
such officer may qualify.
Surety Bonds:
Section 5.11 Except as otherwise provided in this charter, all officers of the
city whose duties involve the custody of public property or the handling of
public funds, either by way of receipt or disbursement or both, and all other
officers and employees so required by the Council shall, before they enter upon
the duties of their respective offices, file with the city an official bond, in
such form and amount as the Council shall direct and approve.
Such official bond of every officer and employee shall be conditioned that he
will faithfully perform the duties of his office, and will on demand deliver
over to his successor in office, or other proper officer or an agent of the
city, all books, papers, moneys, effects and property belonging thereto, or
appertaining to his office, which may be in his custody as an officer or
employee; and such bonds may be further conditioned as the Council shall
prescribe. The official bond of every officer whose duty it may be to receive
or pay out money, besides being conditioned as above required, shall be further
conditioned that he will, on demand, pay over or account for to the city, or
any proper officer or agent thereof, all moneys received by him as such officer
or employee. The requirements of this paragraph may be met by the purchase of
one or more appropriate blanket surety bonds covering all, or a group of, city
employees and officers.
All official bonds shall be corporate surety bonds and the premium thereon
shall be paid by the city. The Clerk shall be custodian of all the bonds of all
officers or employees, except that the Treasurer shall be custodian of any
bonds pertaining solely to the Clerk.

papers, moneys and effects in his custody as such officer or employee. Any
officer violating this provision may be proceeded against in the same manner as
public officers generally for a like offense under statute. Any employee found
guilty of violating this provision by a competent tribunal may be punished by a
fine of not to exceed five hundred dollars or imprisonment for not to exceed
ninety days, or both, in the discretion of the court.

   (a)   No contract or purchase involving an amount in excess of one hundred
dollars shall be made by the city in which any elective or appointive officer
or any member of his family has any pecuniary interest, direct or indirect. A
"contract" shall for the purposes of this section include any arrangement or
agreement pursuant to which any material, service or other thing of value is to
be furnished to the city for a valuable consideration to be paid by the city or
sold or transferred by the city, except the furnishing of personal services as
an officer or employee of the city; and the term "member of his family" shall
include spouse, children, and the spouse of any of them.
   (b)   Without limiting the generality of paragraph (a) of this section, an
officer shall be deemed to have a pecuniary interest in a contract if he or any
member of his family is an employee, partner, officer, director, or sales
representative of the person, firm or corporation with which such contract is
made or of a sales representative of such person, firm or corporation.
Ownership, individually or in a fiduciary capacity, by an officer or member of
his family of securities, or of any beneficial interest in securities, of any
corporation with which a contract is made or which is a sales representative of
any person, firm or corporation with which such contract is made, shall not be
deemed to create a pecuniary interest in such contract unless the aggregate
amount of such securities, or interest in such securities, so owned by such
officer and the members of his family, shall amount to ten per cent of any
class of the securities of such corporation then outstanding.
   (c)   Any officer who knowingly permits the city to enter into any contract
in which he has a pecuniary interest without disclosing such interest to the
Council prior to the action of the Council in authorizing such contract shall
be guilty of misconduct in office. The unanimous determination (by vote or
written instrument filed with the Clerk) of the Council that in a particular
case an officer or member of his family will not have a pecuniary interest in a
contract or purchase to be entered into by the City shall be final and
conclusive in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation.
   (d)   No officer shall stand as surety on any bond to the city or give any
bail for any other person which may be required by the charter or any ordinance
of the city. Any officer of the city who violates the provisions of this
paragraph shall be guilty of misconduct in office.

shall be recorded as part of its official proceedings, determine that the best
interests of the city shall be served, the following relatives of any elective
or appointive officer are disqualified from holding any appointive office or
employment during the term for which said elective or appointive officer was
elected or appointed: spouse, child, parent, grandchild, grandparent, brother,
sister, half-brother, half-sister, or the spouses of any of them. All

officers or employees for the city at the time of the election of said elective
official.
Compensation of Employees and Officers:
Section 5.15
   (a)   The compensation of all employees and officers of the city whose

with any pay plan adopted by the Council.

fixed by, or pursuant to, this charter shall be in full for all official
services of such officers or employees and shall be in lieu of all fees,
commissions and other compensation receivable by such officers or employees for
their services. Such fees, commissions and compensation shall belong to the
city and shall be collected and accounted for by such officers or employees,
and be paid into the city treasury and a statement thereof filed periodically
with the City Manager. The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section shall
not apply to fees, commissions or other compensation paid by the County of
Osceola to any officer or employee serving as a city representative on the
Board of Supervisors.

prepared. The omission of such endorsement shall not affect the validity of
such roll.

ensuing year, the Clerk shall certify to the Assessor the total amount which

taxes shall become a first lien on all personal property of such persons so
assessed. Such lien shall take precedence over all other claims, encumbrances
and liens to the extent provided by statute and shall continue until such
taxes, interest and charges are paid.
Taxes Due: Notification Thereof:
Section 9.15 City taxes shall be due on July first of each year. The Treasurer

be due for collection and the penalties and fees for late payment of same, and
(b) mail a bill to each person named in said roll, but in cases of multiple
ownership of property only one bill need be mailed.
Failure on the part of the Treasurer to publish said notice or mail such bills
shall not invalidate the taxes on said tax roll nor release the person or
property assessed from the penalties and fees provided in this chapter in case
of late payment or non-payment of the same.
Interest on Late Payment of Taxes:

taxes and on the first day of October and of each succeeding month, he shall
add an additional one-half of one per cent of said taxes that remain unpaid.
Such interest shall not exceed six per cent and shall belong to the city and
constitute a charge and shall be a lien against the property to which the taxes
themselves apply, collectable in the same manner as the taxes to which they are
added. It is provided, however, that if delivery of the tax roll to the
Treasurer, as provided in Section
9.13, is delayed for any reason by more than thirty days after June first, the
application of the interest charge provided herein shall be postponed thirty
days for the first thirty days of such delay and shall be postponed an
additional thirty days for each additional thirty days, or major fraction
thereof, of such delay.

any personal property tax assessed to him or them by October first, the
Treasurer shall collect the same by seizing the personal property of such
person, firm or corporation to an amount sufficient to pay such tax fees and
charges for subsequent sale, wherever the same may be found in the state, and
from which seizure no property shall be exempt. He may sell the property seized
to an amount sufficient to pay the taxes and all charges in accordance with
statutory provisions. The Treasurer may, if otherwise unable to collect a tax
on personal property sue, in accordance with statute, the person, firm or
corporation to whom it is assessed.
Delinquent Tax Roll to County Treasurer:

Treasurer on the first day of March following the date when said roll was
received by him shall be returned to the County Treasurer in the manner and
with like effect as provided by statute for returns by township treasurers of
township, school and county taxes. Such returns shall include all the
additional assessments, charges and fees hereinbefore provided, which shall be
added to the amount assessed in said tax roll against each property or person.

property taxes, such delinquent taxes shall be collected in the manner then
provided by statute for the collection of delinquent township, school and
county taxes.

Section 14.2 Public utility franchises and all renewals and extensions thereof
and amendments thereto shall be granted by ordinance only. No exclusive
franchise shall ever be granted. No franchise shall be granted for a longer
period than thirty years.
No franchise ordinance which is not subject to revocation at the will of the

all terms of such franchise. No special election for such purpose shall be
ordered unless the expense of holding such election, as determined by the

A franchise ordinance or renewal or extension thereof or amendment thereto
which is subject to revocation at the will of the Council may be enacted by the
Council without referral to the voters, but shall not be enacted unless it
shall have been complete in the form in which it is finally enacted and shall
have so been on file in the office of the Clerk for public inspection for at
least four weeks after publication of a notice that such ordinance is on file.
Conditions of Public Utility Franchises:
Section 14.3 All public utility franchises granted after the adoption of this

subject to the following rights of the city, but this enumeration shall not be
exclusive or impair the right of the Council to insert in such franchise any
provision within the power of the city to impose or require:

provisions thereof;
   (b)   To require proper and adequate extension of plant and service and
maintenance thereof at the highest practicable standard of efficiency;

and prevent unjust discrimination in service or rates;

accordance with the terms of the franchise throughout the entire period
thereof;

   (f)   To impose such other regulations as may be determined by the Council
to be conducive to the safety, welfare and accommodation of the public.
Regulation of Rates:
Section 14.4 All public utility franchises shall make provision therein for
fixing rates, fares and charges, and may provide for readjustments thereof at
periodic intervals. The value of the property of the utility used as a basis
for fixing such rates, fares and charges, shall in no event include a value
predicated upon the franchise, goodwill or prospective profits.
Use of Public Places by Utilities:
Section 14.5 Every public utility whether it has a franchise or not shall pay
such part of the cost of improvement or maintenance of streets, alleys, bridges
and other public places as shall arise from its use thereof and shall protect
and save the city harmless from all damages arising from said use. Every such
public utility may be required by the city to permit joint use of its property
and appurtenances located in the streets, alleys and other public places of the
city by the city and by other utilities insofar as such joint use may be
reasonably practicable and upon payment of reasonable rental therefor. In the
absence of agreement and upon application by any public utility, the Council
shall provide for arbitration of the terms and conditions of such joint use and
the compensation to be paid therefor, and the arbitration award shall be final.

(1981 Code § 1.153)

lot or parcel of land bears to the total benefits to all lands in such
district. There shall also be entered upon such roll the amount which has been
assessed to the City at large.
(1981 Code § 1.158)
208.09   ASSESSOR 'S CERTIFICATE.
   When the Assessor or assessing officers shall have completed the assessment
roll, he or she shall attach thereto, or endorse thereon, his or her
certificate to the effect that said roll has been made by him or her pursuant
to a resolution of the Council (giving the date of adoption of same) and that
in making the assessments therein he or she has, as near as may be, according
to his or her best judgment, conformed in all respects to the directions
contained in such resolution, and to the City Charter and the provisions of
this chapter. Thereupon he or she shall file said special assessment roll with
the Clerk who shall present the same to the Council.
(1981 Code § 1.159)
208.10   NOTICE OF HEARING ON ROLL.
   Upon receipt of the special assessment roll, the Council shall order it
filed in the office of the Clerk for public examination and shall fix the time
and place when it will meet and review such roll, which meeting shall be held
not less than ten days after notice thereof has been sent by the Clerk by first
class mail to all property owners in the proposed district as shown by the
current assessment roll of the City. Such notice shall specify the time and
place of such meeting. The Council may, in its discretion, publish notice of
said meeting not less than ten days prior to the date of said meeting.
(1981 Code § 1.160)

208.12   HEARING ON ROLL.
   The Council shall meet and review the said special assessment roll at the

any written objections thereto. The Council may correct said roll as to any
assessment or description of any lot or parcel of land, or other errors
appearing therein. Any changes made in such roll shall be noted in the
Council's minutes. After such hearing and review the Council may confirm such
special assessment roll with such corrections as it may have made, if any, may
refer it back to the Assessor or assessing officers for revision or may annul
it and any proceedings in connection therewith. No original special assessment
roll shall be finally confirmed, except by the affirmative vote of five of the
members of the Council, if, prior to such confirmation, written objections to
the proposed improvement have been filed by the owners of property which will
be required to bear more than fifty percent of the amount of such special
assessment. The Clerk shall endorse the date of confirmation upon each special
assessment roll. (1981 Code § 1.162)
208.13   CONFIRMATION FINAL.
   The special assessment roll shall, upon confirmation, be final and
conclusive.
(1981 Code § 1.163)
208.14   ESTABLISHMENT OF LIEN.
   All special assessments contained in any special assessment roll, including
any part thereof deferred as to payment, shall, from the date of confirmation
of such roll, constitute a lien upon the respective lots or parcels of land
assessed and until paid shall be a charge against the respective owners of the
several lots and parcels of land and a debt to the City from the persons to
whom they are assessed. Such lien shall be of the same character and effect as
the lien created by the City Charter for City taxes and shall include accrued
interest and penalties. No judgment or decree, nor any act of the Council
vacating a special assessment, shall destroy or impair the lien of the City
upon the premises assessed for such amount of the assessment as may be
equitably charged against the same, or as by a regular mode of proceeding might
be lawfully assessed thereon. All special assessments shall become due upon
confirmation of the special assessment roll or in annual installments not to
exceed fifteen in number as the Council may determine at the time of
confirmation. If in annual installments, the Council shall determine the first
installment to be due upon confirmation or on the following July 1 and
subsequent installments on July 1 of succeeding years. (1981 Code § 1.164)
208.15   COLLECTION STATEMENTS.
   The assessment roll shall be transmitted by the Clerk to the Treasurer for
collection immediately after its confirmation. The Treasurer shall give notice
by one publication in a newspaper which shall meet the requirements of the

his or her office and specifying when and where payments may be made thereon.
He or she may mail statements of the several assessments to the respective
owners, as indicated by the records of the Assessor or assessing officers of
the several lots and parcels of land assessed, stating the amount of the
assessment and the manner in which it may be paid; provided, however, that
failure to mail any such statement shall not invalidate the assessment or
entitle the owner to an extension of time within which to pay the assessment.
(1981 Code § 1.165)
208.16   DIVISION INTO INSTALLMENTS.
   The whole or any part of any such assessment may be paid during the period
of sixty days from the date of confirmation of the special assessment roll
without interest or penalty. Not later than fifteen days after the end of said
sixty-day period the Treasurer shall transmit such roll to the Assessor or
assessing officers with all payments upon assessments noted thereon. The
Assessor shall then divide any remaining balance of each assessment into such
number of equal installments as shall have been fixed by the Council, provided
that if such division operates to make any installment less than ten dollars
($10.00), then the Assessor shall reduce the number of installments so that
each installment shall be above and as near to ten dollars ($10.00) as
possible.
(1981 Code § 1.166)
208.17   SPREADING INSTALLMENTS ON TAX ROLLS.
   The first installment shall be spread upon the next City tax roll in a
column headed "Special Assessments", together with interest upon all unpaid
installments from the date of the confirmation of the roll to July 1 of the
year in which such tax roll is made; provided, that any fraction of a month
shall be considered as a full month. Thereafter one installment shall be spread
upon each annual tax roll, together with one year's interest upon all unpaid
installments; provided, that when any annual installments shall have been
prepaid as hereinafter provided, then there shall be spread upon the tax roll
for such year only the interest upon all unpaid installments.
(1981 Code § 1.167)
208.18   COLLECTION OF INSTALLMENTS.
   After each installment has been placed on the tax rolls, the same shall be
collected by the Treasurer with the same rights and remedies and the same
penalties and interest as provided in the Charter for the collection of taxes.
(1981 Code § 1.168)
208.19   PAYING INSTALLMENTS IN ADVANCE.
   After the expiration of the sixty-day period provided for in Section
208.16, any installment which has not been spread upon the tax rolls may be
discharged by paying the face amount thereof plus interest thereon to the date
of payment.
(1981 Code § 1.169)
208.20   DETERMINING ACTUAL COST.
   Upon completion of the improvement and the payment of the cost thereof, the
Engineer shall certify to the Council the total cost of said improvement,
together with the amount of the original roll for said improvement.
(1981 Code § 1.170)
208.21   DEFICIENCY ASSESSMENTS.
   Should the assessments in any special assessment roll, including the amount
assessed to the City at large, prove insufficient for any reason to pay the
cost of the improvement for which they were made, then the Council shall make
additional assessments against the City and the several lots and parcels of
land, in the same ratio as the original assessments, to supply the deficiency;
but the total amount assessed against any lot or parcel of land shall not
exceed the value of the benefits received from the improvement, provided that
the additional pro-rata assessment shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the
assessment as originally confirmed unless a meeting of the Council be held to
review such additional assessment, for which meeting notices shall be mailed as
provided in the case of review of the original special assessment roll.
(1981 Code § 1.171)
208.22   EXCESSIVE ASSESSMENT; REBATE.
   The excess by which any special assessment proves larger than the actual
cost of the improvement and expenses incidental thereto may be placed in the
General Fund of the City if such excess is five percent or less of the
assessment, but should the assessment prove larger than necessary by more than
five percent ,the entire excess shall be refunded on a pro-rata basis to the
owners of the property assessed. Such refund shall be made by credit against
future unpaid installments in the inverse order in which they are payable to
the extent such installments then exist, and the balance of such refund shall
be in cash. No refunds may be made which contravene the provisions of any
outstanding evidence of indebtedness secured in whole or part by such special
assessment.
(1981 Code § 1.172)
208.23   REASSESSMENT.
   Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of the Council, be
invalid by reason of irregularity or informality in the proceedings, or if any
court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge such assessment to be illegal,
the Council shall, whether the improvement has been made or not, or whether any
part of the assessment has been paid or not, have power to cause a new
assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was
made. All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall
be conducted in the same manner as provided for the original assessment; and
whenever the assessment, or any part thereof, levied upon any premises has been
so set aside, if the same has been paid and not refunded, the payment so made
shall be applied upon the reassessment and the reassessment shall to that
extent be deemed satisfied.
(1981 Code § 1.173)
208.24   COLLECTION; OTHER REMEDIES.
   In addition to any other remedies and without impairing the lien therefor,
any delinquent special assessment, together with interest and penalties, may be
collected in an action in assumpsit in the name of the City against the person
assessed, in any court having jurisdiction of the amount. If in any such action
it shall appear that by reason of any irregularities or informalities the
assessment has not been properly made against the defendant or upon the
premises sought to be charged, the court may, nevertheless, on satisfactory
proof that expense has been incurred by the City which is a proper charge
against the defendant or the premises in question, render judgment for the
amount properly chargeable against such defendant or upon such premises.
(1981 Code § 1.174)
208.25   MAXIMUM SIZE OF DISTRICT.
   No special assessment district shall be created by the Council for any one
public improvement which includes property having an area in excess of twenty-
five percent of the total area of the City. No public improvement project shall
be divided geographically for the purpose of circumventing this provision.
(1981 Code § 1.175)
208.26   ASSESSMENT TO PRECEDE IMPROVEMENT.
   No public improvement to be financed in whole or in part by special
assessment shall be made before the confirmation of the special assessment roll
for each improvement.

210.02   PURCHASES AND CONTRACTS; COMPLIANCE WITH CHARTER.
   Purchases of supplies, materials or equipment shall be made in accordance
with the provisions of
Chapter 12 of the City Charter. (1981 Code ‘1.202)
210.03   WRITTEN CONTRACT REQUIRED.
   All purchases and sales, regardless of monetary value, shall be made the
subject of a written contract. A purchase order shall be a sufficient written
contract in cases where the expenditure is in the usual and ordinary course of
the City’s affairs. (1981 Code ‘1.203)
210.04   PURCHASES AND CONTRACTS; COUNCIL APPROVAL REQUIRED.
   Except as limited in Section
210.05, any expenditure for supplies, materials, equipment, construction
projects or contracts obligating the City, where the amount of the City’s
obligation is in excess of $10,000.00, shall be approved by the City Council
and shall be governed by the provisions of this section and Section
12.2 of the City Charter.
   (a)   The Purchasing Agent shall solicit bids from a reasonable number of
such qualified prospective bidders as are known to him or her.
      (1)   For purchases or contracts for professional services as limited in
Section
210.05 of greater than $2,500.00 and less than $10,000.00, the Purchasing Agent
shall document that he or she has obtained at least three written quotes, or
attempted in good faith to obtain at least three written quotes.
      (2)   Department heads may purchase supplies, equipment or materials from
$500.00 to $2,500.00, as approved by the Purchasing Agent, by obtaining at
least three written quotes, or attempted in good faith to obtain at least three
written quotes.
      (3)   For purchases of $20,000.00 or more, bids shall also be solicited
by newspaper advertisement when directed by the City Council.
   (b)   Unless amounts are prescribed by the Council, the Manager shall
prescribe the amount of any security to be deposited with any bid, which
deposit shall be in the form of cash, certified or cashier’s check or bond
written by a surety company authorized to do business in the State of Michigan.
The amount of such security shall be expressed in terms of percentage of the
bid submitted. Unless the amount is fixed by the Council, the Manager shall fix
the amount of the performance bond, and in the case of construction contracts,
the amount of the labor and materials bond to be required of the successful
bidders.
   (c)   At the time the contract is executed by him or her, the contractor
shall file a bond executed by a surety company authorized to do business in the
State of Michigan, to the City, conditioned to pay all laborers, mechanics,
subcontractors and material men, as well as all just debts, dues and demands
incurred in the performance of such work, and shall file a performance bond
when one is required. Said contractor shall also file evidence of public
liability insurance in an amount satisfactory to the City Manager, and agree to
save the City harmless from loss or damage caused to any person or property by
reason of the contractor’s negligence.
   (d)   All bids and certificates of deposits or certified or cashier’s checks
may be retained until the contract is awarded and signed. If any successful
bidder fails or refuses to enter into the contract awarded to him or her within
five days after the same has been awarded, or file any bond required within the
same time, the deposit accompanying his or her bid shall be forfeited to the
City, and the Council may, in its discretion, award the contract to the next
lower competent bidder meeting specifications, or to another competent bidder
meeting specifications if the Council shall determine that the public interest
will be better served by accepting such other bid, or said contract may be
readvertised.
(1981 Code § 1.204)
   (e)   Sealed bids shall be obtained for purchases expected to exceed
$20,000.00. They shall be governed by the following:
      (1)   Sealed bids may be received by electronic voice, mail, postal
means, or hand delivered.
      (2)   Bids shall be opened in public at the time and place designated in
the notice requesting bids in the presence of the Purchasing Agent, the City
Clerk and at least one other City official, preferably the head of the
department most closely concerned with the subject of the contract. The bids
shall thereupon be carefully examined and tabulated and reported to the Council
with the recommendation of the Purchasing Agent at the next Council meeting.
After tabulation all bids may be inspected by the competing bidders. In lieu of
the procedure for opening bids herein specified, the Council may direct that
bids be opened at a Council meeting.
      (3)   When sealed bids are submitted to the Council, if the Council shall
find any of the bids to be satisfactory, it shall award the contract to the
lowest competent bidder meeting specifications, unless the Council shall
determine that the public interest will be better served by accepting a higher
bid. Such award may be by resolution or ordinance. The Council shall have the
right to reject any or all bids, to waive irregularities in bidding and to
accept bids which do not conform in every respect to the bidding requirements.
   (f)   Purchases shall be made from the lowest competent bidder meeting
specifications unless the Council determines that the public interest will be
better served by accepting a higher bid.
   (g)   No sale or purchase shall be divided for the purpose of circumventing
the dollar value limitations contained in this Section.

those funds coming from the General Fund.
   (b)   Definition. "Responsible party" means any individual, firm,
corporation, limited liability company, association, partnership, commercial
entity, consortium, joint venture, government entity or any other legal entity
that is responsible for an incident, either actual or threatened, or is an
owner, tenant, occupant, driver, named insured party or party in control of
property onto which or from which the incident occurs.
   (c)   Fees. The fees will be determined by a resolution of the City Council
to include flat fees, equipment operation fees, motor vehicle accident fees,
personnel fees and other fees. The fees shall be due and payable to the Fire
Department from any recipient of any of the following enumerated services:
      (1)   Residential and commercial incidents will be subject to a flat
rate. The cost of special commercial services and special expendable fire
fighting materials (foam products, breathing air) may be assessed in addition
to the flat rate.
      (2)   Motor vehicle accidents will be subject to a rate to be determined
by the level of response.
         A.   Level I Response. This would involve a vehicle accident response,
which would require an engine to respond to the scene to assist in the
situation. It could involve the cleanup of spills and debris removal and
extrication and typically would require sixty minutes of time or less on the
scene. The rate shall be a flat fee.
         B.   Level II Response. Vehicle accidents that require extended (over
one hour) extrication, hazardous materials, or any other situation requiring
Fire Department personnel for multiple engine/truck companies or rescue
vehicle; victim entrapment with heavy rescue and/or extended extraction
operations; could require removing or mitigating hazardous material incident,
combating a working fire, and would require over one hour of time on scene. The
rate shall be subject to the hourly fees established by the City Council.
      (3)   Industrial incidents of more than one hour in duration are subject
to the FLAT RATE and will be subject to additional hourly fees established by
Council. These rates begin at the end of the first hour at the scene. All fees
are per hour or any fraction thereof.
      (4)   Medical assistance runs. There will be no charge for medical
assistance incidents that do not involve fire, motor vehicle accidents or
hazardous release.
      (5)   Hazardous materials incidents. All runs involving hazardous
materials are subject to a flat rate, plus the hourly equipment and personnel
rates specified above. These rates apply from the time the call is received by
the Department.
      (6)   Supervision of damaged utility service equipment. The first hour of
any utility service incident will be charged at the aforementioned flat rate.
For each additional hour of supervision, the hourly equipment and personnel
rates. These rates apply from the time the call is received by the Department.
   (d)   Time for Payment. The above fees shall be due and payable thirty days
from the date service is rendered or billed. Any additional expenses to the
City will be billed to the responsible party in the same manner. For any
amounts due that remain unpaid after thirty days, the City shall impose a late
charge of one percent (1%) per month, or fraction thereof. Default in payment
of these fees shall subject the responsible party to collection procedures by
the City in any type of collection proceeding authorized by the laws of the
State of Michigan including, but not limited to, liens upon the property
benefitted by the services rendered. The City shall accept reimbursement from a
responsible party's insurance carrier as payment in full of expenses of
emergency response, in the case of bona fide residents of the City who appear
as title owners of real property on the City's tax rolls but non-residents will
pay the total bill.
   (e)   Exemptions. The following property and services rendered by the Fire
Department shall be exempt from the fees:
      (1)   False alarms up to three per any twelve month period or at the
discretion of the Chief.

Council.
      (3)   Fire involving City buildings and grounds.

Chief.
   (f)   Lien Rights. The City shall have a lien on all real and personal
property benefitted for services under this section by reason of default and
payment of the fees set by this section resulting from protection services.
This lien may be foreclosed by the City to secure payment for the fees in the
same manner provided for the foreclosure on mechanics' or materialman's liens
under the laws of the State of Michigan existing at the time of default of
payment by the responsible party who benefitted by the protection services. It
is expressly understood that the pursuance of the lien rights shall not be the
exclusive remedy of the City under this section.
   (g)   Non-exclusive Fee. The fees set fourth in this section shall not be
the exclusive fees made by the City for the cost and expenses on maintaining
the Fire Department. The City may use any means provided under Michigan Public
Act No. 33 of 1951, as amended (MCL 41.801 et seq.) and Michigan Public Act 102
of 1990 (MCL 41-806a) for present and future funding of the Fire Department in
addition to the fees set forth in this section.
   (h)   Multiple Property Protection. Where a particular service rendered by
the Fire Department benefits more than one or more persons, or more than one
property, the owner of each property benefitted and each person benefitted
(where property was involved) shall be liable for the full payment of fees set
forth in this section.

   Pursuant to Section 8395 of the Revised Judicature Act, State of Michigan,
as added by Public Act 154 of 1968, a Parking Violations Bureau, for the
purpose of handling alleged parking violations within the City is hereby
established. The Parking Violations Bureau shall be under the supervision and
control of the City Treasurer.
(1981 Code § 10.101)

(1981 Code § 10.102)
430.03   SCHEDULED VIOLATIONS.
   No violation not scheduled in Section
430.06 shall be disposed of by the Parking Violations Bureau. The fact that a
particular violation is scheduled shall not entitle the alleged violator to
disposition of the violation at the Bureau, and, in any case, the person in
charge of such Bureau may refuse to dispose of such violation, in which case
any person having knowledge of the facts may make a sworn complaint before any
court having jurisdiction of the offense as provided by law.
(1981 Code § 10.103)
430.04   DISPOSITION OF VIOLATIONS NOT REQUIRED.
   No violation may be settled at the Parking Violations Bureau except at the

accepted from any person who denies having committed the offense, and in no
case shall the person who is in charge of the Bureau determine, or attempt to
determine, the truth or falsity of any fact or matter relating to such alleged
violation. No person shall be required to dispose of a parking violation at the
Parking Violations Bureau, and all persons shall be entitled to have any such
violation processed before a court having jurisdiction thereof if they so
desire. The unwillingness of any person to dispose of any violation at the
Parking Violations Bureau shall not prejudice him or her or in any way diminish
the rights, privileges and protection accorded to him or her by law.
(1981 Code § 10.104)
430.05   TRAFFIC TICKETS AND VIOLATION NOTICES.
   The issuance of a traffic ticket or notice of violation by a police officer
of the City shall be deemed an allegation of a parking violation. Such traffic
ticket or notice of violation shall indicate the length of time in which the
person to whom the same was issued must respond before the Parking Violations
Bureau. It shall also indicate the address of the Bureau, the hours during
which the Bureau is open and the amount of the penalty scheduled for the
offense for which the ticket was issued and advise that a warrant for the
arrest of the person to whom the ticket was issued will be sought if such
person fails to respond within the time limit.
(1981 Code § 10.105)

card from the Department allowing them to possess and purchase medical
marijuana.
(Ord. 001-10. Passed 3-15-10.)
645.02   PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is determined necessary for the health, safety and welfare of the City to
adopt this chapter regulating the location and operation of "Medical Marijuana
Dispensaries" due to the following factors:
   (a)   Outside the purview of the Michigan Medical Marijuana Act the
possession and use of marijuana (a Schedule I Drug) in the State of Michigan
remains a misdemeanor offense. Possession with intent to deliver, delivery or
manufacture of marijuana, remain felonies.
   (b)   Marijuana is classified federally as a "Schedule I Drug" under the
Controlled Substances Act and is illegal to possess, manufacture, distribute or
dispense. Schedule I drugs, which include heroin and LSD, have a high potential
for abuse.
   (c)   In May, 2001, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in
United States v. Oakland Buyers' Cooperative and Jeffery Jones holding that
distribution of medical marijuana is illegal under the Federal Controlled
Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. Section 841 ("CSA"), and there is no medical
necessity defense allowed under federal law. |
   (d)   The location of and easy availability of "Medical Marijuana
Dispensaries" in close proximity to homes, apartments, schools, churches,
licensed day care centers and public parks give an impression of legitimacy to
such uses and have adverse effects upon children, established family relations,
property values and public safety.
   (e)   The Michigan Medical Marijuana Act states that registered "Primary
Caregivers" may receive compensation for assisting "qualified patients" in the
medical use of marijuana, making them a likely commercial activity.
(Ord. 001-10. Passed 3-15-10.)
645.03   LOCATION.
   (a)   A "Medical Marijuana Dispensary" shall not be located:
      (1)   Within five hundred (500) feet of any residential zoning district.
      (2)   Within five hundred (500) feet of the property line of any public

any other building or location either rented or used in any way for the care or
instruction of children under eighteen (18).
      (3)   Within five hundred (500) feet of the property line of any church,
house of worship or other religious facility or institution. |

time;

Rules, and any other cable television service which is subject to rate
regulation by the City pursuant to the Act and the FCC Rules;
   (d)   "FCC" shall mean the Federal Communications Commission;
   (e)   "FCC Rules" shall mean all rules of the FCC promulgated from time to

programming or customer services, as provided in the FCC Rules.
   All other words and phrases used in this chapter shall have the same meaning
as defined in the Act and FCC Rules.
(Ord. 25D. Passed 12-13-93.)
810.02   PURPOSE; INTERPRETATION.
   The purposes of this chapter are to: adopt regulations consistent with the
Act and the FCC Rules with respect to basic cable service rate regulation; and
prescribe procedures to provide a reasonable opportunity for consideration of
the views of interested parties in connection with basic cable service rate
regulation by the City. This chapter shall be implemented and interpreted
consistent with the Act and FCC Rules.
(Ord. 25C. Passed 9-24-93.)
810.03   REGULATION OF RATES.
   In connection with the regulation of rates for basic cable service and
associated equipment, the City shall follow all FCC Rules.
(Ord. 25C. Passed 9-24-93.)
810.04   FILING OF RATE SCHEDULE OR PROPOSED INCREASE.
   (a)   A cable operator shall submit its schedule of rates for the basic
service tier and associated equipment or a proposed increase in such rates in
accordance with the Act and the FCC Rules. The cable operator shall include as
part of its submission such information as is necessary to show that its
schedule of rates or its proposed increase in rates complies with the Act and
the FCC Rules. The cable operator shall file ten copies of the schedule or
proposed increase with the City Clerk. For purposes of this chapter, the filing
of the cable operator shall be deemed to have been made when at least ten
copies have been received by the City Clerk. The City Council may, by
resolution or otherwise, adopt rules and regulations as allowed by law
prescribing the information, data and calculations which must be included as
part of the cable operator's filing of the schedule of rates or a proposed
increase.
   (b)   In addition to information and data required by rules and regulations
of the City pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, a cable operator shall provide
all information requested by the City Manager that is related and helpful in
connection with the City's review and regulation of existing rates for the
basic service tier and associated equipment or a proposed increase in these
rates. The City Manager may establish reasonable deadlines for submission of
the requested information and the cable operator shall comply with such
deadlines.
   (c)   A cable operator has the burden of proving that its schedule of rates
for the basic service tier and associated equipment or a proposed increase in
such rates complies with the Act and the FCC Rules, including, without
limitation, 47 USC § 543 and 47 CFR §§ 76.922 and 76.923.
(Ord. 25D. Passed 12-13-93.)
810.05   PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.
   (a)   If this chapter, any rules or regulations adopted by the City pursuant
to Section
810.04(a), or any request for information pursuant to Section
810.04(b), requires the production of proprietary information, the cable
operator shall produce the information. However, at the time the allegedly
proprietary information is submitted, a cable operator may request that
specific, identified portions of its response be treated as confidential and
withheld from public disclosure. The request must state the reasons why the
information should be treated as proprietary and the facts that support those
reasons. The request for confidentiality will be granted if the City determines
that the preponderance of the evidence shows that nondisclosure is consistent
with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 52. The City
shall place in a public file for inspection any decision that results in
information being withheld. If the cable operator requests confidentiality and
the request is denied, where the cable operator is proposing a rate increase,
it may withdraw the proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary
information will be returned to it; or the cable operator may seek review
within five working days of the denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the
information will be stayed pending review.
   (b)   Any interested party may file a request with the City to inspect
material withheld as proprietary. The City shall weigh the policy
considerations favoring nondisclosure against the reasons cited for permitting
inspection in light of the facts of the particular case. It will then promptly
notify the requesting entity and the cable operator that submitted the
information as to the disposition of the request. It may grant, deny or
condition a request. The requesting party or the cable operator may seek review
of the decision by filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Disclosure will
be stayed pending resolution of any appeal.
   (c)   The procedures set forth in this section shall be construed as
analogous to and consistent with the rules of the FCC regarding requests for
confidentiality, including, without limitation, 47 CFR § 0.459.
(Ord. 25C. Passed 9-24-93.)
810.06   PUBLIC NOTICE; INITIAL REVIEW OF RATES.
   Upon the filing of ten copies of the schedule of rates or the proposed
increase in rates pursuant to Section
810.04(a), the City Clerk shall publish a public notice in a newspaper of

Clerk not later than seven days after the public notice is published. The City
Clerk shall give notice to the cable operator of the date, time, and place of

consultant's report on the schedule of rates or the proposed increase is

proposed increase in these rates, the existing schedule of rates will remain in

810.04(a), unless the City Council (or other properly authorized body or
official) tolls the thirty day deadline pursuant to 47 CFR § 76.933 by issuing
a brief written order, by resolution or otherwise, within thirty days of the
date of filing. The City Council may toll the thirty day deadline for an

decision of the City Council pursuant to Section
810.10, (based on the filing of the cable operator, the comments or objections
of interested parties, information requested from the cable operator and its
response, staff or consultant's review, and other appropriate information). The
City Clerk shall mail a copy of the report to the cable operator by first-class
mail not less than twenty days before the City Council acts under Section
810.10. The cable operator may file a written response to the report with the
City Clerk. If at least ten copies of the response are filed by the cable
operator with the City Clerk within ten days after the report is mailed to the
cable operator, the City Clerk shall forward it to the City Council.
(Ord. 25C. Passed 9-24-93.)
810.10   RATE DECISIONS AND ORDERS.
   The City Council shall issue a written order, by resolution or otherwise,
which, in whole or in part, approves the existing rates for basic cable service
and associated equipment or a proposed increase in such rates, denies the
existing rates or proposed increase, orders a rate reduction, prescribes a
reasonable rate, allows the existing rates or proposed increase to become
effective subject to refund, or orders other appropriate relief, in accordance
with the FCC Rules. If the City Council issues an order allowing the existing
rates or proposed increase to become effective subject to refund, it shall also
direct the cable operator to maintain an accounting pursuant to 47 CFR §
76.933. The order specified in this section shall be issued within ninety days
of the tolling order under Section
810.07 in all cases not involving a cost-of-service showing. The order shall be

consider issuing a refund order and shall provide an opportunity for the cable
operator to comment. The cable operator may appear in person, by agent, or by
letter at such time for the purpose of submitting comments to the City Council.
(Ord. 25C. Passed 9-24-93.)
810.12   WRITTEN DECISIONS; PUBLIC NOTICE.
   Any order of the City Council pursuant to Section
810.10 or Section

Council, and shall be deemed released to the public upon adoption. The Clerk
shall publish a public notice of any such written order in a newspaper of
general circulation within the City which shall summarize the written decision
and state that copies of the text of the written decision are available for

(Ord. 25C. Passed 9-24-93.)

regulations for basic cable service rate regulation proceedings (including,
without limitation, the conduct of hearings), consistent with the Act and the
FCC Rules.
(Ord. 25C. Passed 9-24-93.)
810.14   FAILURE TO GIVE NOTICE.
   The failure of the City Clerk to give the notices or to mail copies of
reports as required by this chapter shall not invalidate the decisions or
proceedings of the City Council, so long as there is substantial compliance
with this chapter.
(Ord. 25D. Passed 12-13-93.)

cable operator's franchise with the City) for failure to comply with the Act,
the FCC Rules, any orders or determinations of the City pursuant to this

promulgated hereunder. Subject to applicable law, failure to comply with the
Act, the FCC Rules, any orders or determinations of the City pursuant to this

denial of renewal of a cable operator's franchise.

and distinguishing manner.

reliable property owners of the County of Osceola, State of Michigan, who will
certify as to the applicant's good character and business respectability, or in
lieu of the names of references, such other available evidence as to the good
character and business responsibility of the applicant as will enable an

      (3)   Per year   30.00
   No fee for a solicitor's license shall be so applied as to occasion an undue
burden upon interstate commerce. In any case where a license fee is believed by
a licensee or applicant for a license to place an undue burden upon interstate
commerce, he or she may apply to the City Manager for an adjustment of the fees
so that it shall not be discriminatory, unreasonable, or unfair as to such
commerce. Such application may be made before, at or within six months after
payment of the prescribed license fee. The applicant shall, by affidavit, and
supporting testimony, show his or her method of business and gross volume or
estimated gross volume of business and such other information as the City
Manager may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such
undue burden on such commerce. The City Manager shall then conduct an
investigation, comparing the applicant's business with other businesses of like
nature and shall make findings of fact from which he or she shall determine
whether the fee fixed for the solicitor's license is unfair, unreasonable or
discriminatory as to applicant's business and shall fix as the license fee for
the applicant an amount that is fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or, if
the fee has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and
above the fee so fixed. In fixing the fee to be
charged, the City Manager shall have the power to base the fee upon a
percentage of gross sales, or any other method which will assure that the fee
assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so
long as the amount assessed does not exceed the fee prescribed in this
subsection. Should the City Manager determine the gross sales measure of the
fee to be the fair basis, he or she may require the applicant to submit, either
at the time of termination of the applicant's business in the City of Reed City
or at the end of each three-month period, a sworn statement of the gross sales
and to pay the amount of the fee therefor, provided that no additional fee
during any one license year shall be required after the licensee shall have
paid an amount equal to the annual license fee as prescribed in this
subsection.
(1981 Code § 7.84)
   (e)   Exempt Persons. Persons under eighteen years of age, when engaged in
soliciting on foot in the neighborhood of their residence under the direct
supervision of any school or recognized charitable or religious organization,
shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter.

860.01   FINDINGS; PURPOSES; REGULATED USES.
   (a)   It is hereby recognized that sexually oriented businesses, because of
their very nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics,
particularly when several of them are concentrated or when one or more of them
are located near a residential zone or other uses frequented by children. In
these circumstances such uses have a deleterious effect upon the adjacent
areas. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these
adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the
surrounding neighborhood and businesses. These special regulations are itemized
in this chapter. These controls are for the purpose of preventing a
concentration of these uses within any one area and to prevent deterioration or
blighting of a nearby residential neighborhood or commercial area. These
controls do not legitimatize activities which are prohibited by other
provisions of these Codified Ordinances or by State law.
   (b)   Uses subject to these controls and referred to herein as regulated
uses are as follows:
      (1)   Adult book or video stores.
      (2)   Adult cabarets.
      (3)   Adult motion picture theaters.
      (4)   Adult novelty stores.
      (5)   Adult panoramas.
      (6)   Burlesque halls.

notice may be given to the owner of the lot or premises adjacent to and
abutting upon said sidewalk of such determination, which notice shall be given
in accordance with Section

in a safe condition. Such notice shall specify a reasonable time, not less than
seven days, within which such work shall be commenced, and shall further
provide that the work shall be completed with due diligence. If the owner of
such lot or premises shall refuse or neglect to repair said sidewalk within the
time limit therefor, or in a manner otherwise than in accordance with this
chapter, the City Manager shall have said sidewalk repaired. If the City
Manager determines that the condition of said sidewalk is such that immediate
repair is necessary to protect the public, he or she may dispense with said
notice. The cost of repairs hereunder shall be charged against the premises
which said sidewalk adjoins and the owner of said premises, and shall be
collected as provided for single lot assessments in the Charter.

upon receiving a written order from the Department, provided that upon written
permit from the Department, water may be turned on for construction purposes
upon payment of the charges applicable thereto.
(1981 Code § 2.3)
1040.04   WATER METERS.
   All premises using water shall be metered, except as otherwise provided in
these Codified Ordinances. No person except a Department employee shall break
or injure the seal or change the location of, alter or interfere in any way
with any water meter. On all new installations there shall be a shut-off on
each side of the meter for the purpose of testing, inspecting and replacement
of the meter.
(1981 Code § 2.4)
1040.05   ACCESS TO METERS.
   The Department shall have the right to shut off the supply of water to any
premises where the Department is not able to obtain access to the meter. Any
qualified employee of the Department shall, at all reasonable hours, have the
right to enter the premises where such meters are installed for the purpose of
reading, testing, removing, or inspecting the same, and no person shall hinder,
obstruct, or interfere with such employee in the lawful discharge of his or her
duties in relation to the care and maintenance of such water meter.
(1981 Code § 2.5)
1040.06   REIMBURSEMENT FOR DAMAGE. 
   Any damage which a meter may sustain resulting from carelessness of the

water, or steam backing from a boiler, shall be paid by the owner of the
property to the City on presentation of a bill therefor; and in cases where the
bill is not paid, the water shall be shut off and shall not be turned on until
all charges have been paid to the City.
(1981 Code § 2.6)
1040.07   METER FAILURE.
   If any meter shall fail to register properly, the Department shall estimate
the consumption on the basis of former consumption and bill accordingly.
(1981 Code § 2.7)
1040.08   RESERVED FOR FUTURE LEGISLATION.
1040.09   ACCURACY REQUIRED.
   A meter shall be considered accurate if, when tested, it registers not to
exceed 2% more to 2% less than the actual quantity of water passing through it.
If a meter registers in excess of 2% more than the actual quantity of water
passing through it, it shall be considered “fast” to that extent. If a meter
registers in excess of 2% less than the actual quantity of water passing
through it, it shall be considered “slow” to that extent.
(1981 Code § 2.9)
1040.10   BILL ADJUSTMENT.
   (a)   If a meter has been tested at the request of a consumer and shall have
been determined to register “fast” the City shall credit the consumer with a
sum equal to the percent “fast” multiplied by the amount of all bills incurred
by said consumer within the three months prior to the test, and if a meter so
tested is determined to register “slow”, the Department may collect from the
consumer a sum equal to the percent “slow” multiplied by the amount of all the
bills incurred by the consumer for the prior three months. When the Department
on its own initiative makes a test of a water meter, it shall be done without
cost to the consumer, other than his or her paying the amount due the City for
water used by him or her, as above provided, if the meter is found to be slow.
   (b)   The City Manager, in his or her discretion, and without prior City
Council approval, may issue a “run water” notice, if the City Manager believes
such a notice is prudent to safeguard the City’s water distribution system. The
City Manager may also rescind such a notice in his or her discretion. If the
City Manager issues a “run water” notice, the consumer may ask to be added a
“run water” list maintained by the Department. For each month the “run water”
notice is active, the Department shall credit said consumer’s bill in the
amount of the difference between the amount metered in that month, and the
average of the consumer’s meter for the three months preceding the issuance of
the “run water” notice. In no case, however, may said consumer’s credit for
such a month exceed the fee for the use of 6,000 gallons per month.
(1981 Code § 2.10) (Ord. 002-2014. Passed 9-15-14.)
1040.11   HYDRANT USE.

(1981 Code § 2.11)
1040.12   LAWN SPRINKLING.
   The City Manager, subject to approval by the Council, may regulate, limit or
prohibit the use of water for any purpose. Such regulations shall restrict less
essential water uses to the extent deemed necessary to assure an adequate
supply for essential domestic and commercial needs and for fire fighting. No
such regulation, limitation or prohibition shall be effective until 24 hours
after the publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City. Any person violating such rule or regulation shall, upon conviction
thereof, be punished as prescribed in Section
1040.99.
(1981 Code § 2.12)
1040.13   ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS.
   The City Manager may make and issue additional rules and regulations
concerning the water distribution system, connection thereto, meter

rules and regulations now in effect shall continue until changed in accordance
with this section.

(1981 Code § 2.15)
1040.16   WATER SYSTEM POLLUTION.

   (a)   The City of Reed City adopts by reference the Water Supply Cross-
Connection Rules of the Michigan Department of Public Health, being R 325.431
to R 325.440 of the Michigan Administrative Code. A cross-connection is defined
as a connection or arrangement of piping or appurtenances through which water
of questionable quality, wastes or other contaminants can enter the public
water supply system.
   (b)   The City of Reed City shall cause inspections to be made of all
properties served by the public water supply where cross-connections with the
public water supply is deemed possible. The frequency of inspections and
reinspections based on potential health hazards involved shall be as
established by the City Water Department and as approved by the Michigan
Department of Public Health.
   (c)   Representatives of the City Water Department shall have the right to
enter at any reasonable time any property served by a connection to the public
water supply system of the City of Reed City for the purpose of inspecting the
piping system or systems thereof for cross-connections. On request the owner,
lessees or occupants of any property so served shall furnish to the inspection
agency any pertinent information regarding the piping system or systems on such
property. The refusal of such information or refusal of access, when requested,
shall be deemed evidence of the presence of cross-connections.
   (d)   The City Water Department is hereby authorized and directed to
discontinue water service after reasonable notice to any property wherein any
connection in violation of this chapter exists, and to take such other
precautionary measures deemed necessary to eliminate any danger of
contamination of the public water supply system. Water service to such property
shall not be restored until the cross-connection has been eliminated in
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (e)   The potable water supply made available on the properties served by
the public water supply shall be protected from possible contamination as
specified by this chapter and by the State Plumbing Code. Any water outlet
which could be used for potable or domestic purposes and which is not supplied
by the potable system must be labeled in a conspicuous manner as:

1042.01   GENERAL POLICY AND INTRODUCTION.
   (a)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for dischargers into the
POTW Authority wastewater collection and treatment systems, and enables the
Authority to protect public health in conformity with all applicable local,
State and Federal laws relating thereto.
   (b)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Authority
wastewater system which will interfere with the normal operation of the system
or contaminate the resulting municipal sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Authority
wastewater system which do not receive adequate treatment in the POTW and which
will pass through the system into receiving waters or the atmosphere or
otherwise be incompatible with the system;
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the system.
   This chapter provides for the regulation of discharges into the Authority
wastewater system through the enforcement of administrative regulations. This
chapter does not provide for the recovery of operations, maintenance or
replacement costs of the POTW or the costs associated with the construction of
collection and treatment systems used by industrial dischargers, in proportion
to their use of the POTW, which are the subject of separate enactments. (Ord.
22A. Passed 8-19-85.)

   The City Council and duly authorized officials or employees of the City and
agents of the SWRC bearing proper credentials and identification shall be
permitted to enter upon all properties for the purpose of inspection,
observation, measurement, sampling, and testing, in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter at any time during reasonable or usual business
hours. Such personnel shall have the authority to copy the user's records which
pertain to actual or potential discharge. Any person guilty of refusing or
obstructing such entry shall be guilty of a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 22A. Passed 8-19-85.)
1042.10   EMERGENCY SUSPENSION OF SERVICE.
   The Authority may, after informal notice to the discharger based upon a
report from its engineer, immediately and effectively halt or prevent any
discharge of pollutants (to the POTW) which reasonably appears to present an
imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of persons.
(Ord. 22A. Passed 8-19-85.)
1042.11   SUSPENSION OF SERVICES FOR NONCOMPLYING DISCHARGE.
   The Authority may, for good cause shown, suspend the wastewater treatment
service to a discharger when it appears to the Authority that an actual or
threatened discharge presents or threatens substantial danger to the
environment, interference with the operation of the POTW, or violation of any
pretreatment limits imposed by this chapter. Any discharger notified of the
suspension of the Authority's wastewater treatment service shall, within a
reasonable period of time as determined by the Authority, cease all discharges.
In the event of failure of the discharger to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order within the specified time, the Authority shall commence
judicial proceedings immediately thereafter to compel the discharger's
compliance with this order. The Authority shall reinstate the wastewater
treatment service and terminate judicial proceedings pending proof by the
discharger of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge or conditions
creating the threat of imminent or substantial endangerment as set forth above.
(Ord. 22A. Passed 8-19-85.)
1042.12   OPERATING UPSETS.
   Any discharger which experiences an upset in operations which places the
discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance with this chapter shall inform
the Authority thereof within twenty-four hours of first awareness of the
commencement of the upset. Where such information is given orally, a written
follow-up report thereof shall be filed by the discharger with the Authority
within five days. The report shall specify:
   (a)   A description of the upset, the cause thereof, and the upset's impact
on a discharger's compliance status.
   (b)   The duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance and, if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance
is reasonably expected to occur.
   (c)   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of noncompliance.
   A documented and verified bonafide operating upset shall be an affirmative
defense to any enforcement action brought by the Authority against a discharger
for any noncompliance with this chapter which arises out of violations alleged
to have occurred during the period of the upset.
(Ord. 22A. Passed 8-19-85.)
1042.13   REVOCATION OF SERVICES.
   The Authority may seek to terminate the wastewater treatment services to any
discharger which: fails to factually report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge; fails to report significant changes in
wastewater constituents or characteristics; refuses reasonable access to the
discharger's premises by representatives of the Authority for the purpose of
inspection or monitoring; or violates the conditions of this chapter, or any
final judicial order entered with respect thereto.
1042.14   NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION; ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUSTMENT.
   Whenever the Authority finds that any discharger has engaged in conduct
which justifies termination of wastewater treatment services, pursuant to
Section
1042.13 hereof, the Authority shall serve or cause to be served upon such
discharger a written notice either personally or by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged violation.
Within thirty days of the date of receipt of the notice, the discharger shall
respond personally or in writing to the Authority, advising of its position
with respect to the allegations. Thereafter, the parties shall meet to
ascertain the veracity of the allegations and, where necessary, establish a
plan for the satisfactory correction thereof.(Ord. 22A. Passed 8-19-85.)
1042.15   SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   Where a violation of Section
1042.13 is not corrected by timely compliance by means of administration
adjustment, the Authority may order any discharger which causes or allows
conduct prohibited by Section
1042.13 to show cause before the Authority or its duly authorized
representative why the proposed service termination action should not be taken.
A written notice shall be served on the discharger by personal service,
certified or registered, return receipt requested, specifying the time and
place of the hearing to be held by the Authority or its designee regarding the
violation, the reasons why the enforcement action is to be taken and the
proposed enforcement action, and directing the discharger to show cause before
the Authority or its designee why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served no less than ten days before
the hearing. Service may be made on any agent, officer, or authorized
representative of a discharger. The proceedings at the hearing shall be
considered by the Authority, which shall then enter appropriate orders with
respect to the alleged improper activities of the discharger. Appeal of such
orders may be taken by the discharger in accordance with applicable local or
state law.
(Ord. 22A. Passed 8-19-85.)
1042.16   CONTINUED VIOLATION.
   Following the entry of any order by the Authority with respect to the
conduct of a discharger contrary to the provisions of Section
1042.13 the Attorney for the Authority may, following the authorization of such
action by the Authority, commence an action for appropriate action in any court
of competent jurisdiction. Any person who shall continue any violation beyond
the time limit provided for in Section
1042.11 shall be subject to the general Code penalty set forth in Section
202.99 of the Administration Code.
1042.17   RECOVERY OF COSTS.

to the City of Reed City for any expense, loss, or damage occasioned by the
City by reason of such violation. The City shall bill the discharger for the
costs incurred by the City for the enforcement of this chapter and any
cleaning, repair, or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge.
Refusal to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this chapter
enforceable under the provisions of Sections
1042.10,
1042.11 and
1042.99.(Ord. 22A. Passed 8-19-85.)
1042.18   FALSIFYING INFORMATION.
   No person shall knowingly make any false statement, representation or
certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed
or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter, or falsify, tamper with,
or knowingly render inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
this chapter. (Ord. 22A. Passed 8-19-85.)
1042.19   RECORDS RETENTION.
   All dischargers subject to this chapter shall retain and preserve, for no
less than three years, any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports and
correspondence, and any and all summaries thereof, relating to monitoring,
sampling and chemical analyses made by or in behalf of a discharger in
connection with its discharge. All records which pertain to matters which are
the subject of administrative adjustment or any other enforcement or litigation

water service to any premises by discontinuing the water service to such
premises, and the payment of charges for sewage disposal service to any
premises may be enforced by discontinuing either the water service or the
sewage disposal service to such premises, or both, and an action of assumpsit
may be instituted by the City against the customer. The charges for water
service and sewage disposal service, which, under the provisions of Act 94 of
the Public Acts of 1933, as amended, are made a lien on the premises to which
furnished, are hereby recognized to constitute such a lien. The City shall,
annually, on April 1, certify all unpaid charges for such services furnished to
any premises which, on the March 31 preceding, have remained unpaid for a
period of six months, to the City Assessor who shall place the same on the next
tax roll of the City. Such charges so assessed shall be collected in the same
manner as are general City taxes. In cases where the City is properly notified,
in accordance with said Act 94 of 1933, that a tenant is responsible for water
or sewage disposal service charges, no such service shall be commenced or
continued to such premises until there has been deposited with the Department a
sum sufficient to cover two times the average quarterly bill for such premises
as estimated by the City, such deposit to be in no case less than ten dollars
($10.00). Where the water service to any premises is turned off to enforce the
payment of water service charges or sewage disposal service charges, the water
service shall not be recommenced until all delinquent charges have been paid
and a deposit as in the case of tenants is made. There shall be a water turn-on
charge of ten dollars ($10.00). In any other case where, in the discretion of
the City, the collection of charges for water or sewage disposal service may be
difficult or uncertain, the City may require a similar deposit. Such deposits
may be applied against any delinquent water or sewage disposal service charges
of the depositor, and the application thereof shall not affect the right of the
Department to turn off the water service and/or sewer service, to any premises
for any delinquency thereby satisfied. No such deposit shall bear interest, and
such deposit, or any remaining balance thereof, shall be returned to the
customer making the same when he or she shall discontinue receiving water and
sewage disposal service or, except as to tenants as to whom notice of
responsibility for such charges has been filed with the City, when any eight
successive quarterly bills shall have been paid by said customer with no
delinquency.(Ord. 23B. Passed 1-4-82.)

   (b)   Special Alternative Limits and Local Initiative Limits.
         (1)    Special Alternative Limits. The City may impose a special
alternative limit ("SAL") on a User which may be in a Wastewater Discharge
Permit or an Order and which allows wastewater otherwise prohibited by (a)(3)
or (a)(10) numerical limits or numerical ranges to be discharged into the POTW.
The SAL may include other special arrangements which are made between the City
and the User. The City shall not be obligated to impose a SAL, but may do so at
its sole discretion. The SAL or special arrangement may be terminated or
modified at will at any time by the City. A SAL or special arrangement shall
not create any vested rights or property rights for the User. A SAL or special
arrangement shall not create rights to discharge to the POTW which the User
would not have in the absence of a SAL or special arrangement. Provisions
relating to termination or modification of a special arrangement may be more
fully set forth in the SAL or special arrangement document. As a condition to
the imposition of a SAL or entry into a special arrangement, the City shall
require the User to sign an acknowledgement an acceptance of the provisions of
this subsection. Any SAL or special arrangement may contain provisions for the
User to pay a compensatory charge to the City. A SAL shall not be higher than a
categorical Pretreatment Standard unless a removal credit or a fundamentally
different factor variance applies to allow the User to exceed the otherwise
applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard, but such SAL shall not exceed the
limit allowed by such removal credit or variance. A violation of a SAL or of
the terms of any such special arrangement shall be a violation of this section.
In determining a SAL or a special arrangement, the City shall allocate from the
maximum allowable headworks loading, also referred to as the design capacity at
the headworks, for the pollutant of concern to one or more Users, in amounts
and on terms and conditions deemed appropriate by the City.
   (c)   Local Initiative Limits. The City may impose limits on a User for
pollutants not specifically listed in (a)(10) above, which may be in a
Wastewater Discharge Permit or in an Order. In determining a local initiative
limit ("LIL"), the City shall consider available data on acceptable POTW
pollutant loading based on POTW design, treatability of the pollutant, the
potential for Pass-Through or Interference, current POTW pollutant loading, the
properties of the pollutant, and other factors deemed appropriate by the City
relevant to the particular pollutant. The City may also establish generally
applicable LILs by City rulemaking. A generally applicable LIL may be
established and shall be enforceable as a discharge prohibition provided the
City first publishes notice of the proposed LILs in the newspaper in the City
with the largest circulation, provides written Notice to Users who are known to
the city to discharge a significant mass or concentration of the pollutant, and
provides for an opportunity to interested persons to submit written comments.
The City, if significant comments are received, shall hold a public meeting to
take additional oral and written comments. After these procedures are
completed, the City shall publish the final enforceable LILs in the same
newspaper along with the effective date of the LILs.

180 days prior to the expiration of the user's existing permit.
   (c)   Permit Modifications. Within nine months of the promulgation of a
national categorical pretreatment standard. The wastewater discharge permit of
users subject to such standards shall be revised to require compliance with
such standard within the time frame prescribed by such standard. Where a user,
subject to a national categorical pretreatment standard, has not previously
submitted an application for a wastewater discharge permit as required by
Section
1046.06(b)(1), the user shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit within
180 days after the promulgation of the applicable national categorical
pretreatment standard. In addition, the user with an existing wastewater
discharge permit shall submit to the Superintendent within 180 days after the
promulgation of an applicable Federal categorical pretreatment standard the
information required by Section
1046.06(b)(2)H. and I.
   (d)   Permit Transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific
process or operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned or
transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises or a new or
changed operation without prior notification to the POTW and provision of a
copy of the existing wastewater discharge permit to the new owner or operator.
Any succeeding owner or user shall also comply with the terms and conditions of
the existing permit.
   (e)   Monitoring.
      (1)   Users shall provide and maintain in safe and proper condition, at
their own expense, facilities to allow the authorized representatives of the
POTW, the EPA or the State to inspect, sample, or measure flows from wastewater
subject to this chapter.
      (2)   There shall be ample room in or near facilities to allow accurate
sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.
      (3)   If locating such facilities on a user's property would be
impractical, the user may apply to the POTW for a right of way or for
permission to construct on public property.
   (f)   Bypass.
      (1)   Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
violate pretreatment standards or requirements, but only if it also is for
essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   Notice.
         A.   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass,
it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, if possible at least ten days before
the date of the bypass.
         B.   An industrial user shall orally notify the POTW of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the bypass. A
written submission shall also be provided within five days of becoming aware of
the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass
and its cause, the duration of the bypass, including exact times and dates, and
if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue, and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
recurrence of the bypass.
      (3)   Prohibition of bypass.
         A.   Bypass is prohibited and the POTW may take enforcement action
against an individual user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage;
            2.   There are no feasible alternatives to bypass, such as use of
auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of wastes or maintenance during
normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if
adequate back-up equipment should have been installed to prevent bypass which
occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative
maintenance; and
            3.   The industrial user submitted notices as required by paragraph
(f)(2)hereof.
         B.   The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its
adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three conditions
listed in paragraph (f)(3)A. hereof.
   (g)   Upset Provisions.
      (1)   Upset defined. For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an
exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the
reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed
treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive
maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
      (2)   Effect of an upset. An upset shall constitute an affirmative
defense to an action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards if
the requirements of paragraph (g)(3) are met.
      (3)   Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. An industrial
user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence, that:
         A.   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause
(s) of the upset;
         B.   The facility was, at the time, being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures.
         C.   The industrial user has submitted the following information to
the POTW and the control authority within twenty-four hours of becoming aware
of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must
be provided within five days):
            1.   A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue;
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (4)   Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user
seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (h)   User Responsibility in Case of Upset. The industrial user shall
control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain
compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its
treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of
treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among
other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced
or lost or fails.
(Ord. 22C. Passed 4-15-96.)
1046.08   REPORTING.
   (a)   Baseline Report (For Categorical Dischargers Only).
      (1)   Industrial users subject to national categorical pretreatment
standards shall submit baseline reports to the POTW in a form prescribed and
furnished by the POTW.
      (2)   Within 180 days after the effective date of a national categorical
pretreatment standard, or 180 days after a final administrative decision has
been made upon a categorical determination submission in accordance with 40 CFR
403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, industrial users which are existing sources
subject to such national categorical pretreatment standards and currently
discharging to the POTW shall submit a properly completed baseline report.
      (3)   New sources, when subject to a national categorical pretreatment
standard, shall submit a baseline report at least ninety days prior to
commencement of discharge to the POTW.
      (4)   In support of the baseline report, the industrial user shall
submit, in units and terms specified in the application, the following
information:
         A.   Name and address of the facility, including the name of the
operator and owners.
         B.   List of any environmental control permits held by or for the
facility.
         C.   Brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and
standard industrial classification of the operation(s) carried out by such
user. This description shall include a schematic process diagram indicating
points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes.
         D.   Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily
flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following:
            1.   Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the
nature and concentration of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each
regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentrations shall be
reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations.
            2.   A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other
pollutants, twenty-four hour composite sampling must be obtained through flow-
proportional composite sampling unless the industrial user demonstrates that
flow-proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases sampling may be
obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a
minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide
a representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
            3.   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile the data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.
            4.   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed
with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream
formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the
pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been
calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with
supporting data shall be submitted to the POTW.
         E.   The industrial user shall provide a statement reviewed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user and certified by a qualified
professional indicating whether national categorical pretreatment standards are
being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation and
maintenance measures (O&M) or additional pretreatment is required for the
industrial user to meet the national categorical pretreatment standards.
         F.   If additional pretreatment or O&M will be required to meet the
national categorical pretreatment standards, the industrial user will provide
the shortest schedule which will provide such additional pretreatment or O&M.
The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance
date established for the applicable national categorical pretreatment standard.
            1.   Where the industrial user's national categorical pretreatment
standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR 403.7) or the
combined waste stream formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)) or net gross calculations (40
CFR 403.15), at the time the industrial user submits a baseline report, the
information required in paragraph (a)(4)F. and G. hereof shall pertain to the
modified limits.
            2.   If the national categorical pretreatment standard for the
industrial user is modified after the baseline report is submitted, the
industrial user shall make any necessary amendments to information provided as
a response to paragraph (a)(4)F. and G. hereof and submit them to the POTW
within sixty days after the modified limit is approved.
         G.   The following conditions shall apply to any schedule submitted in
response to paragraph (a)(4)F. hereof:
            1.   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form
of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable national categorical pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring
an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing
contracts for major components, commencing construction, completing
construction, etc.).
            2.   No increment referred to in paragraph (a)(4)G.1. hereof shall
exceed nine months.
            3.   Not later than fourteen days following each date in the
schedule and the final date for compliance. the user shall submit a progress
report to the POTW, including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with
the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which
it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and
the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the
schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between
such progress reports to the POTW.
         H.   Such other information as may be reasonably requested by the
POTW.
   (b)   Compliance Date Report. Within ninety days following the date for
final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or, in the
case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater
into the POTW, any user subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall
submit to the POTW a report indicating the nature and concentration of all
pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by
such standards and the average and maximum daily flow for these process units
in the user facility which are limited by such pretreatment standards or
requirements. Where equivalent mass or concentration limits are established by
the POTW for a user, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the
user's long-term production rate. Where a user is subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per
unit of production, the report shall include the user's actual production
during the appropriate sampling period. The report shall state whether the
applicable pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and if
not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user
into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards. This statement
shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user, and
certified to be a qualified professional.
   (c)   Periodic Compliance Reports.
      (1)   Any user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard after the
compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source,
after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the POTW
during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the
pretreatment standard or by the Superintendent, a report indicating the nature
and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such
pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of all
daily flows which, during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily flow
reported in paragraph (c)(2) hereof.
   At the discretion of the Superintendent and in consideration of such factors
as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the
Superintendent may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are
to be submitted.
      (2)   The POTW may impose mass limitations on users which are using
dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other
cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases,
the report required by paragraph (c)(1) hereof shall indicate the mass of
pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user.
These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the
discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production
and the mass where requested by the Superintendent, of pollutants contained
therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards.
      (3)   For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established by the POTW in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR
403.6(c), the report required by paragraph (c)(1) hereof shall contain a
reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other
industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only
in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other
measure of operation), the report required by paragraph (c)(1) hereof shall
include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting period.
      (4)   Significant noncategorical industrial users shall submit to the
POTW at least once every six months (on dates specified by the control
authority) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the
pollutants required to be reported by the control authority.
   (d)   Monitoring and Analysis in Support of Self-Monitoring Requirements.
      (1)   The reports required by subsections (a) through (c) and (e) hereof
shall be based on samplings and analysis performed in the period covered by the
report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR
Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the
Administrator determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques
are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods, including procedures suggested
by the POTW or other persons approved by the Administrator. This sampling and
analysis may be performed by the POTW in lieu of the industrial user. Where the
POTW itself collects all the information required for the reports, the
significant industrial user will not be required to submit the report.
      (2)   If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation,
the user shall notify the POTW within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of
the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the POTW within thirty days after becoming
aware of the violation, except the industrial user is not required to resample
if:
         A.   The POTW performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency
of at least once per month; or
         B.   The POTW performs sampling at the user between the time when the
user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the
results of this sampling.
      (3)   The reports required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (4) hereof shall be
based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed
during the period covered by the report, which data is representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period. The POTW shall require the
frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial
users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
      (4)   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements in
subsections (a) through (c) and (e) hereof monitors any pollutant more
frequently than required by the POTW, using the procedures prescribed in this
section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
      (5)   The reports required by subsections (a) through (c) and (e) hereof
shall include the certification statement as set forth in 40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)
(ii), and shall be signed by an authorized representative.
   (e)   Reporting Requirements for Nonsignificant Industrial Users. The POTW
shall require appropriate reporting from those industrial users with discharges
that are not subject to categorical pretreatment standards and are not
otherwise deemed by the POTW to be significant.
   (f)   Hazardous Waste Notification.
      (1)   Any industrial user, except as specified in Section
1046.13, which discharges to the POTW any substance which, if otherwise
disposed of, would be a listed or characteristic hazardous waste under 49 CFR
Part 261, shall notify the POTW in writing of such discharge.
      (2)   All hazardous waste notifications shall include:
         A.   The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 361;
         B.   The EPA hazardous waste number;
         C.   The type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other); and
         D.   A certification that the user has a program in place to reduce
the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
      (3)   In addition to the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (f)
(2) hereof, industries discharging more than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste
per calendar month to the POTW shall report to the POTW, to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the industrial user:
         A.   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
waste:
         B.   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents
in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month; and
         C.   An estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream
expected to be discharged during the following twelve months.
      (4)   Hazardous waste notifications shall be submitted no later than
thirty days after the date of the adoption of this chapter or thirty days prior
to the proposed discharge. Any notification under this provision need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged, although notification
of changed discharges must be submitted under Section
1046.05(e).
      (5)   Industrial users are exempt from the hazardous waste notification
requirement during a calendar month in which they discharge fifteen kilograms
or less of non-acute hazardous wastes. Discharge of any quantity of acute
hazardous waste as specified in 40 CFR Sections 261.30(d) and 261.33(e)
requires a one time notification.
(Ord. 22C. Passed 4-15-96.)
1046.09   FEES.
   (a)   The fee for permit applications, including the cost of processing such
applications, is two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00).
   (b)   Fees for monitoring, sampling and inspections will be based on the
actual cost incurred by the City and assessed to the affected industry.
   (c)   Other fees as the POTW may deem necessary to carry out the
requirements contained herein, which fees are related solely to the matters
covered by this chapter, are separate from all other fees chargeable by the
POTW. (Ord. 22C. Passed 4-15-96.)
1046.10   ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (a)   Notification of Violation. When the Superintendent finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may serve upon that
user a written notice of violation. Within the time specified in the notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by
the user to the Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the
user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the
notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
Superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
   (b)   Consent Orders. The Superintendent may enter into consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Section
1046.11(d) and (e) and shall be judicially enforceable.
   (c)   Show Cause Hearing. The Superintendent may order a user which has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, to appear before the hearing panel and show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the
user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement
action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least thirty days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served
on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be
a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (d)   Compliance Orders. When the Superintendent finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible
for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a
specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time
provided and the order requiring such compliance is final and effective, sewer
service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to
restrict the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not necessarily be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
   (e)   Cease and Desist Orders. After exhausting all other remedies and
enforcement methods, when the Superintendent finds that a user continues to
violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that
the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Superintendent may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations, and
directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not necessarily be a bar against,
or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (f)   Emergency Suspensions. If no other remedy or enforcement method is
adequate, the Superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
written notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent and substantial endangerment to health and safety of persons. The
Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after written
notice and informal opportunity to respond, that will cause interference or
pass-through or which presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to the
environment.
   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or
eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately
comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Superintendent may take such
steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection.
   A user that is subjected to a suspension of its discharge under this section
shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the
imminent and substantial endangerment or the interference or pass-through
condition and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence.
   The Superintendent may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the
imminent and substantial endangerment or the interference or pass-through
condition has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (g)
hereof are initiated against the user.
   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any emergency suspension under this section.
   (g)   Termination of Discharge. Any user whose discharge permit has been
revoked under subsection (f) hereof or who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
      (1)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to reasonably report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes as required by Section
1046.07(a)(11);
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in Section
1046.04. Such user will be notified in writing of the reason for the proposed
termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under
subsection (c) hereof why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of
this option by the Superintendent shall not necessarily be a bar to, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 22C. Passed
4-15-96.)
1046.11   ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW.
   (a)   Informal Conference. An informal conference with the Superintendent or
the designee of the Superintendent may be requested in writing, by any user
deeming itself aggrieved by any notice of violation, show cause order,
compliance or cease and desist order, emergency suspension, termination of
discharge, surcharge, actions on a permit or special alternative limit by the
Superintendent, refusal to act by the Superintendent in response to a user
request, or other actions of the Superintendent which affect a user
("administrative action"), within five calendar days after the administrative
action is served upon the user. The request for an informal conference shall be
submitted to the Superintendent. The purposes of the informal conference are to
discuss the administrative action by which the user deems itself aggrieved and
to attempt to reach a settlement of the administrative action agreeable to the
user and the City. The Superintendent is not required to reach any conclusion
or provide a decision as a result of an informal conference. If a request is
received, the Superintendent shall hold the informal conference within ten
calendar days of receipt of the request. A user is not required to request or
participate in an informal conference as a precondition to requesting and
participating in a hearing under subsection (b) hereof, nor is a user required
to request or participate in a hearing under subsection (b) hereof as a
precondition to requesting and participating in an informal conference. If a
hearing is held under subsection (b) hereof, such a hearing is not an appeal
from an informal conference.
   (b)   Right to Hearing. A hearing before a hearing panel may be requested in
writing, by any user deeming itself aggrieved by any administrative action,
within thirty calendar days after the administrative action has been served
upon such user (or made known to the user if no service of the administrative
action is required). If an informal conference has not been requested by the
user, such a request shall be made within fifteen calendar days of service (or
knowledge). The request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Superintendent.
If a hearing is not demanded within the time period provided herein, the
administrative action shall be deemed final. In the event such a hearing is
demanded, the administrative action shall be suspended until the hearing is
completed and the time for filing for judicial review has expired.
      (1)   Hearing panel. The hearing panel shall consist of the following:
         A.   The City Manager or the Superintendent, as determined by the
City;
         B.   The ex-officio representative on the City Council if the hearing
is requested by a user. This person may or may not be employed by a party.
         C.   A person who is not an employee of the City or any party to the
hearing who has a high level of expertise in the subject matter of the hearing.
The persons provided for in paragraphs (b)(1)A. and B. hereof shall choose this
person but, in the event they are unable to agree, the person shall be chosen
by the Chief Judge of the Osceola County Circuit Court with neutrality and
expertise as the prime considerations. The persons provided for in paragraphs
(b)(1)A. and B. hereof each may submit a list of no more than two suggested
candidates, along with curriculum vitae, to the judge.
      (2)   Time. The hearing shall be promptly scheduled to commence at the
earliest practicable date, but not later than thirty days after receipt of the
request unless extended by mutual written agreement.

shall be signed by the user requesting the hearing or by a duly authorized
officer. agent, or attorney, shall be directed to the Superintendent, and shall
contain the following:
         A.   The name and address of the user requesting the hearing.
         B.   A copy of the administrative action if it is in writing.
         C.   A general statement of the defenses, arguments, or issues to be
raised at the hearing.
   (c)   Hearing Procedure. The hearing on the administrative action shall be
conducted under the procedures set forth in this section
      (1)   Rules of evidence. Hearings shall be informal and need not be
conducted according to the strict technical rules relating to evidence and
witnesses, but those rules shall be considered in determining what weight to
give evidence and testimony.
      (2)   Rights of parties. At the hearing, each party shall have the
following rights:
         A.   To call and examine witnesses on any matter relevant to the
issues of the hearing.
         B.   To introduce documentary and physical evidence.
         C.   To cross-examine opposing witnesses on any matter relevant to the
issues of the hearing.
         D.   To rebut adverse evidence.
         E.   To have representation of his or her choice.
      (3)   Record. A record of the proceedings shall be made by tape
recording. A transcript of the proceedings shall be made available to all
parties upon request and upon payment by the requesting party of the cost of
the transcription.
   (d)   Decision of Hearing Panel. The hearing panel shall review the evidence
and within fifteen days after the close of the hearing issue a draft written
decision to the parties. The hearing panel shall prepare a draft written report
or opinion, and the parties to the hearing shall be given an opportunity to
review it and submit written comments on it within five days of receipt of the
draft by the parties. Within fifteen days after receipt of comments, if any,
from the parties on the draft, a final written decision shall be issued.
      (1)   Form of decision. The decision shall contain findings of fact, a
decision on each of the points raised by the user, and an explanation of the
reasons for the decision. The decision must be by at least two of the hearing
panel members A dissenting panel member may issue a written dissenting decision
which shall follow the same draft final steps A copy of the decision shall be
delivered personally or be sent by first-class mail to the user.
      (2)   Effective date of decision. The effective date of the decision
shall be as stated therein, but it shall not be earlier than the last day for
seeking judicial review.
   (e)   Special Rule for Review of Emergency Suspensions and Cease and Desist
Orders. A user subject to an emergency suspension or that has received a cease
and desist order:
      (1)   May petition the Osceola County Circuit Court at any time for a de
nova review, including temporary or permanent injunctive relief, without being
required to pursue any administrative review; or
      (2)   May pursue administrative review under this chapter even though the
administrative action is in effect during the administrative review. In this
situation, the hearing panel may affirm, reverse, or modify the administrative
action that was in effect.
(Ord. 22C. Passed 4-15-96.)
1046.12   VIOLATIONS AS PUBLIC NUISANCES.
   A violation of any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit,
or an order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement
is hereby declared a public nuisance.
(Ord. 22C. Passed 4-15-96.)
1046.13   AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   Upset.
      (1)   "Upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is
unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment
standards or local limits because of factors beyond the reasonable control of
the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards or local
limits if the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) hereof are met.
      (3)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence, that:
         A.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset,
         B.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         C.   The user has submitted the following information to the
Superintendent within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the upset.
However, if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five days, including:
            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
            4.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish
the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
            5.   Users shall control all discharges to the extent necessary to
maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards or local limits
upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.
   (b)   Prohibited Discharge Standards. A user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general prohibitions in Section
1046.04 or the specific prohibitions of this chapter if it can prove that it
did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in
conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or
interference and that either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharge that caused pass-
through or interference and the user was in compliance with each such limit
directly prior to and during the pass through or interference; or
      (2)   No such local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the City was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and, in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   (c)   Bypass.
      (1)   For the purpose of this section:
         A.   "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from
any portion of a user's treatment facility.
         B.   "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities of a user which causes them to
become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which
can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      (2)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of
paragraph (c)(3) or (4) hereof.
      (3)   A.   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Superintendent, at least ten days before the date of
the bypass, if possible.
         B.   A user shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
twenty-four hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes
aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and
times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the bypass. The Superintendent may waive the written
report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within
twenty-four hours.
      (4)   A.   Bypass is prohibited, and the Superintendent may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (c)(3)
hereof.
         B.   The Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Superintendent determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (c)(4)A. hereof.
(Ord. 22C. Passed 4-15-96.)
1046.14   SURCHARGES, FEES AND INTEREST.
   (a)   Surcharges.
      (1)   A surcharge will be applied for discharges with a measured BOD
content in excess of 300 mg/l.
      (2)   A surcharge will be applied for discharges with a measured total
suspended solids concentration in excess of 250 mg/l.
      (3)   A surcharge will be applied for discharges with a measured
phosphorus content in excess of 7.5 mg/l.
      (4)   A surcharge will be applied for discharges with a measured ammonia
content in excess of ninety mg/l.
      (5)   When applicable limits for BOD or total suspended solids are
exceeded, the industrial user will be subject to enforcement action in
accordance with the City's Enforcement Response Guide and this chapter. This
action is in addition to an appropriate surcharge fee.
      (6)   Upon recommendation of the Superintendent, the City Council may
establish surcharge provisions for accepting other waste fluids, solids,
pollutants, or materials.
      (7)   Surcharges provided for under paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) hereof
shall be limited in amount to that reasonably estimated as necessary and
appropriate to recover the incremental costs of handling the portion of such
waste fluids, solids, pollutants or materials which exceed applicable
prohibited discharge limits The rate of surcharge shall be annually determined
by the City Council, based upon the Superintendent's budgeting recommendation.
   (b)   Fees. The City may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of
setting up and operating the City's pretreatment program, which may include:
      (1)   Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications, including the
cost of processing such applications;
      (2)   Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures,
including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and

(1981 Code § 5.12)
1220.13   PLAT APPROVAL.
   Whenever the Planning Commission shall have adopted a master plan relating
to the major street system of the territory within its subdivision jurisdiction
or part thereof, and shall have filed a certified copy of such plan in the
office of the Osceola County Register of Deeds, then no plat of a subdivision
of land within such territory or part shall be filed or recorded until it shall
have been approved by such Planning Commission and such approval has been
entered in writing on the plat by the Chairperson or the Secretary of the
Planning Commission. (1981 Code § 5.13)
1220.14   ADOPTION OF SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS.
   Before exercising the powers referred to in Section
1220.13, the Planning Commission shall adopt regulations governing the
subdivision of land within its jurisdiction. Such regulations may provide for
the proper arrangement of streets in relation to other existing or planned
streets and to the master plan, for adequate and convenient open spaces for
traffic, utilities, access for fire-fighting apparatus, recreation, light and
air, and for the avoidance of congestion of population, including minimum width
and area of lots. Such regulations may include provisions as to the extent to
which streets and other ways shall be graded and improved and to which water
and sewer and other utility mains, piping or other facilities shall be
installed as a condition precedent to the approval of the plat. The regulations
or practice of the Planning Commission may provide for a tentative approval of
the plat previous to such installation; but any such tentative approval shall
be revocable and shall not be entered on the plat. In lieu of the completion of
such improvements and utilities prior to the final approval of the plat, the
Planning Commission may accept a bond with surety to secure to the Municipality
the actual construction and installation of such improvements or utilities at a
time and according to specifications fixed by or in accordance with the
regulations of the Planning Commission. The City of Reed City shall have the
power to enforce such bond by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies. All
such regulations shall be published as provided by law for the publication of
ordinances, and, before adoption, a public hearing shall be held thereon. A
copy thereof shall be certified by the Planning Commission to the Register of
Deeds of Osceola County.
(1981 Code § 5.14)
1220.15   TIME LIMIT FOR PLAT APPROVAL.
   The Planning Commission shall approve, modify or disapprove a plat within
sixty days after the submission thereof to it; otherwise such plat shall be
deemed to have been approved, and a certificate to that effect shall be issued
by the Planning Commission on demand; provided, however, that the applicant for
the Planning Commission's approval may waive this requirement and consent to an
extension of such period.
(1981 Code § 5.15)
1220.16   PLAT APPROVAL; USE RESTRICTIONS.
   The grounds for disapproval of any plat shall be stated upon the records of
the Planning Commission. Any plat submitted to the Planning Commission shall
contain the name and address of a person to whom notice of a hearing shall be
sent; and no plat shall be acted on by the Commission without affording a
hearing thereon. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be sent to
the said address by registered mail not less than five days before the date
fixed therefor. Similar notice shall be mailed to the owners of land
immediately adjoining the platted land, as their names appear upon the records
of the City of Reed City or as their addresses appear in the directory of the
City of Reed City or on the tax records of the City of Reed City. Every plat
approved by the Planning Commission shall, by virtue of such approval, be
deemed to be an amendment of or an addition to or a detail of the Municipal
plan and a part thereof. Approval of a plat shall not be deemed to constitute
or effect an acceptance by the public of any street or other open space shown
upon the plat. The Planning Commission may, from time to time, recommend to the
City Council amendment of the Zoning Code or the Zoning Map or additions
thereto to conform to the Planning Commission's recommendations for the zoning
regulations of the territory comprised within approved subdivisions. The
Planning Commission shall have the power to agree with the applicant upon use,
height, area or bulk requirements or restrictions governing buildings and
premises within the subdivision, provided such requirements or restrictions do
not authorize the violation of the then effective Zoning Code. Such
requirements or restrictions shall be stated upon the plat prior to the
approval and recording thereof and shall have the same force of law and be
enforceable in the same manner and with the same sanctions and penalties and
subject to the same power of amendment or repeal as though set out as part of
the Zoning Code or the Zoning Map.
(1981 Code § 5.16)
1220.17   SIX-YEAR PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAMS.
   For the purpose of furthering the desirable future development of the City
and adjacent areas under the master plan, the Planning Commission, after the
adoption of the master plan, may prepare coordinated and comprehensive programs
of public structures and improvements which shall be accompanied by a program
for the financing thereof. The Planning Commission may annually prepare such a
program for the ensuing six years, which program shall show those public
structures and improvements in the general order of their priority, which in
the Planning Commission's judgment will be needed or desirable and can be
financed and undertaken within the six-year period. The above comprehensive
coordinated programs shall be based upon the requirements of the City of Reed
City and the adjacent areas related thereto in the master plan for all types of
public improvements, and to that end, each agency or governmental unit
concerned with such improvement shall, upon request, furnish the Planning
Commission with lists, plans and estimates of the time and cost of public
improvements within the purview of such agency or governmental unit.

trade, service, and other uses of land; to ensure that uses of land, buildings,

(Ord. 52. Passed 6-16-97.)
1244.04   STANDARDS FOR ISSUANCE OF VARIANCES.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power to authorize specific
variances or departures from this Zoning Code, if all of the basic conditions
are satisfied, and if there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships
in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this Zoning Code. A variance
from the dimensional requirements of this Zoning Code may only be granted if it
is determined that all basic conditions have been satisfied and that there is a
practical difficulty in carrying out the requirement. A variance from the use
requirements of this Zoning Code may only be granted if it is determined that
all basic conditions have been satisfied and that there is an unnecessary
hardship created by those use restrictions. Use variances may only be granted
by an affirmative vote of two thirds of the Board's members.
   (a)   Basic Conditions. Any variance granted from this Zoning Code shall
meet the following basic conditions:
      (1)   The spirit of this Zoning Code shall be observed, public safety
secured, and substantial justice done.
      (2)   There is no substantial adverse effect upon property values in the
immediate vicinity or in the district in which the property of the applicant is
located.
      (3)   The difficulty or hardship relating to the property is not so
general or recurrent in nature that the formulation of a general regulation for
such conditions is preferable.
      (4)   The practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships are unique to
the property under consideration and not to the general neighborhood, and shall
apply only to property that is under the control of the applicant.
      (5)   It shall be necessary for the preservation of a substantial
property right possessed by other properties in the same zoning district.
      (6)   There is a clear showing of an unnecessary hardship in that the
property as a whole cannot reasonably be put to a use authorized by this Zoning
Code.
      (7)   The alleged hardship or difficulty is not solely economic, and is
based on the reasonable use of a particular parcel of land.
      (8)   It may be denied where the alleged practical difficulties or
unnecessary hardships resulted from an act of the applicant, or a person in
privity or concert with the applicant.
   (b)   Practical Difficulties and Unnecessary Hardships. In order to
determine if there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships which
prevent carrying out the strict letter of this Zoning Code the following shall
apply:
      (1)   Dimensional variance. A practical difficulty shall exist where
there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or physical conditions,
such as narrowness, shallowness, shape or topography of the property involved,
that do not generally apply to other property or uses in the same zoning
district.
      (2)   Use variance. An unnecessary hardship shall exist where the lot
considered in combination with other adjacent land owned by the applicant has
no reasonable value as zoned.
   (c)   Exceptions. The Board shall have the power to grant the following
exceptions:
      (1)   Extend a district where the boundary line of a district divides a
lot of record in single ownership at the time of adoption of this Zoning Code;
      (2)   Interpret or apply this Zoning Code where the street layout
actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on the District
Map.
      (3)   Permit the alteration or enlargement of an existing building
associated with a nonconforming use under Section
1276.04, or permit the increase in intensity of use of a nonconforming use
under Section
1276.05, where:
         A.   The change will not unreasonably delay future probability of
compliance with this Zoning Code.
         B.   There will be greater compliance with this Zoning Code or, in the
alternative, with the Building Code or other applicable ordinances if the
change is permitted, and such compliance is the maximum which can be reasonably
expected. The change will not detract from any historical or unique
architectural qualities of the building.
         C.   The change will not be detrimental to or tend to alter the
character of the neighborhood.
      (4)   Permit a change in use of a nonconforming use under Section
1276.05 to another nonconforming use which is more nearly conforming to the use
restrictions of this Zoning Code. After a change in use has been permitted, the
use shall not be changed back to the former nonconforming use or to any less
conforming use. Such a change in use may be permitted only where:
         A.   The change in use will not unreasonably delay future probability
of compliance with this Zoning Code.
         B.   There will be greater compliance with this Zoning Code if the
change is permitted, and such compliance is the maximum which can reasonably be
expected.
         C.   The change will not be detrimental to the neighborhood or tend to
alter the character of the neighborhood.

maintaining existing smaller residential lots primarily within the central City
area. This District is intended for smaller lot and lot width requirements as
well as housing sizes to accommodate more affordable housing opportunities.
Development includes single-family dwellings in high density settings.
   (d)   The "R-4" District is established in recognition of the need for
affordable housing opportunities within the City, primarily renter-occupied.
This District is intended for apartment complex development and conversion of
single-family to multiple-family, duplexes, and condominiums. Development
standards themselves provide additional location and site-related standards for
development.
   (e)   The "R-5" District is established in recognition of the need for
affordable housing opportunities within the City. This District is intended for
mobile home park development that may include modular and double-wide plus
single-wide mobile homes. Although the park development standards themselves
are established by the Mobile Home Commission, this District provides
additional location and site-related standards for development.
   (f)   The "C-1" District is established to provide areas of high
concentrations of pedestrian-oriented retail, office, and service activities
within the traditional central business district. Desired development includes
compatible commercial uses accompanied by on-street, off-street, and
Municipally-provided parking. This District provides additional location and
site-related standards for development.
   (g)   The "C-2" District is established to provide areas of commercial
development which require large exterior spaces for storage, display, or sale
of merchandise or commercial uses which depend upon continual movement of
vehicular traffic. Desired development includes commercial uses accompanied by
off-street parking. This District provides additional location and site-related
standards for development.
   (h)   The "C-3" District is established to provide areas of development
which are compatible with existing and future medical services and related
uses. Development regulations accommodate office and service businesses which
require onsite parking. This District provides additional location and site
related standards for development.
(I)   The "C-4" District is established to provide areas of office development
which are compatible with each other without interference from non-related
uses. Development regulations accommodate office businesses which require
onsite parking. This District provides additional location and site related
standards for development.
   (j)   The "IND" District is established to provide areas of light industrial
development in which the uses do not emit excessive noise, fumes, smoke,
vibrations, odors, or other similar nuisances not compatible with adjacent
residential neighborhoods. It is not intended to permit residential or
commercial development or similar uses except as authorized by this Zoning
Code. This District provides additional location and site-related standards for
development.

   Within any C-2 District, no structure or premises will hereafter be used,
erected, converted, or altered externally in whole or in part unless herein
provided, for any other than one or more of the following permitted uses. It is
recognized that sexually oriented businesses, because of their very nature,
have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when
several of them are concentrated or when one or more of them are located near a
residential zone or other uses frequented by children. In these circumstances
such uses have a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas. Special regulation
of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not
contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood and
businesses. These special regulations are itemized in the chapter. These
controls are for the purposes of preventing a concentration of these uses
within any one area and to prevent deterioration or blighting of a nearby
residential neighborhood or commercial area. These controls do not legitimatize
activities which are prohibited by other chapters of these Codified Ordinances
or by State law.

Ch. 1284
1268.01   INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   The provisions of this chapter are intended to provide flexibility and
creativity in the site planning and development process and to provide
requirements and standards for the submission, review, and approval of
applications for planned unit developments (PUDs). The purposes and objectives
of these PUD regulations include the following:
   (a)   To accomplish the intent, purposes, and objectives of this Zoning Code
through a land development project review process based on the application of
site planning criteria to achieve integration of the proposed land development
project with the characteristics of the project area.
   (b)   To permit flexibility in the regulation of land development.
   (c)   To encourage innovation in land use and variety in design, layout, and
type of structures constructed.
   (d)   To achieve economy and efficiency in the use of land, natural
resources, energy, and the provision of public services and utilities.
   (e)   To encourage provision of useful open space and more desirable living
and shopping environments by preserving the natural character of open fields,
stands of trees, wetland and surface water features, floodplains, hills, and
similar natural assets.
   (f)   To provide adequate housing, employment, and shopping opportunities
particularly suited to the needs of the residents of the City and to encourage
the development of recreational facilities and neighborhood commercial
facilities in a generally central location within a reasonable distance of all
living units.
   (g)   To ensure that the land use or activity authorized shall be compatible
with adjacent uses of land, the natural environment, and the capacities of
public services and facilities affected by the land use.
(Ord. 52. Passed 6-16-97.)
1268.02   PERMITTED USES.
   (a)   Land uses, buildings, and structures may be permitted in the PUD
District as in the underlying zoning district. Land uses may be permitted
within a PUD pursuant to an approved site plan and in accordance with all other
applicable requirements of this chapter.
   (b)   PUDs located in Residential Districts with a minimum size of twenty
acres may allocate up to ten percent of the land area for use for commercial
retail and service uses primarily serving the residents of the PUD and adjacent
areas. Such commercial uses shall be encouraged to locate at major
intersections rather than on local residential streets. Appropriate screening
between commercial and residential uses may be required.
(Ord. 52. Passed 6-16-97.)
1268.03   MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Except as otherwise expressly provided, the area, depth, frontage,
setback, height, and other bulk and placement regulations for permitted uses in
a PUD shall not be less than the minimum standards for the regulations
applicable in the district in which it is located.
   (b)   All other uses permitted within the PUD District shall meet, as a
minimum, the regulations that would otherwise be applicable to the use as
provided by the "Schedule of District Regulations." If the use is permitted in
more than one district or is subject to more than one set of regulations, the
most restrictive regulations applicable to that use shall constitute the
minimum standards for purposes of the PUD in question.
   (c)   Parking requirements for the PUD shall be equal to the sum of the
parking requirements for all uses proposed for the PUD as provided in this
Zoning Code.
(Ord. 52. Passed 6-16-97.)
1268.04   MODIFICATION OF MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   The Planning Commission may determine that a better or more
appropriate project design can be achieved, consistent with the purposes and
objectives of this chapter, by not applying the otherwise applicable minimum
requirements provided by this Zoning Code based on the application of site
planning criteria and the characteristics of the project area. In some cases,
adherence to minimum requirements is not required to ensure the health, safety,
and welfare of those using the development or adjacent property or to achieve
the purposes and objectives of this Zoning Code; then the Planning Commission
may authorize less restrictive minimum requirements to be integrated into the
approved PUD site plan for the project in question.
   (b)   The overall site density for a PUD project for which any of the
minimum requirements has been modified shall not exceed the density that would
otherwise be permitted by the density limitations applicable under this chapter
without any modification of the minimum requirements.
(Ord. 52. Passed 6-16-97.)
1268.05   CLUSTERING.
   (a)   The purpose of permitting residential clustering is to provide savings
in sewer, water, facilities, land resources, and energy use through the
concentration of dwellings, construction, and physical impact to specific areas
of a tract. Cluster development permits variation in lot size, shape, and
orientation without an increase in overall site density.
   (b)   Clustering may be permitted by the Planning Commission for PUD
developments approved pursuant to this chapter. The decision of the Planning
Commission as to whether or not to permit clustering for a particular project
shall be guided by the following standards:
      (1)   Individual lots, buildings, streets, and parking areas shall be
designed and situated to minimize alteration of the natural features and
topography.
      (2)   Individual lots and buildings shall be arranged and situated to
relate to surrounding properties to provide improved views from the buildings.
      (3)   Individual lots, buildings, streets, and parking areas shall be
situated to avoid the adverse effects of shadows, noise, and traffic on the
residents of the site and to lessen the area devoted to motor vehicles.
      (4)   Diversity, originality, lot layout, and individual building design
shall be encouraged to achieve a more compatible relationship between
development and the land.
      (5)   Cluster open space intended for recreational or public use shall be
easily accessible to pedestrians. Open space intended for scenic value shall be
visible from a significant number of units or buildings.
   (c)   Front, side, and rear yard requirements and lot areas that are
otherwise required by this Zoning Code shall not apply in a cluster development
except for perimeter lots. Variations from these required dimensions shall be
shown on the PUD site plan and must be approved by the Planning Commission.
   (d)   The number of dwelling units (and other permitted nonresidential uses)
permitted in a cluster development shall not exceed the density that would be
permitted by applying the following procedure:
      (1)   Determine the gross site area of the PUD.
      (2)   Subtract all wetland areas as defined in Act 203 of 1979.
      (3)   Subtract all areas to be used for street right-of-way purposes.
      (4)   Divide the remaining net area available by the applicable lot size
requirements.
(Ord. 52. Passed 6-16-97.)
1268.06   APPLICATION PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Applications for PUD approval shall be submitted as provided by this
section.
   (b)   An application for PUD approval shall require submission of a site
plan as required by this Zoning Code. To the extent not otherwise provided
pursuant to the requirements of this Zoning Code, the site plan for the PUD
shall also contain the following information:
      (1)   The square footage or acreage allocated to each proposed permitted
use.
      (2)   The locations of all structures, including proposed setbacks,
typical layout, and elevation for each type of use.
      (3)   Density calculations, number and types of residential units, and
floor area per habitable space.
      (4)   A description of all proposed permitted nonresidential uses, if
any.
      (5)   A landscape plan showing all woodlands, vegetation, and other
natural features to be preserved or added, topography, and similar features.
      (6)   The location and area of each development phase of a multi phased
development.
   (c)   An application for PUD approval shall also require submission of a
fully completed PUD application form. The PUD application form shall require
the applicant to provide information regarding the proposed PUD in sufficient
detail for the Planning Commission to determine compliance with this chapter
and with other applicable laws or regulations, including, at a minimum,
information regarding the following characteristics of the proposed PUD
development:
      (1)   The scope and nature of the proposed PUD and the objectives and
purposes to be served by the PUD.
      (2)   Compliance with all applicable requirements under local, State, or
Federal laws.
      (3)   The development and construction schedule indicating the
approximate date for commencement of construction, the stages or phases in
which the project will be built, and the expected starting and completion dates
of each stage.
      (4)   The identification and description of the organization or
individual that will own and maintain all land areas within the PUD, including
common open space.
      (5)   Compliance with the City's master plan.
      (6)   The impact of the PUD on public utilities, facilities, or services
on surrounding properties and on the natural environment.
      (7)   The status of ownership or control of the PUD such that there is a
single person or entity having responsibility for completing the PUD in
conformance with an approved site plan.
   (d)   If the site of a proposed PUD has not previously been rezoned as a PUD
District, the applicant must also apply for the necessary rezoning as a part of
the application for PUD approval.
   (e)   The required PUD application materials shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator, who shall transmit the materials and the petition for rezoning
to the Planning Commission. The application must be filed at least thirty days
prior to the Planning Commission hearing at which it is first to be considered.
Each application shall be accompanied by the payment of a fee in accordance
with the schedule of fees adopted by the City Council. No part of this fee
shall be refundable. No transmittals shall be made unless the required fees
have been paid in full.
(Ord. 52. Passed 6-16-97.)
1268.07   PLANNING COMMISSION REVIEW OF SITE PLAN AND REQUEST FOR REZONING.
   (a)   Following receipt of a completed PUD application, the Planning
Commission shall schedule a public hearing on the request for PUD approval,
including a review of the PUD site plan and consideration of the petition for
PUD rezoning. Notice of the public hearing shall be given in the same manner as
required by this Zoning Code for public hearings on special land uses.
   (b)   At the public hearing or within a reasonable time following the public
hearing, the Planning Commission shall take the following actions:
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall approve, approve with conditions, or
deny the request to approve the PUD site plan. The Planning Commission shall
prepare a report stating its conclusions on the request to approve the site
plan, the basis for its decision, and any conditions relating to an affirmative
decision.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall also review and make a recommendation
to the City Council on the proposed rezoning of the property to a PUD District
in accordance with the standards for approval for rezoning requests as provided
by this Zoning Code.
      (3)   The Planning Commission's report and recommendation to the City
Council, as required above, shall include its determination as to whether the
PUD project as described by the site plan meets the standards provided herein.
   (c)   A PUD site plan shall not be approved by the Planning Commission
unless the Commission finds that the PUD project, as proposed, will meet each
of the following conditions and requirements as applicable to the project in
question:
      (1)   The proposed development conforms to the intent and to all
applicable requirements and standards of this chapter and complies with all
other applicable local, State, or Federal laws and regulations.
      (2)   The proposed development conforms to the City's master plan.
      (3)   The overall density of the PUD does not exceed that which would be
allowed under the applicable minimum density limitations for single-family
dwelling units, two-family dwelling units, multiple-family dwelling units, and
any permitted nonresidential uses as applied to the actual number of each of
those types of units and uses included within the PUD.
      (4)   The project is designed to enhance environmental features, such as
the preservation of trees, floodplains, and natural areas, and promotes proper
site landscaping.
      (5)   The proposed development will be adequately served by public
facilities and services, such as highways, streets, police and fire protection,
drainage courses, water and sanitary sewer facilities, and refuse disposal; or
the persons or agencies responsible for the proposed development shall be able
to provide, in a manner acceptable to the Planning Commission, any such
facilities and services.
      (6)   The common open space, any other common properties, individual
properties, and all other elements of the PUD are so planned that they will
achieve a unified open and recreational area system with open space and all
other elements in appropriate locations, suitably related to each other, the
site, and the surrounding land.
      (7)   The applicant has made provision, satisfactory to the Planning
Commission, to assure that open space areas and rights-of-way shown on the site
plan for use by the public or by residents of the development will be or have
been irrevocably committed for that purpose. The applicant has also made
provision, satisfactory to the Planning Commission, for the financing of any
improvement shown on the plan for open space area and common use areas that are
to be included within the development; and maintenance of such improvements is
assured by a means satisfactory to the Planning Commission.
      (8)   The location of the proposed uses, the layout of the site, and its
relation to streets giving access to it is such that traffic to, from, and
within the site and assembly of persons in connection therewith will not be
hazardous or inconvenient to the project or the surrounding area. In applying
this standard, the Planning Commission shall consider, among other things,
convenient routes for pedestrian traffic, particularly of children; the
relationship of the proposed project to main thoroughfares and street
intersections; and the general character and intensity of the existing and
potential development of the surrounding area. Where open parking areas or
roadways are to be located immediately adjacent to any peripheral boundary, a
separation or buffer of a type sufficient to ensure the privacy of the adjacent
property shall be provided.
      (9)   The mix of housing unit types and densities and the mix of
residential and nonresidential uses, if any, is acceptable in terms of
convenience, privacy, compatibility, and similar measures.
      (10)   Noise, odor, light, or other external effect from any source
whatsoever that is connected with the proposed use will not adversely affect
adjacent and neighboring lands or uses.
      (11)   Streets follow the topography, are properly spaced, and are
located and aligned in accordance with the intended function of each street.
The property has adequate access to public streets. The plans provide for
logical extensions of public streets and provide suitable street connections to
adjacent parcels, where applicable.
      (12)   Adequate access for fire and other emergency vehicles shall be
provided on the site.
      (13)   Pedestrian circulation is provided for within the site, as
appropriate, and interconnects all residential areas, community areas, and
commercial and other services, where applicable. The pedestrian system provides
a logical extension of the pedestrian ways from outside the site and provides
pedestrian connections to the edges of the site, where appropriate.
      (14)   If a project is proposed for construction in phases, the planning
and designing are such that, upon completion, each phase shall be capable of
standing on its own in terms of the presence of services, facilities, and open
space and shall contain the necessary components to ensure protection of
natural resources and the health, safety, and welfare of the users of the PUD
and the residents of the surrounding area.
   (d)   Reasonable conditions may be required by the Planning Commission, in
conjunction with the approval of a PUD site plan, for the purpose of ensuring
that public services and facilities affected by a proposed land use or activity
will be capable of accommodating increased services and facility loads caused
by the land use or activity; protecting the natural environment and conserving
natural resources and energy; ensuring compatibility with adjacent uses of
land; and promoting the use of land in a socially and economically desirable
manner. Conditions imposed shall be designed to protect natural resources and
the public health, safety, and welfare of individuals in the project those
immediately adjacent and the community, as a whole. The conditions shall be
necessary to meet the intent and purpose of this chapter and shall be related
to the objective of ensuring compliance with the standards of this chapter. All
conditions imposed shall be made a part of the record of the approved PUD site
plan.
(Ord. 52. Passed 6-16-97.)
1268.08   CITY COUNCIL REVIEW OF REQUEST FOR REZONING.
   (a)   The City Council shall be provided with a copy of the Planning
Commission's report regarding its decision of approval, approval with
conditions, or denial of the PUD site plan along with a summary of comments
received at the public hearing, minutes of all proceedings, and all documents
related to the PUD request.
   (b)   The City Council shall also be provided with the Planning Commission's
recommendation on the proposed rezoning of the PUD site. After receipt of the
recommendation of the Planning Commission on the proposed rezoning, the City
Council may hold a public hearing to consider the rezoning request. Notice of
the public hearing, if held, shall be given in the same manner as required by
this Zoning Code.
   (c)   In making its determination on the proposed PUD rezoning, the City
Council may consider the Planning Commission's report and decision regarding
the Planning Commission's approval or denial of the PUD site plan; but the City
Council shall not engage in a substantive review of the details of a site plan
that has been approved by the Planning Commission.
   (d)   The City Council shall approve or deny the petition to rezone the
site, subject to the site plan, as approved by the Planning Commission, or
shall refer the petition back to the Planning Commission for further review.
   (e)   No construction shall commence, and no construction permits shall be
issued for all or any phase of a PUD, until a site plan has been approved by
the Planning Commission and the property has been rezoned by the City Council
as provided by this chapter.
(Ord. 52. Passed 6-16-97.)
1268.09   EFFECT OF APPROVAL OF SITE PLAN BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   The PUD site plan, as approved by the Planning Commission, including all
approved maps and accompanying written materials and any conditions of
approval, shall be binding upon the applicant and owners of record and upon
their heirs, successors, and assigns with respect to all future development of

and to preserve the aesthetic and scenic values of the watershed environment.
   (b)   The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) requires the
designation of 100-year floodplains to determine eligibility for Federal
floodplain insurance. Most major rivers in the United States have been mapped
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or other agencies to determine the limits
of the floodplain. In Michigan, the Department of Natural Resources has been
assigned the responsibility of monitoring the implementation of these
requirements.

site design where feasible. Trees in excess of six-inch caliper must be
replaced by an equivalent amount, type, and quality of tree. Removal of mature
trees of twelve-inch caliper or greater will be discouraged.
      (9)   Natural drainage courses shall be protected from grading activity.
      (10)   Where known, groundwater flow patterns shall not be interrupted.
      (11)   Slopes created by the grading of the site should generally not
exceed a slope ratio of one foot of vertical slope to three feet of horizontal
distance.
      (12)   Buildings shall be clustered as much as possible to retain open
space and surrounding tree cover and to minimize changes in topography.
      (13)   Screening along roadways shall make maximum use of berming and
landscaping but shall not interfere with site distances.
   (b)   Natural Vegetative Buffer. A thirty-five foot wide strip of land
bordering the river shall be maintained in its natural state. Natural state
shall mean native plants, shrubbery, tall grasses, and trees.
      (1)   Removal of vegetation in the natural vegetative buffer shall be
limited to no more than twenty-five percent of the length of this buffer,
provided that cutting of this twenty-five percent shall not create a clear-cut
opening greater than twenty-five feet wide for every 100 feet of shoreline.
      (2)   Natural shrubbery, trees, or other vegetation shall be preserved as
far as practical and, where removed, shall be replaced with other naturally
occurring vegetation that is equally effective in retarding runoff, preventing
erosion, and preserving natural beauty. A mowed lawn is not a desirable
vegetative buffer adjacent to the shoreline.
      (3)   Native plants, shrubbery, and trees are encouraged when new
vegetation is planted.
      (4)   Existing soil and organic matter shall not be altered or disturbed
within the natural vegetative buffer.
      (5)   These provisions shall not apply to the removal of dead, diseased,
or dying trees, at the discretion of the landowner.
   (c)   Drainage of Surface Water. Proper site surface drainage shall be
provided so that the removal of surface waters will not adversely affect
neighboring properties or the public storm drainage system. If practical,
stormwater shall be removed from all roof areas, canopies, and paved areas and
carried away in an underground drainage system. The peak rate of stormwater
runoff from the site shall not increase as a result of the proposed
development, and temporary onsite storage to reduce peak runoff from the site
is encouraged. Surface water in all paved areas shall be collected at intervals
so that it will not obstruct the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic and so
that it will not create ponding.
(Ord. 52. Passed 6-16-97.)
1270.06   REVIEW REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   No use of property shall be allowed without documented proof that the
conditions required of FEMA for obtaining insurance are met; or written
indication from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) that
compliance is unnecessary. These requirements shall apply to all property, any
portion of which is indicated as being within the designated floodplain areas.
It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to determine the location
of the floodplain in accordance with the site plan review procedures provided
for in this Zoning Code, and that the floodplain does not encroach upon the
limits of the parcel in question. For their own interest and protection,
property owners are encouraged to obtain a written determination from the MDEQ
when it is apparent from the Zoning Map that their property is within or
directly adjacent to the designated area. No zoning or building permit will be
issued until compliance with this section has been documented.
   (b)   In reviewing an application and the standards for approval of a
special land use permitted under this section, the Planning Commission shall
consider the following factors before rendering a decision on the request for
approval:
      (1)   Any possible danger to life and property due to increased flood
heights or velocities caused by encroachments on the floodplain.
      (2)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed development and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the development to the
community.
      (5)   The requirement of the proposed development for a waterfront
location.
      (6)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the City's master plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site.
      (11)   The location, elevation, and construction of all public utilities
and facilities for sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems designed relative
to minimizing or eliminating flood damage.
      (12)   The measures taken to assure adequate drainage so as to reduce
exposure to flood hazards.
      (13)   Such other factors that are, in the opinion of the Planning
Commission, relevant to the purposes of this district.
      (14)   If, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, topographic data,
engineering studies, or other studies are needed to determine the effects of
flooding on a proposed use and/or the effects of the use on the floodway, the
Planning Commission may require the applicant to submit such data and/or
studies prepared by competent engineers or other technical people.
   (c)   To the extent not otherwise provided pursuant to the site plan
requirements under this chapter, the Planning Commission shall require, as
applicable, submission of the following materials:
      (1)   Plans drawn to a scale of one inch equals 100 feet; the nature,
location, dimensions, and elevation of the lot; existing or proposed
structures; fill; storage of materials; and the relationship of the above to
the location of the channel floodway and regulatory flood protection level.
      (2)   A plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground
at five-foot intervals; pertinent structure, fill, or storage elevations; size,
location, and spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing buildings on the
site; location and elevations of streets; photographs or maps showing existing
land uses and vegetation; upstream and downstream soil types; and other
pertinent information that may be required by the Planning Commission.
   (d)   The Planning Commission may impose reasonable conditions, including,
without limitation, limitations on the period of use and operation; imposition
of operational controls, sureties, deed restrictions, and covenants; and
requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes, levees, and
other protective measures.

   (a)   This chapter establishes standards and requirements for the review and
approval, by the Planning Commission, of site plans. As used in this chapter,
"site plan" includes the documents and drawings, as specified by this chapter,
that are necessary as a part of the land development review process to ensure
that a proposed land use or activity is in compliance with applicable local
ordinances and State statutes and is compatible with the character of the
surrounding area; the adjacent uses of land; the natural environment; the
capacities of public services and facilities; and the public health, safety,
and welfare.
   (b)   The standards and requirements provided by this chapter shall be in
addition to those required elsewhere in this Zoning Code that are applicable to
the use or activity under consideration.
   (c)   The intent of this chapter is to provide for consultation and
cooperation between the applicant and the Planning Commission in order that the
applicant may accomplish his or her objectives in the utilization of his or her
land within the regulations of this Zoning Code and with minimum adverse effect
on the use of adjacent streets and highways, and on existing and future uses
and the environment in the immediate area and vicinity.

   (g)   For all site plans prepared on a computer, a single diskette copy
shall be provided to the Zoning Administrator in digital format.
(Ord. 52. Passed 6-16-97.)
1272.10   STANDARDS FOR SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   The Planning Commission shall review the site plan based on the purposes,
objectives, and requirements of this Zoning Code and on the standards provided
by this section. As a part of its review, the Planning Commission may
distribute copies of the plan to other governmental departments or officials.
Their review and comment would be on matters related to the plan that would
fall under their jurisdiction or involve the discharge of their duties. In
reviewing the site plan, the Planning Commission shall specifically consider
the following standards, as applicable:
   (a)   Dimensional Requirements. The dimensional arrangement of buildings and
structures shall conform to the required yards, setbacks, and height
restrictions of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Building Arrangement. The proposed buildings and structures shall have
a harmonious relationship to the site terrain, landscaping, open space, and
other buildings and structures, existing and proposed. The bulk, location, and
height of proposed buildings and structures, as well as the general character
of the development, shall minimize any adverse effect on other uses of property
in the surrounding area and shall not place demands on public services or
facilities in excess of capacity.
   (c)   Drainage of Surface Water. Proper site surface drainage shall be
provided so that the removal of surface waters will not adversely affect
neighboring properties or the public storm drainage system. If practical, storm
water shall be removed from all roof areas, canopies, and paved areas and
carried away in an underground drainage system. The peak rate of storm water
runoff from the site shall not increase as a result of the proposed
development, and temporary onsite storage to reduce peak runoff from the site
is encouraged. Surface water in all paved areas shall be collected at intervals
so that it will not obstruct the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic and so
that it will not create ponding.
   (d)   Public Services and Utilities. The location, availability, and
compatibility of sewer, water, and storm drainage facilities shall be
considered to determine whether the use will be adequately served by necessary
improvements. Utility distribution lines or associated utility installations
shall be located so as to avoid adverse impacts both to neighboring properties
and to the site.
   (e)   Vehicular Access and Parking. The provisions for vehicular loading and
unloading and parking and for vehicular and pedestrian circulation on the site
and onto adjacent public streets and ways shall not create hazards to safety
and shall not place demands on public services or facilities in excess of
capacity. All buildings and structures shall be accessible by emergency
vehicles.
   (f)   Exterior Lighting. All lighting shall be installed and maintained in
such a manner as to confine the illumination source or divert glare to the
property upon which the use is located and to prevent glare or illumination
from adversely affecting the safety or welfare of adjacent property or streets.
   (g)   Signs. The size, location, design, and lighting of signs shall be
considered in relation to signs on adjacent sites, glare, traffic safety, and
compatibility with adjoining properties, consistent with all applicable sign
regulations. Signs shall be located and designed to avoid creating distraction
or clutter.
   (h)   Special Features. Storage areas, mechanical areas, service areas,
truck loading areas, utility buildings and structures, and similar features
shall be located, buffered, and/or screened so as to be unobtrusive; so as not
to interfere with access to or circulation within the site; or so as not to
detract from the visual impression of the site. Trash containers shall be
enclosed on at least three sides by a structure aesthetically compatible with
the development and surrounding property. Waste storage areas shall be
maintained free from litter and in a sanitary condition.
   (i)   Landscaping. The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state,
insofar as practicable, by minimizing tree and soil removal. Grade changes made
shall be in keeping with the general appearance of neighboring developed areas.
Plant materials shall be used to enhance the appearance of the site; to screen
unsightly or harsh elements; and to provide visual relief from large monotonous
features, such as parking lots.
   (j)   External Effects (General). Noise, odor, light, dust, dirt, smoke, or
other external effects from any aspect of the proposed use shall not adversely
affect adjacent and neighboring properties or uses.
   (k)   Compliance With All Applicable Laws. The Planning Commission shall not
approve a site plan that violates or that is inconsistent with local, State, or
Federal laws or regulations. (Ord. 52. Passed 6-16-97.)
1272.11   CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL.
   The Planning Commission shall make a decision to approve the request based
on the following conditions:
   (a)   The Planning Commission may impose any other regulations which it
deems necessary to protect the safety, health, and general welfare of the
people of Reed City and shall have the authority to make any changes or
alterations in submitted plans and modify any requirements and regulations
herein prescribed, provided they are in the best public interest and such that
the property may be developed in a reasonable manner; but in so doing,
complying with other applicable provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   The Planning Commission may impose reasonable conditions upon the
approval of a site plan. The conditions may include, but are not limited to,
conditions necessary to ensure that public services and facilities affected by
a proposed land use or activity will be capable of accommodating increased
service and facility loads caused by the land use or activity, to protect the
natural environment and conserve natural resources and energy, to ensure
compatibility with adjacent uses of land, and to promote the use of land in a
socially and economically desirable manner. Conditions imposed shall meet all

1274.01   PURPOSES; PERMITTED USES.
   (a)   The development and execution of this Zoning Code are based upon the
division of the City into districts, within which districts the use of land and
structures and the bulk and location of structures in relation to the land is
substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are special uses
which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified
in any particular district or districts without consideration, in each case, of
the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for
particular use at the particular location. Such special uses fall into two
categories:
      (1)   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest, such as public utilities facilities, public meeting buildings, and
transportation facilities.
      (2)   Uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature
that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their
impact upon neighboring property or public facilities, such as drive-in
facilities, special medical care facilities, extraction of minerals, and
neighborhood shopping facilities.
   (b)   The purpose of this chapter is to establish equitable procedures and
criteria that shall be met before the following special land uses are
permitted:
      (1)   Bed and breakfasts.
      (2)   Campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks.
      (3)   Child care centers.
      (4)   Communications towers.
      (5)   Drive-through or drive-in businesses.
      (6)   Educational services.
      (7)   Floodplain overlay district uses.
      (8)   Funeral homes.
      (9)   Fueling service stations.
      (10)   Golf courses and country clubs.
      (11)   Individual and family social services.
      (12)   Membership organizations and fraternal associations.
      (13)   Mini-storage self-storage warehouses.
      (14)   Motels or hotels.
      (15)   Motor vehicle repair.
      (16)   Municipally operated sanitary landfill.
      (17)   Nursing and personal care facilities.
      (18)   Landscape nurseries and landscaping contractors.
      (19)   Professional offices.
      (20)   Outdoor commercial recreation.
      (21)   Outdoor sales.
      (22)   Public and institutional uses.
      (23)   Public utility facilities.
      (24)   Salvage/junk yards.
      (25)   Sexually oriented businesses.
      (26)   State-licensed residential facilities (for seven persons or more).
      (27)   Upper floor dwellings.
      (28)   Single family dwelling conversions to multiple family dwelling
units.

   (z)   State Licensed Residential Facilities (For Seven Persons or More).
Uses shall be permitted subject to the following procedures and conditions:
      (1)   The proposed facility shall be consistent with and shall promote
the intent and purpose of this Zoning Code and shall be compatible with
adjacent uses of land, the natural environment, and the capacities of public
services and facilities affected by the proposed facility. In making its
determination regarding a proposed facility, the Planning Commission shall
consider the following factors:
         A.   The design and location of the proposed facility; the density of
population; the adequacy of educational, recreational, and other public support
facilities; traffic volumes and circulation; compatibility with existing
development; adequate provision for light and air; adequate provision of
parking; and accessibility of fire and police protection.
         B.   The density of similar uses in the area; the cumulative effects
of allowing the proposed facility (including effects upon the capacities of
existing community recreation, social service, and other support facilities);
and whether the proposed facility will alter the character of the neighborhood.
In order to prevent an excessive concentration of facilities and consequent
alteration of a neighborhood's character and protect existing facilities from
overdevelopment that could result in an undesirable atmosphere, no facility
shall be located within a 1,500-foot radius of any other facility unless the
Planning Commission finds that a lesser distance is compatible with the goals
of this Zoning Code and that the facility would not contribute to an excessive
concentration of such facilities within a particular neighborhood.
         C.   The accessibility of the proposed facility to convenience
services, such as shopping, banking, health care, and public transportation; to
employment opportunities; and to community resources and agencies, including
medical and social services, that might be used by the facility's residents.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall establish requirements for setback,
lot size, side yard, parking, screening, and other conditions as necessary for
the facility to conform to the character of the adjacent neighborhood and to
protect adjacent property from adverse impacts.
      (3)   If the State licensed residential facility is an adult foster care
facility it shall:
         A.   Be located on a major arterial street, and an off-street drop-
off/pick-up area must be provided, including an onsite vehicle turnaround or

not less than 5,000 square feet of rear yard area per facility shall be
provided and maintained on the lot. For purposes of this section, "rear yard
area" means an area that is available or devoted to outdoor activities,
exclusive of any area occupied by a swimming pool or required parking areas.
The rear yard area shall be free from sharp gravel, glass, or cinder and shall
be well-drained. The rear yard area shall be completely enclosed by a chain-
link or solid fence of at least four feet in height and shall be screened from
any abutting residential use by vegetation having a height, when planted, of at
least five feet.
         C.   Be registered and licensed as required under the appropriate
State act (Act 116 of the Public Acts of 1973, as amended).
      (4)   If the State licensed residential facility is a licensed day care
facility it shall:
         A.   Have child drop-off and pickup areas and other facilities, design
elements, and operational requirements, provided or complied with, as
determined necessary by the Planning Commission, for the safety of the children
attending the State licensed residential facility.

setback of the facility that is available or devoted to outdoor activities,
exclusive of any area occupied by a swimming pool or required parking areas.
The outdoor play area shall be free from sharp gravel, glass, or cinder, and
shall be well-drained. The outdoor play area shall be completely enclosed by a
chain-link or solid fence of at least four feet in height and shall be screened

facility; to any facility offering substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation
service to seven or more people, licensed by the State of Michigan; or to any
community correctional center, resident home, halfway house, or other similar
facility that houses an inmate population under the jurisdiction of the State
Department of Corrections.
         D.   Not exceed sixteen hours during any twenty-four hour period and,
unless specifically approved by the Planning Commission based upon a finding

1276.01   INTENT.
   Under the terms of this Zoning Code or future amendments hereto, lots, uses
of land, and structures or characteristics of use (which were lawful before
this Zoning Code was passed or amended), may be prohibited, regulated, or
restricted. It is the intent of this Zoning Code to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
survival. (Ord. 52. Passed 6-16-97.)
1276.02   AREA, WIDTH AND SETBACK VARIANCES.
   In any district, a permitted use or structure and related accessory
structures may be constructed on any single lot of record at the effective date
of adoption of this Zoning Code not withstanding limitations imposed by other
provisions of this Zoning Code. This provision shall apply even though such lot
fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally
applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements
other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform
to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of
setback requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Zoning Board
of Appeals.
(Ord. 52. Passed 6-16-97.)
1276.03   NONCONFORMING VACANT LOTS.
   Any lot platted or created and recorded prior to the effective date of this
Zoning Code that fails to comply with the minimum requirements of the zoning
district in which it is located may be sold and/or utilized for uses as
authorized by this Zoning Code, provided the lot is not adjacent to other land,
property, or lots in similar ownership. Such lot must be in separate ownership
and not contiguous with other lots in the same ownership. Landowners must
remedy nonconformities by using adjacent land they own. No such nonconforming
lot shall be decreased in size by sale or lease of the entire parcel or
portions thereof.
(Ord. 52. Passed 6-16-97.)
1276.04   NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Code that could not be built under the terms of this
Zoning Code by reason of restrictions on area, height, yards, its location on
the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following
provisions:
   (a)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
   (b)   Any such nonconforming structure which has been damaged or destroyed
by any means may be reconstructed provided it does not extend beyond the limits
of the original foundation or exceed its prior square footage.
   (c)   Should such nonconforming structure be moved for any reason for any
distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the
district in which it is located after it is moved.
      (Ord. 52. Passed 6-16-97.)
1276.05   NONCONFORMING LAND USES.
   Where, at the time of the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
Zoning Code, lawful use of land exists or was occupied which would not be
permitted by the regulations imposed by this Zoning Code, the use may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
   (a)   No such nonconforming use shall be modified, enlarged, or increased
nor extended to occupy a greater area nor otherwise changed except to make the
use less nonconforming or by change to a permitted use.
   (b)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that previously occupied.
   (c)   When a nonconforming use is discontinued for any reason for a period
of more than 180 days, the use may not thereafter be resumed or used except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located and any
subsequent use of such land shall conform with the regulations specified by
this Zoning Code.
   (d)   The nonconforming use may be extended through any parts of a building
arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this
Zoning Code, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such
building.
   (e)   No additional structure shall be erected in connection with such
nonconforming use of land.
   (f)   No nonconforming use may be continued if it has been destroyed by
natural or artificial means to an extent determined to be more than one-half
its value based on the SEV as recorded in the most recent official tax roll.
Nor can it be changed to another nonconforming use. All new or rebuilt
structures shall be erected in conformance with the ordinance appropriate to
the district in which it is located.
   (g)   The nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use
provided the Zoning Board of Appeals shall find that the proposed use is
equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing
nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Zoning Board of Appeals may
require appropriate conditions and safeguards.
   (h)   Any nonconforming use which is superseded by a permitted use shall
thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located,
and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
      (Ord. 52. Passed 6-16-97.)
1276.06   REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE.
   Repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing
may be performed in or on a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure
containing a nonconforming use provided:
   (a)   During any consecutive twelve-month period, extent of repair or
replacement shall not exceed ten percent of the current replacement cost of the
nonconforming structure.
   (b)   Cubic contents of the structure shall not be increased.
   (c)   If the nonconforming structure or portion of the structure containing
a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical
condition, such structure shall not be restored, repaired, or rebuilt, except
in conformity with the current regulations of the district in which it is
located. (Ord. 52. Passed 6-16-97.)
1276.07   ACQUISITION BY CITY OF PROPERTY CONTAINING A NONCONFORMING USE OR
STRUCTURE.
   For the purpose of removing nonconforming uses or structures, the City, by
purchase, condemnation, or otherwise, may acquire private property on which a
nonconforming use or structure is located. (Ord. 52. Passed 6-16-97.)

1450.02   PREAMBLE.
   (a)   It is acknowledged that it is a proper public purpose of the State of
Michigan and its political subdivisions to provide housing for its low-income
persons and families and to encourage the development of such housing by
providing for a service charge in lieu of property taxes in accordance with the
Act. The City is authorized by this Act to establish or change the service
charge to be paid in lieu of taxes by any or all classes of housing exempt from
taxation under this Act at any amount it chooses, not to exceed the taxes that
would be paid but for this Act. It is further acknowledged that such housing
for persons and families of low income is a public necessity, and as the City
will be benefitted and improved by such housing, the encouragement of the same
by providing real estate tax exemption for such housing is a valid public
purpose. It is further acknowledged that the continuance of the provisions of
this chapter for tax exemption and the service charge in lieu of all ad valorem
taxes during the period contemplated in this chapter are essential to the
determination of economic feasibility of the housing projects that is
constructed or rehabilitated with financing extended in reliance on such tax
exemption.
   (b)   The City acknowledges that the "sponsor", (as defined below) has
offered, subject to receipt of a federally or authority-aided mortgage loan and
an allocation under the LIHTC Program from the Michigan State Housing
Development Authority, to construct or acquire and own, rehabilitate and
operate a housing project identified as Crossroads Apartments on certain
property located at 848 Chestnut in the City to serve low income persons and
families, and that the sponsor has offered to pay the City on account of this
housing project an annual service charge for public services in lieu of all ad
valorem property taxes.
(Ord. Unno. Passed 7-21-03; Ord. 04-2024. Passed 9-9-24.)
1450.03   DEFINITIONS.
   All terms shall be defined as set forth in the Act, except as follows:
   (a)   "Annual shelter rent" means the total collections during an agreed
annual period from or paid on behalf of all occupants of a housing project
representing rent or occupancy charges, exclusive of utilities.
   (b)   "Authority" means the Michigan State Housing Development Authority.
   (c)   "LIHTC Program" means the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program
administered by the Authority under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended.
   (d)   "Low income persons and families" means persons and families eligible
to move into a housing project.
   (e)   "Mortgage loan" means a loan that is federally aided (as defined in
section 11 of the Act) or a loan or grant made or to be made by the Authority
to the sponsor for the construction, rehabilitation, acquisition and/or
permanent financing of a housing project and secured by a mortgage on the
housing project.
   (f)   "Sponsor" means GDC-CR Limited Dividend Housing Association, LLC, and
any entity that receives or assumes a mortgage loan.
   (g)   "Utilities" means charges for gas, electric, water, sanitary sewer and
other utilities furnished to the occupants that are paid by the housing
project.
(Ord. Unno. Passed 7-21-03; Ord. 04-2024. Passed 9-9-24.)
1450.04   CLASS OF HOUSING PROJECTS.
   It is determined that the class of housing projects to which the tax
exemption shall apply and for which a service charge shall be paid in lieu of
such taxes shall be housing projects for low income persons and families that
are financed with a mortgage loan. It is further determined that Crossroads
Apartments is of this class.
(Ord. Unno. Passed 7-21-03; Ord. 04-2024. Passed 9-9-24.)
1450.05   ESTABLISHMENT OF ANNUAL SERVICE CHARGE.
   The housing project identified as Crossroads Apartments and the property on
which it is located, 848 S. Chestnut, Reed City, Michigan, shall be exempt from
all ad valorem property taxes from and after the commencement of construction
or rehabilitation. The City acknowledges that the sponsor and the Authority
have established the economic feasibility of the housing project in reliance
upon the enactment and continuing effect of this chapter, and the qualification
of the housing project for exemption from all ad valorem property taxes and a
payment in lieu of taxes as established in this chapter. Therefore, in
consideration of the sponsor's offer to rehabilitate and operate the housing
project, the City agrees to accept payment of an annual service charge for
public services in lieu of all ad valorem property taxes. The annual service
charge shall be equal to 6.0% of the annual shelter rents and utilities of the
housing project during each operating year.
(Ord. Unno. Passed 7-21-03; Ord. 04-2024. Passed 9-9-24.)
1450.06   LIMITATION ON THE PAYMENT OF ANNUAL SERVICE CHARGE.
   Notwithstanding Section
1450.05, the service charge to be paid each year in lieu of taxes for the part
of the housing project that is tax exempt, but which is occupied by other than
low-income persons or families shall be equal to the full amount of the taxes
which would be paid on that portion of the housing project if the housing
project were not tax exempt.
(Ord. Unno. Passed 7-21-03; Ord. 04-2024. Passed 9-9-24.)
1450.07   CONTRACTUAL EFFECT OF ORDINANCE.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of section 15a (7) of the Act to the
contrary, a contract between the City and the sponsor with the Authority as
third party beneficiary under the contract, to provide tax exemption and accept
payments in lieu of taxes, as previously described, is effectuated by enactment
of this chapter.
(Ord. Unno. Passed 7-21-03; Ord. 04-2024. Passed 9-9-24.)
1450.08   PAYMENT OF SERVICE CHARGE.
   The annual service charge in lieu of taxes as determined under this chapter
shall be payable in the same manner as general property taxes are payable to
the City and distributed to the several units levying the general property tax
in the same proportion as prevailed with the general property tax in the
previous calendar year. The annual payment for each operating year shall be
paid on or before August 31st of each year based on the actual rent and
utilities collected through December 31st of the preceding year. Collection
procedures shall be in accordance with the provisions of the General Property
Tax Act (1893 PA 206, as amended; MCL 211.1, et seq).
(Ord. Unno. Passed 7-21-03; Ord. 04-2024. Passed 9-9-24.)
1450.09   DURATION.
   This chapter shall remain in effect and shall not terminate so long as a
mortgage loan remains outstanding and unpaid and the housing project remains
subject to income and rent restrictions under the LIHTC Program; and provided
that construction or rehabilitation of the housing project begins within two
years from the effective date of this chapter, unless extended by a resolution
of the City Council. This chapter is limited to a period of forty years from
date of Council approval.
