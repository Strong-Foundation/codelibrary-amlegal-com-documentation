Sec. 11-06   Fire chief, firemen, department employees; compensation

the fire department shall receive such compensation as the council may
prescribe.
Chapter 12 - Ordinances
Sec. 12-01   Enacting clause, style
   The enacting clause of all ordinances shall be: “The City of Hamtramck
ordains.” Such caption may be omitted, however, when the ordinances are
published in book form or are revised and digested by authority of the council.
Sec. 12-02   Adoption, requisites; effective date
   Every proposed ordinance or summary thereof shall first be read at a council
meeting. Thereafter, the ordinance shall be made available to the public for
fourteen (14) days at the city clerk’s office. No less than fourteen (14) days
following its initial reading, the council shall hold a public hearing
regarding the proposed ordinance. At that same public hearing, the council may
pass a resolution adopting the ordinance, including any changes.
   Every ordinance, unless otherwise provided for in this charter, shall
require for its passage and adoption a majority vote of the council- and mayor-
elect and shall take effect fourteen (14) days after the publication of the
ordinance unless otherwise provided in the ordinance itself, but not before
publication.
Sec. 12-03   Record, authentication required
   All ordinances when regularly enacted shall be recorded by the city clerk in
a book called “The Record of Ordinances”, and it shall be the duty of the mayor
and the clerk to authenticate the same by their official signatures upon such
record.
Sec. 12-04   Record, publication; city clerk, duties
   Within ten days after the passage of any ordinance, the ordinance or a
summary thereof shall be recorded by the clerk and published in a newspaper of
general circulation; and the clerk shall, immediately after such publication,
enter in the record of ordinances, in a blank space to be left for such purpose
under the record of the ordinance, a certificate under his hand, stating the
time and place of such publication. Such certificate shall be prima facie
evidence of the due publication of the ordinance.
Sec. 12-05   Violations of ordinances; penalty, restriction
   When by the provisions of this charter the council has authority to pass
ordinances for any purpose, it may prescribe a penalty for each violation
thereof. Such penalty shall be a fine or forfeiture of not exceeding the
maximum allowed by state law, or imprisonment for a period not exceeding ninety
(90) days or ninety-three (93) days in cases where state law so provides, or
both, in the discretion of the court, together with payment of the costs of
prosecution. Such ordinances may further provide that in case any person shall
fail to pay any fine so imposed, together with the costs of prosecution, that
he may be imprisoned until such fine and costs shall be paid. Provided,
however, that no person shall be imprisoned for a single violation of any
ordinance for a longer period than ninety (90) days or ninety-three (93) days
in cases where state law so provides. Such penalty shall be prescribed in the
ordinance.
Sec. 12-06   Violations; fines, recovery; procedure
   Whenever a penalty shall be incurred for the violation of any ordinance, and
no provision shall be made for imprisonment of the offender upon conviction
thereof, such penalty may be recovered in an action of debt. And when a
corporation shall incur a penalty for the violation of any such ordinance, the
same shall be sued for in one of the actions aforesaid. Prosecutions for
violations of the ordinances of the City, may, in all cases, except against
corporations, be commenced by warrant for the arrest of the offender. Such
warrant shall be in the name of the People of the State of Michigan, and shall
set forth the substance of the offense complained of, and shall be issued upon
complaint made as provided for criminal cases cognizable by the appropriate
court. The proceedings relating to the arrest and custody of the accused during
the pendency of the suit, the pleadings in procuring the attendance and
testimony of witnesses, and in rendition of judgments and the execution
thereof, shall, except as otherwise provided by this charter, be governed by
and conform, as nearly as may be, to the provisions of law regulating
proceedings in criminal cases cognizable by the appropriate court.
Sec. 12-07   Complaints, pleadings; reference to ordinances

complaint or warrant, to set forth substantially, and with reasonable
certainty, the act or offense complained of, the date, the time when, and place
where committed, and alleging a violation of an ordinance of the city,
referring to the ordinance number and section, and signed by the enforcement
officer or official.
   It shall not be necessary in any suit, proceeding, or prosecution for the
violation of any ordinance, to state or set forth such ordinance or any of the
provisions thereof, in any complaint, warrant, process, or pleading therein,
but the same shall be deemed sufficiently set forth or stated by reciting its
number.
Chapter 13 - Taxation and Finance
Sec. 13-01   Power to tax; limitations
   The City is authorized annually to levy property taxes for municipal
purposes not to exceed two percent (20 mills) on all real and personal property
in the city. The subjects of taxation for municipal purposes must be in
accordance with statute and the same as for state, county, and school taxes.
The City levies, collects, and returns state, county, and school taxes as
provided by ordinance in accordance with law.
Sec. 13-02   Exemption from taxes
   No exemptions from taxation shall be allowed, except as expressly required
or permitted by statute.
Sec. 13-03   Tax day
   The taxable status of persons and property shall be determined as of the
31st day of December, which shall be deemed the tax day for the immediately
succeeding calendar year, which is also the tax year, subject to the exceptions
provided or permitted by statute.
Sec. 13-04   Preparation of the assessment roll
   The assessor shall make and complete an assessment roll for the city, in the
manner and form provided in the general tax law of the state, not later than
the first Monday in March each year. On that date he shall file such roll with
the clerk for public inspection during the normal office hours of the clerk,
and such period of inspection shall continue until the date of convening of the
board of review. On that date the clerk shall turn such assessment roll over to
the board of review. Further, the assessor shall, by first class mail addressed
to the owner named on the tax roll, notify the owner of any change in the
assessment of the property; such notice shall be mailed prior to March 1st.
Failure on the part of the assessor to give such notice shall not invalidate
the assessment roll nor release the person or property assessed from any taxes
provided in this charter.
Sec. 13-05   Board of Review
   The board of review shall be appointed by the mayor, subject to approval by
a majority vote of council- and mayor-elect, and shall be comprised of three
persons who are residents in the city, and have the qualifications required by
this charter for officers of the city. The term of office shall be for two
years. The members of the board, during their term of office, shall not be city
officers, employees, nominees, or candidates for elective city office. The
assessor shall be secretary of the board and shall attend its meetings prepared
to present the position of his office without the right to vote upon any
decision of the board.
Sec. 13-06   Duties and Functions of board of review
   For the purpose of reviewing and correcting assessments, the board of review
shall have the same powers and perform like duties in all aspects as are by
statute conferred upon and required of boards of review, except as otherwise
provided in this charter. It shall hear the complaints of all persons
considering themselves aggrieved by assessments; and if it shall appear that
any person or property has been wrongfully assessed or omitted from the roll,
the board shall correct the roll in such manner as it deems just. In all cases,
the roll shall be reviewed according to the facts existing on the tax day, and
no change in the status of any property after said day shall be considered by
the board in making its decisions. Except as otherwise provided by statute, no
person other than the board of review shall make or authorize any change upon
or additions or corrections to the assessment roll.
Sec. 13-07   Clerk to certify tax levy
   Within three days after the council has adopted the budget for the ensuing
year, the clerk shall certify to the assessor the total amount which the
council determines shall be raised by general ad valorem tax. He shall also
certify all amounts of current or delinquent special assessments and all other
amounts which the council requires to be assessed, reassessed, or charged upon
any property or against any person.
Sec. 13-08   City tax roll
   After the board of review has completed its review of the assessment roll,
the assessor shall prepare a copy of the assessment roll, to be known as the
“City Tax Roll”, and upon the certifications of the several amounts to be
raised, as provided in Section 10, the assessor shall spread upon said roll the
several ad valorem taxes according to and in proportion to the several
valuations set forth in the assessment roll. To avoid fractions in computation
on any tax roll, the assessor may add to the amounts as prescribed by statute.
Any excess created thereby on any tax roll shall belong to the city.
Sec. 13-09   Tax roll certified for collection
   After spreading the taxes, the assessor shall certify the tax roll and the
mayor shall sign his warrant thereto directing and requiring the treasurer to
collect from the several persons named in the tax roll, the several sums
mentioned thereon opposite their respective names as a tax or assessment, and
granting to him, for the purpose of collecting the taxes, assessments and
charges on the roll, all statutory powers and immunities possessed by city
treasurers for the collection of taxes.
   Such warrant shall further direct that all taxes paid on or before the 20th
day of August shall be collected without additional charge. If any person shall
pay one-half of the general city taxes on or before the 31st day of July of the
year in which said taxes are assessed, he may pay the remaining one-half of
such taxes on or before the 30th day of December of that year without
additional charge, but, should the remaining one-half not be paid on or before
30th day of December, then the same shall be subject to collection charges as
in section
13-12. Failure to pay the second half on or before December 30th shall subject
the property to all the provisions of this charter relating to delinquent taxes
the same as if the first half had not been paid, except that no interest or
penalty shall be charged against the one-half that is paid. Payment of one-half
a tax shall not in any manner nullify the provisions of section
13-12. The persons liable for a tax under the provisions of this charter on
July 15 of each year shall be liable for the full amount of the tax, and such
tax shall not be considered ‘paid’ until paid in full.
Sec. 13-10   Tax lien on property
   The taxes thus assessed shall become a debt due to the City from the persons
to whom they are assessed. The amounts assessed on any interest in real
property shall become a lien upon such real property, for such amounts and for
all interest and charges thereon, and all personal taxes shall become a first
lien on all personal property of such persons so assessed. Such lien shall take
precedence over all other claims, encumbrances, and liens to the extent
provided by statute and shall continue until such taxes, interest, and charges
are paid.
Sec. 13-11   Taxes due; notification
   The treasurer shall give notice to the taxpayers of the City, by publication
at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City (which
publication of notice shall be made at least ten days prior to the first day of
July), of the time when the taxes will be due for collection and shall give
such notice of the time when the taxes will be due for collection by first
class mail addressed to the owners of the property upon which taxes are
assessed, according to the names of such owners and their addresses as
indicated on the tax roll. Such notice shall be deemed sufficient for the
payment of all taxes on the tax roll. Failure on the part of the treasurer to
give notice shall not invalidate the taxes on the tax roll nor release the
person or property assessed from any penalty or interest provided for in this
charter in case of nonpayment of the same.
Sec. 13-12   Collection fees
   When property taxes shall become delinquent, the treasurer shall add to all
taxes paid thereafter a collection fee of four percent (4%) of the amount of
the taxes. Such collection fee shall belong to the City and constitute a charge
and shall be a lien against the property to which the taxes themselves apply,
collectible in the same manner as the taxes to which they are added. The City
may by ordinance provide interest and penalties for delinquent city real and
personal property taxes.
Sec. 13-13   Failure or refusal to pay personal property tax
   If any person, firm, or corporation shall neglect or refuse to pay any
personal property tax assessed to him or them as required by state law, the
treasurer shall collect the same by seizing the personal property of such
person, firm, or corporation in an amount sufficient to pay such tax, fees, and
charges for subsequent sale whenever the same may be found in the State.
   No property shall be exempt from such seizures. The treasurer may sell the
property seized to an amount sufficient to pay the taxes and all charges in
accordance with statutory provisions. The treasurer may, if otherwise unable to
collect a tax on personal property, sue, in accordance with statute, the
person, firm, or corporation to whom it is assessed.
Sec. 13-14   Delinquent tax roll to County treasurer
   If the treasurer has been unable to collect any of the city taxes on the
City Tax Roll on real property before the first day of March following the date
when the roll was received by him, it shall be his duty to return all such
unpaid taxes on real property to the county treasurer, in the same manner and
with like effect as returns by township treasurers of townships, school and
county taxes. Such returns shall be made upon a delinquent tax roll to be
prepared by the treasurer and shall include all the additional charges and fees
herein before provided; which charges shall, in such return, be added to the
amount assessed in the tax roll against each description. The taxes thus
returned shall be collected in the same manner as other taxes returned to the
county treasurer under the provisions of the general laws of the State and
shall be and remain a lien upon the lands against which they are assessed,
until paid.
Sec. 13-15   Protection of city lien
   The City shall have power, insofar as the exercise thereof shall not
conflict with or contravene the provisions of any general law of the State, to
acquire by purchase any premises within the City at any tax or other public
sale of by direct purchases from the State of Michigan or the fee owner when
such purchase is necessary to protect the lien of the City for taxes, or
special assessments, or both, on said premises. The City may hold, lease, or
sell the same solely for the purpose of securing therefrom the amount of such
taxes, or special assessments, or both, together with any incidental expenses
incurred in connection with the exercise of this power. Any such procedure
exercised by the City in the protection of its tax lien shall be deemed to be
for a public purpose.
Sec. 13-16   Additional rights, duties, powers, immunities and procedures
   Except as otherwise provided by this charter or ordinance, the rights,
duties, powers, immunities, and procedures established by state general law
shall apply in the collection and enforcement of city property taxes.
Sec. 13-17   Budget procedure
   By the first of March each calendar year, the city council shall adopt a
budget calendar that establishes deadlines for the preparation, review, and
adoption phases for the ensuing fiscal year general, special revenue,
enterprise, internal service, and debt service fund budgets.
   As part of that resolution, the city council shall also adopt guidelines
that the city manager shall follow in preparing the budget. At the time of this
charter, the guidelines recommended by the Government Finance Officers
Association are suggested.
   As part of the budget adoption phase, the city council shall set all service
fees for the ensuing fiscal year and adopt a five-year capital improvement
plan, both of which may be amended during the fiscal year, provided that no
action is taken until the city council by resolution gives notice of intention
to make such changes at least six days before considering such changes.
   All budgets shall be adopted by the city council no later than the second
day of June each year in accordance with this charter and state law. No deficit
budget shall be approved. All systems of accounting used by the City shall
conform to the uniform system of accounts as required by law.
Contracts
Sec. 13-18   Purchasing and contractual procedure
   (a)   The City must provide, by ordinance based upon a national standard,
for a purchasing procedure to be followed in purchasing city supplies,
materials, equipment, contractual services, or other personal property. Before
making any purchase or contract to purchase, competitive bids or proposals must
be obtained, except when the purchasing official for the city is exempted from
the bidding requirements by the purchasing ordinance because of value or when
the city council determines that no advantage to the City would result from
competitive bidding or a request for proposal.
   (b)   Purchases must be made from the lowest responsible bidder or party
making a proposal which meets specifications, unless the city council
determines that the public interest would be better served by accepting a
higher bid or proposal or by rejection of all submitted bids or proposals. At
any time that the bid of the lowest responsible bidder is not accepted, the
city council must specify the reason in its resolution concerning the purchase.
   (c)   The City must provide in the ordinance the definition of “lowest
responsible bidder,” the dollar limit within which the purchasing official may
make purchases without the necessity of obtaining competitive bids, and the
dollar limit within which purchases may be made without city council approval.
   (d)   The purchasing official must provide the city council with all
certifications required by law prior to city council action on any contract.
The city manager must, before the final payment for any work for which a bond
has been furnished, report to the city council whether the work has, in the
city manager’s judgment, been done in all respects in accordance with the
specifications. The report does not waive any rights the City may have to
pursue any action for non-compliance.
   (e)   No contract shall be split into multiple contracts in order to avoid
any provisions of the bid procedure.
   (f)   All contracts require the signature of the mayor, city manager, and
city clerk.
   (g)   When it becomes necessary or prudent during any work or improvement
project done under contract to make substantial alterations or modifications in
the contract which exceed an amount set by resolution of the city council, the
alterations or modifications must be made only upon resolution of the city
council. The city council must by resolution determine what is “substantial”
and may do so as a general policy or on a contract-by-contract basis. No order
may be effective until the price to be paid for the material, or work, or both,
under the altered or modified contract has been agreed upon in writing and
signed by the contractor and the city clerk, upon authority of the city
council, and a copy of the modification documents are filed in the office of
the city clerk.
Sec. 13-19   Contracts, purchases, expenditures; regulations, restrictions
   Except as otherwise herein provided, the council by resolution shall have
full power to make and authorize contracts on behalf of the City with due
consideration of short- and long-term cost projections. The city manager shall
act as purchasing official, by whom all purchases of supplies for the City
shall be made, and who shall approve all vouchers for the payment of the same.
All such purchases and sales shall conform to such rules and regulations as the
council may from time to time prescribe.
Sec. 13-20   Authority to expend funds
   No city officer, department head, or board member shall have the authority
to expend funds of the City which should be turned into the city treasury, or
to obligate the City of Hamtramck in any way beyond the amount permitted by
this charter or authorized by the city council.
   The city council shall have no power to authorize any contract on behalf of
the City for the expenditure of money in excess of the budget allowance or to
make or to authorize to make any purchase of materials or supplies of the value
exceeding the budget allowance.
Sec. 13-21   Contracts, expenditures; budget provision required
   No liability shall be incurred by any officer or employee of the city except
in accordance with the provisions of the budget, and all contracts not in
accordance with such provisions shall be void.
Sec. 13-22   Contracts, expenditures; controller, approval prerequisite
   Before any order or contract for improvement, service, supplies, etc., is
issued by the city, council, or any board, officer, or employee, it shall be
presented to the city controller for his approval. The controller shall examine
such order or contract and shall not approve it unless he finds that an
appropriation has been made which has not been exhausted, and that the order or
contract has been otherwise legally authorized and approved. All orders and
contracts which have not been approved by the controller shall be void.

Sec. 14-01   General borrowing
   Subject to the applicable provisions of state law and this charter, the

may be solely an obligation of the special assessment district or districts or
a general obligation of the City. All collections on each special assessment

payment of the principle and interest of the bonds issued in anticipation of
payment of such special assessment and shall be used for no other purpose.
Sec. 14-03   Other bonds
   The City shall have power to issue revenue or other types of bonds in the
manner and for the purpose permitted by the constitution and general laws of
the State of Michigan.
Sec. 14-04   Preparation and record
   Each bond and other evidence of indebtedness shall contain on its face a
statement specifying the purpose for which the same is issued, and it shall be
unlawful for any officer of the city to use the proceeds for any other purpose,
and any officer who shall violate this provision shall be deemed guilty of
misconduct in office. All bonds and other evidence of indebtedness issued by
the City shall be signed by the mayor and countersigned by the clerk under the
seal of the city. Interest coupons may be executed with a facsimile signatures
of the mayor and clerk. A complete and detailed record of all bonds and other
evidence of indebtedness issued by the City shall be kept by the controller.
Upon payment of any bond or other evidence of indebtedness, the same shall be
marked “Cancelled.”
Sec. 14-05   Limitations of indebtedness
   The City may not incur indebtedness by the issuance of bonds or otherwise,
which exceeds the greater of the following:
   (a)   Ten percent (10%) of the assessed value of all real and personal
property in the City;
   (b)   Fifteen percent (15%) of the assessed value of real and personal
property in the City, if that portion of the total amount of indebtedness
incurred exceeds ten percent (10%), is being, or has been used solely for the
construction and renovation of hospital facilities. However, in the case of
fire, flood, or other calamity, the council may borrow for the relief of the
inhabitants of the city and for the preservation of municipal property, the sum
not to exceed three-eighths of one percent (.00375) of the assessed value of
all real and personal property in the City, due in not more than five years,
even if the loan would cause the indebtedness of the City to exceed the limits
established by this section. The indebtedness identified by state statute as
excluded from calculations or limitations set forth herein and shall not be
included for purposes of determining the maximum indebtedness under this
provision.
Chapter 15 - Improvements and Assessments
Sec. 15-01   General power relative to special assessments
   The city council shall, after public hearing, have power to determine and
declare by resolution that the whole or any part of the expense of public
improvement, repair, or abatement of nuisance shall be defrayed by special
assessments upon the property specifically benefited.
   (a)   Those roads, maintained by the City, which have been designated as
Basic Arterial Inter-County Roads shall be improved without specially assessing
any costs thereof to the residential property adjacent thereto.
   (b)   Those paved roads which have been accepted and are maintained by the
city, and have been reported to and approved by the Michigan Department of
State Highways and Transportation for the purposes of Act 51 of the Public Acts

repaired and improved without specially assessing any costs thereof to the
residential property adjacent thereto.
Sec. 15-02   Lien for special assessments.
   From the date of confirmation of any roll levying any special assessment,
the City shall possess a lien on the premises subject thereto for the full

whom assessed until paid and, in case of delinquency, may be enforced as
delinquent city property taxes or by a suit against such person.
Sec. 15-03   Contested assessments.

enjoining the collection of any special assessment, unless (a) a protest is
filed at the hearing held to confirm the special assessment roll; and unless

confirmation of the roll. If the city attorney submits a written opinion
finding said roll illegal, in whole or in part, the city council shall revoke
its confirmation, correct the illegality, if possible, and reconfirm the same.
Property which is not involved in the illegality shall not be assessed more
than was imposed upon the original confirmation without further notice and
hearing thereon.
Chapter 16 - Streets, Parks, Trees, and Sidewalks
Sec. 16-01   Public ways; supervision and control
   The council, except as otherwise in this charter provided, shall have
supervision and control of all public highways, bridges, streets, avenues,

resolution shall appoint a time not less than four weeks thereafter when they
will meet and hear objections thereto; notice of such meeting, with a copy of
the resolution, shall be given in such manner as shall be prescribed by
ordinance or resolution. Objections to such proposed action of the council may
be filed with the city clerk in writing and if any such shall be filed, the
street, alley, or public ground, or any part thereof, shall not be vacated,
discontinued, or abolished, or the name changed, except by a vote of five-
sevenths (5/7) of the council- and mayor-elect.
Sec. 16-03   Parks; vacation
   When the City shall deem it advisable to vacate, discontinue, or abolish any

   The expense of constructing and maintaining bridges and the whole or such

working, including grading and graveling upon the streets, alleys, and
highways, may be paid from the general city funds, to be raised by tax upon all
the property in the City. The expense of grading, paving, or graveling or
otherwise improving any street, alley, or highway, may be defrayed by a special
assessment upon the lots and premises abutting upon such improvement, or a part
of such expense may be so paid and the remainder may be paid from the general
city funds as the council may decide. The lots and premises abutting upon a
street, alley, or highway improvement shall constitute a special assessment
district. The term “paving” shall include curbing and the construction of

be made upon the abutting lots and premises according to the number of feet
frontage upon the improvement, and all assessments for alley improvements shall
be made upon abutting lots and premises according to the benefits received by
such lots and premises. When such assessment is to be made upon lots in
proportion to their frontage upon the improvement, if from the shape or size of
any lot an assessment thereon in proportion to the frontage would be unjust and
disproportionate to the assessment upon other lots, the assessor making the
assessments may assess such lot for such number of feet frontage as in his
opinion will be just.
Sec. 16-05   Special assessment districts; city; expense, apportionment
   When expenses for any such improvement shall be assessed in a special
assessment district, and there shall be lands belonging to the City or school
district fronting upon such improvement, such part of the expense of such
improvement as in the opinion of the assessor making the special assessment
would be justly apportionable to such City or school district property, and to
any interior squares or spaces formed by the intersection of streets, were they
assessable, shall be paid from the general city funds, and the balance of such
expense shall be assessed upon the remaining lots and premises included in the
special assessment district.
Sec. 16-06   Public ways; encumbrances, obstructions; prohibitions, remedy
   The council shall have power to prohibit and prevent obstructions and

street or alley; and to require all such persons to remove every such
obstruction, encumbrance, or encroachment.
Sec. 16-07   Trees; regulations authorized
   The council may provide for and regulate the planting of shade and
ornamental trees in public highways, streets, and avenues of the city, and for

officers, to build, maintain, and keep in repair sidewalks and crosswalks in
the public streets and alleys and to charge the expense of constructing and
maintaining such sidewalks upon the lots and premises adjacent to and abutting

owners and occupants of lots and premises to build, rebuild, and maintain
sidewalks in the public streets adjacent to and abutting upon such lots and
premises and to keep them in repair at all times, and to construct and lay the
same upon such lines and grades and of such width, materials, and manner of
construction, and within such time as the council shall by ordinance or
resolution prescribe the expense thereof to be paid by such owner or occupant;
or the council may, by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of all the council-elect, pay
such part of the expense of building or rebuilding, maintaining and keeping in
repair such walks as they deem proper from the general city funds.
Sec. 16-09   Sidewalks; snow, ice, encumbrances; council authority
   The council shall also have power either by ordinance or resolution to cause
and require the owners and occupants of any lot or premises to remove all snow
and ice from the sidewalks in front of or adjacent to such lot and premises,
and to keep the same free from obstructions, encroachments, encumbrances,
filth, and other nuisances; provided, that the council may provide by ordinance
for the removing of all ice or snow therefrom, and for keeping the same free
from encumbrances and pay the expense thereof from the general city funds.
Sec. 16-10   Compliance with orders required; violations, remedy; procedure
   If the owner or occupant of any lot or premises shall fail to construct or
maintain any particular sidewalk as mentioned and prescribed in section above,
or shall fail to keep the same in repair, or to remove the snow, ice, and filth
therefrom, or to remove and keep the same free from obstructions,
encroachments, encumbrances, or other nuisances, or shall fail to perform any
other duty required by the council in respect to such sidewalks within such
time and such manner as the council shall require, the council may cause the
same to be done, at the expense of such owner or occupant, and the council may
cause the amount of all expenses incurred thereby to be reported to the city
treasurer, who shall cause a notice of such assessment to be mailed to the
owners of the premises if known.
   If the amount of the assessment is not paid to the treasurer within a period
of sixty (60) days from the date of mailing such notice, the treasurer shall
report the same to the council, and the council shall report the same to the
city assessor, to be by him levied, together with a penalty of ten percent in
addition thereto, as a special assessment upon the lot or premises adjacent to
or abutting upon such sidewalk, which special assessment shall be subject to
review after proper notice has been given as in all other cases of special
assessment provided for in this charter; and such assessment when confirmed
shall be a lien upon such lot or premises the same as other special assessments
and all proceedings subsequent to confirmation, provided for in this chapter,
in relation to special assessments shall apply; or the City may collect such
amount, together with the penalty from the owner or occupant of the premises,
together with costs of suit.
Sec. 16-11   Signs, awnings, etc.; regulations, prohibitions authorized
   The council shall have power to regulate and prohibit the placing of signs,
awnings, awning posts, and other things upon or over sidewalks, and to

servant of a particular duty, or treat that person differently than other
similarly situated city residents.

§ 52.005 DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
   (A)   General pollutant prohibitions. No user shall discharge or cause to be
discharged into the POTW, directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater
which will cause interference or pass through. These general discharge
prohibitions shall apply to all users of the POTW whether or not the user is
subject to national categorical pretreatment standards or to any other federal,
state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. In addition, it shall
be unlawful for a user to discharge into the POTW:
      (1)   Any liquid, solid or gas, which by reason of its nature or
quantity, is sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to
create a fire or explosion hazard or to be injurious in any other way to
persons, to the POTW, or to the operations of the POTW. Pollutants, which
create a fire or explosion hazard in a POTW, include, but are not limited to,
wastestreams with a closed cup flash point of less than 140° F. or 60° C. using
the test methods specified in 40 C.F.R. § 261.21;

to cause interference, or pass through, or constitute a hazard to humans or
animals;
      (5)   Any liquid, gas, solid or form of energy, which either singly or by
interaction with other waste is sufficient to create toxic gas, vapor, or fume
within the POTW in quantities that may cause acute worker health and safety
problems, or may cause a public nuisance or hazard to life, or are sufficient
to prevent entry into the sewers for their maintenance and repair;
      (6)   Any substance which is sufficient to cause the POTW’s effluent or
any other product of the POTW, such as residue, sludge, or scum to be
unsuitable for reclamation processing where the POTW is pursuing a reuse and
reclamation program. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause
the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria guidelines
or regulations developed under 33 U.S.C. § 1345, with any criteria, guidelines,
or developed and promulgated regulations affecting sludge use or disposal
developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Federal Clean Air Act,

the sludge management method being used;
      (7)   Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate either the
consent judgment in U.S. EPA v. City of Detroit et al, Federal District Court
for the Eastern District of Michigan Case No. 77-1100, or the City of Detroit’s
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit;
      (8)   Any discharge having a color uncharacteristic of the wastewater
being discharged;
      (9)   Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological
activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case
wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into a public sewer which
exceeds 150° F. or which will cause the influent at the wastewater treatment
plant to rise above 104° F. (40° C.);
      (10)   Any pollutant discharge which constitutes a slug;
      (11)   Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of
such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established in compliance
with applicable federal or state regulations;
      (12)   Any floating fats, oil or grease which are sufficient to cause
interference with or pass through the POTW; or
      (13)   Any solid materials having a specific gravity greater than 1.2 or
a cross section dimension of one-half inch or greater which are sufficient to
cause interference with the POTW.

                         Appendix B
All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating period
representative of an industrial user’s discharge, and in accordance with 40
C.F.R. Part 136
 
         (a)   The limitation for Total PCB is non-detect. Total PCB shall not
be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 608, and the
quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 ugm/l, unless a higher level is
appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one or
more samples indicate detectable levels of Total PCB, the user shall be
required to demonstrate compliance. For purposes of this section, this
demonstration may be made using analytical data showing that the Total PCB
concentration is below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in
accordance with 56-3-66.1(d).
         (b)   The limitation of Mercury (Hg) is non-detect. Mercury (Hg) shall
not be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 245.1, and
the quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 ugm/l, unless a higher level is
appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one or
more samples indicate detectable levels of Mercury, the user shall be required
to demonstrate compliance. For the purposes of this section, this demonstration
may be made using analytical data showing that the mercury concentration is
below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in accordance with 56-3-66.1
(d). All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating period
representative of an industrial user's discharge, and in accordance 40 C.F.R.
Part 136.
      (3)   Compliance period. Within 30 days of the effective date of this
chapter, the Department shall notify all industrial users operating under an
effective wastewater discharge permit of the requirement to submit a compliance
report within 180 days after the effective date of this chapter. The compliance
report shall demonstrate the user’s compliance or non-compliance with these
limitations, and, in the event of non-compliance, include the submission of a
plan and schedule for achieving compliance with the stated limitation. In no
event shall a compliance schedule exceed 18 months from the effective date of
this chapter. An industrial user who does not demonstrate compliance may
petition the Department for a second extension as part of an administrative
consent order. The Department shall include appropriate monitoring, reporting,
and penalties into an administrative consent order that relates to a second
extension, and shall enter into such an agreement only upon a good-faith
showing by the industrial user of the actions taken to achieve compliance with
this provision.
   (C)   National categorical pretreatment standards. All users shall comply
with the applicable national categorical pretreatment standards and
requirements promulgated pursuant to the act as set forth in 40 C.F.R.
Subchapter N, effluent guidelines and standards, which are hereby incorporated
by reference and with all other applicable standards and requirements,
provided, that where a more stringent standard or requirement is applicable
pursuant to state law or regulation, or to this chapter, then the more
stringent standard or requirement shall be controlling. Affected dischargers
shall comply with applicable reporting requirements under 40 C.F.R. Part 403
and as established by the Department. The national categorical pretreatment
standards which have been promulgated as of the effective date of this section
are delineated in Appendix A.
      (1)   Intake water adjustment. Industrial users seeking adjustment of
national categorical pretreatment standards to reflect the presence of
pollutants in their intake water must comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R.
§ 403.15. Upon notification of approval by the Department, the adjustment shall
be applied by modifying the permit accordingly. Intake water adjustments are
not effective until incorporated into an industrial user’s permit.
      (2)   Modification of national categorical pretreatment standards. The
Department may apply to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or to the
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, whichever is appropriate, for
authorization to grant removal credits in accordance with the requirements and
procedures in 40 C.F.R. § 403.7. The authorization may be granted only when the
POTW treatment plant can achieve consistent removal for each pollutant for
which a removal credit is being sought, provided, that any limitation of such
pollutant(s) in the NPDES permit neither are being exceeded nor pose the
prospect of being exceeded as a result of the removal credit being granted.
Where such authorization is given to the Department, any industrial user
desiring to obtain such credit shall make an application to the Department,
consistent with the provisions of 40 C.F.R. § 403.7 and of this chapter. Any
credits which may be granted under this section may be subject to modification
or revocation as specified in 40 C.F.R. § 403.7, or as determined by the
Department. A requisite to the granting of any removal credit may be that the
industrial user pay a surcharge based upon the amounts of such pollutants
removed by the POTW, such surcharge being based upon fees or rates which the
Board may establish and, when appropriate, revise from time to time. Permits
shall reflect, or be modified to reflect, any credit granted pursuant to this
section.
      (3)   New sources. Industrial users who meet the new sources criteria
shall install, maintain in operating condition, and start-up all pollution
control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before
beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time and not to exceed 90
days, new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards.
      (4)   Concentration and mass limits. When limits in a categorical
pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit
of production, the Department may convert the limits to equivalent limitations
expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent
concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to
individual industrial users. Equivalent limitations shall be calculated in
accordance with 40 C.F.R. 403.6(c)(3) and/or 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c)(4) and shall
be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of 33 U.S.C. § 317(d) and of
this chapter. Industrial users will be required to comply with the equivalent
limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the
equivalent limitations were derived.
      (5)   Reporting requirements for industrial users upon effective date of
categorical pretreatment standards-baseline report. Within 180 days after the
effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the
final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission
under 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users
subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging
into or scheduled to discharge into the Detroit POTW shall submit to the
Department a report containing the information listed in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)
(1-7). Where reports containing this information have already been submitted to
the Director or regional administrator in compliance with the requirement of 40
C.F.R. § 128.140(b), the industrial user will not be required to resubmit this
information. At least 90 days before commencement of any discharge, each new
source and any existing sources that become industrial users after the
promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall submit to
the Department a report which contains the information listed in 40 C.F.R. §
403.12(b)(1-5). In such report, new sources shall include information
concerning the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet
applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall provide estimates of the
information requested in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)(4) and (5).
   (D)   Dilution prohibited. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an
applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no user shall increase the use
of process water, or in any way dilute or attempt to dilute a discharge as a
partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance
with the limitations contained in the national categorical pretreatment
standards, or in any other pollutant specific limitation or requirement imposed
by the city, the City of Detroit or by the state.
   (E)   Hauled in wastewater. Any waste material or wastewater which is hauled
into or within the service region for discharge to the POTW is subject to the
requirements of this chapter including, but not limited to, permits,
inspection, monitoring and enforcement. Unloading liquid or solid waste from
hauling vehicles, directly or indirectly, into the POTW, with or without the
benefit of pretreatment, is prohibited unless the person proposing to unload
such waste has applied for and received a permit from the Department for
unloading such waste in accordance with the Board’s rules pertaining thereto.
The discharger shall be subject to applicable terms and conditions, surcharges,
fees or rates as established by the Board. Hauled in wastewater shall only be
discharged at points designated by the POTW after authorization or approval
issued pursuant to the general permit requirements specified in §
52.007. The Department may establish specific limitations for sludge from
municipally owned or operated POTW treatment plants which are different than
the specific limitations in this chapter.
   (F)   Centralized waste treatment.
      (1)   It is unlawful for a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility to
discharge any industrial waste or wastewater into the POTW without a wastewater
discharge permit from the Department. Any authorization granted, or permit
issued, by the Department to a Centralized Waste Treatment (CWT) facility shall
specify the type of wastewater for which treatment is provided, and discharge
approval is sought, from the POTW. Unless such industrial waste or wastewater
is determined by the Department to require further authorization, a centralized
waste treatment (CWT) facility that has submitted an application to, and
received previous approval from, the Department to discharge wastewater is not
required to obtain further authorization from the Department before discharging
such wastewater. An industrial user, that provides centralized waste treatment
services and files an application for the treatment and discharge of such types
of wastewater to the POTW, shall provide the following minimum information in
support thereof:
         (a)   The general nature, source and process(es) generating the type
of wastewater. Any wastewater, which is generated from those processes and is
subject to national categorical pretreatment standards as delineated in
Appendix A, shall be so designated;
         (b)   The identity of the toxic pollutants known or suspected to be
present in the wastewater;
         (c)   At least one sample report showing the results of an analysis
for the EPA priority pollutants for each type of wastewater for which
application is made in division (F)(1) (a) of this section;
         (d)   A statement, that is certified by a professional engineer, which
addresses the treatability and compatibility of the wastewater, received or
collected by the facility’s treatment process(es);
         (e)   The identity of the materials and/or pollutants whose transport
or treatment are regulated by the EPA, by the state, or by any other
governmental agency. Upon request, the Centralized Waste Treatment (CWT)
facility shall provide a copy of its permit and/or license to the Department;
and
         (f)   Other information requested by the Department including, but not
limited to, information required by §
52.007(C)(1) through (18) or by rules adopted by the Board.
      (2)   The discharge from a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility
will be deemed approved for those specific types of wastewater delineated in a
permit and, upon issuance of such permit in accordance with the procedures
contained in §
52.007, will be deemed approved for discharge into the POTW. The Centralized
Waste Treatment (CWT) facility shall comply with all applicable provisions
contained in §
52.007 regarding permits. In furtherance of its obligations as control
authority, the Department may include in the permit a requirement to report at
selected intervals the information mandated in subsections (1)(a) through (f)
of this section.
      (3)   All users granted a permit under this section shall maintain
records which, at a minimum, identify the source, volume, character, and
constituents of the wastewater accepted for treatment and disposal. These
records may be reviewed at any time by the Department.
   (G)   Groundwater discharges. Unless authorization has been granted by the
Department, the discharge of any groundwater into the POTW is prohibited.
      (1)   The Department may authorize the discharge of groundwater resulting
from maintenance and related activities of gas, steam, or electrical utilities
through the use of general permits. Subject to appropriate reporting
requirements, the general permit shall authorize discharge in accordance with
the terms of the permit. Utilities shall comply with this provision within 180
days after its enactment.
      (2)   If a person, who proposes to discharge groundwater resulting from
purge, response activity, or UST projects, has applied for and received a
permit from the Department, the Department may authorize the discharge of such
wastewater. Permits shall be issued in accordance with the procedures contained
in §
52.007 or in accordance with any rules adopted by the Board.
   (H)   Right of revision. The City of Detroit and the city reserve the right
to establish rules or regulations adopted by the Board, additional or more
stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW. These rules
and regulations shall be adopted in accordance with the rule-making procedures
Section 2-111 of the 1997 Detroit City Charter and the 2005 Hamtramck City
Charter, if any. Ninety days after adoption by the Board, industrial users
shall comply with such rules and regulations.
   (I)   Accidental discharges.
      (1)   (a)   Each industrial user, which does not currently have an
approved spill prevention plan or slug control plan, shall provide protection
from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated
by this chapter, and all significant industrial users shall submit to the
Department detailed plans which show facilities and operating procedures to be
implemented to provide protection against such accidental discharges.
Facilities and measures to prevent and abate accidental discharges shall be
implemented, provided, and maintained at the owner’s or industrial user’s cost
or expense. Unless the significant industrial user has an approved spill
prevention or slug control plan, all existing significant industrial users
shall complete and submit such a plan within 60 days of the effective date of
this chapter. New significant industrial users shall submit such a plan prior
to the time they commence discharging.
         (b)   For purposes of this section, the information provided shall
include the approximate average and maximum quantities of such prohibited
materials or substances kept on the premises in the form of raw materials,
chemicals and/or waste therefrom and the containment capacity for each. Only
substances that are in a form which could readily be carried into the POTW and
constitute a concentration of 5% or greater in the raw material, chemical
solution or waste material, are required to be reported. Volumes of less than
55 gallons, or the equivalent thereof, need not be reported unless lesser
quantities could cause pass through or cause interference with the POTW.
         (c)   The industrial user shall promptly notify the Department of any
significant changes or modifications to the plan including, but not limited to,
a change in the contact person, or substance inventory.
      (2)   At least once every two years, the Department shall evaluate
whether a significant industrial user needs a plan to control slug discharges,
as defined by 40 C.F.R. § 403.8(f)(2)(v). Unless otherwise provided, all
significant users shall complete, implement, and submit such a plan within 30
days of notification by the Department.
   (J)   Notification requirements. Unless a different notice is provided by
this chapter or applicable law, within one hour of becoming aware of a
discharge into the POTW which exceeds or does not conform with federal, state
or city laws, rules, regulations or permit requirements, or which could cause
problems to the POTW, or which has the potential to cause the industrial user
to implement its plan prepared in accordance with division (I)(1) of this
section, the industrial user shall telephone the Department at its control
center and notify the Department of the discharge. The notification shall
include the name of the caller, the location and time of discharge, the type of
wastewater, the estimated concentration of excessive or prohibited pollutants
and estimated volume, and the measures taken, or being taken, to abate the
discharge into the POTW. Within five calendar days after the discharge, the
industrial user shall submit a detailed written report describing the cause of
the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences and when required by the Department, the industrial user’s
wastewater discharge permit may be modified to include additional measures to
prevent such future occurrences. The notification shall not relieve the
industrial user of any expense, cost of treatment, loss, damages or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills,
or any other environmental impairment or any other damage to person or
property.
   (K)   Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
industrial user’s bulletin board, or other prominent place, advising employees
whom to contact in the Department in the event of an actual or excessive or
prohibited discharge.
   (L)   Recovery of costs. Any user discharging in violation of any of the
provisions of this chapter, which produces a deposit or obstruction, or causes
damage to or impairs the Department’s POTW, or causes the Department to violate
its NPDES permit, shall be liable to the Department for any expense, loss,
damage, penalty or fine incurred by the Department because of said violation or
discharge. Prior to assessing such costs, the Department shall notify the user
of its determination that the user’s discharge was the proximate cause of such
damage, obstruction, impairment, or violation of the city’s NPDES permit and
the Department’s intent to assess such costs to the user. Any notice shall
include written documentation which substantiates the determination of
proximate cause and a breakdown of cost estimates. Failure to pay the assessed
costs shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The charge shall be in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any penalties or remedies provided under this
chapter, or this code, or other statutes and regulations, or at law or in
equity.
   (M)   Hazardous waste notification. All industrial users, who discharge into
the city collection system, shall notify the Department in writing of any
discharge of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous
waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261. The notification must comply with the
requirements of 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(p).
   (N)   Authorized representative. The authorized representative, as defined
in §
52.004(A)(2), may designate a duly authorized representative of the individual
designated in §
52.004(A)(2)(a) or (b) where:
      (1)   The authorization is made in writing by the individual defined in §
52.004;
      (2)   The authorization specifies either an individual or a position
having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility where the
industrial discharge originates, such as the position of plant manager,
operator of a well or well field superintendent, or a position of equivalent
responsibility, or having overall responsibility for environmental matters for
the company; and
      (3)   The written authorization is submitted to the Department.
   (O)   Pollution prevention. The Department shall encourage and support
industrial users to develop and implement pollution prevention programs that
are designed to eliminate or reduce pollutant contributions beyond the levels
required by this chapter. The Department may require an industrial user to
implement pollution prevention initiatives or BMP, as part of an enforcement
response, or as necessary to comply with its NPDES permit.

used for reporting purposes after the initial information has been furnished to
the Department, provided there have been no changes to the elements composing
the combined wastestream.
         (d)   1.   Reports shall contain the results of representative
sampling performed during the period covered by the report and of the discharge
and analysis of pollutants contained therein, and, for significant industrial
users subject to production based standards, shall be cross-referenced to the
related flow or production and mass as required determining compliance with the
applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be as
prescribed in the applicable general pretreatment regulations, being 40 C.F.R.
Part 403, or by the Department, but no less than is necessary to assess and
assure compliance by the industrial user with the most stringent applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. All sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with applicable regulations contained in 40 C.F.R. Part
136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 C.F.R. Part 136 does not include sampling
or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, sampling and analysis
shall be performed using validated analytical methods approved by the
administrator.
            2.   If an industrial user monitors any pollutant more frequently
than required by the Department using the procedures as prescribed in this
section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in such report. The
report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards are being met
on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance
practices and/or pretreatment system improvements or changes are necessary to
bring the industrial user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment
standards.
         (e)   1.   This report, and those required under §
52.005(C)(5) and
52.007(E)(8)(b) and (c), shall include the following certification statement:
      “I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction, or supervision, in accordance with a system
designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the
information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage
the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of a fine
and/or imprisonment for knowing violations.”
            2.   The certification shall be signed by the facility’s authorized
representative, as defined in §
52.004(A)(2). If an authorization is no longer accurate because a different
individual or position has responsibility for the overall operation of the
facility, or overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company,
a new authorization satisfying the requirements of the authorized
representative definition must be submitted to the Department prior to, or
together with, any reports to be signed by an authorized representative.
         (f)   If sampling performed by a permittee indicates a violation, the
user shall notify the Department within 24 hours of the time the user becomes,
or should have become, aware of the violation. In addition, the user shall
repeat the sampling and analysis, and submit the results of the repeat analysis
to the Department within 30 days after the user becomes, or should have become,
aware of the violation.
      (9)   In the event the Director determines that an industrial user is
discharging substances in quality, quantity or at locations which may cause
problems to the POTW, or the receiving stream, the Department has the authority
to develop and enforce effluent limits applicable to the user. To the extent
the Department seeks to impose restrictions in a permit which are more
restrictive than established in this division, the Department shall provide
written documentation to explain the greater restriction for protection against
pass through, interference, or violation of the NPDES permit;
      (10)   Requirement for pollution prevention initiatives; and
      (11)   Other requirements reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with
this chapter.
   (F)   Permit duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time period.
Except as deemed necessary by the Department, or as otherwise provided for
under this chapter, permits shall be issued for a specified period of not more
than five years nor less than one year. The existing permit for significant
industrial users, who timely submit an application for permit reissuance to the
Department, shall be automatically extended until a permit is issued as final.
   (G)   Permit modification.
      (1)   The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to
modification by the Department during the term of the permit as limitations or
pretreatment standards and requirements identified in §
52.005 are amended, or other just cause exists. Just cause for a permit
modification includes, but shall not be limited to, the following:
         (a)   Material or substantial changes to an industrial user’s facility
or operation, or changes in the characteristics of the industrial user’s
effluent. It shall be the industrial user’s duty to request an application form
and apply for a modification of the permit within 30 calendar days of the
change;
         (b)   Change(s) in the Department's NPDES permit;
         (c)   Embodiment of the provisions of a legal settlement or of a court
order;

control authority;
         (e)   An industrial user’s noncompliance with portions of an existing
permit;
         (f)   A change of conditions within the POTW;
         (g)   A finding of interference or pass through attributable to the
industrial user;
         (h)   Amendments to, or promulgation of, national categorical
pretreatment standards or requirements including 40 C.F.R. Part 403 and those
delineated in
Appendix A of this chapter. Permittees shall request an application form and
apply to the Department for a modified permit within 90 days after the
promulgation of a new or revised national categorical pretreatment standard to
which the industrial user shall be subject. Information submitted pursuant to
this subsection shall be confined to that information related to the newly
promulgated or amended national categorical pretreatment standard or
requirement. However, information previously submitted need not be duplicated,
insofar as the previously submitted information continues to be current and
applicable. In addition, the Department may initiate this action;
         (i)   Changes in the monitoring location (see §
52.008);
         (j)   Typographical errors or omissions in permits;
         (k)   The Department may modify the permit on its own initiative based
on its findings or reasonable belief of the above; or
         (l)   The user may request a modification of the permit.
      (2)   When initiated by the Department, the industrial user shall be
informed of any proposed change in its permit. The Department will issue a
draft permit and an industrial user has 30 days to file a response to the draft
modified permit. Thereafter, the Department will issue a final permit and,
unless appealed in accordance with the procedures contained in §
52.013, the permit will become effective 20 days after issuance.
   (H)   Permit custody and transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued
to a specific person as defined herein for a specific discharge. A wastewater
discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a different
person, new owner, new industrial user, different premises, or a new or changed
operation without notice to and written approval of the Department, and
providing a copy of the existing permit to the new owner or operator. It shall
be the permit holder’s duty to notify the Department of any such change at
least 30 days before the date of the change. Wastewater discharge permits,
which do not receive the written approval of the Department prior to the
change, shall be null and void regardless of reassignment, or transfer, or
sale. If it has occurred, the Department may revoke a permit. If a change takes
place, the Department may require the application for a new or modified permit.
Any succeeding person shall comply with the terms and conditions of any
existing permit which the Department allows to be retained.
   (I)   Permit notification requirements. All industrial users shall promptly
notify the Department in advance of any substantial change in the volume or
character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or
characteristic hazardous waste for which initial notification under 40 C.F.R. §
403.12(p) has been made, request a permit application form, and apply for a
modification of the permit at least 30 calendar days prior to the change.
Failure of the industrial user to so apply shall be considered a violation of
this chapter.

monitoring, inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of their discharge by
the Department and the industrial user, and to enable the Department to conduct
such other monitoring and sampling as required for determining compliance with
discharge requirements, limits and standards as provided for in this chapter.
In the event the Department determines that the monitoring facility identified
in the permit application is inadequate, a new monitoring facility must be
identified, or provided, which shall allow for collection of a representative
sample of the wastewater discharged from the facility. Unless otherwise
determined at the discretion of the Department, the facility shall be provided
within 90 days of receipt of notification by the Department. The industrial
user shall provide the Department with:
      (1)   A drawing showing all sewer connections and sampling manholes by
the size, location, elevation, and points or places of discharges into the
POTW;
      (2)   A flow schematic showing which connections receive each national
categorical process wastestream; which connections receive storm water,
sanitary water or cooling water; and which lines handle each combined
wastestream. This report shall be certified by a professional engineer. If a
significant industrial user fails to install the monitoring facilities within
the prescribed time limits, then the Department may install such structure or
device and the significant user shall reimburse the Department for any costs
incurred therein.
   (B)   The sampling manhole should be situated on the industrial user’s
premises in a location readily accessible to the Department. When such a
location would be impractical or cause undue hardship to the industrial user,
the Department may allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or
sidewalk area when there is room and the location will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles. It shall be the responsibility of the
industrial user to obtain any necessary approvals which may be required from
other government agencies for the location and construction of monitoring
facilities. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling or monitoring
manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis. The facility and any permanently installed sampling and measuring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition at the expense of the industrial user. Whether constructed upon
public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be
provided in accordance with the Department’s requirements and all applicable
local construction standards and specifications (see §
52.007(G)).

§ 52.009 INSPECTION, SAMPLING AND RECORD-KEEPING.
   (A)   For purposes of administering and enforcing this chapter, any other
applicable provisions of this code or applicable state or federal laws and
regulations, the Department may inspect the establishment, facility or other
premises of the industrial user. The Department’s employees or authorized
representative shall have access to the industrial user’s premises for purposes
of inspection, sampling, compliance monitoring and/or metering activities.
   (B)   Each such inspection or sampling activity shall be commenced and
completed at reasonable times, and in a reasonable manner. Upon arrival at the
industrial user’s premises, the Department shall inform the industrial user, or
the industrial user’s employees, that sampling and/or inspection is commencing,
and that the facility’s authorized representative has the right to observe the
inspection and/or sampling. The Department shall neither refrain from, nor be
prevented or delayed from, carrying-out its inspection or sampling duties due
to the unavailability of the authorized representative of the facility to
observe or participate in the inspection or sampling activity.
   (C)   While performing work on private property, employees or authorized
representatives of the Department shall observe all reasonable safety, security
and other reasonable rules applicable to the premises as established by the
industrial user. Duly authorized employees or representatives of the Department
shall bear proper credentials and identification, and at the industrial user’s
option may be accompanied by a duly authorized representative of the industrial
user. Duly authorized Department representatives shall not be restricted from
viewing any of the facility site. Department employees or representatives may
take photographs of facilities subject to this chapter. Which shall be
maintained by the Department as confidential in accordance with §
52.010.
   (D)   Where an industrial user has security measures in force, the
industrial user shall make prompt and necessary arrangements with the security
personnel so that, upon presentation of appropriate credentials, personnel from
the Department will be permitted to enter for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.
   (E)   Significant industrial users shall sample and analyze their discharge
in accordance with the provisions of their permit. The Department may require
such samples to be split with the Department for the Department’s independent
analysis.
   (F)   Industrial users shall maintain records of all information from
monitoring activities required by this chapter, or by 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(n).
Industrial users shall maintain the records for no less than three years. This
period of record retention shall be extended during the course of any
unresolved litigation regarding the discharge of pollutants by the industrial
user, or the operation of the City of Detroit’s Industrial Waste Program, or
when requested by the department, by the state, or by the EPA.
   (G)   Upon the request of the Department, industrial users shall furnish
information and records relating to discharges into the POTW. Industrial users
shall make such records readily accessible to the Department at all reasonable
times, and allow the Department to copy such records.
   (H)   In the event the Department obtains samples, and analyses are made of
such samples, a copy of the results of such analyses shall be promptly
furnished upon written request by the industrial user’s authorized
representative. When requested by the industrial user, the Department employee
or representative shall leave with the user, a portion of any sample of the
user’s discharge taken from any sampling point on or adjacent to the premises
for the user’s independent analysis. In cases of disputes arising over shared
samples, the portion taken and analyzed by the Department shall be controlling
unless proven invalid.
   (I)   In addition to any other violation caused by the discharge described
herein, in the event a single grab sample of the industrial user’s discharge is
obtained by the Department, and then analyzed in accordance with 40 C.F.R. Part
136, and found to contain concentrations of pollutants which are two or more
times greater than the numeric limitations as listed in §
52.005(B), or as contained in the facility’s wastewater discharge permit, the
industrial user shall implement its slug control plan, and shall provide a
written report to the Department within 14 days, which describes the cause of
greater concentration and provides a description of the means by which future
discharge concentrations will be held to values of less than two times the
limitation in the future.
(Ord. 2009-4, passed 6-23-2009)
§ 52.010 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   (A)   (1)   Information and data on an industrial user obtained from written
reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs,
and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental
agencies without restriction unless the industrial user specifically requests
and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department that the
release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the industrial user.
      (2)   When submitted to the Department, all information claimed to be
confidential must be clearly marked confidential. When requested by the person
furnishing the report, the portions of a report determined by the Department to
disclose trade secrets or trade secret processes, and which are clearly labeled
as confidential, shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but
shall be made available upon request to governmental agencies for uses related
to this chapter, to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit, and to the State Disposal System permit and/or the pretreatment
programs, provided, however that information shall be treated as confidential
by the governmental agency, until such time as the information has been
determined to be non-confidential by the governmental agency. Confidential
information on industrial users, which the Department releases pursuant to a
request of another governmental agency, should be handled by the other
governmental agency pursuant to its own confidentiality procedures. The
Department cannot control how another governmental agency handles such
confidential information, and assumes no responsibility for the disposition of
the information released to the governmental agency. The Department will use
sufficient care to inform the other governmental agency of the existence of the
industrial user’s confidentiality claim.
      (3)   The Department shall determine whether the information requested to
be treated as confidential, in fact, satisfies the requirements of confidential
information as defined herein. The decision of the Department shall be made in
writing. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information.
   (B)   Except as otherwise determined by the Department or provided for by
applicable law, all information with respect to an industrial user on file with
the city shall be made available upon request by such user or the user’s
authorized representative during normal business hours.

      (7)   Fail to comply with any limitation, prohibition, or requirement of
this chapter including any rule, regulation, or order issued hereunder.
Industrial users acting in full compliance with wastewater discharge permits
issued prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be deemed to be in
compliance with the requirements of this chapter, and such permits shall remain
in effect and be enforceable under this chapter until a superseding permit is
effective. Industrial users shall comply with applicable national categorical
pretreatment standards and requirements on the date specified in the federal
regulations, regardless of compliance schedules.
   (B)   Upsets. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with national categorical pretreatment standards
where the requirements of subsection (1) are met.
      (1)   An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence, that:
         (a)   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause
(s) of the upset;
         (b)   At the time, the facility was being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
         (c)   The industrial user has submitted the following information to
the Department, orally or in writing, within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
upset and where this information is provided orally, a written submission must
be provided within five days:
            1.   A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (2)   In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof;
      (3)   The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to
the extent necessary to maintain compliance with this chapter upon reduction,
loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   (C)   Bypass. Bypasses are prohibited unless the bypass does not cause a
violation of pretreatment standards or requirements, but only if it is for
essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the treatment system.
These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (1) and (2).
      (1)   Notice of anticipated bypass. Industrial users anticipating a
bypass shall submit notice to the Department at least ten days in advance.
      (2)   Notice of unanticipated bypass. An industrial user shall submit
oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes or should
have become aware of the bypass. A written submission shall be provided within
five days of the time the industrial user becomes or should have become aware
of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass
including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
      (3)   Prohibition of bypass and enforcement. Bypass is prohibited, and
the Department may take enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated waste, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
         (c)   The industrial user properly notified the Department as
described in division (C)(2).
      (4)   Bypass approval. Where it meets all conditions in division (C)(3),
the Department may approve an anticipated bypass.
   (D)   Measurements. Where one or more of the measurements taken for any
pollutant defined in §
52.005(B) during a six-month period exceed by any magnitude the daily maximum
non-detect limit for the same parameter, the industrial user may develop and
implement pollution prevention initiatives, or a BMP, as part of its response.
The Department may, as part of an administrative order, also require
development of a BMP as a part of the Department’s enforcement response. Upon
approval of the Department, these pollution prevention initiative, or BMPs
shall be made an enforceable part of the wastewater discharge permit.
Industrial users shall provide, at six-month intervals, analytical results and
certifications in support of its implementation of an approved pollution
prevention initiative or BMPs. Upon demonstration of compliance, the industrial
user may request to be relieved of this implementation requirement.
   (E)   Emergency suspensions and orders. The Department may order suspension
of the sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge
permit where, in the opinion of the Department, such suspension is necessary to
stop any actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an
imminent or significant hazard to the health or welfare of persons or to the
environment, interferes or may interfere with the POTW, or causes or may cause
the City of Detroit to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. Any person
notified of a suspension of the sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or
the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. In the event the Department provides informal notification under
this section, written confirmation and an order shall be provided within 24
hours. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with any
suspension or revocation order, the Department shall take such steps as deemed
necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection or services,
to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or danger to any individual or
the environment. In the event such steps are taken, the Director shall notify
the industrial user within 24 hours in writing of such action and order, and
the specific recourse available. In any event, the Department shall provide the
industrial user with an opportunity for a hearing before the Director, or his
or her designated representative, within ten days of such action. The
industrial user shall submit a detailed written statement to the Department
within 15 days of the occurrence describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence. Upon
proof of elimination of the noncomplying discharge, the Department shall
reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or the sewer or wastewater
treatment service.
   (F)   Notice of violation. Except in the case of an actual or threatened
discharge as specified in division (E), whenever the Department has reason to
believe that any industrial user has violated or is violating this chapter, the
Department shall serve a written notice stating the nature of the violation
upon such industrial user. Where applicable, the Department shall pursue
appropriate escalating enforcement action as defined within its approved
enforcement response plan. The failure of the Department to issue a notice of
violation shall not preclude the Department from escalating its enforcement
response.
   (G)   Administrative actions. Whenever the Department has reasonable grounds
to believe that a user is violating, or has violated, a provision of its
wastewater discharge permit, or a pretreatment standard or requirement or any
prohibition of this chapter, the Department, may initiate appropriate
administrative enforcement action, except in the case of emergency or flagrant
violation, in order to compel the industrial user to eliminate or to remedy
such violation as soon as possible.
      (1)   Conferences. The Department may order any person, who violates this
chapter, to attend a conference wherein the Department may endeavor to cause
the user to eliminate or remedy the violation by establishing an enforceable
compliance schedule. The notice of violation shall be served at least ten days
before the scheduled conference and shall set forth the date, time, and place
thereof. The conference shall be conducted by a representative of the
Department. The industrial user shall present a plan and schedule for achieving
compliance with this division. Nothing contained herein shall require the
Department to accept or agree to any proposed plan or schedule, or to prevent
the Department from proceeding with a show cause hearing as set forth in
subsection (2) of this section. If the attendees agree upon a compliance
schedule, the user and the Department’s duly authorized representative may
enter, by consent, into a compliance agreement or an administrative order
setting forth the terms of such agreement. An industrial user must exhibit good
faith and expeditious efforts to comply with this chapter and any procedures,
requirements, and agreements hereunder.
      (2)   Compliance schedules. The user and the Department may agree upon a
schedule which sets forth the terms and conditions, and time periods or

violation. These schedules may be developed as part of a compliance agreement,
administrative consent order. Schedules developed under this subsection shall
adhere to the following conditions:
         (a) The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of upgraded or additional pretreatment facilities,
or to the implementation of additional operation and maintenance procedures
required for the industrial user to meet the applicable pretreatment
requirements and standards including, but not limited to, hiring an engineer,
completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contracts for
major components, commencing construction, and completing construction;
         (b)   No single increment referred to in division (I) shall exceed
nine months;
         (c)   Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and
the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress
report to the Department including, at a minimum, whether it complied with the
increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date which it
expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason(s) for delay, and
the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the established
schedule; and
         (d)   Any deviations from the compliance schedule may result in the
industrial user being found in violation of this chapter.
      (3)   Administrative orders. The Department may order any industrial
user, who violates or continues to violate this chapter or a duly issued
permit, to install and to properly operate devices, treatment facilities, or
other related appurtenances. In addition, orders may contain such other
requirements as might reasonably be necessary and appropriate to address the
violation including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional
self-monitoring and management practices, implementation of a waste
minimization assessment to identify and implement feasible source reduction,
and recycling practices to reduce the generation or release of pollutants at
the facility. An order may be either an administrative consent order, which is
the result of an agreement, or a unilateral administrative order.
      (4)   Show cause hearing. The Department may order any industrial user,
who violates this chapter or allows such violation to occur, to show cause
before the Department why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A
notice shall be served upon the industrial user specifying the time and place
of a hearing before the Department regarding the violation, the reason(s) why
the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the
industrial user to show cause before the Department why any proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be
served personally, or by registered or certified mail with return receipt
requested, at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made upon any
agent or officer of a corporation, or its authorized representative.
         (a)   Hearing proceeding. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance
with the procedures adopted by the Board. A hearings officer shall conduct the
show cause hearing and take the evidence, and may:
            1.   In the name of the Board, issue notices of hearing requesting

wastewater discharge permit, a pretreatment standard or requirement or any
requirement of this chapter, the Director may commence a civil action to compel
compliance in a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin the user from
discharging, and/or to obtain appropriate relief to remedy the violations. The
Department or Board may also seek additional legal and/or equitable relief. The
commencement of suit neither constitutes an exclusive election of remedies nor
prohibits the Department, Director, Board, or City of Detroit from commencing
action in federal court for discharges believed to be in violation of this
chapter, state and federal requirements contained in the Clean Water Act, the
City of Detroit’s NPDES permit, or other applicable laws or requirements. In
addition, the City of Detroit may recover the reasonable attorney fees, court
costs, court reporters’ fees, and other unusual expenses related to enforcement
activities or litigation against the person found to have violated this
division, or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder.
      (3)    Fines, costs, and penalties. All fines, costs, and penalties which

§ 90.023 MANAGEMENT OF COMMUNITY CATS.

sterilizing, vaccinating for rabies, ear tipping, and returning cats to their
original location is an effective and humane way to manage the population of
community cats within the city; has determined that this process, known as
TNVR, is the preferred approach for managing the cat population; and will
encourage community organizations in TNVR efforts.

90.024.

circumstances exist that would require immediate action in furtherance of the
health, safety, and welfare of the public.
   (D)   Healthy community cats that have been trapped by a designated
caretaker in accordance with this section, shall not be considered nor be

Police or his or her designee. Within 48 hours a report must be transmitted by
means of electronic transmission through a modem, or similar device in a format
that the data is capable of direct electronic entry into the Hamtramck Police
Department’s computerized system, as approved by the Chief of Police, or his or
her designee for identifying property coming into the possession of a licensor,
including but not limited to all pawn property, all transactions in which used

registration fee is not a per item fee, included in the transaction. It is

from their customers for registering a transaction.
   (E)   The licensee will be invoiced on a monthly basis. The city’s vendor
automated reporting service isolates and generates a list of the billable
transactions will be used for deriving invoiced amounts. The above fees are
assessed for the use of the standard vendor’s automated recording service. Any
custom programming completed for the secondhand dealer will be negotiated on a
contract basis and may result in additional licensing arrangements between the
vendor and the licensor. Sales tax will be added to the above amounts where
applicable. Failure to timely pay as invoiced is a violation of this chapter.

persons and/or entities with whom business has transacted and all property
coming into their possession. Reports must be electronically transmitted to the
Police Chief or his or her designee. Within 48 hours of receipt by purchase, or
otherwise of a precious item, a report must be transmitted by means of
electronic transmission through a modem, or similar device in a format that the
data is capable of direct electronic entry into the Hamtramck Police
Department’s computerized system, as approved by the Police Chief, or his or
her designee for identifying property coming into the possession of a licensor.
A transaction report by electronic transmission under this division (B) shall
not be reported on paper forms, unless the Police Chief, or his or her designee
so requires. All dealers must have the equipment installed in their place of
business no later than January 1, 2013. Information must be reported
electronically beginning February 1, 2012.
      (2)   A fee as adopted and subject to change periodically by the City

transaction registration fee is not a per item fee, included in the

automated reporting service isolates and generates a list of the billable
transactions will be used for deriving invoiced amounts. The above fees are
assessed for the use of the standard vendor’s automated recording service. Any
custom programming completed for the secondhand dealer will be negotiated on a
contract basis and may result in additional licensing arrangements between the
vendor and the licensor. Sales tax will be added to the above amounts where
applicable. Failure to timely pay as invoiced is a violation of this chapter.

sheriff’s department shall not be open to inspection by the general public.

not more than one hour a day that does not produce a sound level in excess of
67 dB(A) beyond the property line of the property on which the instrument is
used.
   (H)   Call to prayer and church bells. The city shall permit “call to
prayer,” “church bells” and other reasonable means of announcing religious
meetings to be amplified between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. for
duration not to exceed five minutes:
      (1)   The city shall have the sole authority to set the level of
amplification, provided, however, that no such level shall be enforced until
all religious institutions receive notice of the levels; and
      (2)   All complaints regarding alleged violations of this section shall
be filed with the City Clerk and placed on the agenda of the next regular
meeting of the City Council. The City Council shall take all appropriate action
it deems necessary to alleviate the complaints, with the action to include, but
not be limited to, an order to terminate use of amplification. If the City
Council deems that the means of announcing religious meetings must be reduced,
the Council shall amend this section of the subchapter. The Council may also
determine that a complaint is without justification and choose to take no
action on the complaint; if the determination is made, the decision shall be
made by resolution of the City Council.

PROSTITUTION AND DRUG ACTIVITY
§ 131.001 TITLE.

(Ord. 506, passed 9-21-2004)

unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CITY COUNCIL. The City Council, or a standing or special committee of the
City Council.
   OWNER. Any person who possesses or has legal or equitable interest in a

§ 131.003 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS WITH RESPECT TO DRUG USE AND PROSTITUTION OR
SOLICITING FOR PROSTITUTION.
   (A)   The City Council determines that whenever the repeated use, sale,
furnishing, giving or possession of controlled substances or drug paraphernalia
occurs on any property, or whenever property is repeatedly used for violation
of the controlled substance or drug paraphernalia laws or for the purposes of
prostitution or soliciting for prostitution, within the city, a public nuisance
may result.
   (B)   A public nuisance results from the increased criminal activity that
occurs in the neighborhood surrounding the property, increased pedestrian and/
or vehicular traffic in the neighborhood surrounding the property, the fear
engendered in the minds of neighbors and the peace and quiet of residents
living in the neighborhood surrounding the property being disturbed.
(Ord. 506, passed 9-21-2004)
§ 131.004 AUTHORITY FOR DECLARATION OF A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   Whenever the illegal use, sale, furnishing, giving or possession of
controlled substances or drug paraphernalia repeatedly occurs on any property
or when any violation of the controlled substances act or drug paraphernalia
laws or any act of prostitution or soliciting for prostitution repeatedly
occurs on any property, the City Council may declare by resolution that the
property is a public nuisance and seek an order from the court that the
nuisance be abated as provided in this subchapter.
(Ord. 506, passed 9-21-2004) Penalty, see §
131.999
§ 131.005 PROCEDURE FOR DECLARATION OF A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   A declaration of a public nuisance under the authority of this subchapter
shall occur only in accordance with the following procedure:
   (A)   A declaration may occur only after there has been notice given to the
owner of the property and the owner has had an opportunity to be heard at a
public evidentiary hearing before the City Council.
   (B)   Notice of the public evidentiary hearing shall be given to the owner
and shall consist of personal service or the mailing of a certified letter to
the owner at the address indicated by the city assessor’s records, the records
of Register of Deeds of the county and the records of the city’s Building and
Engineering Department. The notice shall state the nature of the alleged
nuisance and the time, date and location of the hearing. If the notice is
served by certified mail, it shall be delivered with a return receipt requested
according to the practices of the post office. Receipt of the return receipt
card by the city indicating the owner’s has received the notice shall be deemed
notice to the owner. The notice to an owner shall occur at least seven calendar
days prior to the date of the public hearing. As used in this subchapter, THE
OWNER, AN OWNER or OWNER shall mean any and all person that the city is aware
of who have or who may have an ownership as defined in this subchapter.
Whenever this subchapter provides for notice to the owner, it shall be
construed to mean that notice shall be given to all persons having a known
ownership interest as so defined.
   (C)   The City Council, sitting as an administrative body, and acting a
quasi-judicial capacity, shall make a determination as to whether a public
nuisance exists under the standards established by this subchapter. The City
Council shall make this determination based solely upon the evidence presented
at the public evidentiary hearing. In conducting the public evidentiary
hearing, the City Council shall afford the owner and the Police Department an
opportunity to present relevant and material evidence and to make arguments as
to factual or legal issues. Cross-examination of opposing witnesses shall be
permitted. The owner may appear in person or be represented by an attorney. Lay
representation is not permitted. In conducting its public evidentiary hearing,
the City Council shall not be bound by rules of evidence and may admit and give
weight to probative evidence of a nature that is commonly relied upon by
reasonably prudent individuals in the conduct of their affairs. Irrelevant,
incompetent and immaterial evidence and unduly repetitious evidence shall be
excluded.
   (D)   The owner may, at any time during the proceedings, enter into a good
neighbor agreement with the City Council, and so long as the good neighbor
agreement remains in effect, no further action may be taken by City Council to
declare the property a nuisance, keeping in mind the purpose of this subchapter
is to rid the community of drug activity, not take or deny an owner of the
casual use of his or her property as a matter of course. However, after a
determination that a nuisance exists, the owner may not enter into a good
neighbor agreement with the City Council.
(Ord. 506, passed 9-21-2004)
§ 131.006 DECLARATION OF PUBLIC NUISANCE BY DEFAULT.
   If an owner, having been properly notified of the alleged nuisance and the
time, date and location of the hearing before City Council, or his or her
attorney, shall fail to appear at the hearing the City Council shall enter a
ruling in default. Failure to appear shall be viewed, in all cases, by the City
Council, as the concession, by the owner, to the relevant evidence in the
action.
(Ord. 506, passed 9-21-2004)
§ 131.007 ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE AND COSTS.
   (A)   If the City Council determines by a preponderance of the evidence that
a property is a public nuisance, it may, by resolution, in addition to any
other remedies available to the city at law or in equity, direct the City
Attorney to seek from a court of competent jurisdiction an order of abatement
of the nuisance.
   (B)   The abatement process shall be conducted as follows:
      (1)   If it is determined that all or a portion of the property is to be
ordered vacated, the court shall order the property vacated and declare that
occupancy of all or a portion of the property is prohibited and authorized the
Police Department to prohibit the occupancy of the property by either
padlocking all or a portion of the property or boarding or otherwise securing
all or a portion of the property, as is appropriate, for a period of up to one
year as the court shall determine based upon the evidence;
      (2)   Determine that the owner shall be liable for the full cost of any
materials and personnel (including police and any other city employees or
contractors) involved in the padlocking, boarding or securing of the property
in the first instance and the full cost of any personnel and materials involved
in any subsequent or remedial padlocking, boarding or securing of the property;
      (3)   Determine that the owner shall be liable for the full cost to the
city in bringing the action to abate before the court;
      (4)   Determine that the costs set out herein shall be a personal debt of
the owner and/or assess those costs against the property as a lien as provided
for in the City Charter for property taxes; and
      (5)   Where only a discreet area under the control of a person or persons
other than the owner is involved in the illegal activity, the court shall not
order that any other than the part of used for the illegal activity be vacated.
The court shall not order that any part of the business or other property be
vacated provided the owner or owners of the property take steps, as ordered by
resolution of City Council adopting a good neighbor agreement, to police the
activity taking place near the business or property. These actions include, but
are not limited to, hiring a private security firm to patrol the area, the
installation of cameras and other surveillance equipment, posting of signs on
the building, and cooperation with the Police Department. Failure to comply
with the resolution of City Council shall result in a hearing of a declaration
of public nuisance as provided for in this subchapter. It is the intent of this
provision to protect those truly and completely innocent of any participation
in the act and those not having any notice of, or direct or imputed knowledge
of, the illegal acts from being deprived of the use of their property. By way
of example and limitation, if only a single apartment in a multiple dwelling is
used for illegal purposes as provided for in this subchapter, the court may
vacate only the apartment used for the illegal purposes and shall not vacate
the entire building.
(Ord. 506, passed 9-21-2004)

substances or illegal controlled substances or illegal drug paraphernalia have
been found by the police;
   (B)   The property has been the location of a violation of the state

court approved plea bargain agreement, or, if within one year, a subsequent
violation of the controlled substances act or the drug paraphernalia law occurs
which directly leads to a conviction even if the conviction is for a crime is

soliciting for prostitution; and
   (D)   The same property is the location within one year from the date of the
first offense of an act of prostitution or solicitation for prostitution, which

different than the one originally charged because of a court approved plea
bargain agreement.

§ 151.013 DENIALS.

be necessary to substantially improve or correct any of the following
conditions:
   (A)   The resource constitutes a hazard to the safety of the public or to
the structure’s occupants;
   (B)   The resource is a deterrent to a major improvement program that will
be of substantial benefit to the community and the applicant proposing the work
has obtained all necessary planning and zoning approvals, financing and
environmental clearances;
   (C)   Retaining the resource will cause undue financial hardship to the
owner when a governmental action, an act of God or other events beyond the
owner’s control created the hardship, and all feasible alternatives to
eliminate the financial hardship, which may include offering the resource for
sale at its fair market value or moving the resource to a vacant site within
the Historic District, have been attempted and exhausted by the owner; or

community.

decision is furnished to the applicant. The appellant may submit all or part of
the appellant’s evidence and arguments in written form. The State Historic
Preservation Review Board shall consider an appeal at its first regularly

rendered under this chapter may not appeal to the court without first
exhausting the right to appeal to the State Historic Preservation Review Board.

§ 151.016 WORK WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   When work has been done upon a resource without a permit, and the Commission
finds that the work does not qualify for a certificate of appropriateness, the
Commission may require an owner to restore the resource to the condition that
the resource was in before the inappropriate work or to modify the work so that
it qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness. If the owner does not comply
with the restoration or modification requirement within a reasonable time, the
Commission may seek an order from the Circuit Court to require the owner to
restore the resource to its former condition or to modify the work so that it
qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness. If the owner does not comply or
cannot comply with the order of the court, the Commission or its agents may
enter the property and conduct work necessary to restore the resource to its
former condition or modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of
appropriateness in accordance with the court’s order. The costs of the work
done shall be charged to the owner, and may be levied by the city as a special
assessment against the property. When acting pursuant to an order of the
Circuit Court, the Commission or its agents may enter a property for purposes
of this section.

following:

contributing to demolition by neglect; or
   (B)   If the owner does not make repairs within a reasonable time, the
Commission or its agents may enter the property and make the repairs as
necessary to prevent demolition by neglect. The costs of the work shall be
charged to the owner, and may be levied by the city as a special assessment
against the property. The Commission or its agents may enter the property for
purposes of this section upon obtaining an order from the Circuit Court.
(Ord. 501, passed 3-2-2004)
§ 151.018 REVIEW OF WORK IN PROPOSED DISTRICTS.
   Upon receipt of substantial evidence showing the presence of historic,
architectural, archaeological, engineering or cultural significance of a
proposed Historic District, the City Council may, at its discretion, adopt a
resolution requiring that all applications for permits within the proposed
Historic District be referred to the Historic District Commission as prescribed
in §

the same powers that would apply if the proposed Historic District was an
established Historic District. The review may continue in the proposed Historic

a period not to exceed six months. The City Council may extend the emergency
moratorium for an additional period not to exceed six months, upon finding that
the threat of irreparable harm to resources is still present. Any pending

§ 151.021 ACQUISITION OF HISTORIC RESOURCES.
   If all efforts by the Commission to preserve a resource fail or if it is
determined by the City Council that public ownership is most suitable, the City
Council, if considered to be in the public interest, may acquire the resource
using public funds, public or private gifts, grants or proceeds from the
issuance of revenue bonds. The acquisition shall be based upon the
recommendation of the Commission. The Commission is responsible for maintaining
publicly owned resources using its own funds, if not specifically designated

unintentional breaches of the obligations of administration and enforcement
imposed by the City of Hamtramck shall not be enforceable in tort.

§ 155.021 PERMITS AND APPROVALS.
   (A)   General. All departments, officials, and employees who are charged
with the duty or authority to issue permits or approvals shall not issue any
permit or approval for uses or purposes when the permit or approval would be in
conflict with this chapter. No permit shall be issued to any person who is in
default to the city. By way of illustration, a person in default could owe the
city income tax, property tax, water bill, or a business license fee. If a
written payment plan has been accepted by the chief executive officer, the code
official shall issue a conditional permit if all other provisions of this
chapter are met. Any permit or approval, if issued in conflict with this
chapter, shall be null and void.
   (B)   Permits.
      (1)   Conformance to zoning. No use, building, or structure, whether
publicly or privately owned, shall be constructed or authorized until the
location and extent thereof conform to the approved plan and the code official
has issued the proper permits. Specifically, a zoning permit shall be obtained
before the construction, physical development, or razing of a proposed new or
expanded use, structure, or building; the restoration and structural
improvement of any existing use or structure other than normal repairs and
minor improvement; or a change of one use to any other use. When a building
permit is required, zoning approval shall be an eligibility requirement or
prerequisite for such permit.
      (2)   Expiration or cancellation. Each license, permit, or approval
issued shall expire after 180 days if no work is undertaken or such use or
activity is not established, unless a different time of issuance of the license
or permit is allowed in this chapter, or unless an extension is granted by the
Zoning Board of Appeals before expiration. Failure to comply fully with the
terms of any permit, license, or approval shall be permitted to be grounds for
cancellation or revocation. Action to cancel any license, permit, or approval
shall be permitted to be taken on proper grounds by the code official.
Cancellation of a permit or approval by the Commission or Board shall be
permitted to be appealed in the same manner as its original action.
      (3)   Validity of licenses, permits, approvals, and variances. The code
official shall require that the development or use in question before the
Commission or Board proceed only under the terms of such license, permit,
approval, or variance including any requirements or conditions established as a
condition of issuance by the Commission or Board. Except as specifically
provided for in this chapter and conditions of approval, the securing of one
required review or approval shall not exempt the recipient from the necessity
of securing any other required review or approval.
      (4)   Approval for and availability of essential services. All projects
that require the additional use of new facilities or essential services, such
as sewers, storm drains, fire hydrants, potable water, public streets, street
lighting, and similar services, shall obtain such approval as required by the
agency providing such services before project approval and permit issuance.
Nonavailability of essential services shall be permitted to be grounds for
denying permits for additional development until such services are available.
The city is not obligated to extend or supply essential services if capacity is
not available. If capacity is available, the extension of such services shall
be by and at the cost of the developer. All service extensions shall be
designed and installed in full conformance with the city's standards for such
service, and shall be subject to review, permit, and inspection as required by
other policies or ordinances of the city.
   (C)   Certificate of compliance required. A person shall not occupy a new
structure, except an owner-occupied dwelling unit, or lot, or occupy an
existing structure or lot until the code official has issued a certificate of
compliance. If a change in ownership occurs in an established business, a
certificate of compliance shall be required. Before a certificate of compliance
is issued, the code official and other interested city officials and
departments shall perform a thorough inspection intended to insure that both
the structure and the use comply with all zoning requirements and any
conditions previously imposed. After inspection and consultation with other
interested city officials and departments, the code official shall:
      (1)   Issue the certificate of compliance if all requirements of this
chapter are satisfied and all conditions, if any, have been met;
      (2)   Deny the certificate of compliance if all of the requirements of
this chapter are not satisfied and all conditions, if any, have not been met,
with such denial being in writing and clearly identifying the reasons for
denial and imposing a time frame for compliance;
      (3)   Issue a temporary certificate of compliance for no more than 60
days, if in the opinion of the code official the reasons for possible denial
are minor and can be addressed within a reasonable period of time; the
temporary certificate of compliance shall have conditions imposed by the code
official.
   (D)   Fees. A fee for services shall be charged. All fees shall be
established by resolution of the Common Council during the adoption of the
annual budget. Failure to apply for the appropriate zoning permit and paying
the appropriate fee shall result in a municipal civil infraction and a doubling
of the permit fee.

imposed under this chapter, in authorizing any zoning permit, special land use
approval, or variance, the body or official charged with administering, as
designated by this chapter, the respective request may require that a cash
deposit, certified check, irrevocable bank letter of credit, or surety bond in
an amount authorized by this chapter be deposited with the City Treasurer to
insure faithful completion of the improvements. The performance guarantee shall
be deposited when the permit is issued authorizing the activity or project.
This section shall not be applicable to improvements for which a cash deposit,
certified check, irrevocable bank letter of credit, or surety bond has been
deposited under the Land Division Act, Act No. 288 of the Public Acts of 1967,
as amended, being M.C.L.A. §§ 560.101 to 560.293.
   (B)   Amount of bond. Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, the Common
Council shall by resolution during adoption of the annual budget establish a
guideline for the amount of bonds that the Common Council deems adequate for
the protection of the city and its inhabitants.
   (C)   Return of performance bond. Upon the satisfactory completion of
specific requirements as attested to by the code official, the City Treasurer
shall be authorized to return any improvement or performance bond without
interest that may pertain to the specific improvement.
   (D)   Withholding and partial withholding of performance bond. When the
project is not satisfactorily completed, the code official may direct the City
Treasurer not to return all or part of any bond; but to apply the bond or part
thereof to the project in question. If any action begin and fail to meet full
completion based on the approve site plan, or if the project area is reduced in
size and action is only partially completed, the code official shall determine
the amount of the bond or bonds to be returned to the applicant, without
interest, and the amount be applied to the improvements.

         (a)   Non-use variance.
            1.   The Board shall be permitted to approve or approve with
conditions by a simple majority vote of the Board a request for a dimensional
or non-use variance provided that the property owner demonstrates practical
difficulty by showing all of the following:
               a.   Strict compliance with the area, setbacks, frontage,
height, bulk, or density requirements of this chapter would unreasonably
prevent the property owner from using property for some lawful permitted
purpose or would render conformity unnecessarily burdensome in the particular
case.
               b.   A variance shall do substantial justice to both the
property owner and neighboring property owners in the district or that a lesser
requirement would give substantial relief and be more consistent with justice
to others.
               c.   The plight of the property owner is due to unique
circumstances of the property.
               d.   The problem of the property owner is not self-created.
            2.   If the property owner demonstrates the above criteria, the
Board may consider the following types of non-use variance requests:
               a.   All matters referred to the Board or upon which the Board
shall hear and decide under this chapter.
               b.   Permit such modification of the height, placement, and area
regulations as may be necessary to secure an appropriate improvement of a lot
which is of such shape or so located with relation to surrounding development
or physical characteristics that the lot cannot otherwise be appropriately
improved without such modification.
               c.   Permit the modification of the automobile parking space or
loading space requirements when, in the particular instance, such modifications
shall not be inconsistent with the purpose and intent of such requirement.
               d.   Permit variances for items such as buffering, screening,
fencing, or landscaping.
         (b)   Use variance. The Board shall be permitted to grant by a two-
thirds vote of the Board a use variance of the literal provisions of this
chapter to a property owner provided that the property owner demonstrates all
of the following:
            1.   Showing of unnecessary hardship on the property owner if this
chapter was strictly enforced. The landowner shall prove that the land cannot
be put to a reasonable use or yield a reasonable return under its existing
zoning classification.
            2.   The hardship shall be unique or peculiar to the particular
parcel and cannot be the result of general neighborhood conditions.
            3.   There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or
conditions applicable to the property involved or to the intended use of the
property that do not apply generally to other properties or uses in the same
zone.
            4.   The variance is necessary to the preservation and enjoyment of
a substantial property right possessed by other property in the same zone and
proximity.
            5.   The variance shall not result in the alteration of the
essential character of the neighborhood by impairing an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, increasing traffic congestion in public
streets, increasing the danger of fire, endangering the public safety, or
unreasonably diminishing or impairing established property values within the
surrounding area.
            6.   The variance is a minimum variance that shall make possible
the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
            7.   The variance shall be in harmony with the general purpose and
intent of this chapter and shall not be injurious to the neighborhood or
otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
      (12)   Time limitations on a variance. If the Board approves a variance,
the variance shall remain in effect only so long as the facts and circumstances
as presented to the Board and upon which the variance was granted continue to
exist, and that the conditions attached to the approval are satisfied and
maintained. If the variance is not exercised within 12 months from the date the
variance is granted (unless the Board establishes a different time period as a
condition), the variance shall lapse. If the variance has lapsed and the
petitioner desires to proceed with the benefits of the variance, the petitioner
shall reapply for the variance and demonstrate that all of the requirements for
approval of a variance have been met, based upon the facts and circumstances in
existence when the new request was submitted. The Board shall have the right to
deny the variance if the facts and circumstances pertaining to the request have
changed, if the petitioner is not willing to satisfy the conditions attached to
the original approval, or if the petitioner has not demonstrated that all of
the substantive requirements for the granting of a variance have been satisfied
as of the time the new application for variance is filed.
   (G)   Appeals and hearings.
      (1)   Filing, time limit. An appeal under this chapter shall be commenced
by a person filing notice of appeal or petition as described in the rules and
procedures of the Board, within 35 days, and with the appropriate filing fee as
annually determined by the Common Council upon adoption of the budget, with the
code official. The notice of appeal shall specify the specific grounds upon
which the appeal is based and shall be signed by the applicant and property
owner. The appeal shall specify the requirement from which a variance is sought
and the nature and extend of such variance. The appeal shall be accompanied by
a fully completed application along with any other information required by the
Board. The code official shall immediately send to the Board all the papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. No
appeal under this chapter shall be taken if such applicant is in default to the
city and is not eligible to be issued a permit under this chapter.
      (2)   Notification of hearing. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for
the hearing of the appeal and give notice of the appeal to the persons to whom
real property within 300 feet of the premises in question is assessed, and to
the occupants of single and two-family dwellings within 300 feet. The notice
shall be delivered personally or by mail addressed to the respective owners and
tenants at the address given in the last assessment roll. If a tenant's name is
not known, the term "occupant" may be used. A person may appear in person or be
represented by a duly authorized agent at the hearing.
      (3)   Effect of filing. An appeal under this chapter stays all
proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the officer or
body from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board, after the notice of
appeal is filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay
would in the opinion of the officer or body cause imminent peril to life or
property. If such a certification is filed, the proceedings shall only be
stayed by a restraining order. A restraining order may be granted by the Board
or by the circuit court, on application, on notice to the officer or body from
whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
      (4)   Board to decide. The Board shall decide the appeal within 75 days.
The Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and shall make an order,
requirement, decision, or determination as in the Board's opinion ought to be
made in the premises, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer
or body from whom the appeal is taken, all subject to limitations identified in
this chapter. If there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in
carrying out the strict letter of this chapter, the Board may in passing upon
appeals grant a variance in any of its rules or provisions relating to the
construction, or structural changes in, equipment, or alteration of buildings
or structures, or the use of land, buildings, or structures, so that the spirit
of this chapter shall be observed, public safety secured, and substantial
justice done.
      (5)   Official record of hearing. The Board shall prepare an official
record for each appeal and shall base its decision on this record. The official
record shall include the relevant administrative record and administrative
orders issued thereon relating to the appeal, the notice of the appeal, and
such documents, exhibits, photographs, or written reports as may be submitted
to the Board for its consideration, and the minutes of the hearing, findings of
fact, and decisions and order of the Board. The record and decision of the
Board shall comply with the constitution and the laws of the state, be based on
proper procedure, be supported by competent material and substantial evidence
on the record, and represent the reasonable exercise of discretion granted by
law to the Board.
      (6)   Appeal to Circuit Court. The decision of the Board is final.
However, a person having an interest affected by this chapter may appeal to the
circuit court. If the court finds the record of the Board inadequate to make
the review required under state law, or that additional material evidence
exists that with good reason was not presented to the Board, the court shall
order further proceedings before the Board on conditions that the court
considers proper. The Board of appeals may modify its findings and decision as
a result of the new proceedings, or may affirm the original decision. The
supplementary decision shall be filed with the court.
   (H)   Limitations on the powers of the Board.
      (1)   Common Council decisions. Nothing contained herein shall empower
the Board to override the decisions of the Common Council with respect to the
approval or denial of any decision authorized to be made by the Common Council.
      (2)   Zoning Map. Nothing contained herein shall empower the Board to
change the terms of this chapter, to effect changes in the Zoning Map, or to
add to the uses permitted in any zoning district, except when specifically
empowered to do so by this chapter.
      (3)   Variance conditions.
         (a)   In authorizing a variance or taking any other action within its
jurisdiction, the Board may attach such conditions as may be deemed necessary
in the furtherance of the purposes of this chapter, provided any conditions are
in compliance with the standards contained herein. The conditions imposed by
the Board may include conditions necessary to ensure that public services and
facilities affected by a proposed land use or activity shall be capable of
accommodating increased service and facility loads caused by the land use or
activity, protect the natural environment, conserve natural resources and
energy, ensure compatibility with adjacent uses of land, and to promote the use
of land in a socially and economically desirable manner. Conditions imposed
shall do all the following:
            1.   Be designed to protect natural resources, the health, safety,
and welfare, as well as the social and economic well-being of those who shall
use the land use or activity under consideration, residents and landowners
immediately adjacent to the proposed land use or activity and the community as
a whole;
            2.   Be related to the valid exercise of the police power and
purposes which are affected by the proposed use or activity;
            3.   Be necessary to meet the intent and purpose of the zoning
regulations, be related to the standards established in this chapter for the
land use or activity under consideration and be necessary to ensure compliance
with those standards.
         (b)   The conditions imposed with respect to the approval of a land
use or activity shall be recorded in the record of the approval action and
shall remain unchanged except upon the mutual consent of the approving
authority and the property owner. The Board shall maintain a record of changes
granted in conditions. Any changes in the conditions shall be filed with the
Register of Deeds as provided herein.
      (4)   Basis of decisions. Every decision of the Board shall be based upon
findings of fact, and every such finding shall be supported in the record and
proceedings of the Board.

ZONING DISTRICTS AND MAP
§ 155.035 GENERAL.
   (A)   Classification. To classify, regulate, and restrict the locations of
uses and locations of buildings designated for specific areas, and to regulate
and determine the areas of yards, courts, and other open spaces within or
surrounding such buildings, the city is hereby divided into zoning districts as
prescribed in this subchapter. To the extent possible, these zoning districts
are established under the city's proposed Master Land Use Plan.
   (B)   Zoning Map.
      (1)   Boundaries. The boundaries of these districts are hereby
established as shown on the City of Hamtramck Official Zoning Map, referred
hereinafter as "the Map", which accompanies this chapter as Appendix A, and
which map, with all notations, references and other information shown thereon,
shall be as much a part of this chapter as if fully described herein.
      (2)   Changes to boundaries. Under this chapter, if changes are made in
district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the Map, such changes shall be
made on the Map after the amendment has been approved by the City Council,
together with an entry on the Map as follows: amended date, Ordinance No. ().
      (3)   Official copies. Two copies of this chapter and the Map are to be
maintained and kept up-to-date. One copy shall be filed with the code official
and the other shall be filed with the City Clerk, whose copy shall be the final
authority as to the current zoning status of lands, buildings, and other
structures in the city.
      (4)   District boundaries interpreted. If, due to the scale, lack of
details, or illegibility of the Map, there is any uncertainty, contradiction,
or conflict as to the intended location of any zoning district boundaries shown
thereon, interpretation concerning the exact location of district boundary
lines shall be determined by the Board upon written application. The Board, in
arriving at a decision on such matters, shall apply the following standards:
         (a)   The boundaries of zoning districts are intended to follow
centerlines of alleys, streets, or other rights-of-way, or be parallel or
perpendicular thereto, unless such district boundary lines are otherwise
clearly indicated on the Map;
         (b)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they
approximately follow lot of record lines, such lot lines shall be construed to
be boundaries;
         (c)   In unsubdivided property, or where a district boundary divides a
lot of record, the location of such boundary, unless shown by dimensions on the
Map, shall be determined by use of the map scale shown thereon.
      (5)   Zoning status of public, semi-public, and parks/open space
designations. Where the Map indicates public, semi-public, or parks/open space,
such areas shall be considered to be zoned in the area that borders the area in
question on not less than three sides. If a clear distinction cannot be made,
then the zoning shall be considered R, except as otherwise indicated in this
section. For clarification purposes the following commonly known locations
shall be considered to be placed in the following districts:
         (a)   R District, sites of:
            1.   Corinthian Baptist Church;
            2.   Kosciuszko Middle School;
            3.   Hamtramck Fire Department;
            4.   Hamtramck Public Library;
            5.   St. Ladislaus Church properties;
            6.   Immaculate Conception Church properties;
            7.   Hamtramck High School and Community Center;
            8.   Our Lady Queen of Apostles Church properties;
            9.   Pulaski Park;
            10.   St. Florian Church properties;
            11.   St. Peter Zion, A.M.E. Church properties;
            12.   Hamtramck City Hall;
            13.   Dickinson Elementary School;
            14.   St. Joseph Living Center properties;
            15.   Tau Beta;
            16.   Veterans' Memorial Park, Playfair, and Keyworth stadium;
            17.   Holbrook Elementary School; and
            18.   Eastside of Conant, between Oliver and Dorothy.
         (b)   I District, sites of:
            1.   Wayne County Jail; and
            2.   Southeast corner of Conant and Holbrook.
      (6)   Annexed territory. Any territory hereafter annexed shall
automatically, upon such annexation, be classified as "Residential" and shall
be subject to all conditions and regulations applicable to property in such
district.

§ 155.036 CONFORMITY TO ORDINANCE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Scope. Zoning effects every structure and use. No structure, building,
or land shall be used, occupied, erected, constructed, moved, or altered,
except in conformity with the regulations specified for that zoning district.
Unless a use is specifically permitted in a particular zoning district, the use
shall be prohibited in that zoning district. If any building, structure, or
land is used, erected, altered, or occupied contrary to law or to the
provisions of this chapter, such building, structure, or use shall be declared
a nuisance and shall be required to be vacated, torn down, or abated by any
legal means and shall not be used or occupied until the building, structure, or
use has been brought into compliance.
   (B)   Area, bulk, and height requirements. Except as otherwise provided,
regulations governing land and building use, minimum lot size, lot area per
dwelling unit, building height, building placement, required yards, and other
pertinent factors are hereby established as stated in the detailed provisions
for each of the zoning districts and shall apply uniformly to each class or
kind of structure, land, or use within the appropriate district.
   (C)   Application of regulations. The regulations set by this chapter shall
be minimum regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of
structure, land, or use. All buildings, structures, or land may hereafter be
used, constructed, altered, or occupied only when in conformity with all of the
regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located. No
building or other structure shall hereafter be altered to accommodate or house
a greater number of persons or families, or to have narrower or smaller rear
yards, front yards, or other side yards than permitted by the district in which
it is located. No lot existing when this chapter or subsequent amendment became
effective shall be subdivided or reduced in dimension or area below the minimum
requirements of the district in which the lot is located. Lots created after
the effective date of this chapter shall meet the minimum requirements
established by this chapter.
   (D)   Uses.
      (1)   General. The principal objective of this chapter is to provide for
an orderly arrangement of compatible buildings and land uses and for the proper
location of all types of uses required for the social and economic welfare of
the community. To accomplish this objective, each type and kind of use is
classified as permitted in one or more of the various districts established by
this chapter. However, in addition to those uses specifically classified and
permitted in each district, there are certain additional uses that may be
allowed because of the unusual characteristics of the service the use provides
to the public. These special land uses require particular consideration as to
their proper location to adjacent, established, or intended uses, or to the
planned growth of the community. The conditions controlling the locations and
operation of such special land uses are established by applicable sections of
this chapter.
      (2)   Permitted uses. In each zoning district a "permitted use" shall be
a use of land or buildings subject to the minimum requirements specified for
such use in the zoning district in which such use is located, plus applicable
requirements found elsewhere in this chapter.
      (3)   Special land uses. A special land use shall be a use of land or
buildings that may be permitted in that district only after following special
procedures designed to ensure site and use compatibility with existing or
proposed surrounding land uses. In evaluating and deciding each application for
such permission, the Commission shall apply the standards contained in §§
155.185 through
155.188 and any special conditions imposed for that use. Uses are permitted
within the various districts described in this chapter and as otherwise
provided herein.
      (4)   Unclassified uses. The city recognizes that all possible uses and
variations of uses that might arise cannot reasonably be listed or categorized.
Mixed uses/sites or any use not specifically mentioned or about which there is
any question shall be administratively classified by comparison with other uses
identified in the districts described in this chapter. If the proposed use
resembles identified uses in terms of intensity and character, and is
consistent with the purpose of this chapter and the individual district
classification, the use shall be considered as a permitted use within the
appropriate district classification, subject to the regulations for the use it
most nearly resembles. If a use does not resemble other identified allowable
uses within a district, the use may be permitted as determined by the Board
after a public hearing as a variance to this chapter under §§
155.020 through
155.024.

removed, but not to encourage their survival. With the knowledge that some
nonconforming uses, buildings, or structures shall not disappear, the city
desires and requires, in pursuit of the public interest, to distinguish between
nonconforming uses, buildings, or structures which shall be eliminated as
rapidly as possible and nonconforming uses, buildings, or structures which
ought to be given separate treatment.
   (B)   Board authority to permit some changes. In recognition of this fact,
the Board shall have the authority to permit some expansion or changes to
lawfully existing nonconforming uses based upon the standards set forth in this
subchapter.
   (C)   Status of alleged nonconformities. Those alleged nonconforming uses,
structures, or uses and structures in combination, which cannot be proved
conclusively to have been lawfully existing before the enactment or amendment
of this chapter, shall be declared illegal uses and shall be discontinued. In
other than criminal proceedings, the owner, occupant, or user shall have the
burden to show that the lot, use, or structure was lawfully established.

FENCES
§ 155.135 GENERAL.
   (A)   Scope. The respective owners of all lots in the city shall construct
and maintain fences between their own and adjoining lots owned by other
persons.
   (B)   Responsibility. Fences shall be between four feet four inches and six
feet four inches high. No more than two fences shall be constructed along the
side lot line between the rear property line and front building line. If the
parcel runs north and south, the owner is responsible for the west fence line.
If the parcel runs east and west, the owner is responsible for the north fence
line. For odd shaped parcels, the code official shall determine the
responsibility for fence construction and maintenance. Fences enclosing a
property shall provide adequate access for fire fighting purposes, with not
less than one access at the front lot line and not less than one access at the
rear lot line, except that access can be provided on the side lot line for
corner lots. Double fences constructed along the rear of the lot shall be
permissible if they comply with all rules and regulations required herein and
by the State of Michigan.
   (C)   Mixed-use adjoining properties. In the absence of a building façade
within five feet of the lot line, owners of properties with nonresidential uses
abutting properties with residential uses shall erect and maintain a privacy
fence of six feet four inches along such property lines. If the nonresidential
use is an industrial use, an eight-foot four-inch privacy fence may be
permitted by the code official.
   (D)   Bodies of water. Any swimming pool, pond, or other artificially
installed body of water, all of which may contain not less than 12 inches of
water in depth at any point, shall be enclosed by a fence not less than four
feet four inches in height. Gates shall be of a self-closing and latching type,
with the latch on the inside of the gate so that the latch is not readily
accessible for children to open. Gates shall be capable of being securely
locked. If the entire premises is enclosed, then the code official may waive
this provision upon proper application and approval.
   (E)   Maintenance, repair, and removal. All fences shall be maintained in a
neat and safe condition. Fences erected between residential uses and other uses
shall be maintained in a neat and safe condition at the expense of the owner of
the other use under the terms of any waiver granted under to this chapter.
Fences shall be kept free of weeds, trees, and other nuisance vegetation. The
respective owners of all lots shall also be responsible for the care, repair,
and upkeep of all fences contiguous to or bordering upon streets, alleys, and
other public areas. Fences erected on or between residential uses shall be
maintained in a neat and safe condition at the expense of the owner legally
responsible for the fence. If ownership and responsibility of the fence, in the
opinion of the code official, is not reasonably and readily ascertainable, the
code official shall have the authority to require that any or all property
owners abutting the fence maintain or repair the fence. This chapter shall not
require the city to secure a survey to determine responsibility or property
ownership. In the absence of any other agreement, the fence owner shall, if
necessary, be allowed by the adjoining property owner access to that fence not
less than two days twice a year for the purpose of periodic maintenance work,
and at any time and as long as required for emergency repair work. In the case
of a disagreement between the two property owners, the code official shall make
a determination. If a fence falls into such disrepair that the fence becomes a
threat to public health, safety, or welfare, the city shall have the authority
to replace or repair the fence and the cost of such replacement or repair shall
be that of the property owner who is legally responsible for maintaining the
fence. The city shall have the authority to place the cost of such replacement
or repair on the tax rolls.
   (F)   Nonconforming fences. Any fence legally existing when this chapter or
subsequent amendment became effective that does not conform in use, location,
height, or size with the regulations of this chapter shall be considered a
legal nonconforming fence and shall be permitted to continue in such status
while it is either abandoned or removed by its owner, subject to the following
limitations:
      (1)   Structural alterations, enlargement, or re-erection are permissible
only if such changes shall not increase the degree of nonconformity of the
fence.
      (2)   Any legal nonconforming fence shall be replaced without increasing
the existing height or area if its is damaged, or removed if allowed to
deteriorate to the extent that the cost of repair or restoration exceeds 50% of
the replacement cost of the fence as determined by the code official.
      (3)   Fences that comply with either item division (F)(1) or (F)(2) above
need not be permitted.
   (G)   Prohibited fences. The following fences shall be specifically

§ 155.136 PERMITS.
   (A)   Permit required. Unless specifically exempted, a permit shall be
obtained from the code official for the erection of all fences erected within
the city and under other ordinances of the city. Exemptions from the necessity
of securing a permit, however, shall not be construed to relieve the owner of
the fence involved from responsibility for its erection and maintenance in a
safe manner and in a manner under all the other provisions of this chapter. No
permit shall be issued to any person who is in default to the city. By way of
illustration, a person in default could owe the city income tax, property tax,
water bill, or a business license fee. If a written payment plan has been
accepted by the chief executive officer, the code official shall issue a
conditional permit if all other provisions of this chapter are met. All rights
and privileges acquired under this chapter are mere licenses and may be revoked
by the city by a letter to the permit holder upon the violation of any of the
conditions herein, whereupon the code official may revoke the fence with costs
of removal charged to the permit holder. If the work authorized under a fence
permit has not be started within six months, and then finished within thirty
days after the date of issuance, the permit shall become null and void.
   (B)   Permit fees. A fee for services shall be charged. All fees shall be
established by resolution of the Common Council during the adoption of the
annual budget. Failure to apply for the appropriate fence permit shall result
in a municipal civil infraction and a doubling of the permit fee.
   (C)   Construction documents. Before any permit is granted for the purpose
of erecting a fence requiring such permit, construction documents shall be
filed with the code official showing the dimensions, materials, and details of
fence construction, the location of the parcel of land upon which the fence is
to be erected with the property line and the position of the fence in relation
to nearby buildings or structures, and any other pertinent data required by the
code official. The permit application shall be accompanied by written consent
of the owner or lessee of the premises upon which the fence is to be erected
and a written agreement between the adjoining property owners as to the
location of the lot line or a certified land survey by a licensed land surveyor
showing the location of the property line.

§ 155.137 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   (A)   Types of fences. The following types of fences shall be permitted to
be erected or re-erected, subject to the following limitations:
      (1)   Partition fences may be erected for the purpose of separating,
enclosing, or protecting property within its perimeter.
      (2)   Privacy fences may be erected to constitute a complete visual
barrier to persons outside of the perimeter. All privacy fences shall have
posts, cross-members, bolts, or any other frame support placed on the side of
the fence facing the property of the erector. Privacy fences shall be permitted
along the rear lot line. Privacy fences constructed along a side lot line shall
be permitted to extend from the rear lot line to the front building line.
      (3)   Decorative fences out of metal, wood, pipe, or rail as a non-sight-
obstructing structure may be erected as a landscape treatment to enhance,
accent, beautify, or protect the site.
   (B)   Vegetation. Hedges, shrubs, bushes, and evergreen trees shall be
considered legal fences if they do not enclose swimming pools, ponds, or other
bodies of water. When fully grown, the hedges, shrubs, bushes, and evergreen
trees shall not exceed six feet four inches in height and shall be planted not
closer than two feet from the lot line. No vegetation considered a legal fence
shall obscure the line of sight for drivers on an abutting public right-of-way
or private driveway.
   (C)   Building lines. Fences erected along established front building lines
and along rear lot lines shall not exceed the height of six feet four inches
above grade level, except that in residential zones, no fence shall be
constructed along the front building or lot line that exceeds two feet four
inches in height. Along the side lot lines, no fence shall be constructed
between the established front building lines and the front property lines with
the exception of a four-foot four-inch high fence of decorative non-sight-
obscuring material. On a corner lot abutting a public right-of-way, a non-
sight-obscuring fence may be permitted not to exceed four feet four inches in
height at the established building line, tapering down to a height of two feet
four inches at the front lot line.
   (D)   Construction. Any fence post hereinafter erected shall consist of
posts that may be one and five-eighths inches diameter galvanized steel pipe,
four inch reinforced concrete, four-inch treated wood, primarily wood
composite, or vinyl, spaced a maximum of ten feet apart, embedded in concrete
footings not less than three-feet deep in the ground, and shall allow for the
erection of a fence as authorized by this chapter that is four inches off of
the ground to the fence height of four feet four inches to six feet four inches
above grade level. All fence posts shall be within the lot line of the person
responsible for the maintenance of the fence. Fences shall be made of
galvanized woven wire, metal, decay resistant wood boards, primarily wood
composite, or vinyl. If the fence is erected on the lot line, the junction line
of the posts and wire or boards shall be considered to coincide with the
property line.

§ 155.138 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (A)   Appeals. Any person denied a permit to erect or re-erect a fence shall
have the right to appeal the decision of the code official to the Board upon
filing the appropriate fee. The Board shall, after a public hearing conducted
under this chapter and the rules of the Board, be authorized to grant
dimensional and use variances if the applicant demonstrates upon a finding that
all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical
conditions of the property would render compliance with the requirements of
this section difficult and would likely result in a particular hardship on the
person causing the fence to be erected. No variance shall be granted to anyone
who deems a waiver based on the mere inconvenience of the requirements of this
chapter or to increase financial gain or avoid the financial expense of
compliance.
      (2)   Strict enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would serve no
useful purpose.
      (3)   The type of fence and the location proposed would not pose a
significant risk to the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (4)   The benefit of the fence to the general public outweighs any risk
to public health, safety, and welfare.
      (5)   A waiver would be in the best interest of the city and not against
the spirit and intent of this chapter.
   (B)   Variances. A dimensional variance shall require a simple majority vote
of the Board, and a use variance shall require a two-thirds majority vote of
the Board.

SIGN REGULATIONS
§ 155.150 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this section is to regulate signs and outdoor
advertising so as to protect the health, safety, general welfare, property
values, aesthetics and the character of the various neighborhoods in the City
of Hamtramck.
   (B)   The principle features are the restriction of the location, height,
and total area of signs permissible per site. Any sign placed on land or on a
building for the purposes of identification or for advertising a use conducted
on the premises shall be deemed an accessory use. It is intended that the
display of signs will be appropriate to the land, building, or use to which
they are appurtenant and be adequate, but not excessive, for the intended
purpose of identification or advertisement. With respect to all signs, it is
specifically intended, among other things, to reduce visibility blockages for
motorists and pedestrians, avoid excessive visual competition and clutter among
sign displays that distract motorists and pedestrians, and to reduce the
negative aesthetic impact on the city from excessive signage. The regulations
contained in this section are the minimum amount of regulations necessary to
achieve its purpose.
   (C)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the substitution
or display of a non-commercial message on any permitted sign. All violations of
this subchapter shall be subject to the penalties set forth in §
155.999.

§ 155.153 PERMITS.
   (A)   Permits, applications, plans, specifications and revocation.
      (1)   Permits generally.
         (a)   It shall be unlawful for any person to erect, re-erect, repair,
alter, paint or relocate, reconstruct or reface, on the same or another
premises or to maintain within the city, any sign as defined in this section
unless a permit shall have been first obtained from the city and a permit fee
paid in accordance with the fee schedule adopted by resolution of the City
Council.
         (b)   This section shall not be construed to prevent repair or
restoration of any part of an existing sign when said sign is less than 50%
destroyed or damaged by storm or other accidental emergency, and when the
Building Official has ordered said repair or restoration of the sign to return
that sign to a safe condition. If a sign is to be repaired or restored under
this exception, the sign message must remain the same. If the sign copy will be
changed, a sign permit is required.
      (2)   Application. Application for sign permits shall be made upon forms
provided by the city for this purpose and shall contain the following
information:
         (a)   Name, address and telephone number of applicant(s).
         (b)   Location and dimensions of the building, structure or lot to
which the sign is to be attached or erected.
         (c)   Position of the sign in relation to nearby buildings,
structures, property lines and rights-of-way, existing or proposed.
         (d)   Two copies of the plans and specifications with color renderings
and showing the method of construction and attachment to the building or in the
ground.
         (e)   Copies of stress sheets and calculations if deemed necessary by
the Building Official, showing the structure as designed for dead load and wind
pressure in accordance with the regulations adopted by the City of Hamtramck.
         (f)   Name, address and phone number and license information of the
sign erector.
         (g)   Insurance policy as required herein.
         (h)   Such other information as may be required by the Building
Official to show full compliance with this and other applicable laws of the
City of Hamtramck and State of Michigan.
         (i)   The Building Official may require that the application
containing the aforesaid material shall, in addition, bear the certificate or
seal of a registered structural or civil engineer as a condition to the
issuance of a permit.
         (j)   Indicate the zoning district in which the sign is located.
      (3)   Insurance requirements. Permits may be issued to sign erectors only
under the following conditions:
         (a)   Insurance certificates. Before a permit is issued for the
erection of any sign which overhangs any public property or right-of-way, the
installing company shall submit for filing with the Community Development
Department a certificate of insurance, in a form acceptable to the city, for
public liability in the amount of $100,000 for injuries to one person and
$300,000 for injuries to more than one person, and property damage insurance in
the amount of $25,000 for damage to any city property due to the actions of
himself or any of his or her agents or employees.
         (b)   Lapsing of insurance. At any time, the insurance of any sign
erector is permitted to lapse, his or her contractor registration shall
automatically be revoked.
         (c)   Notification of change. A sign erector shall notify the city of
any change in address, and if a firm or corporation, any change in ownership or
management if other than that indicated on the insurance certificates.
      (4)   Permit insurance and revocation. All rights and privileges acquired
under the provisions of this section, or any amendment thereto, are mere
licenses and may be revoked by the city upon violation of this section.
         (a)   Compliance. Except as provided herein, permits are required for
all signs. All signs shall be inspected for compliance at the time of
installation. If work indicated to be done on the application for permit has
not been started within three months the permit will expire and become null and
void.
         (b)   Concealed work. All work shall remain accessible and exposed for
inspection until approved. It shall be the duty of the permit applicant to
cause said work to remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes.
Neither the Building Official nor the jurisdiction shall be liable for any
expense entailed in the removal or replacement of any material required to
allow inspection.
         (c)   Removal of signs. Should any sign be found unsafe, insecure,
improperly constructed or not in accordance with the requirements of this
section, the erector and/or owner shall be required to make the sign safe,
secure and otherwise in compliance with the requirements of this section within
ten days of notice. Failure to comply shall result in an order to remove the
sign, with costs charged to the permit holder, within 48 hours from the time of
notification in writing. Exception: Existing signs determined to be unsafe and
an immediate hazard to health or safety shall be removed or repaired at the
owner's expense within 48 hours of notification by the Building Official.
   (B)   Permit fees. All fees for permits or services shall be established by
resolution of the City Council.
   (C)   Signs not requiring a permit. Signs not requiring a permit shall be
exempt from the provisions of this section. Such exemptions, however, shall not
be construed to relieve the owner of the sign from responsibility for its
proper location, erection and maintenance as described in this subchapter.

§ 155.154 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Changes to signs. No sign shall be structurally altered, enlarged,
relocated, repaired or refaced except in conformity to the provisions herein
and until a proper permit if required, has been secured. The maintenance of
moveable parts or electrical components of an approved sign shall not be deemed
a structural alteration.
   (B)   Conformance to codes. Any sign hereinafter erected shall conform to
the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of the State Construction Code,
and any other ordinances of the city.
   (C)   Signs in rights-of-way. No signs other than public signs shall be
erected on any public sidewalk or public way, unless specifically authorized by
this chapter.
   (D)   Projections over public ways. Signs projecting over public walkways
shall be permitted to do so up to 18 inches at a minimum height of eight feet
from grade level to the bottom of the sign. Signs, architectural projections,
or sign structures projecting over vehicular access areas shall conform to the
minimum height clearance limitations imposed by the city for such structures.
   (E)   Traffic visibility. No sign or sign structure shall be erected at the
intersection of any street in such a manner as to obstruct the free and clear
vision, nor at any location if, by its position, shape, or color, it may
interfere with or obstruct the view of or be confused with any authorized
traffic sign, signal, or device.
   (F)   Computation of frontage. Frontage shall be determined by the width of
the building wall of the space occupied by the business advertised on the side
facing the street on which it is addressed. If a premise borders more than one
street the sign area(s) for each building wall facing a street shall be
computed separately based on the building frontage. The sign area(s) thus
calculated shall be permitted to be applied to permitted signs placed on each
separate wall.
   (G)   Maintenance, repair, and removal. Every sign permitted by this chapter
shall be kept in good condition and repair. When any sign becomes insecure, in
danger of falling, or is otherwise deemed unsafe by the code official, or if
any sign shall be unlawfully installed, erected, or maintained in violation of
any provision of this chapter, the owner thereof or the person or firm using
the sign shall, upon written notice by the code official immediately in the
case of immediate danger, and in any case within not more than ten days, make
such sign conform to the provisions of this chapter, or shall remove it. If
within ten days the order is not complied with, the code official may issue a
citation for violation of this section.
   (H)   Nonconforming signs.
      (1)   Intention. It is the intention of this section to encourage
eventual elimination of signs that, because of the adoption of this chapter,
become nonconforming. It is considered as much a subject of health, safety, and
welfare as the prohibition of new signs in violation of this section. It is the
intention, therefore, to administer this section to realize the removal of
illegal, nonconforming signs and to avoid any unreasonable invasion of
established private property rights by providing for removal of nonconforming
signs.

hereafter existing which is not maintained in good condition shall be removed.
   (I)   Lighting. Internal and external lighting shall be permitted, but the
illumination thereof shall not be anything other than a steady, continuously
burning bulb or light. The movement, flashing or illusion of flashing, or
turning on and off the sign illumination or of any bulb or component part
thereof is prohibited. In no case shall any sign illumination cause an increase
in the ambient light level at the property line of any adjacent residential-
zoned property. No sign shall be illuminated by other than electrical means and
electrical devices and wiring shall be installed in accordance with the
requirements of the Michigan Electrical Code. All electrically illuminated
signs shall be certified as to wiring and devices by the electrical inspector
and all wiring and accessory electrical equipment shall conform to the

SITE PLAN REVIEW REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES
§ 155.165 GENERAL.
   (A)   Scope. 
      (1)   In every zoning district, no building or structure shall be
demolished or razed, except for dangerous or condemned buildings, erected,
converted to other use, or structurally altered, except as may be otherwise
provided in this chapter, until Common Council has reviewed and approved a site
plan for such use. Each action taken with respect to site plan review and
approval shall be duly recorded in the minutes of Common Council. One and two-
family residential structures shall be exempted from the application of the
provisions of this section.
      (2)   The Building Code Official or their designee may administratively
approve applications to modify previously approved site plans, or site plans
which renovate, expand or convert the use of buildings or site improvements
which legally existed prior to the adoption of this section, which meet all of
the following standards:
         (a)   The modification would comply with all other requirements of
this chapter and other applicable regulations;
         (b)   The modification would comply with all previously imposed
conditions of approval, if any;
         (c)   The modification would not otherwise increase the overall scale
or intensity of the use in a way that would have a material adverse effect on
adjacent properties, natural features, public streets or public services;
         (d)   The modification would not increase by more than 20% any or all
of the following characteristics of the property: the total floor area of
building(s); the total residential occupancy; or the total number of parking
spaces provided;
         (e)   The modification would not decrease by more than 10% any of the
principal building setbacks from the perimeter of the property; and
         (f)   The modification would not materially alter more than 20% of the
architectural style, façade materials to be used, or other architectural
features and adornments of the street front façade wall area in any way other
than in compliance with the requirements of the zoning ordinance.
   (B)   Purpose. The purpose of site plan review is to provide flexibility in
the placement and interrelationship of the buildings and uses within each
building site subject to plan approval, and to provide for the implementation
of design concepts while at the same time maintaining the overall intensity of
land use, density of population, and amounts of light, air, access and
landscaped open space as required in this chapter. The objectives of site plan
review are to:
      (1)   Discourage monotonous, drab, unsightly, dreary and inharmonious
developments, and poor quality;
      (2)   Conserve the city's natural beauty and visual character and charm
by ensuring that structures, signs, and other improvements are properly related
to their sites, and to surrounding sites and structures, with due regard to the
aesthetic qualities of the natural terrain and landscaping, and that proper
attention is given to exterior appearance of structures, signs, and other
improvements;
      (3)   Stabilize and improve property values and prevent blighted areas;
      (4)   Foster civic pride and community spirit so as to improve the
quality and quantity of citizen participation in local government and in
community growth, change and improvement;
      (5)   Sustain the comfort, health, tranquility, and contentment of
residents and attract new residents by reason of the city's favorable
environment; and
      (6)   Provide for consultation and cooperation between the developer and
the Commission so that both parties might realize maximum utilization of land
and minimum adverse effects upon the surrounding area.

§ 155.166 SITE PLAN REVIEW PROCESS.
   (A)   Scope. The city has established a two-tier site plan review process:
preliminary site plan review and final site plan review. This process has been
established so that an applicant can receive city comments on the general
conformity of a proposed site plan to city requirements before preparing a
complete package of engineering, drawings, landscape plans, construction
details, etc. Questions regarding this process may be directed to Building Code
Official or Common Council.
   (B)   Preliminary site plan review.
      (1)   Scope. A site plan submitted to the city for preliminary site plan
review shall contain all of the information set forth in the preliminary site
plan data checklist included in this section. Adequate engineering data to
establish engineering feasibility of utilities proposed is required, however,
detailed engineering plans and detailed landscaping plans are optional at this
stage in the process.
      (2)   Fees. A fee as determined from time to time by resolution of the
Common Council shall accompany any application for site plan approval,
preliminary or final. Such fee may be utilized by the city to determine if the
development shall conform to the applicable city ordinances, policies and
standards, and for investigation and report of any objectionable elements.

applicant may then proceed to the final site plan review process described
below.
         (b)   Conditional approval. Upon determination of the Common Council
that a plan is in compliance except for minor required revisions, preliminary
site plan approval, conditional upon such revisions being made, shall be
granted and that the required changes shall be stated in writing. The applicant
may then proceed to the final site plan review process described below,
provided that the required changes are incorporated in the final site plan.
         (c)   Denial. If extensive revisions to the preliminary site plan are
necessary to meet applicable standards and requirements, preliminary site plan
approval shall be denied and the applicant requested to provide an alternative
site plan. In this case, "DENIED" shall be written on the plan and the reasons
for denial indicated in writing. If the applicant desires to prepare an
alternative plan, the same procedures as outlined above beginning with

SPECIAL LAND USE REVIEW REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES
§ 155.185 GENERAL.
   (A)   Intent. The formulation and enactment of this chapter is based upon
the division of the city into districts, in each of which are specified
permitted uses which are mutually compatible. In addition to such permitted
uses, however, there are certain other uses which may be necessary or desirable
to allow in certain locations in certain districts; but because of their actual
or potential impacts on neighboring uses or public facilities, there is a need
to carefully regulate them with respect to their location for the protection of
the community. These uses, due to their peculiar locational need or the nature
of the service offered may have to be established in a district where they
cannot be reasonably allowed as a permitted use.
   (B)   Authority. The Commission shall have the sole power to approve or
disapprove all special land uses. In consideration of all applications for
special land use, the Commission shall review each case individually as to its
appropriateness and consider the following standards as it relates to the
proposed land use. Such uses shall be subject to conditions, restrictions, and
safeguards deemed necessary to the interest of public health, safety, and
welfare.
(Ord. 497, passed 2-3-2004; Am. Ord. 523, passed 6-13-2006; Am. Ord. 2011-7,
passed 12-13-2011; Am. Ord. 2019-02, passed 10-8-2019; Am. Ord. 2020-28, passed
3-3-2020; Am. Res. 2021-46, passed 4-13-2021)
§ 155.186 SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Fee required. A fee for services shall be charged. All fees for
special land use requests shall be established by resolution of the Common
Council during the adoption of the annual budget and which shall be paid when
the application for special land use approval is filed.
   (B)   Application. An application for the approval of a special land use
shall be made by an owner, lessee, or other person with a legal interest in the
property and who has the owner's consent to file the application. The
application form shall contain such information as the Building Code Official
or Plan Commission may require. The necessary fees shall accompany such
application. The applicant shall also submit a color photograph of the site and
existing front elevation for each special land use request submitted to the
city for review. Such photographs shall be submitted with the application. With
the application, the applicant shall submit the requisite number of folded site
plans as required by this chapter. The application shall not be considered
received by the city until all required application conditions are met.
   (C)   Notification required.
      (1)   Process. Upon receipt of an application for a special land use, one
notice that a request for special land use has been received shall be published
in a newspaper of general circulation in the city and shall be sent by mail or
personal delivery to the owners of property for which approval is being
considered, to all persons to whom real property is assessed within 300 feet of
the boundary of the property in question, and to the occupants of all
structures within 300 feet, except that the notice shall be given at least 15
days before the application shall be considered. If the name of the occupant is
not known, the term "occupant" may be used in making notification. Notification
need not be given to more than one occupant of a structure, except that if a
structure contains more than one dwelling unit or spatial area owned or leased
by different individuals, partnerships, businesses or organizations, one
occupant of each unit or spatial area shall receive notice. In the case of a
single structure containing more than four dwelling units, or other distinct
spatial areas owned or leased by different individuals, partnerships,
businesses, or organizations, notice may be given to the manager or owner of
the structure who shall be requested to post the notice at the primary entrance
to the structure.
      (2)   Content. The notice shall describe the nature of the special land
use request; indicate the property that is the subject of the special land use
request; state when and where the special land use request shall be considered;
indicate when and where written comments shall be received concerning the
request; indicate that a public hearing on the special land use request may be
requested by a property owner or the occupant of a structure located within 300
feet of the boundary of the property being considered for a special use.
   (D)   Request for public hearing. At the initiative of the Commission, upon
the request of the applicant for special land use authorization, or upon the
request of a property owner of a structure located within 300 feet of the
boundary of the property being considered for a special land use, a public
hearing with notification as required for a notice of a request for special
land use approval as prescribed above shall be held before a decision is made
on the special land use request, which request is based on discretionary
grounds. If the applicant or the Commission requests a public hearing, only
notification of the public hearing need be made. A decision on a special land
use request which is based on discretionary grounds shall not be made unless
notification of the request for special land use or notification of a public
hearing on a special land use request is given as required by this section.

§ 155.187 STANDARDS.
   (A)   General standards. The following general standards shall be applied by
the Commission to all special land use requests:
      (1)   The proposed special land use shall be of such location, size, and
character that it shall be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly
development of the surrounding neighborhood and vicinity and applicable
regulations of the zoning district (including but not limited to any applicable
performance standards) in which it is to be located.
      (2)   The proposed use shall be of a nature that shall make vehicular and
pedestrian traffic no more hazardous than is normal for the district involved,
taking into consideration vehicular turning movements in relations to routes of
traffic flow, proximity and relationship to intersections, adequacy of sight
distances, location and access of off-street parking, and provisions for
pedestrian traffic, with particular attention to minimizing child-vehicle
interfacing.
      (3)   The proposed use shall be designed as to the location, size,
intensity, site layout, and periods of operation of any such proposed use to
eliminate any possible nuisance emanating therefrom which might be noxious to
the occupants of any other nearby permitted uses, whether by reason of dust,
noise, fumes, vibration, smoke, or lights.
      (4)   The proposed use shall be such that the proposed location and
height of buildings or structures and location, nature, and height of walls,
fences, and landscaping shall not interfere with or discourage the appropriate
development and use of adjacent land and buildings or unreasonably affect their
value.
      (5)   The proposed use shall relate harmoniously with the physical and
economic aspects of adjacent land uses.
      (6)   The proposed use offers a service or benefit for the public
convenience at the proposed location.
      (7)   The proposed use is so designed, located, planned, and to be
operated that the public health, safety, and welfare shall be protected.
      (8)   The proposed use shall not be detrimental or injurious to the
neighborhood within which it is to be located, nor shall such use operate as a
deterrent to future land uses permitted within the zoning district, and shall
be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter.
      (9)   Consideration will be given to the hours of operation of the
proposed use. Approval of a special land use may be conditioned upon operation
within specified hours considered appropriate to ensure minimal impact on
surrounding uses.
      (10)   Consideration will be given to compatibility with the Master Plan.
The proposed special land use shall be consistent with the general principles
and objectives of the adopted Hamtramck Master Plan.
      (11)   Consideration will be given to public services. The proposed use
shall not exceed the capacity of existing and available public services,
including, but not limited to, utilities, public roads, and police and fire
services. Provision of stormwater management or green infrastructure on-site
over and above the specific requirements of this chapter may be required as a
condition of a special use approval.
   (B)   Eligible uses and activities. The following additional standards shall
be applied by the Commission to uses if authorized as a special land use in a
district:
      (1)   Commercial zones. Light manufacturing uses shall not be directly

one on-site parking location per each rented unit and that a boarding house
shall have no more than four rented units.
         (c)   “Commercial, light” in the R District shall exclude overnight
stay, 24-hour emergency and 24-hour urgent care facilities.
         (d)   Commercial uses in R may be permitted if the gross floor area

combined number of automotive self-service stations and automotive service
stations within the city does not exceed five, and the use shall be on a lot

§ 155.188 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE COMMISSION.
   (A)   Conditions. The Commission, before approving a special land use
request, shall determine that the conditions set for the special land use have
been satisfied unless the Board has granted a variance for such conditions. The
Commission may deny, approve, or approve with conditions, requests for a
special land use. The Commission may impose such conditions or limitations in
granting approval as may be permitted by state law and this chapter if the
Commission deems conditions necessary to fulfill the spirit or purpose of this
chapter. The conditions imposed with respect to the approval of a land use or
activity shall be recorded in the record of the approval action and shall
remain unchanged except upon the mutual consent of the Commission and the
landowner. The Commission shall maintain a record of changes granted in
conditions. The conditions may include, conditions necessary to ensure that
public services and facilities affected by a proposed land use or activity
shall be capable of accommodating increased service and facility loads caused
by the land use or activity, to protect the natural environment, to conserve
natural resources and energy, to ensure compatibility with adjacent uses of
land, and to promote the use of land in a socially and economically desirable
manner. Conditions imposed shall do all the following:
      (1)   Be designed to protect natural resources, the health, safety, and
welfare, as well as the social and economic well-being of those who shall use
the land use or activity under consideration, residents and landowners
immediately adjacent to the proposed land use or activity, and the community as
a whole;
      (2)   Be related to the valid exercise of the police power and purposes
which are affected by the proposed use or activity;
      (3)   Be necessary to meet the intent and purpose of the zoning
regulations, be related to the standards established in this chapter for the
land use or activity under consideration, and be necessary to ensure compliance
with those standards.
   (B)   Decision.
      (1)   General. The Commission shall deny, approve, or approve with
conditions requests for a special land use. The Commission shall approve the
any special land use request when the applicant demonstrates that all of the
standards contained in this chapter have been met. The basis of a decision for
a special land use shall be incorporated in a statement of conclusions relative
to the special land use under consideration. The decision shall specify the
basis of the decision, and any condition imposed. Any changes in the conditions
shall be filed with the Wayne County Register of Deeds as provided herein.
      (2)   Approval. If the particular special land use is in compliance with
the standards set forth in this chapter, the requirements specific to the
particular zoning district in which the special land use is proposed, and the
conditions imposed under this chapter, the special land use request shall be
approved. Upon approval of a special land use, the applicant shall submit a
site plan under this chapter. Subsequent amendments to an approved site plan
for a special land use shall not require Commission approval unless the
amendments significantly impact factors considered by the Commission in
approving the special land use, as determined by the Building Code Official.
Thereafter, the Building Code Official shall issue a building permit in
conformity with the particular special land use so approved. In all cases where
a particular special land use has been granted as provided herein, application
for a building permit in pursuance thereof shall be made and received by the
city not later than one year thereafter or such approval shall automatically be
revoked. The Building Code Official may grant an extension thereof for good
cause shown under such terms and conditions and for such period of time not
exceeding six months as he or she shall determine to be necessary and
appropriate. Any special land use that is discontinued or abandoned for a
period exceeding one year shall have its approval revoked. No special land use
approval shall be effective until a notice of such approval, including all
applicable conditions, are filed with the Wayne County Register of Deeds. Any
subsequent changes to a special land use shall also be filed with the Wayne
County Register of Deeds.
      (3)   Denial. If the Commission shall determine that the particular
special land use(s) requested does not meet the standards of this chapter or
otherwise shall tend to be injurious to the public health, safety, welfare or
orderly development of the city, the Commission shall deny the application in
writing which clearly sets forth the reason(s) for such denial in its minutes.
      (4)   Appeal. Any person who is denied a special land use request by the
Commission may appeal the decision to the Board. In hearing the appeal, the
Board shall examine the record of the Commission and determine if the
Commission properly applied the conditions established by this chapter. If the
Board determines that the Commission properly applied the conditions
established by this chapter, then the Board shall uphold the decision of the
Commission. If the Board determines that the Commission failed to properly
apply the conditions established by this chapter, then the Board shall so state
the perceived deficiency and remand the request to the Commission for further
examination.

   (A)   Violation of law. It shall be unlawful for any person to erect,
construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, remove, convert, demolish,
equip, use, occupy, or maintain any building or land or cause or permit the
aforementioned to be done in violation of this chapter. When any building or
parcel of land regulated by this chapter is being used contrary to this
chapter, the code official shall be permitted to order such use discontinued
and the structure, parcel of land, or portion thereof, vacated by notice served
on any person causing such use to be discontinued. Such person shall
discontinue the use within the time prescribed by the code official after
receipt of such notice to make the structure, parcel of land, or portion
thereof, comply with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Nuisance declaration. Any building or structure which is erected,
altered, or converted or any use of premises or land which is begun or changed
after the time of passage of this chapter and in violation of any of the
provisions thereof is declared to be a public nuisance per se and shall be
abated by order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (C)   Infraction type.
      (1)   Municipal civil infraction. Any person, firm, or corporation who
violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with any provision of
this chapter shall be punished for a municipal civil infraction. Each day that
a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.
      (2)   Misdemeanor. Any person, firm, or corporation who violates,
disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with any provision of this
chapter for any time after the second repeat offense (third offense), then such

   (D)   Sanctions. The sanction for a violation which is a municipal civil
infraction shall be a civil fine in the amount as prescribed by resolution of
the Common Council, plus any costs, damages, expenses, and other sanctions as
authorized under Chapter 87 of Act No. 236 of the Public Acts of 1961, as

prosecution, or by imprisonment for a period not exceeding 90 days, or by both
fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court. Each day that a
