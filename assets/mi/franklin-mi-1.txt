EDITOR'S NOTE
         The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is consistent
with the best accepted practice for codification. Each section is self-
identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For example, 238.02
indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238 (or the 38th
chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code and chapter
numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the first
two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the first two
digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right of the
decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4, the
chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
         With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded
almost endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99. Newly created sections subsequent to the original
codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event
the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For
example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063 follow 660.06 and precede
660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
         Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law
contained in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to
either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at
that time, or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections
without histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are
or contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
         The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of
every ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It
indicates whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another
into one section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct
the user to subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a
given chapter.

INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM
   Section 1. Any ordinance which may legally be adopted by the Council of the
Village of Franklin may be proposed by petition signed by a number of
registered electors of the Village of Franklin equal in number to at least ten
(10) per cent of the number of registered electors in the Village as certified
by the Village Clerk. Such petition shall be addressed to the Council and shall
set forth at length the ordinance proposed to be enacted. With each signature
attached thereto, there shall be given the street and house number of the
residence of the elector so signing, and the date when such signature was
attached. The petition may be signed on separate identical forms, but all
signed counterparts of the petition shall be filed with the Village Clerk at
one (1) and the same time. An affidavit made by a registered elector of the
Village shall be attached to each signed counterpart of the petition, which
shall state that each signature appearing on the counterpart is the genuine
signature of the person of whom it purports to be, and that to the best of
affiant's knowledge and belief, the signers whose names are attached thereto
are registered electors of the Village of Franklin.
   Section 2. Said petition, when signed by the requisite number of registered
electors, shall be filed with the Village Clerk. Such Clerk shall attach
thereto a certificate, setting forth the name and address of the person or
persons filing the said petition in his or her office and the date when said
petition was filed. A copy of said petition, exclusive of signature, and of
said certificate shall be entered in a record book to be kept for that purpose
in the office of the Village Clerk.
   Section 3. Within fifteen (15) days from the date of the filing of said
petition with the Village Clerk, it shall be the duty of such Clerk to
ascertain by comparison of said petition with the registration records of the
Village of Franklin, whether or not such petition is signed by the requisite
number of registered electors, and following such examination, the Clerk shall
attach to said petition his or her certificate showing the result of such
examination.
   Section 4. If the certificate of the Village Clerk so attached shows the
petition to be insufficient, he or she shall within ten (10) days cause notice
in writing, setting forth the fact that such petition is found to be
insufficient to be served upon at least one (1) of the persons designated in
the certificate attached by him or her to said petition as the persons who
filed said petition in his or her office. Depositing the said notice in the
United States mail, addressed to such person at the address shown on the
certificate provided in Section 2 of this chapter, shall be deemed sufficient
service. Additional signatures to said petition, properly verified as
hereinbefore provided, may be filed with the Village Clerk at any time within
twenty (20) days from the date of the service of such notice. The Village Clerk
shall attach his or her certificate to such additional typed counterparts of
the petition showing the date when the same were filed, and shall cause said
certificate to be entered in the record book along with the original record of
the petition and certificate. The Village Clerk shall, within five (5) days
after filing of such additional signatures, certify to the sufficiency or
insufficiency of the additional signatures. If the number of signatures is
still shown to be insufficient, or if no additional signatures are so filed,
such petition shall be deemed to be of no effect. A new petition for the same
purpose, however, may be later filed.
   Section 5. When the petition shall be found by the Village Clerk to be
sufficient, he or she shall so certify to the Council at its next regular
meeting.
   Section 6. If such petition shall be signed by the required number of
registered electors of the Village, the Council shall, within twenty (20) days
after the meeting at which such petition is submitted to it, either:
   (1)    Pass said ordinance without alteration subject to the referendum
provided by this Charter, or
   (2)   Reject said ordinance and submit the same without alteration to vote
of the qualified electors of the Village at the next regular or special
election occurring not less than fifty (50) days from the date of such
rejection by the Council; provided, however, that the Council may, by a five-
sixths (5/6) vote of the Trustees, call a special election for the purpose of
submitting such ordinance, the same to be held not less than fifty (50) days
after the rejection of such ordinance by the Council.
   Section 7. Within thirty (30) days after the publication of any ordinance
duly passed by the Council, a petition may be presented to the Council by
filing the same with the Village Clerk, protesting against such ordinance
continuing in effect. Said petition shall contain the text of such ordinance
and shall be signed by registered electors of the Village equal in number to at
least ten (10) per cent of the number of registered electors in the Village as
certified by the Village Clerk. Said ordinance shall thereupon and thereby be
suspended from operation unless the Council shall, by unanimous vote of those
present at its first meeting after the filing of said petition, declare that
such ordinance is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public
health, peace or safety. The Council shall immediately reconsider such
ordinance and if the same be not repealed, the Council shall submit the
question of its approval or disapproval to a vote of the electors of the
Village at the next regular or special election occurring in not less than
fifty (50) days; provided, that the Council, by a five-sixths (5/6) vote of its
members elect, may call a special election for the purpose of submitting such
question, such election to be held in not less than fifty (50) days from the
calling thereof. If a majority of the electors voting thereon at such election
vote in favor thereof, said ordinance shall be deemed to have been approved and
shall be in full force and effect; otherwise it shall be null and void. The
procedure in regard to such petition of protest and referendum shall be the
same as provided in this chapter for the initiative and referendum on a
proposed ordinance with such modification as the nature of the case may
require.
   Section 8. The Council may, of its own motion, submit to a referendum for
adoption or rejection at any regular or special election held in said Village
for any proposed ordinance, in the same manner and with the same force and
effect as provided in this chapter for submission on petition. No such
ordinance shall be submitted, however, at any election to be held less than
fifty (50) days from the date of the meeting of the Council at which such
ordinance is ordered submitted.
   Section 9. If the provisions of two (2) or more proposed ordinances adopted
or approved at the same election are inconsistent, then the ordinance receiving
the highest affirmative vote shall prevail.
   Section 10. Whenever any ordinance is submitted to the voters of the Village
at any election, the Council shall cause such ordinance to be published by
inserting the same in full at least once in a newspaper of general circulation
in the Village or published by posting the same in ten (10) conspicuous places
in the Village, such publication to be made not less than ten (10) days before
the election.
   Section 11. The ballot or ballot labels used when voting upon such ordinance
shall be provided in accordance with law, and shall state the nature of the
ordinance in terms sufficient to identify it. If a majority of the qualified
electors voting on the proposed ordinance shall vote in favor thereof, the same
shall thereupon become an ordinance of the Village.
   Section 12. An ordinance adopted by the electors through initiatory
proceedings may not be amended or repealed by the Council for one (1) year
after the date of the election at which it was adopted. An ordinance repealed
by the electors may not be re-enacted by the Council for one (1) year after the
date of the election at which it was repealed.

assessed therein and such duplicate tax roll shall thereupon become the
official record of the Village.
(Amended 3-11-02)
   Section 8. Village taxes shall be due on the first day of July of the year
when levied and shall be payable as stated in the warrant of the Village
President annexed to said roll. After the delivery of the tax roll to the

persons named therein. Failure to mail or receive any such statement shall not
excuse the non-payment of any tax.
(Amended 3-11-02)
   Section 9. The Village taxes when assessed shall become at once a debt to
the Village from the person to whom they are assessed, and the amounts assessed
on any interest in real property shall, on the first day of July of the year
when assessed, become a lien upon such real property, and the lien for such
amounts for all interest and charges shall continue until payment thereof. All
personal taxes shall also be a first lien on all personal property of such
persons so assessed, from and after the first day of July of the year when
assessed, and shall so remain until paid, which said lien shall take precedence
over all other claims, encumbrances, and liens upon said personal property
whatsoever, whether created by chattel mortgage, execution, levy, judgment or
otherwise, and whether arising before or after the assessment of said personal
taxes, and no transfer of personal property assessed for taxes thereon shall
operate to divest or destroy such lien, except where such personal property is
actually sold in the regular course of retail trade.
(Amended 3-11-02)
   Section 10. If the Village Treasurer has been unable to collect any of the
Village taxes on said roll on real property before the first day of March
following the date when said roll was received by him or her, then it shall be
his or her duty to return all such unpaid taxes on real property to the County
Treasurer in the same manner and with like effect as returns by township
treasurers of state and county taxes. Such returns shall include all the
additional charges hereinbefore provided, which charges shall in such return be
added to the amount assessed in said roll against each description. The taxes
thus returned shall be collected in the same manner as other taxes returned to
such County Treasurer are collected under the provisions of the general laws of
the State, and the same rate of interest and all charges shall be collected
thereon, and all taxes upon land so returned as delinquent shall be and remain
a lien thereon until paid.
(Amended 3-11-02)
   Section 11. It shall be the duty of the Village Treasurer, upon request made
by any party, to issue his or her certificate showing all unpaid taxes, and
other charges which are a lien upon any specified property, and which are
payable at his or her office, and he or she may, upon being authorized by the
Village Council, charge the party requesting the same such sum as the Council
shall establish for each parcel. The issuance of such certificate shall not
create any liability upon the part of the Village or the Village Treasurer,
except that in the event of fraud on the part of the Village Treasurer in the
issuance thereof he or she shall be liable therefor.
(Amended 3-11-02)
   Section 12. The Village Clerk, after the Council has determined the several
amounts which it requires to be raised by general tax for the several funds of
the Village, and the aggregate thereof, shall certify the same to the Village
Treasurer. When such general taxes shall be received by the Village Treasurer,
they shall be apportioned to the several funds of the Village pro rated
according to the several amounts of said funds so certified.
(Amended 3-11-02)
   Section 13. Money may be borrowed in anticipation of receipts from taxes for
the payment of current expenses or to fund deficiencies in current revenue, by
the issue of notes, but the aggregate amount of such loans at any time
outstanding shall not exceed the total of such unpaid taxes outstanding. All
such loans shall be subject to the provisions of the laws of the State in
relation thereto. No temporary loans authorized by this section shall be made
without approval of four (4) of the members of the Council.

within the Village shall be defrayed by a special assessment upon the property
especially benefited.
(Ord. 16. Passed 7-16-62.)
208.02.   INITIATION OF PROCEEDINGS.
   Special assessment proceedings may be initiated by the Council or by a

the proposed construction or improvement, an estimate of the life of the

208.05.   SETTING OF PUBLIC HEARING ON NECESSITY.
   Either at the time of its direction to the Road Administrator to prepare his
or her report, or after the report of the Road Administrator has been filed
with the Village Clerk, the Council shall, by resolution, establish a date for
a public hearing on necessity, which hearing shall be not less than ten days
after notice thereof has been given as hereinafter provided. (Ord. 16. Passed
7-16-62.)
208.06.   NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING.
   Notice of hearings held pursuant to this chapter shall be in the form
approved by the Council, which form of notice shall specify the names of the
highways, streets or alleys to be constructed or improved, in whole or in part,
and shall describe by lot and subdivision, by metes and bounds or by boundary
streets, or a combination thereof, the special assessment district within which
are located the properties especially benefited; provided, however, that such
description of the district shall not be required in the notice of the hearing

or to the special assessment district by any person to be affected by the
proposed construction or improvement. The hearing may be adjourned from time to
time by announcement and without the necessity for further notice by
publication or mail, and the Council may make any changes in the proposed work
or the assessment district which shall seem reasonable or proper and in the
best interest of the Village; provided, however, that the construction or
improvement shall not be enlarged or extended, nor shall the proposed
assessment district be enlarged, without another public hearing being held
after the giving of notice thereof in the manner as above provided.
(Ord. 16. Passed 7-16-62.)
208.08.   COUNCIL DETERMINATION OF NECESSITY.
   After the public hearing provided for in Section

shall establish the district which is to be especially benefited and upon which
special assessments shall be levied, shall provide for the manner in which the
assessment is to be levied by the Township Assessor and shall direct the
Assessor to spread the roll. The Council may also provide in such resolution
that a portion of the cost of such construction or improvement be paid by the
Village at large. Such resolution shall also provide for the number of
installments in which each assessment may be paid, provided that the total
number of installments shall not exceed fifteen.
(Ord. 16. Passed 7-16-62.)
208.09.   PREPARATION OF ASSESSMENT ROLL.
   Pursuant to Section
208.08, the Township Assessor shall prepare a special assessment roll,
including all parcels of land within the special assessment district designated
by the Council, and shall assess to each parcel of land such portion of the
whole sum to be levied against all the lands in the special assessment district
as the benefit to such lot or parcel of land bears to the total benefit to all
lands in the district. Upon completion of such roll, the Assessor shall attach
thereto his or her certificate to the effect that the assessments have been
made pursuant to the resolution of the Council and the provisions of this
chapter. He or she shall thereupon file said roll with the Village Clerk.
(Ord. 16. Passed 7-16-62.)
208.10.   SETTING OF HEARING ON ASSESSMENT ROLL.
   Upon the filing of an assessment roll, as provided in Section
208.09, the Council shall by resolution fix the time and place of a hearing
when it will meet and review such roll, which hearing shall be held not less
than ten days after notice thereof has been given as provided in Section
208.06.
(Ord. 16. Passed 7-16-62.)
208.11.   COUNCIL DETERMINATION ON ASSESSMENT ROLL.
   At the hearing provided for in Section
208.10, the Council shall review the assessment roll and may confirm it with
such corrections as may have been made, if any, may refer it back to the
Township Assessor for revision or may vote to abandon any further proceedings
in connection therewith. If, at or prior to the hearing on the confirmation of
any special assessment roll, written objections to such special assessments are
made by the owners of property which will bear fifty percent of the cost of the
proposed construction or improvement, the same shall not be made and the
special assessment roll shall not be confirmed unless approved by at least four
of the members elect of the Village Council, exclusive of the President. After
the confirmation, the special assessment roll and all assessments thereon shall
be final and conclusive unless attacked in a court of competent jurisdiction
within thirty days after the date of confirmation.
(Ord. 16. Passed 7-16-62.)
208.12.   INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS.
   The first installment of any special assessment shall become due thirty days
after the adoption of the resolution confirming the roll, and one installment
shall be due every twelve months thereafter, provided that assessments totaling
less than ten dollars ($10.00) shall become due thirty days after the
confirmation of the assessment roll.
(Ord. 16. Passed 7-16-62.)
208.13.   INTEREST, FEES AND PENALTIES.
   The unpaid part of any special assessment shall bear interest at the rate of
six percent from the due date of the first installment until said assessment
shall have been paid in full. The same penalty and fee shall be collected on
delinquent special assessments and upon delinquent installments of such special
assessments as are provided for the collection of delinquent taxes.
(Ord. 16. Passed 7-16-62.)
208.14.   REASSESSMENTS AND REFUNDS.
   Upon the completion of any project, the Road Administrator shall compile the
actual cost of making such construction or improvement and, if the amount
assessed shall not be sufficient to pay that portion of the cost of the
construction or improvement which the Council has determined shall be assessed
against private property, the Council may make an additional assessment upon
all the property in the special assessment district in the same ratio as the
original assessments. If the assessments levied are more than five percent
larger than necessary to defray the cost of the construction or improvement,
then the Council shall, by resolution, order such excess over actual cost to be
refunded to the then owner of any property which has been assessed for the
construction or improvement, provided that refunds shall not be made to any
owner whose share of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00). If any
assessment is declared void or invalid by the Council or a court of competent
jurisdiction, a reassessment against the property may be made.
(Ord. 16. Passed 7-16-62.)
208.15.   SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS AS LIENS.
   Special assessments and all interest, penalties and charges thereon from the
date of confirmation of the assessment roll shall be and remain a lien upon the
property assessed of the same character and effect as a lien created by general
law for State and County taxes or by the Village Charter for Village taxes
until paid. The failure of the owner to receive any notice required to be sent
under this chapter shall not invalidate any special assessment or any special
assessment roll, if such notice was in fact published and mailed as herein
provided. Any failure to give notice as required in this chapter shall not
invalidate an entire assessment roll, but only the assessment on property
affected by the lack of notice. In no case shall any special assessment be
declared invalid as to any property if the owner or party in interest thereof
has actually received notice, has waived notice or has paid any part of the
assessment.
(Ord. 16. Passed 7-16-62.)

other written accounting for the review undertaken, and such written
documentation shall be maintained for inspection by the person providing the
funds.

review, as ultimately determined, the excess shall be returned to the person
who posted the escrow.

civil infraction notices.
   (b)   "Municipal civil infraction" means a violation of any Village

or sanction other than a criminal penalty. A Municipal civil infraction is not
a lesser included offense of a criminal offense or of an ordinance violation
that is not a civil infraction.
   (c)   "Municipal civil infraction determination" means a determination that
a defendant is responsible for a Municipal civil infraction based on one of the
following:
      (1)   An admission of responsibility for the Municipal civil infraction;
      (2)   An admission of responsibility for the Municipal civil infraction,
"with explanation";
      (3)   A preponderance of the evidence at an informal hearing or formal
hearing; or
      (4)   A default judgment for failing to appear at a scheduled appearance.
   (d)   "Municipal civil infraction violation notice" means a written notice
prepared by an authorized enforcement officer directing a person to appear at
the Ordinance Violations Bureau established under this chapter for the purpose
of paying a civil fine and/or costs for a violation which is prescribed to be a
Municipal civil infraction.
   (e)   "Violation" means any act or offense which is prohibited or declared
to be unlawful under any Village ordinance and any omission or failure to act
where such act is required by ordinance. (Ord. 2000-1. Passed 2-7-00.)
212.02   MUNICIPAL CIVIL INFRACTION ACTIONS.
   (a)   Commencement. A Municipal civil infraction action is commenced upon
the issuance by an authorized enforcement officer of either of the following:
      (1)   Citation. A Municipal civil infraction citation directing the
alleged violator to appear in District Court; or
      (2)   Violation notice. A Municipal civil infraction violation notice
directing the alleged violator to appear at the Ordinance Violations Bureau.
   (b)   Citation Form. The form and content of citations used for Municipal
civil infraction violations shall be in accordance with M.C.L.A. 600.8705 and
600.8709.
   (c)   Basis for Issuance. The basis for issuance of a Municipal civil
infraction citation shall be as follows:
      (1)   Witnessed by authorized enforcement officer. An authorized
enforcement officer who witnesses a person violate an ordinance, the violation
of which is a Municipal civil infraction, shall prepare and subscribe, as soon
as possible and as completely as possible, an original and three copies of a
citation unless the officer instead issues a Municipal civil infraction
violation notice pursuant to subsection (e) hereof.
      (2)   Based upon investigation. An authorized enforcement officer may
issue a citation to a person if, based upon investigation, the officer has
reasonable cause to believe that a person is responsible for a Municipal civil
infraction.
      (3)   Based on investigation of complaint by witness. An authorized
enforcement officer may issue a citation to a person if, based upon
investigation of a complaint by someone who allegedly witnessed the person
violate an ordinance, the violation of which is a Municipal civil infraction,
the officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person is responsible for
a Municipal civil infraction and if the Village Attorney approves, in writing,
the issuance of the citation.
   (d)   Filing and Service of Citations. Municipal civil infraction citations
shall be filed with the District Court, and a copy shall be served in the
following manner:
      (1)   Personal service. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (d)(2)
and (3) hereof, the authorized enforcement officer shall personally serve a
copy of the citation upon the alleged violator.
      (2)   Use or occupancy of land; posting. In a Municipal civil infraction
action involving the use or occupancy of land or a building or other structure,
a copy of the citation need not be personally served upon the alleged violator
but may be served upon the owner or occupant of the land, building or structure
by posting the copy on the land or attaching the copy to the building or
structure. In addition, a copy of the citation shall be sent by first class
mail to the owner of the land, building or structure at the owner's last known
address.
      (3)   Processing of citation. A citation served as provided in paragraph
(d)(2) hereof, for a violation involving the use or occupancy of land or a
building or other structure, shall be processed in the same manner as a
citation served personally upon a defendant.
   (e)   Municipal Civil Infraction Violation Notices. An authorized
enforcement officer may issue and serve a Municipal civil infraction violation
notice, instead of a citation, under the same circumstances and in the same
manner as provided for the service of citations. The violation notice shall
indicate the time by which the alleged violator must appear at the Ordinance
Violations Bureau, the means by which a violator may appear, the address and
telephone number of the Ordinance Violations Bureau, the Ordinance Violations
Bureau's hours, the amount of the fine for the violation, and the consequences
for failure to appear or to pay the fine, together with any other information
required by ordinance. (Ord. 2000-1. Passed 2-7-00.)

   (a)   Establishment; Purpose. An Ordinance Violations Bureau is hereby
established for the purpose of accepting admissions of responsibility for
Municipal civil infractions in response to Municipal civil infraction violation
notices issued and served by authorized enforcement officers, and to collect
civil fines and costs prescribed by Village ordinance.
   (b)   Disposition of Payments. Payments made to the Ordinance Violations
Bureau shall be retained and accounted for as fines and costs, respectively,
and shall be deposited in the Village's General Fund.
   (c)   Location; Authority of Village Administrator. The Ordinance Violations
Bureau shall be located in the Village's administrative offices, and shall be
under the supervision and control of the Village Administrator.
   (d)   Authority of Ordinance Violations Bureau.
      (1)   Acceptance of payments. The Ordinance Violations Bureau is
authorized to accept admissions of responsibility for Municipal civil
infractions in response to Municipal civil infraction violation notices, and to
collect civil fines and costs in connection therewith.
      (2)   Non-acceptance of payments where responsibility denied. The
Ordinance Violations Bureau shall not accept payment of a fine or costs from
any person who denies having committed the Municipal civil infraction charged
in a Municipal civil infraction violation notice, or who admits responsibility
only with explanation.
      (3)   No authority to determine responsibility. The Ordinance Violations
Bureau shall not have the authority or jurisdiction to determine, or attempt to
determine, the truth or falsity of any fact or matter relating to an alleged
violation.
   (e)   Disposition of Violations.
      (1)   Alleged violator's options. Any person receiving a Municipal civil
infraction violation notice may dispose of the charge alleged in the notice by
making payment of the fine and/or costs to the Ordinance Violations Bureau;
however, a person shall have the right to elect not to have the violation
processed by the Ordinance Violations Bureau and to instead have the alleged
violation processed in District Court. The unwillingness of any person to
dispose of a violation at the Bureau shall not prejudice the person or in any
way diminish the person's rights, privileges and protection accorded by law.
      (2)   Procedure for processing violations at bureau. A person electing to
have an alleged violation processed at the Ordinance Violations Bureau shall
appear at the Bureau and pay the specified fine and/or costs within the time
specified for appearance in the Municipal civil infraction violation notice.
Appearance may be made by mail, in person or by representation. If appearance
is made by mail, the person charged in the notice shall be responsible for
timely delivery of the fine and/or costs within the time specified in the
Municipal civil infraction violation notice.
      (3)   Procedure where responsibility not admitted or fine not paid. If a
person elects not to admit responsibility or pay the specified civil fine and/
or costs prescribed for an alleged violation, an authorized enforcement officer
may file a Municipal civil infraction citation with the District Court, in
which case a copy of the citation shall be served by first-class mail upon the
person charged with the Municipal civil infraction at the person's last known
address. The citation filed with the Court need not comply in all particulars
with Section
212.02 (b), but shall consist of a sworn complaint containing the allegations
stated in the Municipal ordinance violations notice and shall fairly inform the
defendant how to respond to the citation.
(Ord. 2000-1. Passed 2-7-00.)
212.04   SCHEDULE OF CIVIL FINES.
   (a)   Adoption. A schedule of civil fines payable to the Ordinance
Violations Bureau for admissions of responsibility by persons served with
Municipal civil infraction violation notices shall be adopted from time to time
by resolution of Council.
   (b)   Posting. A copy of the adopted schedule of civil fines shall be posted
at the Ordinance Violations Bureau.

meeting falling upon a legal holiday shall be held on the next following
Monday, at the same hour and place. Council meetings shall be held upon such
premises as the Council may, from time to time, decide, provided, however, that
the premises of the meeting shall always be sufficient to accommodate, insofar
as practical, all members of the public who may wish to attend. The agenda for
each regular meeting of the Council shall be posted at least twenty-four hours
prior to the scheduled time of such meeting.
   Rule 2.   Special meetings of the Council may be called by the President or
any two Trustees upon at least twenty-four hours written notice given to each
member and the Clerk, served personally or left at his or her usual place of
residence, provided,
however, that any special meeting at which all members of the Council are
present shall be a legal meeting for all purposes without such written notice.
The Clerk shall post notice of the date, time, place and agenda of the special
meeting, at least eighteen hours before the convening of the meeting, on the
Village Office bulletin board and, when possible, at up to three other public
places in the Village.
   Rule 3.   All meetings of the Council shall be public. Proposed minutes of
each regular and special meeting shall be available for public inspection
during regular business hours at the Village Offices not more than eight
business days after the date of said meeting. Approved minutes of each meeting

same location, not more than five business days after the meeting at which the

   Rule 8.   These Rules and Robert's Rules of Order (the current edition)
(where Robert's does not conflict with these rules) will comprise the
parliamentary authority for the Council. The Chair shall decide all questions
arising under this parliamentary authority, subject to appeal, by any Council
Trustee, which appeal shall be determined by a majority vote of the Trustees
present. (The form used is: "I appeal from the decision of the Chair.") The
Chair shall preserve order and decorum and may speak to points of order in
preference to other Trustees.
   Rule 9.   After all Council Trustees have had the opportunity to speak, the
Chair may express his or her opinion on any subject under debate without
relinquishing the Chair.
   Rule 10.   Any Trustee desiring to speak shall address the Chair, and, after
his or her right to speak has been granted, shall not be interrupted except by
a point of order raised by another Trustee. When two or more Trustees seek
recognition, the Chair shall name the Trustee who is to speak first. No Trustee
shall speak more than once on the same question unless every Trustee desiring
to speak to that question shall have had the opportunity to do so. No person
other than a Trustee shall address the Council except as otherwise provided
herein.
   PARTICIPATION BY THE PUBLIC
   Rule 11.   The Chair, at his or her discretion and subject to appeal as
provided in Rule 8 hereof, may permit any person to address the Council during

person, may address the Council at the time it is considering public requests.
   Rule 13.   A person addressing the Council shall be requested to state his

subject have had the opportunity to speak.
    Rule 15.   Any person who shall have a specific question for which he or
she desires an answer from the President or any Trustee during consideration of
public requests shall submit the same in writing to the Clerk at least three
days prior to the scheduled date of the meeting. The Clerk shall immediately
transmit the same to those to whom such questions are addressed. The President

a refusal to answer any such question, the reason therefor shall be publicly
stated.

shall be read by the Clerk prior to voting on such motion. At the request of a
Trustee, any motion shall be reduced to writing.
   Rule 17.   The previous question shall be put in this form: "I move the
previous question," and, until decided, such motion shall preclude all
amendments and debate on the main question. Moving the previous question
requires a second and a two- thirds majority of those Trustees present for
passage.
   Rule 18.   A motion to adjourn shall always be in order (except when a vote
is being taken or when a Trustee has the floor), provided that there shall
always be some intervening business proposed between two motions to adjourn.
Motions to adjourn, to lay on the table and to move the previous question, and
all motions relating to questions of order, must be decided without debate.
   Rule 19.   It shall be in order for any Trustee voting in the majority to
move for a reconsideration of the vote on any question at that meeting or at
the next meeting. A motion to reconsider, being considered and lost, shall not
be renewed.
   Rule 20.   Any Trustee may demand a roll call vote, which vote shall be
taken by the Clerk in alphabetical order, and such vote shall be entered in the
minutes of the proceedings.

Charter shall be proposed at a regular or special meeting of the Council, be

operative, be published in accordance with State law and posted in two of the
most public places in the Village.
   MISCELLANEOUS
   Rule 23.   These Rules or any part thereof may be suspended temporarily in
connection with any matter under consideration, except insofar as the same
embody mandatory provisions of the Village Charter, by a majority vote of the
Trustees, as defined in Rule 21.

Trustees, notice having been given in writing of the proposed alteration or
amendment at a previous session.

the Village upon request.
   Rule 26.   A Sergeant at Arms shall be provided for all Council meetings.
   Rule 27.   No Village Trustee shall vote (including abstaining) with regard
to any question, issue or decision wherein said Trustee has knowledge that the
question, issue or decision will provide the Trustee, a member of his or her
immediate family, or a business with which he or she is associated, with direct
or indirect private benefit (financial or otherwise) which is distinguishable
from the benefit to the public or a broad segment of the public.
   Rule 28.   Public requests and comments shall be limited to those items that
do not appear on the meeting's agenda. Public requests and comments on listed
agenda items shall be allowed for a time period of three minutes after
discussion by Council, but before a motion is voted upon.
   Rule 29.    The Fire Marshall and the Chief of Police shall be present at
all regular Council meetings to verbally report to Council on the monthly

   Rule 30.   There will be no smoking in the Broughton House during Council
meetings.
   ELECTRONIC MEETINGS
   Rule 31.   Electronic Meetings Authorized.
   The Village Council may meet and conduct its meetings, in whole or in part,
by electronic means using telephone conferencing or video conferencing
technology without regard to physical place and physical presence requirements,
in accordance with Section 3a of the Open Meetings Act, MCL 15.263a, as
amended, through December 31, 2020.
   Beginning January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, Village Council
meetings may be held, in whole or in part, by electronic means using telephone
conferencing or video conferencing technology due to circumstances requiring
accommodation of any Village Councilmember absent because of military duty, a
medical condition, or when a declared statewide or local state of emergency or
state of disaster exists and the personal health or safety of members of the
public or public body would be at risk if the meeting were held in person. As
used in these Rules, the term "medical condition" means an illness, injury,
disability, or other health-related condition, including the quarantine or
isolation of a Village Councilmember to minimize the spread of a contagious
disease.
   Beginning January 1, 2022 members of the Village Council may participate by
electronic means in Village Council meetings only to accommodate their absence
due to military duty.
   Rule 32.   Conduct of Electronic Meetings.
   An electronic meeting of the Village Council will be conducted in a manner
that permits two-way communication so that members of the Council can hear and
be heard by one another, and so that public participants can hear members of
the Village Council and be heard by both the Council and other public
participants. The Village may use technology to facilitate typed public
comments submitted by members of the public participating in the
electronically-held meeting that shall be read to or shared with members of the
Village Council and other participants.
   As permitted by the Open Meetings Act, a physical place is not required for
an electronically-held meeting. Members of the Village Council and members of
the public participating electronically in a meeting that occurs in a physical
place are considered present and in attendance at the meeting for all purposes.
For a meeting at which Village Councilmembers are physically absent due to
military duty or a medical condition and who are being accommodated by remote
participation, all other Village Councilmembers must be physically present at
the meeting to be able to participate.
   In addition to any other notice required by the Open Meetings Act, advance
notice of an electronically-held meeting shall be posted on a portion of the
Village's website that is fully accessible to the public. The public notice
must be included on either the home page or a separate webpage dedicated to
public notices for non-regularly scheduled or electronically-held public
meetings that is accessible through a prominent and conspicuous link on the
Village's website home page that clearly describes its purpose for public
notification of non-regularly scheduled or electronically-held public meetings.
Any scheduled meeting of the Village Council may be held as an electronic
meeting as permitted by the Open Meetings Act if a notice consistent with this
Rule is posted at least 18 hours before the meeting begins. Any notice of the
meeting of the Village Commission held electronically must clearly contain all
of the following:
   (a)   Why the Village Council is meeting electronically;
   (b)   How members of the public may participate in the meeting
electronically (if a telephone number, internet address or both are required to
participate, that information must be provided in the notice);
   (c)   How members of the public may contact members of the Village Council
to provide input or ask questions on any business that will come before the
Council at the meeting; and
   (d)   How persons with disabilities may participate in the meeting.
   If an agenda exists for an electronically held meeting of the Village
Council, the Village shall, on a portion of its website that is fully
accessible to the public make the agenda of the meeting available to the public
at least two hours before the meeting begins. This publication of the meeting
agenda does not prohibit subsequent amendment of the agenda at the meeting.
   A member of the general public is not required to register or otherwise
provide his or her name or other information or otherwise fulfill a condition
precedent to attend an electronically-held meeting, other than mechanisms
established and required by the Village necessary to permit the individual to
participate in a public comment period of the meeting.
   Members of the general public otherwise participating in an electronically-
held meeting of the Village Council are excluded from participation in a closed
session of the Village Council that is held electronically provided that the
closed session is convened and held in compliance with the requirements of the
Open Meetings Act applicable to closed sessions.
   Rule 33.   Agenda for Regular Business Meetings; Electronic Meetings.
   The order of business for all meetings of the Village Council conducted
electronically and held during through December 31, 2020, and held beginning
January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021 for Village Council meetings held, in
whole or in part, by electronic means using telephone conferencing or video
conferencing technology when a declared statewide or local state of emergency
or state of disaster exists shall be as follows: Call to order; Roll call;
Adoption of agenda; Approval of minutes of previous meeting(s); Reports of
Village officers and agents; Submission of current bills; Public requests and
comments; Unfinished business; New business; and Adjournment. The order of
business outlined in this paragraph is not applicable when electronic means is
used to accommodate the absence of individual Village Councilmembers due to
military duty or a medical condition.
   Rule 34.   Public Comments.
   During Village Council meetings conducted electronically, members of the
public attending the meeting, once recognized by the chair, shall identify
themselves for the record and indicate the municipality where they reside.
Comments by the public will be limited to two minutes for each speaker unless
the time is extended by the chair or by vote of the Council. Comments by the
public during electronic meetings will be restricted to the public requests and
comments portion of the meeting.
   Rule 35.   Councilmember Attendance by Phone/Video.
   A member of the Village Council who anticipates being absent from a meeting
due to the circumstances set forth in the Open Meetings Act and these Rules may
request accommodation of their absence to permit their remote participation in
and voting on Commission business by two-way telephonic or video conferencing
communication. A Village Councilmember who desires to attend a meeting by
telephonic or video conferencing shall inform the Village Administrator, or the
Village Administrator's designee, at least 24 hours before the meeting to
permit any necessary technology to be put in place to accommodate participation
of the absent member. Village Councilmembers attending a meeting by telephone
or video conferencing may fully participate in the meeting, including voting
and attendance in any closed session of the Village Council. A Councilmember
participating by telephonic or video conferencing is not permitted to chair the
meeting unless all Council members are participating by telephone or video
conferencing.
   Any member of the Village Council attending a meeting remotely must publicly
announce at the outset of the meeting (which shall be included in meeting
minutes) that the member is attending the meeting remotely. If the member is
attending the meeting remotely for a purpose other than for military duty, the
member's announcement must identify the member's physical location by stating
the city, village or township and the state from which the member is attending
the meeting remotely.
   Rule 36.   Other Boards and Commissions.
   All other Village boards and commissions and the members thereof are
governed by and shall conform to the provisions contained in these Rules
setting forth the requirements and procedures by which absent members and the
public may remotely participate in meetings electronically by telephone or
video conferencing. In the event of any conflict between these rules and the
bylaws or procedural rules of the other board or commission, this Rule is
controlling authority.

   (b)   Investment Policy.
      (1)   Scope. This investment policy applies to all cash and financial
assets held by the Village of Franklin (the “Village”) other than pension fund
assets and the Police Retiree Medical assets which are organized and
administered separately.
      (2)   Objectives. The primary objectives, in accordance with Michigan
Public Act 20 of the Public Acts of 1943, as amended, in priority order, of
investment activities shall be:
         A.   Safety. The primary objective of the Village’s investment
activity is the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. The objective
will be to mitigate credit risk and interest rate risk.
            1.   Credit Risk. Credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the
failure of the security issuer or backer, shall be mitigated by limiting
investments to the safest type of securities. The investment portfolio shall be
sufficiently diversified to minimize potential losses on individual securities.
Financial institutions, broker/dealers, intermediaries, and advisors that the
Village does business with shall be pre-qualified.
            2.   Interest Rate Risk. The Village will minimize interest rate
risk, which is the risk that the market value of securities in the portfolio
will fall due to changes in interest rates. The investment portfolio shall be
structured to ensure that securities mature to meet cash requirements for
ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to liquidate prior to maturity.
Operating funds shall be invested primarily in shorter term securities.
         B.   Liquidity. The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently
liquid to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated.
         C.   Return on Investment. Subject to the foregoing constraints of
safety and liquidity, the Village will strive to maximize the yield from the
investment portfolio.
      (3)   Standards of Care.
         A.   Responsibilities of Treasurer. Daily management for the
investment program is the responsibility of the Treasurer as custodian of
Village funds (see Charter Chapter III, Section 16). No person may engage in an
investment transaction except as provided under terms of the Village Charter,
this policy and procedures established by the Treasurer.
         B.   Prudence. The standard of prudence to be used by investment
officials shall be the “prudent person” standard applied in the context of
managing the overall portfolio. Investment officials acting in accordance with
written procedures and the investment policy and exercising due diligence will
be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk
or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported the
Village Council in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control
adverse developments.
         C.   Ethics and Conflicts of Interest. Officers involved in the
investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could
conflict with the proper execution and management of the investment program, or
could impair their ability to make impartial decisions. Investment officials
shall disclose any material interests in financial institutions with which they
conduct business. Officers shall refrain from undertaking personal investment
transactions with the same individual with whom business is conducted on behalf
of their entity.
         D.   Maintain the Public’s Trust. All participants in the investment
process shall seek to act responsibly as custodians of the public trust.
Investment officials shall recognize that the investment program shall be
designed and managed with a degree of professionalism worthy of the public
trust. Investment officials shall avoid any transactions that might knowingly
impair public confidence in the ability of the Village of Franklin to govern
effectively.
         E.   Collateralization. The State of Michigan does not require
collateralization of public funds, however, all security transactions shall be
conducted on a deliver versus payment basis. The Village will also utilize any
IPC insurance protections as applicable. Non-negotiable, non-collateralized
certificates of deposits, as is the law in the State of Michigan shall be
evidenced by a safekeeping receipt from the issuing bank. To further provide
safety and reduce custodial risk for CD investments, a nationally recognized
financial institution rating service shall be utilized as stated in (b)(4)(A).
      (4)   Safekeeping and Custody.
         A.   Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions. The Treasurer will
maintain a list of financial institutions, which have been ratified by the
Village Council on an annual basis, to provide investment and depository
services. In addition, a list will also be maintained of approved security
broker/dealers selected by creditworthiness who maintain an office in the State
of Michigan (the State) or who are “primary” dealers or regional dealers that
qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15C3-1 (uniform net
capital rule). No deposit of public funds shall be made except in a qualified
public depository as established by State law.
      All financial institutions and broker/dealers being considered for
inclusion on the list must supply the Treasurer with the following: Audited
financial statements for the most recent fiscal year; quarterly or interim
financial statements as published; certification of having read the Village’s
investment policy and pertinent State statutes; a signed statement agreeing to
comply with the terms of this investment policy regarding the buying and
selling of securities; proof of National Association of Security Dealers
certification; and proof of state registration, where applicable.
      An annual review of the financial condition and registration of qualified
institutions/dealers will be conducted by the Treasurer. Information indicating
a loss or prospective loss of capital on existing investments must be shared
with the Village Council immediately upon notification.
         B.   Internal Controls. The Treasurer shall establish and maintain a
system of internal controls which is designed to ensure that the financial
assets of the Village are protected from loss, theft or misuse. Required
elements of the system of internal controls shall include the timely
reconciliation of all bank accounts, and trust receipt documentation.
         Internal controls will also encompass these additional items:
            Transfer of all funds (purchases, sales, etc.).
            Separation of functions, including transaction authority and
accounting and record keeping.
            Custodial safekeeping.
            Avoidance of physical delivery securities.
            Written confirmation of telephone transactions.
            Specific guidelines regarding securities losses and remedial
action.
            Identification of authorized investment officials.
            Documentation of transactions by the investment official.
      Bank deposits should be made with sufficient frequency to ensure adequate
safeguarding of negotiable instruments. Deposits should be made when necessary
as monies are received but no less than at weekly intervals. Any single
negotiable instrument, check or draft, or accumulation of the same, that
exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000) in amount should be, as practical,
deposited in the bank by the next business day.
   Periodically, but not less than every two years, independent certified
public accountants, in connection with their audit of the Village financial
statements, shall review the system of internal controls with respect to
investments.
         C.   Third-Party Custodial Agreements. All securities purchased by the
Village shall be held in safekeeping by a third-party custodial bank or other
third-party custodial institution, chartered by the United States government or
the State of Michigan, and no withdrawal of such securities, in whole or in
part, shall be made from safekeeping except by the Treasurer as authorized by
the Village Charter and this policy.
   The Village will execute third-party custodial agreement(s) with its bank(s)
and depository institution(s). Such agreements will include letters of
authority from the Village, details as to responsibilities of each party,
notification of security purchases, sales, delivery, repurchase agreements and
wire transfers, safekeeping and transactions costs, procedures in case of wire
failure or other unforeseen mishaps, including liability of each party.
   Securities will be held by a third-party custodian designated by the
Treasurer and evidenced by safekeeping receipts, including securities which act
as collateral for repurchase agreements.
      (5)   Authorized and Suitable Investments.
         A.   Investment Types. The Village is empowered by State statute (Act
239 of the Public Acts of 1988, being M.C.L.A. 129.91, as amended) to invest in

of either of the following:
            a.   The purchase of securities on a when-issued or delayed
delivery basis.
            b.   The ability to lend portfolio securities as long as the mutual
fund receives collateral at all times equal to at least 100 percent of the

         9.   Investment pools organized under the Surplus Funds Investment

      B.   Limitations. The Treasurer is restricted to investments which meet
the statutory restrictions above and limitations on security issuers as
detailed below:
         1.   Repurchase agreements shall be negotiated only with dealers or
financial institutions with whom the Village has negotiated a master repurchase
agreement or with the Village’s primary bank. Repurchase agreements must be
signed by the Village President, the Village Clerk and the bank or dealer and
must contain provisions similar to those outlined in the Public Security

as considered appropriate by the Treasurer and consistent with this policy.

investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a
specific cash flow, the Village will not directly invest in securities maturing

derivative-type instruments or reverse repurchase agreements that may be
allowed under State statute.

420.01   WEIGHT LIMITS.
   (a)   Maximum Axle Load Defined. As used in this chapter, "maximum axle
load" means the gross weight over the axle which includes vehicles and load.
   (b)   Maximum Loads.
      (1)   The maximum axle load shall not exceed the number of pounds
designated in the following provisions, which prescribe the distance between
axles:
         A.   When the axle spacing is nine feet or more between axles, the
maximum axle load shall be 18,000 pounds for vehicles equipped with high-
pressure pneumatic or balloon tires.
         B.   When the axle spacing is less than nine feet between two axles,
but more than three and one-half feet, the maximum axle load shall be 13,000
pounds for high-pressure pneumatic or balloon tires.
         C.   When two axles are spaced less than three and one-half feet
apart, the maximum axle load shall not exceed 9,000 pounds per axle.
      Paragraphs (b)(1)A. to C. above shall be known as the normal loading
maximum.
      (2)   When normal loading is in effect, Council, with respect to highways
under the Village's jurisdiction, may designate certain highways or sections
thereof, where bridges and road surfaces are adequate, for heavier loading,
which designation may be revised as needed and on which the maximum tandem axle
assembly loading shall not exceed 16,000 pounds for any axle of the assembly,
if there is no other axle within nine feet of any axle of the assembly.
      (3)   Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8) hereof, on a legal
combination of vehicles, only one tandem axle assembly shall be permitted on
the designated highways at the gross permissible weight of 16,000 pounds per
axle, if there is no other axle within nine feet of any axle of the assembly,
and if no other tandem axle assembly in the combination of vehicles exceeds a
gross weight of 13,000 pounds per axle. When the maximum gross weight of a
combination of vehicles with load does not exceed 73, 280 pounds, two tandem
axle assemblies shall be permitted on the designated highways at a gross
permissible weight of 16,000 pounds per axle, if there is no other axle within
nine feet of any axle of the assembly.
      (4)   The normal size of tires shall be the rated size as published by
the manufactures, and the maximum wheel load permissible for any wheel shall
not exceed 700 pounds per inch of width of tire.
      (5)   During the months of March, April and May in each year, the maximum
axle load allowable on concrete pavements, or pavements with a concrete base,
shall be reduced by twenty-five percent from the maximum axle load as specified
in this section, and the maximum axle loads allowable on all other types of
roads during these months shall be reduced by thirty-five percent from the
maximum axle loads specified. The maximum wheel load shall not exceed 525
pounds per inch of tire width on concrete and concrete base or 450 pounds per
inch of tire width on all other roads during the period the seasonal road
restrictions are in effect.
      (6)   The Road Administrator, or the Village President, in his or her
absence or disability, may, with respect to highways under the Village's
jurisdiction, suspend the restrictions imposed by this section when and where,
in his or her discretion, conditions of the highways or the public health,
safety and welfare so warrant, and may impose the restricted loading
requirements of this section on designated highways at any other time that the
conditions of the highway may require, or he or she may prohibit the operation
of trucks or other commercial vehicles on designated roads, provided, however,
that such prohibitions shall be designated by appropriate signs placed on such
streets.
      (7)   For the purpose of enforcement of this section, the gross vehicle
weight of a single vehicle and load, or a combination of vehicles and loads,
shall be determined by weighing individual axles or groups of axles, and the
total weight on all the axles shall be the gross vehicle weight. In addition,
the gross axle weight shall be determined by weighing individual axles or by
weighing a group of axles and dividing the gross weight of the group of axles
by the number of axles in the group.
         Pursuant to paragraph (b)(8) hereof, the overall gross weight on a
group of two or more axles shall be determined by weighing individual axles or
several axles, and the total weight of all the axles in the group shall be the
overall weight of the group.
      (8)   The Road Administrator, or the Village President, in his or her
absence or disability, may, with respect to highways under the Village's
jurisdiction, designate a highway, or a section of a highway, for the operation
of vehicles having a gross vehicle weight of not more than 80,000 pounds which
are subject to the following load maximums:
         A.   Twenty thousand pounds on any one axle, including all enforcement
tolerances.
         B.   A tandem axle weight of 34,000 pounds, including all enforcement
tolerances.
         C.   An overall gross weight on a group of two or more consecutive
axles equaling:
               W = 500(LN/(N-1)) ÷ 12N + 36)
   Where W = overall gross weight on a group of two or more consecutive axles
to the nearest 500 pounds; L = distance in feet between the extreme of a group
of two or more consecutive axles; and N = number of axles in the group under
consideration, except that two consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a
gross load of 34,000 pounds each if the first and last axles of the consecutive
sets of tandem axles are not less than thirty-six feet apart. The gross vehicle
weight shall not exceed 80,000 pounds, including all enforcement tolerances.
Except for five axle truck tractors, semitrailer combinations having two
consecutive sets of tandem axles, vehicles having a gross weight in excess of
80,000 pounds or in excess of the vehicle gross weight determined by
application of the formula in this paragraph shall be subject to the maximum
axle loads of paragraphs (b)(1) to (3) hereof. As used in this paragraph,
"tandem axle weight" means the total weight transmitted to the road by two or
more consecutive axles, the centers of which may be included between parallel
transverse vertical planes spaced more than forty inches, but not more than
ninety-six inches, apart, extending across the full width of the vehicle.
   (c)   Information on Vehicles.
      (1)   All motor trucks or truck tractors, except as provided in paragraph
(c)(3) hereof, of more than 5,000 pounds registered weight and all towing or
platform bed wrecker road service vehicles in operation upon the public
highways of the State shall have the name, city and state or the registered
logo or emblem of the registered owner of the vehicle, and the lessee of the
vehicle if the vehicle is being operated under lease, painted or permanently
attached on each side of the cab on a motor truck or truck tractor in letters
of not less than three inches in height, not lower than the bottom edge of the
door, except that motor trucks with closed van bodies may place the information
on each side of the van body not lower than the bottom edge of the cab door.
This information shall be in sharp color contrast to the background.
      (2)   Except for towing or platform bed wrecker road service vehicles,
the identification requirements of paragraph (c)(1) hereof, may be met through
the use of removable devices which meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)
hereof. These devices shall be of durable construction and securely attached to
each side of the motor truck or truck tractor. The removable devices shall be
attached so that the identification is in a horizontal position.
      (3)   This section shall not apply to trucks eligible for and equipped
with farm license plates.
   (d)   Authority to Require Weighing of Vehicles.
      (1)   Any public safety officer of the Village, having reason to believe
that the weight of a vehicle and load is unlawful, may require the driver to
stop and submit to a weighing of the vehicle by means of either portable or
stationary scales approved and sealed by the Michigan Department of Agriculture
as a legal weighing device, and may require that such vehicle be driven to the
nearest weighing station of the State Department of Transportation or the
Village for the purpose of allowing said officer to determine whether such
conveyance is loaded in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Whenever the officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines
that the weight is unlawful, the officer may require the driver to stop the
vehicle in a suitable place and remain standing until that portion of the load
is shifted or removed as necessary to reduce the gross axle load weight of the
vehicle to the limit permitted under this chapter. All material unloaded as
provided under this subsection shall be cared for by the owner or operator of
the vehicle at the risk of the owner or operator.
   (e)   Special Permits.
      (1)   The Road Administrator may, in his or her discretion, upon
application in writing and good cause being shown therefor, issue a special
permit, in writing, authorizing the applicant to operate upon or remove from a
highway maintained by the Village a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a
size, weight or load exceeding the maximum specified in this chapter or which
otherwise is not in conformity with this chapter.
      (2)   The application for any special permit shall be on a form
prescribed by the Road Administrator and shall specifically describe the
vehicle or vehicles and load to be operated or moved and the particular
highways upon which the special permit to operate is requested.
      (3)   A special permit shall specify the trip(s) and date(s) for which it
is valid and the special permit may restrict or prescribe conditions of
operation of a vehicle or vehicles, if necessary, to protect the safety of the
public or to ensure against undue damage to the road foundations, surfaces,
structures or installations, and may require a reasonable inspection fee and
other security as the Village determines necessary to compensate for damage
caused by the movement. A special permit may be issued on an annual basis.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the fee charged by the Village
for an intrastate or an out-of-state vehicle for a single trip shall be not
more than fifty dollars ($50.00) and, for multiple trips or on an annual basis,
such fee shall be not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
      (4)   Every such permit shall be carried in the vehicle or combination of
vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to inspection by any public
safety officer or the Road Administrator, and no person shall violate any of
the terms and conditions of such permit.
   (f)   Failure to Stop. A driver or owner of a vehicle who knowingly fails to
stop and submit to a weighing of the vehicle or load when requested or ordered
to do so by a public safety officer of the Village shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor.
(Ord. 99-94. Passed 11-15-99.)
420.99   PENALTY.
   (a)   An owner of a vehicle or a lessee of the vehicle of an owner-operator,
or other person, who causes or allows a vehicle to be loaded and driven or
moved on a highway, when the weight of that vehicle violates Section
420.01, is responsible for a civil infraction and shall pay a civil fine in an
amount equal to three cents (3¢) per pound for each pound of excess load over
1,000 pounds when the excess is 2,000 pounds or less; six cents (6¢) per pound
of excess load when the excess is over 2,000 pounds but not over 3,000 pounds;
nine cents (9¢) per pound for each pound of excess load when the excess is over
3,000 pounds but not over 4,000 pounds; twelve cents (12¢) per pound for each
pound of excess load when the excess is over 4,000 pounds but not over 5,000
pounds; fifteen cents (15¢) per pound for each pound of excess load when the
excess is over 5,000 pounds but not over 10,000 pounds; and twenty cents (20¢)
per pound when the excess is over 10,000 pounds. However, the court shall have
discretionary power as to the amount of the civil fine within the schedule
provided by this subsection and may impose the civil fine provided in Section
907(3) of the Michigan Vehicle Code, being M.C.L.A. 257.907(3), as amended,
where, at the time of the violation, either the motor vehicle, motor vehicle
and semitrailer or trailer did not exceed the total weight which would be

   As used in this chapter, "alcoholic liquor" means any spirituous, vinous,
malt or fermented liquor, liquids and compounds, whether or not medicated,
proprietary or patented, and by whatever names called, containing one-half of
one percent or more of alcohol by volume, which are fit for use for beverage

(Ord. 132. Passed 1-8-80.)
610.02   SELLING TO OR FURNISHING TO MINORS.
   No person, either directly or indirectly, by himself or herself or by a
clerk, agent, servant or employee, shall at any time sell, furnish, give or
deliver any alcoholic liquor to any person unless such person shall have
attained the age of 21 years. The provisions of this section shall not prohibit
the following:
   (a)   The furnishing, giving or delivering of alcoholic liquor to any person
who has not attained the age of 21 years, if said furnishing, giving or
delivering is by a natural or adoptive parent to his or her child within the
confines of said parent's home.
   (b)   The use of alcoholic liquor when actually used as an ingredient in the
preparation of foods.
   (c)   The furnishing, giving or delivering of alcoholic liquor to a person
who has not attained the age of 21 years, if such furnishing, giving or
delivering is done at the direction of a physician or surgeon.
   (d)   The furnishing, giving or delivering of alcoholic liquor to a person
who has not attained the age of 21 years, if such furnishing, giving or
delivering is in connection with a ceremony of an established religion.
(Ord. 132. Passed 1-8-80.)
610.03   PURCHASE, CONSUMPTION, POSSESSION BY MINORS.
   (a)   Fines and Sanctions. A minor shall not purchase or attempt to purchase
alcoholic liquor, consume or attempt to consume alcoholic liquor, or possess or
attempt to possess alcoholic liquor, or have any bodily alcohol content, except
as provided in this section. A minor who violates this subsection is
responsible for a municipal civil infraction or guilty of a misdemeanor
punishable by the following fines and sanctions:
      (1)   For the first violation, the minor is responsible for a civil
infraction and shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00). A
court may order the minor to participate in substance use disorder services as
defined in section 6230 of the Public Health Code, 1978 PA 368, M.C.L.A.
333.6230, and designated by the Administrator of the State Office of Substance
Abuse Services, and may order the minor to perform community service and to
undergo substance abuse screening and assessment at the individual’s own
expense.
      (2)   For a violation of this subsection that occurs after one prior
judgment, the minor is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for
not more than 30 days if the court finds that the minor violated an order of
probation, failed to successfully complete any treatment, screening, or
community service ordered by the court, or failed to pay any fine for that
conviction or juvenile adjudication, or by a fine of not more than two hundred
dollars ($200.00), or both. A court may order the minor to participate in
substance use disorder services as defined in section 6230 of the Public Health
Code, 1978 PA 368, M.C.L.A. 333.6230, and designated by the Administrator of
the State Office of Substance Abuse Services, to perform community service, and
to undergo substance abuse screening and assessment at the individual’s own
expense.
      (3)   For a violation of this subsection that occurs after two or more
prior judgments, the minor is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by
imprisonment for not more than 60 days, if the court finds that the minor
violated an order of probation, failed to successfully complete any treatment,
screening, or community service ordered by the court, or failed to pay any fine
for that conviction or juvenile adjudication, or by a fine of not more than
five hundred dollars ($500.00), or both, as applicable. A court may order the
minor to participate in substance use disorder services as defined in section
6230 of the Public Health Code, 1978 PA 368, M.C.L.A. 333.6230, and designated
by the Administrator of the State Office of Substance Abuse Services, to
perform community service, and to undergo substance abuse screening and
assessment at the individual’s own expense.
   (b)   Fraudulent Identification. An individual who furnishes fraudulent
identification to a minor or, notwithstanding subsection (a), a minor who uses
fraudulent identification to purchase alcoholic liquor, is guilty of a
misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of
not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), or both.
   (c)   Probation and Deferral. If an individual who pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of subsection (a)(2) or offers a plea of admission in a
juvenile delinquency proceeding for a misdemeanor violation of subsection (a)
(2), the court, without entering a judgment of guilt in a criminal proceeding
or a determination in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the juvenile has
committed the offense and with the consent of the accused, may defer further
proceedings and place the individual on probation. The terms and conditions of
that probation include, but are not limited to, the sanctions set forth in
subsection (a)(3), payment of the costs including minimum state cost as
provided for in section 18m of chapter XIIA of the Probate Code of 1939, 1939
PA 288, M.C.L.A. 712A.18m, and section 1j of chapter IX of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1927 PA 175, M.C.L.A. 769.1j, and the costs of probation as
prescribed in section 3 of chapter XI of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1927
PA 175, M.C.L.A. 771.3. If a court finds that an individual violated a term or
condition of probation or that the individual is utilizing this subsection in
another court, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt, or a determination
in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the individual has committed the
offense, and proceed as otherwise provided by law. If an individual fulfills
the terms and conditions of probation, the court shall discharge the individual
and dismiss the proceedings. A discharge and dismissal under this section is
without adjudication of guilt or without a determination in a juvenile
delinquency proceeding that the individual has committed the offense and is not
a conviction or juvenile adjudication for purposes of disqualifications or
disabilities imposed by law on conviction of a crime. An individual may obtain
only one discharge and dismissal under this subsection. The court shall
maintain a nonpublic record of the matter while proceedings are deferred and
the individual is on probation and if there is a discharge and dismissal under
this subsection. The Secretary of State shall retain a nonpublic record of a
plea and of the discharge and dismissal under this subsection. These records
shall be furnished to any of the following:
      (1)   To a court, prosecutor, or police agency on request for the purpose
of determining if an individual has already utilized this subsection.
      (2)   To the Department of Corrections, a prosecutor, or a law
enforcement agency, on the department’s, a prosecutor’s, or a law enforcement
agency’s request, subject to all of the following conditions:
         A.   At the time of the request, the individual is an employee of the
department of corrections, the prosecutor, or the law enforcement agency, or an
applicant for employment with the department of corrections, the prosecutor, or
the law enforcement agency.
         B.   The record is used by the department of corrections, the
prosecutor, or the law enforcement agency only to determine whether an employee
has violated his or her conditions of employment or whether an applicant meets
criteria for employment.
   (d)   Deferred Violation-Prior to Judgment. A misdemeanor violation of
subsection (a) successfully deferred, discharged, and dismissed under
subsection (c) is considered a prior judgment for the purposes of subsection
(a)(3).
   (e)   Court-Ordered Screening. A court may order an individual found
responsible for or convicted of violating subsection (a) to undergo screening
and assessment by a person or agency as designated by the department-designated
community mental health entity as defined in section 100a of the Mental Health
Code, 1974 PA 258, M.C.L.A. 330.1100a, to determine whether the individual is
likely to benefit from rehabilitative services, including alcohol or drug
education and alcohol or drug treatment programs. A court may order an
individual subject to a misdemeanor conviction or juvenile adjudication of, or
placed on probation regarding, a violation of subsection (a) to submit to a
random or regular preliminary chemical breath analysis. The parent, guardian,
or custodian of a minor who is less than 18 years of age and not emancipated
under 1968 PA 293, M.C.L.A. 722.1 to 722.6, may request a random or regular
preliminary chemical breath analysis as part of the probation.
   (f)   Preliminary Chemical Breath Analysis. A law enforcement officer who
has reasonable cause to believe a minor has consumed alcoholic liquor or has
any bodily alcohol content may require that individual to submit to a
preliminary chemical breath analysis. A peace officer may arrest an individual
based in whole or in part upon the results of a preliminary chemical breath
analysis. The results of a preliminary chemical breath analysis or other
acceptable blood alcohol test are admissible in a criminal prosecution to
determine whether the minor has consumed or possessed alcoholic liquor or had
any bodily alcohol content. A minor who refuses to submit to a preliminary
chemical breath test analysis as required in this subsection is responsible for
a municipal civil infraction and may be ordered to pay a civil fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   (g)   Notification of Parent or Guardian. A law enforcement officer, on
determining that an individual who is less than 18 years of age and not
emancipated under 1968 PA 293, M.C.L.A. 722.1 to 722.6, allegedly consumed,
possessed, or purchased alcoholic liquor, attempted to consume, possess, or
purchase alcoholic liquor, or had any bodily alcohol content in violation of
subsection (a) shall notify the parent or parents, custodian, or guardian of
the individual as to the nature of the violation if the name of a parent,
guardian, or custodian is reasonably ascertainable by the law enforcement
agency. The law enforcement officer shall notify the parent, guardian, or
custodian not later than 48 hours after the law enforcement agency determines
that the individual who allegedly violated subsection (a) is less than 18 years
of age and not emancipated under 1968 PA 293, M.C.L.A. 722.1 to 722.6. The law
enforcement officer may notify the parent, guardian, or custodian by any means
reasonably calculated to give prompt actual notice including, but not limited
to, notice in person, by telephone, or by first-class mail. If an individual
less than 17 years of age is incarcerated for violating subsection (a), his or
her parents or legal guardian shall be notified immediately as provided in this
subsection.
   (h)   Possession of Alcohol in Course of Employment. This section does not
prohibit a minor from possessing alcoholic liquor during regular working hours
and in the course of his or her employment if employed by a person licensed by
the Michigan Liquor Control Code of 1998 (M.C.L.A. 436.1101 et seq.), by the
State Liquor Control Commission, or by an agent of the commission, if the
alcoholic liquor is not possessed for his or her personal consumption.
   (i)   Exceptions. The following individuals are not considered to be in
violation of subsection (a):
      (1)   A minor who has consumed alcoholic liquor and who voluntarily
presents himself or herself to a health facility or agency for treatment or for
observation including, but not limited to, medical examination and treatment
for any condition arising from a violation of sections 520b to 520g of the
Michigan Penal Code, 1931 PA 328, M.C.L.A. 750.520b to 750.520g, committed

750.520b to 750.520g, committed against a minor.
      (3)   A minor who initiates contact with a peace officer or emergency
medical services personnel for the purpose of obtaining medical assistance for
a legitimate health care concern.
   (j)   Vendor Liability. This section does not limit the civil or criminal
liability of a vendor or the vendor’s clerk, servant, agent, or employee for a
violation of the Michigan Liquor Control Code of 1998 (M.C.L.A. 436.1101 et
seq.).
   (k)   Educational Use. The consumption of alcoholic liquor by a minor who is
enrolled in a course offered by an accredited postsecondary educational
institution in an academic building of the institution under the supervision of
a faculty member is not prohibited by this section if the purpose of the
consumption is solely educational and is a requirement of the course.
   (l)   Religious Service. The consumption by a minor of sacramental wine in
connection with religious services at a church, synagogue, or temple is not
prohibited by this section.
   (m)   Undercover Operations. Subsection (a) does not apply to a minor who
participates in either or both of the following:

alcoholic liquor under the direction of the person’s employer and with the
prior approval of the local prosecutor’s office as part of an employer-
sponsored internal enforcement action.
      (2)   An undercover operation in which the minor purchases or receives
alcoholic liquor under the direction of the State Police, the State Liquor
Control Commission, or a local police agency as part of an enforcement action
unless the initial or contemporaneous purchase or receipt of alcoholic liquor
by the minor was not under the direction of the State Police, the State Liquor
Control Commission, or the local police agency and was not part of the
undercover operation.
   (n)   Affirmative Defense. In a prosecution for the violation of subsection
(a) concerning a minor having any bodily alcohol content, it is an affirmative
defense that the minor consumed the alcoholic liquor in a venue or location
where that consumption is legal.
   (o)   Definitions. As used in this section:

legalize the keeping of chickens and ducks in a responsible manner.
   (b)   Purpose. The regulations in this section are intended to establish the
conditions under which chickens and ducks may be kept in certain residential
areas of the Village of Franklin. Some residents wish to raise chickens and
ducks because of a desire for healthier dietary practices, community
sustainability and resilience, and greater access to safe and healthy food
options. Concerns about disease and pestilence exist when farm animals and
people live in proximity. Nuisance concerns also exist, due to odors, noises,
and other impacts associated with farm animals. The regulations in this section
are intended to address these concerns, allow chickens and ducks on residential
parcels and lots, and minimize social conflict and public health impacts.
   (c)   Private, Non-Commercial Use. Chickens and ducks kept and maintained
under this section shall be for private, non-commercial use only.
   (d)   Sanitary Requirements; Nuisances. It is unlawful and shall be
considered a nuisance for any person to keep or maintain, or allow to be kept
or maintained, upon any premises owned, controlled, or occupied by the person,
any chickens or ducks that are in foul, obnoxious, malodorous, or filthy
conditions or that may become detrimental to the public health, safety, and
welfare. All places where chickens or ducks are kept shall be maintained in
sanitary condition and shall be cleaned as often as necessary to avoid being a
nuisance.
   (e)   Zoning Permit Required. A person intending to keep chickens or ducks
on a residential parcel or lot shall obtain a zoning permit from the Village
prior to acquiring the chickens or ducks. By signing the permit application,
the applicant attests that he or she will abide by all the regulations
contained herein for as long as the chickens or ducks are kept. A zoning permit
for the keeping of chickens or ducks shall not be transferrable from one
property owner to another. The Village may revoke a permit granted under this
subsection upon finding of noncompliance with the requirements set forth
herein. The application for a zoning permit shall be accompanied by a plot plan
that shows the location and dimensions of the coop and pen in proximity to
property lines, dwellings, and potable water wells.
   (f)   Applicability of Private Restrictions. Notwithstanding the regulations
set forth in this section, private restrictions on the use of property for
keeping of farm animals shall remain enforceable. Private restrictions include,
but are not limited to, deed restrictions, restrictions in condominium master
deeds and bylaws, subdivision association bylaws, and covenant deeds. The
interpretation and enforcement of private restrictions is the sole
responsibility of the private parties involved.
   (g)   Regulations for Keeping Chickens and Ducks. The keeping of chickens
and ducks is permitted, subject to the following regulations.
      (1)   Gender. Only female chickens (hens) shall be kept on residential
parcels or lots. For example, keeping of mature roosters is prohibited. Both
drakes (male ducks) and hen ducks may be kept.

the applicant’s residence.
         C.   Manure storage facilities shall be located to the rear of the
residence and set back minimum of fifty feet from all property lines.

forty-two inches in height and the birds’ wings must be clipped to prevent them
from leaving the pen.
         F.   Cleaning requirements. Coops and pens shall be cleaned regularly
to prevent accumulation of food, fecal matter, and nesting material that would
create a nuisance or unsanitary conditions due to odor, vermin, debris, or
decay.
      (5)   Additional regulations.
         A.   Feed storage. Feed shall be stored in sealable containers to
prevent access by rodents or other animals.
         B.   Containment. Chickens and ducks shall be always kept inside a pen
and must be shut in their coop from sunset to sunrise. However, the birds may
be allowed to roam outside of the pen during daylight hours, provided a person

and has determined that the public health and welfare and good order of the
community require that the members of the community be allowed to enjoy the
well being, tranquility and privacy of the home and, when absent from their
homes and dwellings, to carry with them a sense of security inherent in the
assurance that they may return to the enjoyment, tranquility and privacy of
their homes and dwellings. The Village Council has also determined that the
practice of picketing residences and/or dwellings causes emotional disturbance
and distress to the occupants when such practice has as its object the
harassing of said occupants. The Village Council has further determined that
without resorting to such picketing, a full opportunity exists and, under the
terms of this section, will continue to exist for the exercise of freedom of
speech and other constitutional rights. Based on said determinations, the
Village Council enacts this section to protect the public interests and to
avoid the detrimental results set forth herein.
   (b)   Prohibition. No person, group of persons and/or association shall
engage in picketing which takes place solely on the residence or dwelling of
any individual of the Village of Franklin.

control of the franchisee shall make the franchise subject to revocation unless
and until the Village shall have consented thereto, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent
to such change, transfer, disposition, or acquisition of control, the Village
Council may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective controlling
party, and the franchisee shall assist the Village Council in such inquiry.
      (3)   The consent or approval of the Village Council to any transfer of a
franchise shall not constitute a waiver or release of the right of the Village
in and to the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly
subordinate to the terms and conditions of the franchise.
      (4)   In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the Village Council
shall not approve any transfer or assignment of a franchise prior to completion
of construction of the proposed system or any required upgrade thereof.
      (5)   The Village Council reserves the right to review the purchase price
of any transfer or assignment of the cable communication system.
      (6)   In no event shall a transfer of ownership be approved without the
transferee becoming a signatory to the franchise agreement.
   (e)   Franchise Renewal.
      (1)   The franchise may be renewed by the Village Council upon
application by the franchisee pursuant to the procedures established in this
section upon the advice of the cablecasting board.
      (2)   At least twelve months prior to the expiration of the franchise,
the franchisee shall inform the Village Council in writing if it intends to
seek renewal of the franchise.
      (3)   After giving public notice, the Village Council shall proceed, upon
the advice of the cablecasting board, to determine whether the franchisee has
satisfactorily performed all obligations under the franchise. To determine
satisfactory performance, the Village Council shall consider technical
developments and performance of the system, programming, other services
offered, costs of services, and any other particular requirements set out in
this chapter and the franchise agreement. The Village Council shall also
consider the records of the performance evaluation sessions required
hereinafter as well as the franchisee's annual reports made to the Village as
required by this chapter. The Village Council shall also be entitled to
consider or compare the franchisee's performance with the performance of other
systems of comparable configuration nationally in arriving at its decision. The
Village Council shall also consider comments of subscribers to, and users of,
the system.
      (4)   Within four months of receiving notice from the franchisee of its
desire to renew the franchise, the Village Council shall hold a public hearing.
Subsequently, the Village shall arrive at a decision on the eligibility of the
franchisee for renewal. Notice of the public hearing shall be given in
accordance with the provisions of Section
820.09(o). Upon the finding by the Village Council that the franchisee's
performance is satisfactory, and that superior service for subscribers may not
be obtained from other companies or operators, a renewal with any amendments
shall be granted for a period of not more than fifteen years and not less than
five years, as specifically set forth in the franchise agreement. All contracts
granting any franchise, or renewing or amending any existing franchise, shall
be made by ordinance, which ordinance shall be thereafter published in the
manner prescribed by law.
      (5)   Upon a finding that the franchisee's performance is not
satisfactory or that superior service for subscribers may be obtained from
other companies or operators, the Village Council may deny renewal. A new
franchise may be awarded at any time utilizing the procedures set forth in this
chapter.
      (6)   If a franchise is denied renewal, the Village Council may require,
at its option, the non-renewed franchisee to temporarily continue service until
the execution of a new franchise agreement.
      (7)   The provisions of this subsection (e) shall be applicable only to
the extent permitted by the renewal provisions of higher law.
   (f)   Franchise Termination. Any franchise granted by the Village, pursuant
to this chapter, shall be revocable at the will of the Village or for any
material violation by the franchisee of the provisions of this chapter or of
the terms of the franchise agreement. The procedure set forth in this chapter
regarding franchise termination shall be followed in revoking a franchise.
   (g)   Termination Procedure.
      (1)   Upon receipt by the Village Council of a petition seeking
termination of the franchise and signed by five percent of cable communications
system subscriber households in the Village, or upon receipt by the Village
Council of a written report of the Cablecasting Board recommending

termination of the franchise. A copy of the report shall be mailed to the
franchisee. The report shall be forwarded to the Village Council which shall
schedule a public hearing to hear and determine the issue of franchise
termination. Written notice of the public hearing shall be mailed to the
franchisee at least thirty days prior to the scheduled hearing date. Public
notice of the hearing shall be given in accordance with the provisions of
Section
820.09(o).
      (4)   The Village Council shall hear any interested person, shall
consider the issue, and shall determine in its discretion whether to continue
the franchise, to continue the franchise for a specified period subject to
conditions, or to terminate the franchise. If the Village Council decides to
terminate the franchise, it shall issue a written report within fifteen days
setting forth its position and the date upon which the franchise shall be
terminated. If the Village Council decides to continue the franchise with
conditions, it shall issue a written report within fifteen days setting forth
the specific conditions, establishing an appropriate timetable for
accomplishment and review of the objectives and establishing any necessary
supervisory board. A copy of the Village Council report shall be mailed to the
franchisee.
   (h)   Removal of System. At the expiration of the term, or any extension
thereof, for which this franchise is granted, or upon its termination as
provided in this chapter, a franchisee shall forthwith, at the option of the
Village and upon notice by the Village Council, remove at its own expense such
portions of the cable communications system owned by the franchisee as
specified by the Village from all streets and public property within the
Village. If a franchisee fails to do so, the Village may have the work
performed at a franchisee's expense after thirty days' written notice to a
franchisee. A letter of credit or bond, at the Village's discretion, in the
amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or in any greater amount specified
in the franchise agreement shall be furnished by a franchisee for the specific
performance of this section, not less than thirty days after the above notice.
Such letter of credit or bond, in the Village's discretion, shall be furnished
in addition to and concurrently with the letter of credit or bond required in
Section
820.09 (c).
   (i)   Resolution of Disputes.
      (1)   Any disputes arising under this chapter or the franchise agreement
shall be settled either by commencement of a suit in County Circuit Court or by
compulsory arbitration, at the option of the Village. If a franchisee feels
aggrieved, it shall advise the Village of any dispute it has arising out of
this chapter or a franchise agreement and shall demand that the Village elect
whether the dispute is to be resolved by submitting it to compulsory
arbitration or by commencement of a suit in the County Circuit Court. The
Village shall make its election in writing within 30 days from the receipt of
such notice.
      (2)   If the Village elects to have the dispute resolved by compulsory
arbitration, it shall be settled pursuant to M.C.L. 600.5001 et seq., M.S.A.
27A.5001 et seq., with each of the parties appointing one arbitrator and the
two thus appointed appointing a third.
      (3)   If the Village fails to make such an election, any dispute between
the parties may be resolved by filing of a suit in Oakland County Circuit
Court. (Ord. 2000-59. Passed 7-10-00.)
820.07   SYSTEM DESIGN AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (a)   Channel Capacity.
      (1)   A franchisee shall construct, and thereafter operate and maintain,
a cable communications system that shall initially be capable of delivering the
minimum number of channels specified in the franchise agreement. Applicants may
provide greater channel capacity. A set top converter shall be provided by a
franchisee when required to enable subscribers to receive programming services.
Any fee charged by a franchisee for a set top converter shall be in accordance
with applicable law. A franchisee may also require a refundable deposit not to
exceed the franchisee's actual cost of the converter, but only if the
franchisee has required such deposit in adjacent cable systems. A franchisee
shall not be required to pay interest on the refundable deposit. The refundable
deposit may be required by a franchisee for each set top converter provided and
the responsibility for normal maintenance of the converter shall be that of the
franchisee and no charges for the repair of the converter shall be made except
in cases of subscriber misuse. There shall be no charge for removal of the
converter.
      (2)   When required by Federal law, a franchisee shall provide, as part
of its cable communications system, all television broadcast signals, as
presently available or as may become available off the air in the Village, and
the maximum number of additional television signals consistent with the rules
and regulations of the FCC and all other applicable laws, rules or regulations.
A franchisee's system shall be designed, engineered and maintained so as not to
interfere with the television and radio reception of residents of the Village
who are not subscribers to the system.
      (3)   A franchisee shall offer all channels and programming specified in
its application and the franchise agreement. Changes in service may be made
only if authorized by the Village Council and incorporated into an amended
franchise agreement except as otherwise provided by law.
   (b)   Lock-out Device. A franchisee shall provide, at no charge to
subscribers, a lock-out mechanism that prevents viewing of any pay channel.
This mechanism shall be provided upon request of the subscriber. A franchisee
shall make all subscribers, prior to installation, aware of the availability of
this device.
   (c)   Services to Educational Institutions. A franchisee shall provide, at
no charge throughout the term of the franchise, such services, equipment and
facilities devoted to educational use as specified in the franchise agreement.
   (d)   Timetable for Establishment of Educational Services. The educational
services, equipment and facilities shall be furnished by a franchisee within
the time periods specified in the franchise agreement.
   (e)   Future Educational Facilities. In addition to the currently existing
educational facilities and buildings benefiting from the provisions of
subsection (c) hereof, the same services shall be provided to all future such
facilities and buildings. Such services may be suspended to buildings no longer
used for public purposes.
   (f)   Government Access Channels. A franchisee shall provide, at no charge
throughout the term of the franchise, such services, equipment, and facilities
devoted to Village governmental use as specified in the franchise agreement.
Such services, equipment and facilities shall be furnished within the time
periods specified in the franchise agreement.
   (g)   Cost and Maintenance of Equipment.
      (1)   When required by a franchise agreement, all maintenance, repair and
periodic update/replacement of the original equipment shall be provided by a
franchisee at no charge to the educational institutions or any other
governmental agency. The level of service provided shall be sufficient to
assure that each unit of equipment operates satisfactorily at least ninety-
five percent of the elapsed time desired for use during any ninety-day period.
Responsibility for maintaining appropriate operating and failure statistics
shall be that of the institution or agency. A franchisee shall be notified
promptly by the institution or agency whenever a failure occurs and maintenance
or repair service is required.
      (2)   When required by a franchise agreement, any major additional
equipment which may be acquired, and which is clearly not a replacement for
originally installed equipment, may be provided through a franchisee at the
lowest possible cost for comparable equipment with acceptable quality. Lowest
cost shall be evidenced by competitive bids from at least three suppliers of
such equipment, each of whom have records of previous sales with acceptable
performance. Such equipment shall be warranted by a franchisee to the
educational institution for a period of not less than one year after
installation of each unit of equipment. During this warranty period, all
maintenance, repair and replacement, if necessary, shall be provided by a
franchisee at no charge to the institution in order to provide a minimum
ninety-five percent level of service as described above for the original
equipment requirements.
   (h)   Public Access Channels.
      (1)   Throughout the duration of a franchise, a franchisee shall make
available, at no cost, such public access channels exclusively dedicated for
use by the public as specified in the franchise agreement. Priority in use of
the channel and public access playback facilities shall be given to residents,
taxpayers, and persons affiliated with tax-exempt organizations as set forth in
Section 501(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code, within the
Village, and to residents, taxpayers and persons affiliated with the
aforementioned organizations in municipalities that enter into an agreement
with the Village for cooperative use of the public access channel and its
related studio and facilities. Use of the public access studio and production
equipment shall be restricted to residents, taxpayers and persons affiliated
with such organizations.
      (2)   A franchisee shall provide such public access studios, facilities,
and equipment as specified in the franchise agreement.
      (3)   In order that there is maximum opportunity for freedom of
expression by members of the public, public access programming shall be free
from any control by a franchisee as to program content except as required by
the FCC or to protect a franchisee from liability under appropriate law to the
extent such exceptions are permitted by law.
      (4)   Reasonable rules and procedures governing use of and charges for
use of any public access channel shall be established by the cablecasting board
upon the approval of the Village Council.
   (i)   Leased Access Channels. A franchisee shall make any unused channels
available for lease to any organization, group, or individual on a first-come,
first-served basis. At least one channel must be available for leasing on a
part-time basis. A franchisee shall not exercise program controls over leased
channels, but it shall adopt rules governing the leasing of channel space
which:
      (1)   Provide for access on a first-come, nondiscriminatory basis;
      (2)   Prohibit the presentation of lottery information and obscene or
indecent matter;
      (3)   Require sponsorship identification;
      (4)   Specify an appropriate rate schedule; and
      (5)   Permit public inspection of the record of the names and addresses
of all persons or groups requesting time, which record shall be retained for a
period of two years.
   (j)   Additional Channel Capacity. If any public, governmental or
educational access channel is cablecasting locally produced, non-duplicative
programming, Monday through Friday for eight consecutive hours for ten
consecutive weeks, a franchisee shall report that fact to the Cablecasting
Board. For purposes of this threshold, character generator programming shall
not qualify. The Cablecasting Board shall investigate the need for the addition
of a new channel or channels and file its recommendations with the Village
Council. After review of the Cablecasting Board report, the Village Council
may, in its discretion, require a franchisee to make a new channel available
within six months for any or all of the uses and under the conditions specified
in subsections (c), (f), (h) or (i) hereof. Nothing in this section shall
interfere with a franchisee's right to add additional channels of the type
described in such sections, provided that such channels are operated in a
manner consistent with those sections. Should a franchisee choose to add such
additional channels, it shall notify the Village Council, in writing, of its
intention, its plan and its timetable for doing so.
   (k)   FM Radio Service. A franchisee shall make available to all subscribers
any FM stereo radio service indicated in its proposal and the stereo audio
portion of all channels as available. A franchisee shall advise all subscribers
of the availability of this service, but shall not require that it be
purchased.
   (l)   Automated Channel. A franchisee shall provide a channel cablecasting
automated time, weather, stock, sports and news information. Such information
may be displayed by means of a character generator during normal cablecast
hours.
   (m)   Program Index. During all cablecast hours, a franchisee shall provide
a channel continuously informing subscribers of the programs being cablecast on
all other operational channels. A franchisee shall actively seek and cablecast
such indexing information from access channel managers.
   (n)   Additional Services. If such services are generally available in the
Detroit Metropolitan Area, a franchisee shall make available such additional
video, audio, radio, digital, internet and other services as are requested by
subscribers and/or programmers who are willing to pay for such services,
provided that such services are technologically and economically appropriate.
The Village specifically reserves the right, if authorized by law, to require a
franchisee to furnish non-discriminatory access to its cable system for
providers of internet access service, subject to applicable law. This provision
does not waive the Village or franchisee's rights, obligations, claims,
defenses or remedies regarding the authority of such requirement. The
franchisee shall be provided with reasonable notice and an opportunity to be
heard, including the right to present evidence on the findings, if any, to be
made by the Village with respect to such requirement.
   (o)   Interconnection.
      (1)   A franchisee shall provide one-way and two-way interconnection
facilities to interconnect the system with other cable systems, the school
district, and other political subdivisions as may be required by the Village
Council. Interconnection facilities may be effected by direct cable connection,
microwave length, satellite or any other appropriate method. Interconnection
facilities may be required for one, several, or all channels of the system.
Upon receiving a directive to interconnect, a franchisee shall reasonably
cooperate in the interconnection if other systems express a willingness to
share the cost of such interconnection.
      (2)   Before the Village Council issues a directive requiring
interconnection, it shall notify a franchisee in writing of its consideration
of the issue and schedule a public hearing, not less than fifteen days from the
notification date, at which a franchisee shall be provided an opportunity to
state its position on the issue. Notice of the hearing shall be given in
accordance with the provisions of Section
820.09(o).
      (3)   Upon receiving a directive from the Village Council to
interconnect, a franchisee shall immediately initiate negotiations with the
other affected system or systems in order that the cost may be shared by the
franchisees of the affected systems for both construction and operation of the
interconnection link. A franchisee shall report to the Village Council monthly
in writing regarding the status of all negotiations and construction progress.
The monthly reports shall continue until the interconnection line is
operational.
      (4)   A franchisee shall cooperate with any interconnection corporation,
regional interconnection authority, council of governments, County, Federal or
State regulatory agency which may be established for the purpose of regulating,
facilitating, encouraging, financing or otherwise providing for the
interconnection of cable communication systems beyond the boundaries of the
individual political jurisdictions.
      (5)   Should a dispute arise over any matter regarding interconnection,
it shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of this chapter on
methods of resolving disputes.
      (6)   The Village Council may grant reasonable extensions of time to
interconnect or rescind its request to interconnect upon petition by a
franchisee to the Village Council. The Village Council shall grant such request
if it finds that a franchisee has negotiated in good faith and has failed to
obtain an approval from the system of the proposed interconnection, or that the
cost of the interconnection would cause an unreasonable or unacceptable
increase in subscriber rates.
      (7)   In order to assure future interconnection capability, a franchisee
shall meet the following initial technical requirements: use of standard
frequency allocations for cable communications signals, use of signal
processors at the headend for each cable communications signal, use of adequate
amplifiers spaced appropriately to enable two-way activation of the total
system, and use of local origination equipment compatible with videocassettes,
videotapes, videodisks, video film chains and other various video formats.
   (p)   Standby Power. A franchisee shall install and maintain equipment
capable of providing standby power for headend, transportation and trunk
amplifiers for a minimum of four hours. The standby power equipment for the
headend shall be constructed so as to automatically notify the cable office
when it is in operation and to automatically revert to the standby mode when
the AC power returns. All utility safety regulations must be followed to
prevent a standby generator from powering the dead utility line.
   (q)   Underground and Aboveground Installations.
      (1)   A franchisee may lease, rent or in any other manner by mutual
agreement obtain the use of towers, poles, lines, cables and other equipment
and facilities from utility companies operating within the Village, and use
towers, poles, lines, cables and other equipment and facilities for the system,
subject to all existing and future laws, ordinances and regulations of the
Village, the State and the United States of America. When and where
practicable, the poles used by a franchisee's distribution system shall be
those erected and maintained by utility companies operating within the Village
provided mutually satisfactory rental agreements can be reached. All utility
companies in the Village shall cooperate with a franchisee and allow a
franchisee the use of their poles and pole line facilities whenever possible so
that the number of new or additional poles installed in the Village may be
minimized.
      (2)   A franchisee shall have the right to erect, install and maintain
its own towers, poles, guys, anchors, underground conduits, amplifiers,
transformers, manholes and other equipment as may be necessary for the proper
construction and maintenance of the antenna site, headend and distribution
system, provided that the location and construction of towers, poles, guys,
anchors, underground conduits, amplifiers, transformers and other equipment,
manholes placed on Village property and public rights-of-way shall be approved
in advance, in writing, by the Village Engineer. In cases of conflict,
preference shall be given to more essential utilities and services such as
water, power, steam, telephone, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, traffic signals,
street lighting and gas. If a franchisee violates the provisions in this
paragraph, the Village Engineer may require a franchisee to remove any and all
equipment at its own cost.
      (3)   A franchisee shall have the right to establish terms, conditions
and specifications governing the form, type, size, quantity and location of
equipment belonging to other persons on its poles, and shall have the further
right to charge a fair rental for attachment, space or spaces occupied by the
equipment and plant of such other persons, except that no rent shall be paid by
the Village for its attachment to a franchisee's poles. The Village shall pay
any reasonable additional costs incurred by a franchisee in providing space for
the Village's attachments, including the reasonable cost of any necessary
rearrangements of a franchisee's equipment and plant to provide room for
Village attachments. Upon expiration, termination or revocation of a franchise,
or should a franchisee wish to dispose of any of its poles being used by the
Village, the Village shall have the first option to purchase them in place for
a value equal to depreciated book value.
      (4)   In those areas of the Village where transmission or distribution
facilities of all utility companies are, or are scheduled to be placed
underground, a franchisee shall likewise construct, operate and maintain all of
its transmission and distribution facilities underground to the maximum extent
the then existing technology permits, in accordance with the then management
edition of the National Electrical Safety Code, and the Telephone System
Practices Governing Joint Attachment Practices, and their successor documents,
as well as in conformance with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances,
regulations and/or codes of the Federal, State or municipal governments. If and
when necessary, amplifiers and/or transformers in a franchisee's transmission
and distribution lines may be in appropriate housings on the surface of the
ground.
      (5)   All transmission and distribution structures, lines, poles,
conduits, fixtures and equipment erected by a franchisee in the Village shall
be located so as not to endanger life or property or interfere with the normal
use of streets, alleys or other public ways and places, so as to cause minimum
interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of the general public
and adjoining property owners and so as not to interfere with existing traffic
control, street lighting, gas, electric, telephone, water hydrant or other
public utility installations and so as to comply with the then current edition
of the National Electrical Safety Code, and the Telephone System Practices
Governing Joint Attachment Practices and their successor documents, as well as
in conformance with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, regulations and/
or codes of the Federal, State and municipal governments. If the Village
Engineer determines any of such equipment erected by a franchisee violates the
provisions outlined in this subsection, he may require a franchisee to alter or
remove any or all of the offending equipment.
      (6)   Prior to the commencement of construction, a franchisee shall file
with the Village maps, plats, and records of the locations and character of all
facilities to be constructed, including underground facilities and shall have
received prior approval from the Village Engineer for such construction. A
franchisee is required to maintain current and accurate maps, plats and
permanent records for public inspection and to file such documents with the
Village annually.
      (7)   In the case of any disturbance of pavement, sidewalks, driveway,
lawn or other surfacing, a franchisee shall, at its expense, promptly replace
and restore all such surfacing to its original condition.
      (8)   The Village may, upon reasonable notice, require a franchisee, at
its expense, to protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove a
franchisee's equipment from a particular area of the Village's streets if
reasonably necessary by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street
construction or vacation, change or establishment of communication lines,
tracks, traffic signals, street lighting or by reason of other conditions.
Reasonable notice for this provision shall be construed to mean at least ten
days, except in the case of emergencies.
      (9)   A franchisee shall have the authority, upon prior approval of the
Village Administrator or his or her designated representative, to trim any
trees upon and overhanging the streets, alleys, sidewalks and public places of
the Village so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact
with wires and cables of a franchisee, except that at the option of the
Village, trimming may be done by it, or under its supervision and direction, at
the expense and liability of a franchisee. In trimming any trees, a franchisee
shall not go upon private property without the consent of the owner. Any damage
caused to the property of building owners or users, or of any other person, by
the franchisee's negligence shall be repaired fully and promptly at a
franchisee's sole expense.
      (10)   Prior to the installation of any portion of the cable system in or
onto a building, a franchisee shall obtain from the building department a cable
communications installation permit at the request of and on behalf of the owner
of the building or premises. The permit shall be required to defray the costs
of an electrical inspection to insure compliance with applicable requirements
of the Village. A franchisee shall be responsible for payment of applicable
permit fees to the Village.
   (r)   Construction Standards and Technical Requirements.
      (1)   All of a franchisee's plant and equipment, including, but not
limited to, the antenna site, headend, and distribution system, towers, house
connections, structures, poles, wire, cable, fixtures and appurtenances shall
be installed, located, erected, constructed, reconstructed, replaced, removed,
repaired, maintained and operated in accordance with good engineering
practices, performed by experienced pole line construction crews and so as not
to:
         A.   Endanger or interfere with the safety of any persons or property,
         B.   Interfere with improvements the Village may deem proper,
         C.   Interfere in any manner with the rights of any property owner, or
         D.   Unnecessarily hinder or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic
on Village property.
      (2)   All of a franchisee's system, including all plant and equipment and
all construction, shall meet, at a minimum, all relevant and applicable
specifications as set forth in a request by the Village for a proposal, a
franchisee's application, this chapter, and these Codified Ordinances, when not
pre-empted by higher law. Such specifications, construction standards and
performance characteristics shall include, but not be limited to, the following
listed construction and technical standards:
         A.   Construction standards. Methods of construction, installation and
maintenance of the cable communications system shall comply with all applicable
laws and regulations.

         C.   Performance testing:
            1.   Performance requirements and standards specified in this
chapter, and in all FCC requirements and standards, shall be measured at the
time of initial testing as provided in paragraph (r)(2)C.2 hereof, to ensure
compliance with all specified requirements and standards for construction.
Measurements shall be taken and recorded as specified in the Cable Television
Information Center specifications. All costs of such tests shall be borne by a
franchisee, including all costs associated with the hiring of an independent
supervising engineer pursuant to paragraph (r)(2)C.10 hereof.
            2.   Initial proof of performance testing shall occur within sixty
days of the commencement of cable service to each section of the system
franchise area as delineated in a construction timetable which shall be
submitted with a franchisee's application and bid proposal and also included in
the final franchise agreement. Initial proof of performance shall also be
tested within thirty days of the commencement of cable service to new
subscribers on any extension of the system not specified in the construction
timetable, and within 30 days after service has been extended to new
subscribers upon any reconstruction of the cable system.
            3.   All measurements shall be made using instruments which are
appropriate for making each performance test. Such instruments shall be
sufficiently sensitive to measure each parameter accurately. The accuracy of
the instruments must meet those standards developed by the National Bureau of
Standards for Test Equipment. Such test equipment and instruments shall know a
correction factor for bandwidth and scale position where applicable. All
measurements shall be taken at test points to be designated in a franchisee's
application, which shall also be included in the franchise agreement.
            4.   Tests and measurements to ensure compliance with the technical
standards shall be performed in a manner that is consistent with the provisions
of Federal law and regulations.
            5.   Performance requirements and standards specified in this
document, including all FCC requirements and standards, and all local
performance guidelines, shall be measured annually to ensure compliance with
all specified requirements and standards. Measurements shall be taken and

basis to ensure compliance with applicable performance standards. Measurements
shall be taken and recorded as specified in this paragraph (r)(2)C. All costs
of such tests shall be borne by the franchisee.
            7.   When complaints have been made or when other evidence exists
which, in the judgment of the Village Council, casts doubt on the reliability
or quality of cable service, the Village shall have the right and authority to
compel a franchisee to test, analyze and report on the performance of the
system. Such test or tests shall be made and the reports of such tests shall be
delivered to the Village no later than fourteen days after the Village Council
formally notifies a franchisee.
            8.   The Village's rights under paragraph (r)(2)C.7 hereof shall be
limited to requiring tests, analysis, and reports covering specific subjects
and characteristics based on such complaints or other evidence when and under
such circumstances as the Village has reasonable grounds to believe that the
complaints or other evidence require that tests be performed to protect the
public substandard cable service. All costs for such tests shall be borne by
the franchisee.
            9.   Reports required pursuant to paragraph (r)(2)C.7 hereof shall
include information setting forth the nature of the complaint or other evidence
which precipitated the special tests; what system component was tested, the
equipment used and procedures employed in such testing, the results of the
testing and the resolution of the complaint or problem. Any additional
information pertinent to the special test or specifically requested by the
Village shall be reported.
            10.   All performance testing shall be done under the supervision
and direction of a qualified engineer, not on the permanent staff of the
franchisee. The Engineer shall be selected by a franchisee and approved by the
Village Administrator or his or her designated representative, after reviewing
the individual's professional qualifications and a statement, provided by the
Engineer, indicating all associations or relationships of any nature which that
individual may currently have or may formerly have had with the franchisee. All
records of performance tests and their results shall be signed and certified by
the Engineer who shall include in the records a copy of his or her
qualifications and of the statement.
      (3)   If, at any time, the cable communications system or any portion
thereof fails to comply with any of the standards set forth in this section,
the Village Engineer shall send written notice to a franchisee listing any
deficiencies and requiring a franchisee to repair, alter or correct the
deficiencies so as to meet all such standards. A franchisee shall have thirty
days after the date of the notice within which to correct the deficiencies. A
franchisee's failure to correct the deficiencies within thirty days shall
subject it to the penalties provided in Section
820.09(p), unless the penalty is waived by the Village Council upon a showing
by a franchisee that it has made all reasonable efforts to correct the
deficiency, but has been unable to do so due to the occurrence of conditions
beyond its control. If deficiencies in the cable communications system remain
after the thirty-day period, the Village Council may direct the Engineering
Department to correct such deficiencies and a franchisee shall pay all
reasonable costs associated therewith.
      (4)   Where the provisions of any codes or regulations referred to in
this section are in conflict, the more stringent provisions, as determined by
the Village Engineer, shall be deemed to apply.
   (s)   Changes Prohibited. A franchisee shall provide its cable system and
all services as set forth in the franchise agreement, including all exhibits
thereto and all documents and written material incorporated by reference
therein.
   (t)   Maintenance of Facilities and Equipment. A franchisee shall upgrade
its facilities, equipment and service so that its system is as advanced as the
current state of technology will allow, provided that any necessary upgrade to
its facilities, equipment, or service is economically appropriate. A franchisee
shall install additional channel capacity as required to keep channel capacity
in excess of the demand therefor by users. At all times, the cable system shall
be no less advanced than any cable system in the Detroit Dominant Market Area
or than any other cable system of comparable size excepting only those cable
systems which are experimental, pilot, or demonstration. Such matters shall be
a topic of discussion at all review sessions. A franchisee shall submit a five-
year plan for upgrading facilities and equipment at each performance review
session.
   (u)   Subscriber Privacy.
      (1)   No signals of a cable communications channel shall be transmitted
from a subscriber terminal for purposes of monitoring individual viewing
patterns or practices without the express written permission of the subscriber.
The request for such permission shall be contained in a separate document with
a prominent statement to be signed by the subscriber acknowledging his full
understanding of the provisions of the request and permitting the activity to
occur. No penalty shall be invoked for a subscriber's failure to provide such
an authorization. The authorization shall be revocable at any time by the
subscriber without penalty. Such authorization is required for each type or
classification of subscriber terminal signal planned; provided, however, that a
franchisee may keep such records of viewing or purchasing of services by
individual subscribers as are necessary for the billing of the individual
subscriber for such services.
      (2)   A franchisee shall not monitor or tabulate any records or test
results in any manner that would reveal the economic status, commercial product
preferences or opinions of individual subscribers or their families. A
franchisee shall not maintain or tabulate any data on the political, religious,
moral or social preferences or opinions of individual subscribers or their
families.
      (3)   A franchisee, or any of its agents or employees, shall not, without
the specific written authorization of the subscriber involved, sell, or
otherwise make available to any party:
         A.   Lists of the names and addresses of such subscribers, or
         B.   Any list which identifies the viewing habits of subscribers.
      (4)   A franchisee shall be constantly alert to possible abuses of any
legal right of privacy or other legal rights of any subscriber, programmer or
general citizen resulting from any device or signal associated with the cable
communications system. The possibility of such abuse shall be discussed at
every scheduled review session.
      (5)   Devices such as electronic locks, scramblers, warning lights, and
others designed to inhibit signals originating from a subscriber terminal shall
be provided by a franchisee for all two-way system subscribers. Such devices
shall additionally be provided as other privacy problems are identified, the
technology becomes available and reasonable financial arrangements can be made.
   (v)   Continuity of Service.
      (1)   It shall be the right of all consumers and programmers to receive
all available services insofar as their financial and other obligations to a
franchisee are honored. If a franchisee elects to overbuild, rebuild, renovate,
modify or sell the system, or the Village gives notice of intent to terminate
or fails to extend or renew this franchise, a franchisee shall act so as to
ensure that all consumers and programmers receive continuous, uninterrupted
service regardless of the circumstances, for a period not to exceed six months
unless a longer period is agreed to by the parties.
      (2)   Upon a change of franchisee, or if a new operator acquires the
system, a franchisee shall cooperate with the Village, new franchisee or
operator in maintaining continuity of service to all consumers and programmers.
During such period, a franchisee shall be entitled to the revenues for
any period during which it operates the system, and shall be compensated for
reasonable costs incurred in providing any services when it no longer operates
the system.
      (3)   If a franchisee fails to operate the system for three consecutive
days without prior approval of the Village or without just cause, the Village
may, at its option, operate the system or designate an operator until such time
as a franchisee restores service under conditions acceptable to the Village or
a permanent operator is selected. If the Village fulfills this obligation for a
franchisee, the franchisee shall reimburse the Village for all reasonable costs
or damages, in excess of revenues from the system received by the Village, that
are the result of the franchisee's failure to perform.
   (w)   All Channels Emergency Alert. A franchisee shall, in the case of any
emergency or disaster, make its entire system available without charge to the
Village Administrator or his or her representative, or to any other
governmental or civil defense agency that the Village shall designate. The
system shall be engineered to provide an emergency alert system as set forth in
the franchise agreement to allow authorized officials to automatically override
the audio signal on all channels, and transmit and report emergency
information. The system shall provide for visual transmission of emergency
messages.
   (x)   Home Security. No home security program shall be promoted, nor shall a
home security device be installed, without the prior approval from the Police
Chief and Fire Chief of the overall home security system design. This provision
shall include alarm systems the purpose of which is to detect and warn
monitoring agencies of medical emergencies, fires or illegal entry. This
section shall be interpreted to cover the general plan and scope of activities,
not individual service hookups.
(Ord. 2000-59. Passed 7-10-00.)
820.08   FRANCHISE FEE AND RATES.
   (a)   Establishment of Franchise Fee.
      (1)   As compensation for the use of the Village's streets, public ways
and places, and other facilities, and for the right to construct, operate,
maintain, modify, and reconstruct a cable communications system, and for the
Village's costs of maintenance, and supervision of the franchise, and for the
Village's costs of establishing and conducting the regulatory activities
required by virtue of the franchise, a franchisee shall pay to the Village an
amount equal to five percent of a franchisee's gross revenues from all sources
attributable to the operations of the franchisee within the Village. The
franchise fee payment shall be in addition to any tax, permit fee, or other
payment owed or service to be provided to the Village by a franchisee.
      (2)   For purposes of this chapter, gross revenues shall be calculated on
an accrual basis.
   (b)   Payment of Franchise Fee.
      (1)   Payment of the franchise fee shall be made quarterly at the Village
Treasurer's office. Each payment shall be accompanied by a financial statement
in a standard form, approved by the Village Treasurer, setting forth the basis
for the computation and specifically showing the gross revenues attributable to
the franchise during the preceding quarter, as well as such other relevant
facts as may be required by the Village.
      (2)   Each quarterly payment and accompanying financial statement shall
be filed in the Village Treasurer's office within twenty days after the last
day of the quarter for which the payment is due.
      (3)   A franchisee shall file, within 120 days of the close of the
franchisee's fiscal year, an annual report audited by a certified public
accountant, of the annual gross revenues attributable to a franchisee's cable
communications operation in the Village as well as such other items of
information as may be required of a franchisee. This requirement may be
modified by the Village Council in appropriate circumstances. Extension of such
period up to thirty additional days may be granted by the Village Council upon
request by a franchisee.
      (4)   The Village shall have the right to inspect a franchisee's
financial records, such records to be kept or made available within the
Village, and the rights of audit and recomputation of any amounts that may be
determined to be payable under this chapter. Any additional amount due the
Village as a result of the audit shall be paid within thirty days following
written notice to a franchisee by the Village, which notice shall include a
copy of the audit report. The cost of the Village's audit shall be borne by a
franchisee if it is properly determined that a franchisee's annual payments to
the Village for the preceding year are increased thereby by more than three
percent.
      (5)   If any franchise fee payment or recomputed amount is not made on or
before the applicable due date a late payment fee of two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00) and a monthly service charge of 1.8 percent of the total unpaid
amount shall be paid to the Village by the franchisee.
      (6)   No acceptance of any payment by the Village shall be construed as a
release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the Village may have for
further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this chapter or for
the performance of any other obligation of a franchisee.
   (c)   Renegotiation of Franchise Fees. If the law permits a specified
franchise fee greater than the franchise fee set forth in this chapter, the
Village shall have the right to impose such greater fee upon thirty days
written notice to a franchisee. If the law removes all limitations on the
amount of such fee, the Village shall have the right to increase such fee to
eight percent, or more if negotiated, upon thirty days written notice to a
franchisee.
   (d)   Rates and Charges for Service.
      (1)   The Village Council shall be empowered to determine, fix, and
regulate the charges or rates of the franchisee and from time to time to alter
or change such rates.
      (2)   The Village shall fix and regulate rates for services which shall
include, but not be limited to, the following:
         A.   Rates for the provision of basic service to subscribers,
residential or nonresidential.
         B.   Rates for the provision of pay television service to subscribers.
         C.   Rates for the connection and installation of services, and for
the downgrade or disconnection and/or reconnection of such services.
         D.   Rates for nonentertainment services, such as home security,
utility meter reading, data transmission, use of access channels, energy
management, traffic signalization and other services that may be introduced
during the term of the franchise.
      (3)   Initial maximum rates for services of the cable communications
system shall be those delineated in a franchise agreement. Initial maximum
rates shall not be increased during the period specified in a franchise
agreement except as otherwise permitted by law. If construction of the cable
communications system is not timely completed and activated as set forth in a
franchise agreement, and an extension is not granted by the Village Council,
the rate guarantee shall be extended one day for each day that construction
remains incomplete and unactivated beyond the specified construction and
activation period.
      (4)   A franchisee shall have the right to conduct promotional campaigns
which permit new subscriptions to the system at lesser rates than those
applicable to earlier subscribers provided those promotional rates shall be
equally available to all such new subscribers in the Village.
   (e)   Revision of Rates for Services.
      (1)   The Village Council, upon request of a franchisee or upon its own
initiative, may establish revised rates for services. The following procedures
are hereby adopted to provide for a method for the revising of rates:
         A.   A franchisee shall file a petition with the Village Council,
which petition shall contain full and detailed information concerning the rate
revisions being requested and supporting financial documentation for such rate
revision.
         B.   The Village Council shall establish the date and time for public
hearing on such rate revision request no less than thirty days from the date a
written request is formally received by the Village Council in a regularly
scheduled public meeting and shall render a decision on the request within
thirty days following the public hearing.
         C.   Notice of the public hearing shall be given in accordance with
the provisions of Section
820.09(o).
         D.   The Village Council may, at its option, employ a consultant or
consultants mutually acceptable to a franchisee to aid in the analysis of the
requested rate revision. Costs of such consultants shall be borne by a
franchisee.
         E.   The Village may renegotiate other provisions of the franchise at
such times as rate revisions are requested by a franchisee.
         F.   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the Village on
its own initiative from instituting proceedings to revise rates at the
Village's expense.
      (2)   In making its determination with regard to the setting or revision
of rates, the Village Council may direct the Cablecasting Board to review and
report on the following items:
         A.   The rate request and its supporting financial documentation;
         B.   Comparative rates in metropolitan Detroit and the United States;
         C.   Performance ratings and subscriber complaints;
         D.   System expansion and franchise fee payments;
         E.   Comparable services in metropolitan Detroit and the United

subsections (d) and (e) hereof shall be applicable only if, when, and to the
extent, permitted by law.
   (g)   Refunds to Subscribers and Programmers. If a franchisee fails to
provide any material service requested by a subscriber or programmer in
accordance with the standards set forth in this chapter, a franchisee shall
promptly refund all deposits or advance charges paid for the service in
question by the subscriber or programmer. This section shall include
discontinuance of service for each twenty-four hour period, as well as lack of
service after payment for initial hookup.
(Ord. 2000-59. Passed 7-10-00.)
820.09   ADMINISTRATION AND REGULATION.
   (a)   Performance Review.
      (1)   In order to monitor a franchisee's performance and adherence to
this chapter and the franchise agreement, the Village, through the Cablecasting
Board, and a franchisee may hold scheduled review sessions within thirty days
after the first, fourth, seventh and tenth anniversary dates of the effective
date of the franchise and each three years thereafter during the remaining
initial term of the franchise and any extension or renewal thereof. All such
review sessions shall be open to the public and notice thereof shall be
published not less than ten days nor more than thirty days before each review
session in a local newspaper of general circulation. The published notice shall
specify the topics to be discussed. Notice shall be given in accordance with
the provisions of subsection (o) hereof.
      (2)   Unless waived by resolution of the Cablecasting Board in writing
four months prior to each scheduled review session, a franchisee shall submit
to the Cablecasting Board the results of an independent opinion survey which
shall elicit constructive criticisms and identify unmet needs among subscribers
and nonsubscribers in the franchise area. The Cablecasting Board shall
establish standards and controls with respect to the opinion survey, the
preparation and implementation of which shall be without expense to the Village
or the Cablecasting Board, and shall approve in advance the survey form and the
person conducting the survey.
      (3)   Special review sessions may be held at any time during the term of
the franchise by the Village or by the Cablecasting Board upon not less than
thirty-days' notice to a franchisee of the time and place of the review
sessions and the topics to be covered. All such review sessions shall be open
to the public and public notice of the review sessions shall be given in
accordance with the provisions of subsection (o) hereof.
      (4)   All or any of the following topics may be designated for discussion
and review at any review session:
         A.   Judicial and Federal communications rulings.
         B.   Rate structures.
         C.   Application of new technology or new developments.
         D.   System performance.
         E.   System extension policy.
         F.   Service provided.
         G.   Programming offered.
         H.   Customer complaints.
         I.   Privacy.
         J.   Amendments to the ordinance authorizing the franchise.
         K.   Interconnection.
         L.   Underground progress.
         M.   Public, governmental and educational access programs and
performance.
         N.   Studio facilities and service.
         O.   Insurance.
         P.   New services.
   Other topics may be added by either party. Members of the general public may
also request discussion of additional topics.
      (5)   The Cablecasting Board at its discretion may utilize the services
of a consultant to gain additional information for use during the review
sessions. A franchisee shall cooperate with such consultant and the
Cablecasting Board in all aspects of the performance review. In the event the
consultant's review reveals or leads to the discovery of a significant default
or violation of the franchise, the reasonable fees of such consultant relating
to such default or violation shall be borne by a franchisee.
      (6)   The Cablecasting Board shall, at the conclusion of all review
sessions, issue a public report to the Village Council announcing its findings
and recommendations for enforcement of or modifications to this chapter or the
franchise agreement.
   (b)   Security Fund.
      (1)   Within thirty days after the effective date of franchises between a
franchisee and each of the Cablecasting Board's member communities, a
franchisee shall deposit with the Cablecasting Board, and maintain on deposit
through the term of the franchise, the sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000).
Such sum shall stand as security for the obligations of a franchisee to the
member communities of the Cablecasting Board and be administered by the
Cablecasting Board as set forth below.
         A.   The faithful performance by it of all the provisions of this
chapter and the franchise;
         B.   Compliance with all orders, permits and directions of any agency,
commission, board or department of the member communities having jurisdiction
over its acts or defaults under the franchise agreements; and
         C.   The payment by the franchisee of any claims, liens and taxes due
the member communities which arise by reason of the construction, operation or
maintenance of the system.
      (2)   Within ten days after notice to it that any amount has been
withdrawn from the security fund, the franchisee shall pay to or deposit with
the Cablecasting Board a sum of money in the full amount withdrawn.
      (3)   If the franchisee fails to pay to the member communities any fees
within the time fixed in this chapter; or fails, after ten days' written
notice, to pay to the member communities any taxes due and unpaid; or fails to
repay the member communities within such ten days, any damages, costs, or
expenses which the member communities shall be compelled to pay by reason of
any act or default of the franchisee in connection with the franchise, or
fails, after three days' notice of such failure, to comply with any provisions
of the franchise which the member communities reasonably determines can be
remedied by a withdrawal from the security, the member communities may
immediately withdraw the amount thereof, with interest and any penalties, or
liquidated damages from the security fund. Upon such withdrawal, the member
communities shall notify the franchisee of the amount and date thereof.
      (4)   The security fund deposited pursuant to this section, including all
interest thereon, shall become the property of the member communities if the
franchise is rescinded or revoked by reason of the default of the franchisee.
The franchisee, however, shall be entitled to the return of such security fund,
or portion thereof, as remains on deposit at the expiration of the term of the
franchise, provided that there is then no outstanding default on the part of
the franchisee. Interest earned by the investment of the security fund shall
become part of the security fund and unless consumed by the payment of
penalties, fees or other charges under this chapter, shall be returned to the
franchisee at the expiration of the franchise term, provided that there is then
no outstanding default on the part of the franchisee.
      (5)   The payment of a penalty from the security shall not constitute a
cure of any violation or any act of noncompliance. The rights reserved to the
member communities with respect to the security fund are in addition to all
other rights of the member communities whether reserved by this chapter or
authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with
respect to such security fund shall affect any other right the member
communities may have.
   (c)   Performance Bond/Letter of Credit.
      (1)   Upon the effective date of the franchise agreement, at the
Village's discretion, a franchisee shall file with the Village a performance
bond, in favor of the Village, in the sum of two hundred fifty thousand dollars
($250,000), or in any greater amount specified in the franchise agreement,
conditioned that the franchisee shall well and truly observe, fulfill and
perform each term and condition of this chapter and the franchise agreement.
This bond shall be maintained by the franchisee throughout the construction
period and until such time as determined by the Village Council. At the request
of the Village Council, additional municipalities may be named as additional
secured parties in such bond. In lieu of all or part of the amount of such
performance bond, at the Village's discretion, a franchisee shall file with the
Village an unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit, in form and content
satisfactory to the Village, in the sum specified in this section or in any
greater amount specified in the franchise agreement. Failure to furnish such
bond or letter of credit and to maintain the same in effect in the full amount
required hereby during the entire term of the franchise agreement, and any
extension or renewal thereof, shall constitute a violation of this section and
a material breach of the franchise agreement.
      (2)   If a franchisee fails to comply with any law, ordinance or
regulation governing the franchise, or fails to well and truly observe, fulfill
and perform each term and condition of the franchise, including the
franchisee's proposal, there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally, from
the principal and surety of the bond, and/or from the letter of credit, any
damages or loss suffered by the Village as a result thereof, including the full
amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal or abandonment
of any property of a franchisee, plus a reasonable allowance for attorney's
fees and costs, up to the full amount of the bond or letter of credit.
      (3)   The Village may, upon completion of initial or subsequent
construction, waive or reduce the requirement of the franchisee to maintain
such bond or letter of credit. However, the Village may require a performance
bond or letter of credit to be posted by a franchisee for any construction
subsequent to the completion of the initial service areas, in a reasonable
amount and upon such terms as determined by the Village Council.
      (4)   The bond or letter of credit shall contain the following or
substantially similar endorsement: It is hereby understood and agreed that the
bond or letter of credit may not be canceled nor the intention not to renew be
stated until thirty days after receipt by the Village, by registered mail, of a
written notice of such intent to cancel or not to renew.
   (d)   Insurance.
      (1)   A franchisee shall maintain throughout the term of the franchise,
insurance insuring the Village and franchisee in the minimum amount of:
         A.   Workers' compensation. As required by all applicable Federal,
State, maritime or other laws, including franchisee's liability, with a limit
of at least one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for each occurrence.
         B.   Comprehensive general liability and extended coverage
endorsement. Including nonownership and hired car coverage as well as owned
vehicles, with minimum limits as follows: Bodily injury for each person, one
million dollars ($1,000,000), and each occurrence, one million dollars
($1,000,000); property damage for each occurrence, five hundred thousand
dollars ($500,000).
         C.   Excess liability. Bodily injury and property damage, five million
dollars ($5,000,000) for each occurrence.
      (2)   The insurance policies obtained by a franchisee in compliance with
this section must be approved by the Village Attorney as being in compliance
with this chapter and the franchise agreement within thirty days of the
execution of the franchise agreement. Certified copies of such insurance
policies, or certificates of insurance in lieu of the policies, along with
written evidence of payment of required premiums, shall be filed and maintained
with the Village Clerk during the term of the franchise. Such certified copies
may be changed from time to time to reflect any increase in liability limits. A
franchisee shall immediately advise the Village of any litigation covered by
the insurance.
      (3)   Neither the provisions of this section nor any damages recovered by
the Village thereunder shall be construed to limit the liability of a
franchisee under any franchise issued under this chapter or for damages.
      (4)   All insurance policies maintained pursuant to a franchise shall
name the Village, its employees, agents, boards and officers as additional
named insured parties with respect to all actions, inactions, errors and
omissions of the franchisee, its agents or subcontractors, and shall contain
the following or substantially similar endorsement: It is hereby understood and
agreed that this insurance policy may not be canceled by the insurer nor the
intention not to renew be stated by the insurer until at least thirty days
after receipt by the Village, by registered mail, of a written notice of such
intention to cancel or not to renew.
      (5)   Each policy of insurance shall be noncancellable except upon giving
such notice to the Village. If deemed appropriate by the Village attorney, the
franchisee shall also provide an owners and contractors protective liability
policy.
   (e)   Indemnification.
      (1)   A franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, fully indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Village, its officers, boards, commissions and
employees against any and all claims, suits, actions, liability and judgments
for damages, including, but not limited to, expenses for reasonable legal fees
and disbursements and liabilities assumed by the Village in connection
therewith:
         A.   In any way arising out of or through the acts or omissions of a
franchisee, its servants, agents, or employees, or to which the franchisee's
negligence shall in any way contribute with respect to any claim attributable
to the operation or existence of any part of the cable communications system.
         B.   Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy,
for defamation of any person, or the violation or infringement of any
copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent, or of any other right
of any person, excluding claims arising out of or relating to Village
programming.
         C.   Arising out of a franchisee's failure to comply with the
provisions of any Federal, State or local statute, ordinance or regulation
applicable to the franchisee in its business hereunder.
      (2)   The foregoing indemnity is conditioned upon the following:
         A.   The Village shall give a franchisee prompt notice of the making
of any claim or the commencement of any action, suit or other proceeding
covered by the provisions of this section.
         B.   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the Village
from cooperating with a franchisee and participating in the defense of any
litigation by its own counsel at its sole cost and expense.
         C.   No recovery by the Village of any sum by reason of the security
fund shall be any limitation upon the liability of a franchisee to the Village
under the terms of this section, except that any sum so received by the Village
shall be deducted from any recovery which the Village might have against a
franchisee under the terms of this section.
   (f)   Foreclosure. Upon foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a
substantial part of the cable communications system, or upon the termination of
any lease covering all or a substantial part of the cable communications
system, a franchisee shall notify the Village of such fact. Such notification
shall be treated as notification that a change in control of the franchisee has
taken place, and the provisions of this chapter governing transfer shall apply.
   (g)   Receivership. A franchise granted under this chapter shall, at the
option of the Village, cease and terminate ninety days after the appointment of
a receiver, or trustee, to take over and conduct the business of a franchisee,
whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or
proceedings, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated
prior to the expiration of such ninety days.
   (h)   Reports.
      (1)   On not less than thirty days' advance notice, the franchisee shall
submit reports on such matters as the Village or Cablecasting Board may request
from time to time. All reports and records of the franchise required under this
chapter or the franchise agreement shall be furnished at the sole expense of
the franchisee. Any materially false or misleading statement or report made by
a franchisee under this chapter or the franchise agreement shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter and a material breach of the franchise agreement.
      (2)   A franchisee shall fully cooperate in making available at
reasonable times, and representatives of the Cablecasting Board and the Village
Administrator or designated representatives shall have the right to inspect,
the books, records, maps, plans and other like materials of a franchisee
applicable to the cablecasting system, at any time during normal business hours
within the Village. Where volume and convenience necessitate, a franchisee may
require inspection to take place on its premises within the Village.

         B.   Emergency toll-free telephone line capacity on a twenty-four hour
basis, including weekends and holidays.
         C.   A franchisee shall maintain a presence within the franchise area
with adequate hours to meet public demand. The Cablecasting Board may require a

         D.   An emergency system maintenance and repair staff, capable of
responding to and repairing malfunctions on a twenty-four hour basis.

practices applicable to subscribers including, without limitation, information
regarding products and services, prices and options, installation and service
maintenance policies, instructions for using the system, billing and complaint
procedures, and such additional matters as may be required by law or as may

of the franchisee to whose attention the subscriber should direct a request for
service, request for billing adjustment or complaint. Such instructions or
information shall also include the name, business address, and telephone number
of the Cablecasting Board's administrator and the name, business address and
telephone number of the Village Administrator or other designated Village
employee to whom the subscriber can call or write for information regarding the
terms, conditions and provisions governing a franchisee's franchise if a
franchisee fails to respond within a reasonable period of time to the
subscriber's complaint or request for installation, service or billing
adjustment.
         A.   A franchisee shall furnish revised written instructions to each
subscriber whenever the instructions previously provided have been changed, and
at least annually.
         B.   The written instructions and information provided for in this
section shall be subject to the review and approval of the Cablecasting Board
which shall not withhold its approval unreasonably. The Board shall have the
power to compel changes in such materials if the Board deems the same to be
incorrect or inadequate in any material respect, and a franchisee shall
promptly institute any changes so required by the Board.
   (b)   Cable Service.
      (1)   A franchisee shall interrupt programming service only with good
cause and for the shortest time possible and, except in emergency situations,
only after periodic cablecasting notice of service interruption for two days
prior to and on the same channel and at the same time as the anticipated
interruption. Programming services may be interrupted between 1:00 a.m. and 5:
00 a.m. for routine testing, maintenance and repair, without notification, any
night except Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, or the night preceding a holiday.
      (2)   A franchisee shall maintain a written log, or an equivalent stored
in computer memory and capable of access and reproduction in printed form, of
all subscriber complaints. Such log shall list the date and time of such
complaints, identifying the subscribers and describing the nature of the
complaints and when and what actions were taken by the franchisee in response
thereto. Such log shall be made available at a location convenient to the
Village, reflecting the operations to date for a period of at least three
years, and shall be available for public inspection during regular business
hours. The franchisee shall submit a copy of such log quarterly to the
Cablecasting Board for its review. For purposes of this section, "complaint"
means any expression of dissatisfaction or report of a failure or defect, by a
subscriber or other user of the cable system to the franchisee relating to any
product, service, price, facility of the franchisee, or action or omission of
the franchisee relating to the franchisee's status as a cable franchisee of the
Village.
      (3)   For purposes of this section, "subscriber problem" means any
malfunction affecting a single subscriber; "outage" means a complete loss of
picture and sound affecting more than one subscriber; "system problem" means
any problem other than an outage which affects more than one subscriber. With
respect to matters within a franchisee's control, a franchisee shall maintain a
repair force of technicians so as to resolve any subscriber request for service
or to repair any malfunction within the following time frames:
         A.   For an outage. Within two hours, including weekends and holidays,
after receiving knowledge of such malfunction.
         B.   For a subscriber problem. Next business day service and repair,
seven days a week, for all complaints and requests for repairs or adjustments.
In no event shall the response and repair time for calls received subsequent to
2:00 p.m. exceed twenty-four hours, including weekends and holidays, from the
time of receiving a subscriber's request for service.
         C.   For a system problem. Within twenty-four hours, including
weekends and holidays, of receiving a request for service identifying a problem
concerning picture or sound quality affecting any two or more subscribers.
      (4)   Upon receipt of a request for service, a franchisee shall establish
a four-hour appointment window with the subscriber or adult representative of
the subscriber. A franchisee shall respond to the request for service within
such established appointment window.
         A.   If access to the subscriber's home is not made available to a
franchisee's technician when the technician arrives during the established
appointment window, the technician shall leave written notification stating the
time of arrival and requesting that the franchisee be contacted again to
establish a new appointment window. In such case, the required response time
for the request for service shall remain the next business day from the time
the franchisee is contacted to establish the new appointment window.
         B.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a franchisee's technician
telephones the subscriber's home during the appointment window and is advised
that the technician will not be given access to the subscriber's home during
the appointment window, then the technician shall not be obliged to travel to
the subscriber's home or to leave the written notification referred to above,
and the burden shall again be upon the subscriber, or adult representative of
the subscriber, to contact the franchisee to arrange for a new appointment
window, in which case the required response time for the request for service
shall again be the next business day from the time the franchisee is contacted
to establish the new appointment window.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) hereof, a franchisee
shall be deemed to have responded to a request for service under the provisions
of this section only when a technician arrives at the service location, begins
work on the problem, and proceeds diligently to complete such work.
      (6)   No charge shall be made to the subscriber for any service call
unless the problem giving rise to the service request can be demonstrated by a
franchisee to have been:
         A.   Caused by subscriber negligence,
         B.   Caused by malicious destruction of cable equipment, or
         C.   A problem previously established as having been noncable in
origin.
      (7)   All service personnel of a franchisee or its contractors or
subcontractors who have as part of their normal duties contact with the general
public shall wear on their clothing a clearly visible identification card
bearing their name and photograph. A franchisee shall account for all
identification cards at all times. Every service vehicle of a franchisee shall
be clearly identifiable by the public.
   (c)   Franchisee's Billings.
      (1)   A franchisee's bills to its subscribers shall be clear, concise and
understandable and shall be itemized as to each charge reflected thereon. The
billing content in use by a franchisee as of the date of adoption of the
ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be subject to the approval
of the Cablecasting Board. Any modification of the content of a franchisee's
bills to subscribers shall also be subject to the Board's approval.
      (2)   The Board shall not withhold its approval of the content of a
franchisee's bills unreasonably. If the Board disapproves of any of a
franchisee's bills to subscribers, it shall so notify the franchisee and shall
specify the basis for such disapproval. A franchisee shall then modify the
bills so as to remedy the defects specified by the Board. The modification
shall be implemented by a franchisee effective with the first billing after the
expiration of forty-five days after receipt by the franchisee of the Board's
notice of disapproval, unless the Board extends such time.
   (d)   Disconnect and Downgrade Charges.
      (1)   A franchisee shall make no charge to any subscriber on account of
complete discontinuance of service. Except as may otherwise be provided by a
law which preempts this section, a franchisee shall make no charge to any
subscriber on account of a net downgrade of service whereby the subscriber
requests a lower tier of basic service and/or a reduction in premium service.
      (2)   A franchisee may only disconnect a subscriber if at least forty-
five days have elapsed after the due date for payment of the subscriber's bill
and a franchisee has provided at least ten days' written notice to the
subscriber prior to disconnection, specifying the effective date after which
cable services are subject to disconnection; provided, however, notwithstanding
the foregoing, a franchisee may disconnect a subscriber at any time if the
franchisee in good faith and on reasonable grounds determines that the
subscriber has tampered with or abused the franchisee's equipment, or is or may
be engaged in the theft of cable services.
      (3)   A franchisee shall promptly disconnect any subscriber who so
requests disconnection. No period of notice prior to requested termination of
service may be required of subscribers by a franchisee. No charge may be
imposed upon the subscriber for any cable service delivered after the effective
date of the disconnect request. If the subscriber fails to specify an effective
date for disconnection, the effective date shall be deemed to be the day
following the date the disconnect request is received by a franchisee.
   (e)   Late Payment Charges. Late payment charges imposed by a franchisee
upon subscribers shall be fair and shall be reasonably related to a
franchisee's cost of administrating delinquent accounts. No late payment charge
shall be imposed upon a subscriber, and a subscriber shall not be deemed to be
in arrears on a bill, until at least forty-five days have elapsed after the due
date specified on the bill; and, for purposes of this section and the prior
section, the due date specified on the bill shall not be earlier than the first
day of the monthly period to which the bill is attributable.
   (f)   Notice of Programming or Channel Change. Except as may otherwise be
provided by Federal law, a franchisee shall provide at least forty-five days'
written notice to subscribers prior to discontinuing any channel or programming
service or to realigning any channel and shall provide written notice of the
same to the Cablecasting Board no later than the franchisee's notice to
subscribers. This provision shall not preclude the right of the Village to
contest or prohibit any such action by a franchisee if, and to the extent, such
rights exist. The foregoing notice requirement shall not apply in cases in
which a programming service is discontinued because a nonaffiliated provider
thereof discontinues furnishing the same to a franchisee on less than forty-
five days' notice to a franchisee. In any such case a franchisee shall
nevertheless furnish notice to its subscribers and the Cablecasting Board
promptly upon a franchisee receiving notice of the discontinuance of the
programming service from such unaffiliated provider.
   (g)   Notice of Price Increase or Reduction of Service. Except as may
otherwise be provided by Federal law, a franchisee shall provide at least
forty-five days' written notice to subscribers prior to implementing any
increase in subscriber rates or reduction in subscriber services and shall
provide written notice of the same to the Cablecasting Board no later than a
franchisee's notice to the subscribers. The provisions of this section shall
not preclude the right of the Village to contest or prohibit any such action by
a franchisee if, and to the extent, such right exists.
   (h)   Franchisee's Communications. Prior to or simultaneously with any
communication made by a franchisee to the general public or to a franchisee's
subscribers announcing or explaining any increase in subscriber rates or
reduction in programming services, a franchisee shall furnish a copy of such
communication to the Cablecasting Board. The copy of the communication required
to be furnished to the Board under this section shall be deemed to be a report
under Section
820.09 (h) and hence subject to the provisions of Section
820.09 (h).
   (i)   Disclosure of Information on Franchisee's Costs. If a franchisee, in
any communication to the general public, to the Village, to subscribers, or to
the Cablecasting Board, justifies a price increase or reduction in service on
the basis of increased costs to which the franchisee has been subjected, a
franchisee, on written request of the Board, shall promptly furnish the Board
with the underlying information on which such claim of increased costs is based
in such form as the Board may request. The information furnished to the Board
pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be a report under Section
820.09 (h) and hence subject to the provisions of Section
820.09 (h).
   (j)   Subscriber Rebates.
      (1)   Upon a violation of the provisions of this chapter by a franchisee
which results in a subscriber not receiving cable programming service or
receiving only significantly impaired service, the Board may order and direct a
franchisee to issue a rebate to such subscriber in any amount determined by the
Board to provide monetary relief to the subscriber substantially equal to the
subscriber's unliquidated detriment or loss resulting from such violation.
      (2)   Except for planned outages where subscribers are provided
reasonable notification in advance, upon a subscriber's request a franchisee
shall provide not less than a one-day credit for each day in which there is a
period of four hours or more during which the subscriber experienced an outage
or significant impairment of cable service not attributable to any action or
omission of the subscriber or to any defect in the subscriber's equipment. The
credit specified in this section shall be equal to one thirtieth of the
subscriber's total monthly bill for all services and equipment multiplied by
the applicable number of days, but excluding any pay-per-view charges;
provided, however, if such monthly bill includes any charge for a pay-per-view
program subject to such outage or significant impairment, then the credit shall
be increased by the amount of such charge.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to preclude a subscriber
from requesting and receiving from a franchisee a rebate greater than that
provided in subsections (a) and (b) hereof.
   (k)   Liquidated Damages.
      (1)   The Cablecasting Board may assess liquidated damages of up to one
hundred dollars ($100.00) per day against a franchisee for each day a
franchisee is in violation of this chapter. Such assessment may be levied
against the security fund specified in Section
820.09(b).
      (2)   Assessment of liquidated damages shall not constitute a waiver by
the Village of any other right or remedy it may have under the franchise
agreement or applicable law, including the right to recover from a franchisee
any costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, which are
incurred by the Village on account of a franchisee's violation of this chapter.
   (l)   Remedies Available. If the Cablecasting Board determines that a
franchisee has violated this chapter, the Board may order appropriate rebates
to subscribers as provided in subsection (j) hereof and/or assess liquidated
damages against a franchisee as provided in subsection (k) hereof. In addition,
the Village may pursue any additional or other legal or equitable remedies
available to it under the franchise agreement or any applicable law.
   (m)   Appeal Process. A franchisee may appeal any action of the Cablecasting
Board to the Village by submitting a written appeal within twenty-one days from
the date of the Board's action to which a franchisee objects. Upon such appeal,
the Village Council shall conduct a de novo review of the action of the Board
being appealed and shall set a hearing date within forty-five days of the date
of receipt of the appeal. A franchisee may present any information, data or
other evidence to the Council either prior to or at the time of the hearing.

food, and whether the applicant's premises are or will be, prior to commencing
liquor sales, equipped to serve the required volume of food sales;
      (11)   Whether traffic and parking requirements generated by the proposed
licensed premises will cause unnecessary congestion or inconvenience on the
public highways;

welfare to eliminate any malfunctioning, defective, overloaded or improperly
installed on-site septic systems within the Village and to provide for
easements and necessary repairs and enforcement procedures in order to carry
out this purpose. Nothing contained in this chapter shall prohibit a property
owner from maintaining, repairing or installing an on-site septic system, also
known as an on-site septic facility, provided that such an on-site septic
system can meet all lawful requirements and is not in a court-ordered
designated pollution area. The Village shall not require any such property
owner to connect to the pressure sewer system.
(Ord. 98-44. Passed 3-16-98.)

septic system. Such restriction shall be contained in rules and regulations to
be adopted or formulated by the Waste Water Management District from time to
time. As a minimum standard, no person shall introduce into any on-site septic
system any substances, materials, waters or wastes in such quantities or
concentrations which will:
      (1)   Create a fire or explosion hazard, including, but not limited to,
gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil or other flammable or explosive liquid,
solid or gas;
      (2)   Cause corrosive damage or hazard to structures, equipment,
personnel or the waste water facilities, but in no case discharges with the
following properties:
         A.   Having a ph lower than 5.0 or greater than 10.0 for more than ten
percent of the time in a twenty-four hour period;
         B.   Having a ph lower than 3.5 or greater than 12.0 for any period
exceeding fifteen minutes.
      These requirements may be modified for facilities designed to accommodate

operation and performance of the waste water facilities.
      (5)   Contain heat in amounts which will accelerate the biodegradation of
wastes, causing the formation of excessive amounts of hydrogen sulfide in the
waste water system or inhibition of biological activity in the waste water
treatment facilities, but in no case shall the discharge of heat cause the
temperature in any waste water facility to exceed fifty degrees Centigrade (150
degrees Fahrenheit) or the temperature of the influent to the treatment
facilities to exceed forty degrees Centigrade (104 degrees Fahrenheit) unless
the facilities are designed and constructed to accommodate such heat.
      (6)   Contain radioactive wastes in harmful quantities as defined by
applicable State and Federal regulations.
      (7)   Contain any garbage that has not been properly shredded.
   (b)   If, in establishing discharge restrictions, discharge limits or
pretreatment standards for commercial and/or industrial waste pursuant to this
section, the Village Enforcement Official establishes concentration limits to
be met by a user, the Village Enforcement Official, in lieu of concentration
limits, shall recommend to Council the establishment of mass limits of
comparable stringency if such is requested by the user.
(Ord. 98-44. Passed 3-16-98.)
1040.15   PROHIBITED DISCHARGES (PRESSURE SEWER SYSTEM).

pump-out records along with any Oakland County Health Division permits
regarding installation, alteration, repair or construction of any on-site
septic systems.
   (b)   Monitoring/testing of surface waters in the Village for evidence of
pollution.
   (c)   Monitoring/testing of on-site septic systems as provided in Section
1040.18.
   (d)   Provide guidance and counseling to all other employees, officers or
other persons in connection with carrying out the purpose of this chapter and
acting as liaison between the Village and the Oakland County Health Division.
(Ord. 99-97. Passed 11-15-99.)
1040.17   ENFORCEMENT ACTION.
   The Enforcement Official shall, from time to time, advise Council and the
homeowner or owner/operator of any on-site septic system, when the same is
deemed to be improper, malfunctioning or in a state of disrepair. Upon such
notification, the individual homeowner or operator/owner of said system shall
take steps to repair, correct, modify or otherwise alleviate the problem or
malfunction reported. If the homeowner or owner/operator should fail to take
such steps as may be reasonably necessary to correct such condition, then the
Village, through the Village President or his or her designee, may order that
such steps be taken, and may take any enforcement action, in order to assure
that said system is brought to operational or performance standards. All such
repairs, corrections, modifications or other actions as may be necessary to
correct or repair said system shall be solely at the homeowner's expense,
including design, pumping, repair or modifications as may be necessary.
   Upon determination that such repairs or modifications are necessary, and
upon refusal of the homeowner or owner/operator of said system to effect such
repairs and modifications, the Village may cause such repairs or modifications
to be carried out, and all costs and expenses therefor shall be levied as an
assessment against the real property upon which such system is located.
(Ord. 98-44. Passed 3-16-98.)
1040.18   INSPECTIONS AND EASEMENTS.
   (a)   The Enforcement Official shall inspect each on-site septic system
within the Village.
   (b)   Council shall cause a form of easement to be prepared which shall be
required as a condition precedent for:
      (1)   Each property owner who shall receive any grant funds or other
services of any type or nature whatsoever from the Waste Water Management
District;
      (2)   Any and all building permits within the Village, including site
plan approvals, lot splits, or such other permits or decisions as may be
incidental to any of the ordinances or regulatory powers of Council;
      (3)   Any operating permit under this chapter.
   (c)   The Enforcement Official, upon direction of Council, shall be fully
empowered to obtain such administrative or judicial orders as may be deemed
appropriate and necessary to carry out any inspections, tests, measurements or
other determinations regarding any system which said Enforcement Official has
reasonable grounds to believe is leaking, malfunctioning, overloaded, plugged
or otherwise posing a threat to public health, safety and welfare.
(Ord. 98-44. Passed 3-16-98.)
1040.19   GRANT PROGRAM.
   (a)   The Village shall recognize, enter into and let design and
construction contracts as may be necessary to carry out design, repairs,
modifications or such other corrective efforts as may be determined to be
necessary for those initial systems identified by the Village Engineers and as
approved by the State Department of Environmental Quality, the Oakland County
Health Division and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. All
construction, repairs, replacements, modifications and corrective efforts shall
be incorporated in designs prepared by the Village Engineer and shall be let
for bids in accordance with such approved designs on an overall basis for the
total work upon all such on-site systems affected.
   (b)   Each homeowner or owner/operator of each such system affected shall be
assessed a pro rata share of such design costs as shall be applicable to his or
her system. Such assessment shall be payable within thirty days of the date of

owner. Upon failure of such property owner to pay said design assessment within
thirty days, such assessment shall become a lien upon the real property upon
which said on-site system is located, and all further grant awards, subsidies
or activities shall cease with regard to said on-site septic system.
   (c)   Each homeowner or owner/operator of such on-site system to be included
within said grant program shall be assessed an amount equal to fifteen percent
of the estimated construction costs and construction engineering costs for the
specific on-site system to be corrected. Such assessment shall be payable
within thirty days from the date of written notification to said homeowner or
owner/operator of said system. In the event of nonpayment, the Enforcement
Official shall decide either:
      (1)   To proceed with the repair or modification work and place a lien
for the cost of the same upon the real property upon which said system is
located; or
      (2)   To take no further action for repair or modification pursuant to
said grant but, rather, to leave any such repairs or modifications to
subsequent enforcement action.
   (d)   In no event shall any failure to pay any assessment, whether the same
shall be a lien on the property or not, discharge, forgive or excuse any
homeowner or owner/operator of any such system from repairing, modifying or
correcting any malfunctions of said system as may ultimately be determined by
said Enforcement Official and as may be the subject of any subsequent
enforcement action. In no event shall any disqualification or loss of grant
funding by any homeowner or owner/ operator of any system excuse, discharge or
release said homeowner or owner/operator from full compliance with all
necessary requirements for protection of public health, safety and welfare as
shall be determined by the Waste Water Management District and by said

   (a)   Connection Required. The owner of all existing houses or buildings
used for human occupancy, employment, recreation or other purposes, situated
within the Village of Franklin, shall be connected to a properly operating and
permitted on-site sanitary disposal system. Where it is determined that an on-
site system cannot be properly or safely utilized or where such property is
within an area of the Village meeting the criteria of a designated pollution
area as set forth herein, then each such property owner shall, at his or her
own expense, install suitable facilities to connect such house or building to
the public sewer in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. It is the
intent of this division that each property within the Village of Franklin
utilized for human occupancy, employment, recreation or other purposes, shall
be required to either maintain a properly operating on-site sanitary system or,
in the alternative, if such system cannot be made to operate properly, then be
connected to the public sewer system in accordance with this chapter. Nothing
contained in this division shall prohibit a property owner from maintaining,
repairing or installing an on-site sanitary system, also known as an on-site
septic facility, provided that such an on-site sanitary system can meet all
lawful requirements and is not in a designated pollution area. The Village
shall not require any such property owner to connect to the pressure sewer
system.

time to time designate geographic areas of the Village in which all properties
shall connect to the pressure sewer system. This division shall not apply to
properties which have received approval for construction of a private sewer
system from the Village of Franklin since August, 1988. Such designated
pollution areas shall be determined after investigation by and on
recommendation of an appropriate State or County health official.
      (1)   Areas may be mandated for connection where investigation determines
the existence of fecal coliform where the source(s) of the same cannot be
determined.
      (2)   Mandated connection areas shall be determined so as to reasonably
accomplish the abatement of pollution in such areas, and the Village of
Franklin shall consider the following information in making such determination:
         A.   Soil maps of the area to determine soil characteristics relative
to on- site septic systems.
         B.   A search of the Oakland County Health Department records for a
history of repairs, soil characteristics, water tables and any other data such
as a disclaimer relative to site limitations.
         C.   Reliance on the health official's knowledge of the area gained
through soil evaluations associated with the septic permit system and past
documentation of the area such as seasonal high water tables.
      (3)   After reviewing the above information, the health official shall
develop a conclusion relative to mandating sewer connection in a geographically
defined area which shall be summarized in a report with recommendations to the
Village Council.
      (4)   In reviewing the above information, the Village Council shall also
consider cost effectiveness and engineering feasibility in determining
geographic boundaries of the mandated area.
      (5)   In making its determination of any mandated area, the Village
Council shall hold a public hearing with written notice to each property owner
by first class mail at least ten days prior to the date set for such hearing;
such notice to include a map of the proposed mandated area, including the
location of all lateral lines within such proposed area and street addresses.
      (6)   The Village shall cause the map of any such mandated area to be
published in the official records of the Village.

source of human pollution and on which an on-site sanitary system cannot be
properly or safely utilized shall cause such property to connect to the
pressure sewer system.
   (d)   Connection to Public System. The owner of any house, building or
property used for human occupancy, employment, recreation or other purposes,
and abutting on any street or right-of-way in which there is located or in the
future may be located a public sanitary sewer of the Village, and which is
either an individual polluting property or is within a mandated area, is hereby
required at the owner's expense to connect to the public sewer system in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter within 30 days after the date of
the second official notice to do so.
   (e)   Connection Procedures.
      (1)   First notice. This chapter shall constitute the first notice to the
affected property owners that the Village of Franklin will require immediate
connection to the pressure sewage system once it becomes operational and
available to the property in question and shall be mailed by first class mail
to those property owners upon its enactment or upon determination of required
hook up.
      (2)   Second notice. The second notice sent to the affected property
owners shall require the connection to the pressure sewer system to be made
within 30 days after said notice is given. Notice may be given by first class
or certified mail or posting on the affected property. The notice shall:
         A.   Give the approximate location of the relevant section of the
pressure sewer system which is available for connection; and
         B.   Advise the property owner of the requirements and of the
enforcement provisions of this chapter.
   (f)    Exception for Late Connection. In the event the property owner is
unable to connect to the pressure sewer system within the time prescribed by
this chapter, said property owner may appeal to the Village Council to allow
said owner additional time in which to connect without penalty and without
civil and criminal proceedings being initiated against him or her. This appeal
must be made in writing within ten days of the second written notice as
provided for in division (c) of this section.
   (g)   Enforcement Remedies.
      (1)   Penalties for late connection. In addition to other charges
required herein, failure or refusal to connect to the pressure system within
the prescribed time may result in the property being charged such additional
connection charges as may be established by the Village Council.
      (2)   Civil penalties to compel connection. Where any structure in which
sanitary sewage originates is not connected to the available and operational
pressure sewer system within thirty days after the date of mailing or posting
of the second written notice as required by division (e) of this section, the
provisions of this chapter shall be enforceable through the bringing of an
appropriate action for injunction, mandamus, or otherwise, in any court having
jurisdiction to compel the owner of the property on which said structure is
located to connect to said system. The Village may charge in such action or
actions any number of owners of such properties to compel said person or
persons to connect to the pressure sewer system.
      (3)   Recourse of Village for continued failure to connect. The continued
failure or refusal of any property owner to connect to the pressure sewer
system after a civil action has been brought by the Village of Franklin and a
court of competent jurisdiction has rendered an order compelling said
connection, shall allow the Village to:
         A.   Seek a contempt order against the recalcitrant property owner;
         B.   Enter upon said property and physically connect it to the
pressure sewer system;
         C.   Charge any expense incurred in making said connection to the
property owner through a lien the Village shall acquire against such property
for such expense, said lien to be enforced in the manner now provided by law
for the enforcement of tax liens; and
         D.   Report the amount of the lien to the Village Clerk who shall
notify the property owner or party in interest whose name appears upon the last
local tax assessment records of the lien, by first class mail. If the property
owner fails to pay the same within thirty days after mailing by the Clerk of
the notice of the amount thereof, the Clerk shall add the same to the next
Village delinquent tax roll and it shall be collected in the same manner in all
respects as provided by law for the collection of taxes by the Village.

1042.08   PRIVATE SEWAGE DISPOSAL.
   Where a public sewer is not available under the provisions of this chapter,
or where the particular property does not meet the criteria for connection to
the Village of Franklin pressure sewer system, the building's sewer shall be
connected to an approved private sewage disposal system, constructed under a
permit or in accordance with Chapter 1040 of these Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 179. Passed 8-17-92.)
1042.09   BUILDING SEWER AND CONNECTIONS.
   (a)   No person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into,
use, alter or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof, without first
obtaining a written permit from the Village and the Oakland County Department
of Public Works. No building sewer shall be covered until after it has been
inspected and approved by the Village and the Oakland County Department of
Public Works.
   (b)   The owner or his or her agent shall make application for a sewer
permit on a form furnished by the Village. The permit application shall be
supplemented by any plans, specifications or other information required by this
chapter or considered pertinent in the judgment of the Council. A hook-up fee
in an amount established by the Village Council shall be paid to the Village
Clerk at the time the application is filed. A plumbing permit and electrical
permit are also required. If a street opening is required to make the service
connection, an additional attachment to the permit must be completed.

Village. Costs and charges for operation and maintenance (including
replacements) shall be borne equally by users of the pressure sewer system.
   (d)   All costs, expenses and liabilities incident to the installation and
connection of the building sewer shall be borne by the property owner. The
property owner shall indemnify and save harmless the Village of Franklin from
any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the
installation of the building sewer.
      (1)   It shall be the duty of each property owner to maintain, clean and
repair the building sewer lines at his or her own expense as necessary to keep
such lines free and clear of obstructions and in good working order.
      (2)   The Village of Franklin shall maintain, clean and repair, as
necessary and at the user's expense, the Municipal sewer lines and the grinder
pumps.
      (3)   In the case of a bona fide dispute as to whether needed
maintenance, cleaning or repair of a portion of sewer line is the
responsibility of the property owner or the Village under the provisions of
this chapter, it shall be the duty of the property owner to establish that the
obstruction, disrepair or defect has occurred in that portion of the line for
which the Village is responsible.
      If the property owner fails to establish the Village's responsibility, it
shall be the property owner's responsibility to perform the necessary
maintenance as provided in this chapter. If the Village's responsibility is
established, the Village shall perform the necessary maintenance and shall
reimburse the property owner for reasonable expenses incurred in locating the
defect in the line or in otherwise establishing the Village's responsibility.
      The property owner shall be responsible under this chapter for the
maintenance and repair of the building sewer lines. The Village, on the other
hand, is responsible for the maintenance and cleaning of the entire sewer line
out of the grinder pump and for major repair of the grinder pump, the trunk
line and lateral lines only and has no responsibility of any kind for the
building sewer lines.
      (4)   Any property owner who shall violate the provisions of this section
shall be liable to the Village for civil damages incurred in correcting the
defect and, in addition, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to the
penalties set forth in this chapter.
      If any property owner fails to maintain a building sewer line as required
by this chapter, then, in addition to the other penalties prescribed, the sewer
may be declared a public nuisance by the Village or by the Oakland County
Health Department, and the defect may be corrected by either governmental
agency. Any costs so incurred shall be assessed against the property and become
a lien on the property if not timely paid.
      (5)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for
every building, except where one building stands at the rear of another or an
interior lot and, in the judgment of the Council, no private sewer is available
or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, yard or
driveway, in which case the building sewer from the front building may be
extended to the rear building.
      (6)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings
only when they are found, on examination and test by the Council, or its
designated agent, to meet all requirements of this chapter. All costs incurred
in such evaluation shall be borne by the property owner.
      (7)   The building sewer shall be constructed of a material approved by
the State of Michigan Plumbing Code. The Village reserves the right to specify
and require the encasement of any sewer pipe with concrete, or the installation
of the sewer pipe in a concrete cradle if foundation and construction are such
as to warrant such protection in the opinion of the Council or its designated
agent.
      (8)   The size of the building sewer shall be six inches. Such size may
be reduced to not less than four inches when, in the judgment of the Village
Engineer, a six-inch pipe cannot or should not be installed. The slope of such
four-inch pipe shall be not less than one-quarter inch per foot, unless
otherwise permitted. The slope of pipe, the diameter of which is six inches or
more, shall be not less than one-eighth inch per foot, unless otherwise
permitted.
      (9)   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the
building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be
laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby
be weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. The
building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade. The line shall be straight or
laid with properly curved pipe and fittings. Changes in direction greater than
forty-five degrees shall be provided with cleanouts accessible for cleaning.
      (10)   In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall
be lifted by artificial means in conformity with the State Plumbing Code and
approved by the Village of Franklin.
      (11)   All joints and connections shall be tested in accordance with the
State Plumbing Code and proved to be gastight and watertight.
      (12)   No sewer connection will be permitted unless there is capacity
available in all downstream sewers, lift stations, force mains and the sewage
treatment plant, including capacity for treatment of BOD and suspended solids.
      (13)   All newly constructed building sewers shall have a properly sized
cleanout at the head of said sewer that is accessible at all times. This
cleanout shall allow access of sewer cleaning equipment of a size equivalent to
the size of the building sewer.
      (14)   All sewers shall be constructed in accordance with the latest
edition of the "Ten State Standards."

Total Phenolic Compounds (or see C. below)     1.0 mg/l
 
      All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating period
representative of an industrial user's discharge, and in accordance with 40
C.F.R. Part 136.
         A.   The limitation for Total PCB is non-detect. Total PCB shall not
be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 608, and the
quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 gm/l, unless a higher level is
appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one or
more samples indicate detectable levels of Total PCB, the user shall be
required to demonstrate compliance. For purposes of this section, this
demonstration may be made using analytical data showing that the Total PCB
concentration is below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in
accordance with Section
1042.11(w)(4).
         B.   The limitation for Mercury (Hg) is non-detect. Mercury (Hg) shall
not be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 245.1, and
the quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 gm/l, unless a higher level is
appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one or
more samples indicate detectable levels of Mercury, the user shall be required
to demonstrate compliance. For purposes of this section, this demonstration may
be made using analytical data showing that the mercury concentration is below
the detection level, or submission of a BMP in accordance with Section
1042.11(w)(4).
         C.   An industrial user may elect, in lieu of the Total Phenols
Limitation specified in Section
1042.11(c)(2), to substitute specific limitations for each of the eight
individual phenolic compounds identified under the Total Phenols Limitation.
The following specific limitations, expressed in mg/l, shall be applied in lieu
of the Total Phenols Limitation, upon election;
            2-Chlorophenol   2.0 mg/l
            4-Chlorophenol   2.0 mg/l
            4-Chloro-3-methylphenol   1.0 mg/l
            2,4-Dichlorophenol   5.5 mg/l
            2,4-Dinitrophenol   2.0 mg/l
            4-Methylphenol   5.0 mg/l
            4-Nitrophenol   15.0 mg/l
            Phenol   14.0 mg/l
      Following election, the wastewater discharge permit shall be modified to
incorporate these substituted parameters and an industrial user shall be
responsible for monitoring and reporting compliance with these parameters.
      (3)   Compliance period. Within thirty days of the effective date of this
section, the Department shall notify all existing industrial users operating
under an effective wastewater discharge permit of the requirement to submit a
compliance report within 180 days after of the effective date of this section.
The compliance report shall demonstrate the user's compliance or non-compliance
with these limitations, and in the event of non-compliance, include the
submission of a plan and schedule for achieving compliance with the stated
limitation. In no event shall a compliance schedule exceed eighteen months from
the effective date of this section. An industrial user who does not demonstrate
compliance may petition the Department for a second extension as part of an
Administrative Consent Order. The Department, shall include appropriate
monitoring, reporting, and penalties into an Administrative Consent Order that
relates to a second extension, and shall enter into such an agreement only upon
a good-faith showing by the industrial user of the actions taken to achieve
compliance with this provision.
   (d)   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. All users shall comply
with the applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standards and
requirements promulgated pursuant to the Act as set forth in 40 C.F.R.
Subchapter N, Effluent Guidelines and Standards, which are hereby incorporated
by reference and with all other applicable standards and requirements,
provided, however, that where a more stringent standard or requirement is
applicable pursuant to State law or regulation, or to this division, then the
more stringent standard or requirement shall be controlling. Affected
dischargers shall comply with applicable reporting requirements under 40 C.F.R.
Part 403 and as established by the Department. The National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards which have been promulgated as of the effective date of
this section are delineated in Appendix A at the end of this chapter.
      (1)   Intake water adjustment. Industrial users seeking adjustment of the
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards to reflect the presence of
pollutants in their intake water must comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R.
403.15. Upon notification of the approval of the U.S. EPA, the adjustment shall
be applied by modifying the permit accordingly. Intake water adjustments are
not effective until incorporated into an industrial user's permit.
      (2)   Modification of Standards. The Control Authority may apply to the
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, or the United States
Environmental Protection Agency, whichever is applicable, for authorization to
grant removal credits in accordance with the requirements and procedures of 40
C.F.R. 403.7. Such authorization may be granted only when the POTW treatment
plant can achieve consistent removal for each pollutant for which removal
credit is being sought, provided that any limitation on such pollutant(s) in
the NPDES permit are neither being exceeded nor pose the prospect of being
exceeded as a result of the removal credit being granted. Should this
authorization be given to the Control Authority, any industrial user desiring
to obtain such credit shall make an application to the Control Authority,
consistent with the provisions of 40 C.F.R. 403.7 and this chapter. Any credits
which may be granted under this provision may be subject to modification or
revocation as specified in 40 C.F.R. 403.7 or as determined by the Control
Authority. A prerequisite to the granting of any removal credit may be that the
industrial user pay a surcharge based on the amounts of such pollutants removed
by the POTW, such surcharge being based on fees or rates which the Board may
establish and, when appropriate, revise from time to time. Permits shall
reflect or be modified to effect any credit granted pursuant to this section.
      (3)   New sources. Industrial users who meet the new sources criteria
shall install, maintain in operating condition and "start-up" all pollution
control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before
beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time and not to exceed 90
days, new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards.
      (4)   Concentration and mass limits. When limits in a categorical
pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit
of production, the Department may convert the limits to equivalent limitations
expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent
concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to
individual industrial users. Equivalent limitations shall be calculated in
accordance with Sections 40 C.F.R. 403.6(c)(3) and/or 40 C.F.R. 403.6(c)(4) and
shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of 33 U.S.C. 1317(d)
and of this division. Industrial users will be required to comply with the
equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from
which the equivalent limitations were derived.
      (5)   Reporting requirements for industrial users upon effective date of
categorical pretreatment standards-baseline report. Within 180 days after the
effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the
final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission
under Section 40 C.F.R. 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial
users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently
discharging into or scheduled to discharge into the Detroit POTW shall submit
to the Department a report containing the information listed in 40 C.F.R.
403.12(b)(1) through (7). Where reports containing this information have
already been submitted to the Director or regional administrator in compliance
with the requirement of 40 C.F.R. 128.140(b), the industrial user will not be
required to resubmit this information. At least 90 days before commencement of
any discharge, each new source and any existing sources that become industrial
users after the promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard
shall submit to the Department a report which contains the information listed
in 40 C.F.R. 403.12(b)(1) through (5). In such report, new sources shall
include information concerning the method of pretreatment the source intends to
use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall provide
estimates of the information requested in 40 C.F.R. 403.12(b)(4) and (5).
   (e)   Dilution Prohibited. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an
applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no user shall increase the use
of process water or, in any way, dilute or attempt to dilute a discharge as a
partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve Categorical
Pretreatment Standards or any other pollutant-specific limitation or
requirement imposed by this chapter. Combining in-plant waste drains or
modulating the release of pollutants upstream of the sampling point prior to
the point of discharge into the public sewer shall not be construed as dilution
except as otherwise restricted by National Categorical Pretreatment Standards
or requirements.
   (f)   Hauled-In Waste Water. Any waste material or waste water which is
hauled into or within the service region for discharge to the POTW is subject
to the requirements of this division, including but not limited to permits.
inspection, monitoring and enforcement. Unloading liquid or solid wastes from
hauling vehicles directly into the POTW with or without the benefit of
pretreatment is prohibited, unless the person proposing to unload such wastes
has applied for and received a permit from the Control Authority for unloading
such wastes in accordance with the Board's rules pertaining thereto. The
discharger shall be subject to applicable terms, conditions, surcharges, fees
or rates as established by the Board. Hauled-in waste water shall only be
discharged at points designated by the POTW after authorization or approval
issued pursuant to the general permit requirements specified in this section.
The Control Authority may establish specific limitations for sludges from
municipally owned or operated POTW treatment plants which are different than
the specific limitations in this chapter.
   (g)   Centralized Waste Treatment. It is unlawful for a centralized waste
treatment (CWT) facility to discharge any industrial waste or waste water into
the POTW without a waste water discharge permit from the Department. Any
authorization granted, or permit issued, by the Department to a centralized
waste treatment (CWT) facility shall specify the type of waste water for which
treatment is provided, and discharge approval is sought, from the POTW. Unless
such industrial waste or waste water is determined by the Department to require
further authorization, a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility that has
submitted an application to, and received previous approval from, the
Department to discharge waste water is not required to obtain further
authorization from the Department before discharging such waste water.
   An industrial user that provides centralized waste treatment services and
files an application for the treatment and discharge of such types of waste
water to the POTW shall provide the following minimum information in support
thereof:
      (1)   The general nature, source and process(es) generating the type of
waste water. Any waste water, which is generated from those processes and is
subject to national categorical pretreatment standards as delineated in
Appendix A, shall be so designated;
      (2)   The identity of the toxic pollutants known or suspected to be
present in the waste water;
      (3)   At least one sample report showing the results of an analysis for
the EPA priority pollutants for each type of waste water for which application
is made in division (g)(l) of this section;
      (4)   A statement, that is certified by a professional engineer, which
addresses the treatability and compatibility of the waste water received or
collected by the facility's treatment process(es);
      (5)   The identity of the materials and/or pollutants whose trans port or
treatment are regulated by the EPA, by the State or by any other governmental
agency. Upon request the centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall
provide a copy of its permit and/or license to the Department; and
      (6)   Other information requested by the Department, including but not
limited to information required by division (r)(3) of this section or by rules
adopted by the Board.
   The discharge from a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility will be
deemed approved for those specific types of waste water delineated in a permit
and, upon issuance of such permit in accordance with the procedures contained
in this Section
1042.11, will be deemed approved for discharge into the POTW. The centralized
waste treatment (CWT) facility shall comply with all applicable provisions
contained in this Section
1042.11 regarding permits. In furtherance of its obligations as control
authority, the Department may include in the permit a requirement to report at
selected intervals the information mandated in divisions (g)(1) through (6) of
this section.
   All users granted a permit under this division shall maintain records which,
at a minimum, identify the source, volume, character, and constituents of the
waste water accepted for treatment and disposal. These records may be reviewed
at any time by the Department.
   (h)   Groundwater Discharges.
      (1)   Unless authorization has been granted by. the Department, the
discharge of any groundwater into the POTW is prohibited.
      (2)   The Department may authorize the discharge of groundwater resulting
from maintenance and related activities of gas, steam, or electrical utilities
through the use of general permits. Subject to appropriate reporting
requirements, the general permit shall authorize discharge in accordance with
the terms of the permit. Utilities shall comply with this provision within 180
days after its enactment.
      (3)   If a person who proposes to discharge groundwater resulting from
purge, response activity, or UST projects has applied for and received a permit
from the Department, the Department may authorize the discharge of such waste
water. Permits shall be issued in accordance with the procedures contained in
this Section
1042.11, or in accordance with any rules adopted by the Board.
   (i)   Right of Revision. The Village reserves the right to establish rules
or regulations adopted by the Board, additional or more stringent limitations
or requirements on discharges to the POTW. Ninety days after adoption by the
Board, industrial users shall comply with such rules and regulations.
   (j)   Accidental Discharges.
      (1)   A.   Each industrial user which does not currently have an approved
spill prevention plan or slug control plan shall provide protection from
accidental discharge of prohibitive materials or other substances regulated by
this chapter. Facilities and measures to prevent and abate accidental
discharges shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or industrial user's
cost or expense. Unless the significant user has an approved spill prevention
or slug control plan, all significant users shall submit to the Control
Authority detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide
protection against accidental discharges. All existing significant users shall
complete and submit such plans within 180 days of the effective date of this
chapter. New significant users shall submit such a plan prior to the time they
commence discharging.
         B.   For purposes of this section, the information provided shall
include the approximate average and maximum quantities of such prohibited
materials or substances kept on the premises in the form of raw materials,
chemicals and/or waste therefrom and the containment capacity for each. Only
substances that are in a form which could readily be carried into the POTW and
constitute a concentration of 5% or greater in the raw material, chemical
solution or waste material, are required to be reported. Volumes of less than
55 gallons, or the equivalent thereof, need not be reported unless lesser
quantities could cause pass-through or cause interference with the POTW.
         C.   The industrial user shall promptly notify the Department of any
significant changes or modifications to the plan, including but not limited to
a change in the contact person or substance inventory.
      (2)   At least once every two years, the Department shall evaluate
whether a significant industrial user needs a plan to control slug discharges,
as defined by 40 C.F.R. 403.8(f)(2)(v). Unless otherwise provided, all
significant users shall complete, implement and submit such a plan within 30
days of notification by the Department.
   (k)   Notification Requirements. Unless a different notice is provided by
this division or application law, within one hour of becoming aware of a
discharge into the POTW which exceeds or does not conform to Federal, State,
Control Authority or Village laws, rules, regulations or permit requirements,
or which could cause problems to the POTW, or which has the potential to cause
the industrial user to implement its plan prepared in accordance with this
section, the industrial user shall telephone the Control Authority at its
control center and notify the Control Authority of the discharge. The
notification shall include the name of the caller, the location and time of
discharge, the type of waste water, the estimated concentration of excessive or
prohibited pollutants and estimated volume. Within five calendar days after the
discharge, the industrial user shall submit a detailed written report
describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user
to prevent similar future occurrences. When required by the Control Authority,
the industrial user's waste water discharge permit shall be modified to include
additional measures to prevent such future occurrences. Such notifications
shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damages or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills,
or any other environmental impairment or any other damage to person or
property. However, notification received pursuant to this division or
information obtained by the exploitation of such notification shall not be used
against any individual in any criminal case, except in prosecution for perjury
or for giving a false statement. Such immunity shall not bar the criminal
prosecution of non- natural persons nor shall it bar the pursuit of
administration or civil remedies against any person.
   (l)   Notice to Employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees of
whom to contact in the event of an actual or potential excessive or prohibitive
discharge.
   (m)   Recovery of Costs. Any user discharging in violation of any of the
provisions of this chapter, which discharge produces a deposit or obstruction,
or causes damage to or impairs the POTW, or causes the City of Detroit to
violate its NPDES permit, shall be liable for any expense, loss, damage,
penalty or fine incurred because of said violation or discharge. Prior to
assessing such costs, the Control Authority shall notify the user of its
determination that the user's discharge was the proximate cause of such damage,
obstruction, impairment or violation of the City of Detroit's NPDES permit and
the intent to assess such costs to the user. Any such notice shall include
written documentation which substantiates the determination of proximate cause
and a breakdown of cost estimates. Failure to pay the assessed costs shall
constitute a violation of this chapter. Such charge shall be in addition to,
not in lieu of, any penalties or remedies provided in this chapter or in other
ordinances, statutes or regulations, at law or in equity.
   (n)   Hazardous Waste Notification. All industrial users who discharge into
the Village Collection System shall notify the Department in writing of any
discharge of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous
waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261. Such notification must comply with
the requirements of 40 C.F.R. 403.12(p).
   (o)   Authorized Representative. The authorized representative, as defined
in Section

Section
1042.03(3);
      (2)   The authorization specifies either an individual or a position
having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility where the
industrial discharge originates, such as the position of plant manager,
operator of a well or well field superintendent, or a position of equivalent
responsibility, or having overall responsibility for environmental matters for
the company; and
      (3)   The written authorization is submitted to the Department.
   (p)   Pollution Prevention. The Department shall encourage and support
industrial users to develop and implement pollution prevention programs which
eliminate or reduce pollutant contributions beyond the levels required by this
section. The Department may require an industrial user to implement pollution
prevention initiatives as part of an enforcement response, or as necessary to
comply with its NPDES permit.
   (q)   Fees.
      (1)   It is the purpose of this division to provide for the recovery of
costs from industrial users of the POTW. The applicable charges and fees shall
be sufficient to meet the cost of the operation, maintenance, improvement or
replacement of the system or as provided by law, contractual agreement or Board
action.
      (2)   Charges and fees shall include, but not be limited to:
         A.   Fees for reimbursement of costs of establishing, operating,
maintaining or improving the Control Authority's industrial waste control and
pretreatment programs;
         B.   User fees based on volume of waste and concentration or quantity
of specific pollutants in the discharge; and
         C.   Reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs for hearings,
including but not limited to expenses regarding hearings officers, court

Authority, and additional information and data are required which shall be
promptly furnished. Where appropriate, the industrial user is notified
regarding specific information that is missing, or that the application is
unacceptable;
      D.   The industrial user is required to have a waste water discharge
permit. The Department shall notify the industrial user of its determination
and the basis of the determination. The Control Authority may withhold issuance
of a permit to a significant user which has not submitted a report, or has
submitted an inadequate or untimely report, to the Control Authority in
accordance with the baseline reporting requirements of 40 C.F.R. 403.12. If the
Control Authority determines that an industrial user is required to have a
waste water discharge permit and has evaluated and accepted the data furnished,
the industrial user will be notified accordingly by certified mail, and the
Village shall be notified by first class mail.
      Notification shall contain a copy of the proposed permit, so marked for
the industrial user's review. An industrial user may contest the determination
of the Control Authority or any term or condition of the waste water discharge
permit, including modifications thereof, by filing a request for
reconsideration in accordance with the procedures set forth in this chapter. In
the event of such request, the contested terms and conditions of the proposed
permit shall be stayed pending the Control Authority's review of the contested
issues. If the permit is not contested or if the industrial user fails to
respond within 20 days after receipt of the proposed permit, the permit may be
issued as proposed. A permit shall be issued upon resolution of the Control
Authority of any contested terms or conditions. Only one facility location
shall be included in each permit.
      (5)   Permit conditions. Waste water discharge permits shall contain all
requirements of 40 C.F.R. 403.8(f)(1)(iii) and shall be deemed to incorporate
all provisions of this section, other applicable laws, rules, regulations and
user charges and fees established by the City of Detroit or Village without
repetition therein.
      Permits may also contain the following:
         A.   Limits on the average and maximum waste water constituents or
characteristics which are equivalent, more restrictive than, or supplemental to
the numeric limits enumerated in this Section
1042.11, or the applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standards;
         B.   Limits on average and maximum rate in time of discharge or
requirements for flow regulation and equalization;
         C.   Requirements for installation, operation and maintenance of
discharge sampling manholes and monitoring facilities by the industrial user;
         D.   Restrictions on which of the user's discharge waste streams are
to be allowed to be discharged at each point of connection to the POTW;
         E.   Specifications for industrial user monitoring programs, which may
include sampling locations, frequency and type of sampling, number, types and
standards for tests and a reporting schedule;
         F.   Requirements for the prevention of accidental discharges and the
containment of spills or slug discharges;
         G.   Restrictions based on the information furnished in the
application;
         H.   Reporting requirements, in addition to the above.
            1.   All permittees shall submit a report to the Control Authority
in the prescribed form, or in an alternative approved form, indicating the
status of compliance with all conditions enumerated or referred to in the waste
water discharge permit or made applicable to the permit by this chapter. The
report shall be submitted at six-month intervals, unless required more
frequently, on the schedule to be established by the Control Authority for each
permittee. Analytical data generated by the Department may not be submitted in
lieu of the facility's own monitoring data as required by the waste water
discharge permit.
            2.   Permittees not subject to National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards or requirements shall submit compliance in accordance with division
(r)(5)H.4. of this section. The report shall show the concentration of each
substance for which there is a specific limitation in the permit or which may
be identified by the Control Authority in accordance with division (r)(5)I. of
this section.
            3.   Permittees subject to National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards or requirements shall submit compliance reports at the times and
intervals specified by federal regulations and by the Department. A compliance
report shall be submitted to the Department no later than 90 days following the
final compliance date for a standard, or in the case of a new source, no later
than 90 days, following commencement of the introduction of waste water into
the POTW and in accordance with 40 C.F.R. 403.12(d). A report on continued
compliance shall be submitted at six-month intervals thereafter on the schedule
established by the Department and incorporated into the industrial user's
discharge permit and in accordance with division (r)(5)H.4. of this section.
The reports shall be either on a form prescribed by the Department or on an
alternate form provided by the Department, and shall indicate the nature and
concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process
which are limited by National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or for which
there is a specific limitation in the permit, or which may be identified by the
Department in accordance with this division (r)(5)H. The report shall include a
record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the
reporting period for the discharges regulated by the permit. The combined
wastestream formula may be used for reporting purposes after the initial
information has been furnished to the Department, provided there have been no
changes to the elements composing the combined wastestream.
            4.   a.   Reports shall contain the results of representative
sampling performed during the period covered by the report and of the discharge
and analysis of pollutants contained therein, and, for significant industrial
users subject to production-based standards, shall be cross- referenced to the
related flow or production and mass as required to determine compliance with
the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be as
prescribed in the applicable general pretreatment regulations, being 40 C.F.R.
Part 403, or by the Department, but no less than is necessary to assess and
assure compliance by the industrial user with the most stringent applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. All sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with applicable regulations contained in 40 C.F.R. Part
136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 C.F.R. Part 136 does not include sampling
or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, sampling and analysis
shall be performed using validated analytical methods approved by the
administrator.
               b.   If an industrial user monitors any pollutant more
frequently than required by the Department using the procedures as prescribed
in this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in such
report. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards
are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operation and
maintenance practices and/or pretreatment system improvements or changes are
necessary to bring the industrial user into compliance with the applicable
pretreatment standards.
            5.   This report, and those required under divisions (d)(5) and (r)
(5)H.4. of this Section
1042.11, shall include the follow certification statement: "I certify under
penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my
direction or supervision, in accordance with a system designed to assure that
qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted.
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those
persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information
submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate and
complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false
information, including the possibility of a fine and/or imprisonment for
knowing violations." Said certification shall be signed by the facility's
authorized representative, as defined in Section
1042.03(3) of this Code. If an authorization is no longer accurate because a
different individual or position has responsibility for the overall operation
of the facility, or overall responsibility for environmental matters for the
company, a new authorization satisfying the requirements of the authorized
representative definition must be submitted to the Department prior to, or
together with, any reports to be signed by an authorized representative.
            6.   If sampling performed by a permittee indicates a violation,
the user shall notify the Department within 24 hours of the time said user
becomes, or should have become aware of the violation. In addition, the user
shall repeat the sampling and analysis, and submit the results of the repeat
analysis to the Department within 30 days after said user becomes, or should
have become, aware of the violation.
         I.   In the event the Director determines that an industrial user is
discharging substances in quality, quantity or at locations which may cause
problems to the POTW or the receiving stream, the Department has the authority
to develop and enforce effluent limits applicable to the user. To the extent
the Department seeks to impose restrictions in a permit which are more
restrictive than established in this division. the Department shall provide
written documentation to explain the greater restriction for protection against
pass-through, interference or violation of the NPDES permit;
         J.   Requirement for pollution prevention initiatives; and
   K.   Other requirements reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with this
chapter;
      (6)   Permit duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time
period, not to exceed five years. A permit may be issued for a lesser period of
time or may be stated to expire on a specific date. However, permits shall not
be issued for a period less than one year. The existing permit for significant
industrial users who timely submit an application for permit reissuance to the
Department shall be automatically extended until a permit is issued as final.
      (7)   Permit modification. The terms and conditions of the permit may be
subject to modification by the Control Authority during the term of the permit
as limitations or requirements identified in divisions (c)(1) and (2) of this
section are amended or if other just cause exists. Just cause for a permit
modification includes, but shall not be limited to, the following:
         A.   Material or substantial changes to an industrial user's facility
or operation or changes in the characteristics of the industrial user's
effluent. It shall be the industrial user's duty to request an application form
and apply for a modification of the permit within 30 calendar days of the
change.
         B.   Change(s) in the City of Detroit's NPDES permit;
         C.   Embodiment of the provisions of a conciliation agreement, court
settlement or order;
         D.   Any changes necessary to allow the City of Detroit to fulfill its
role as Control Authority;
         E.   An industrial user's noncompliance with portions of an existing
permit;
         F.   A change of conditions within the POTW;
         G.   A finding of interference or pass through attributable to the
industrial user;
         H.   Amendments to, or promulgation of, National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards or requirements, including 40 C.F.R. Part 403 and those
delineated in Appendix A of this chapter. Permittees shall request an
application form and apply to the Control Authority for a modified permit
within ninety days after the promulgation of a new or revised National
Categorical Pretreatment Standard to which the industrial user shall be
subject. Information submitted pursuant to this division shall be confined to
that information related to the newly promulgated or amended National
Categorical Pretreatment Standard or requirement. However, information
previously submitted may not be duplicated, insofar as previously submitted
information continues to be current and applicable. The Control Authority may
also initiate this action. The industrial user shall be informed of any
proposed change in its permit at least 60 days prior to the proposed effective
date of the change for any change initiated by the Control Authority, unless
such change is the result of any enforcement action taken pursuant to this
chapter;
         I.   Changes in the monitoring location. (See division (s) of this
section);
         J.   Typographical errors or omissions in permits;
         K.   The Department may modify the permit on its own initiative, based
on its findings or reasonable belief of the above; or
         L.   The user may request a modification of the permit.
      When initiated by the Department, the industrial user shall be informed
of any proposed change in its permit. The Department will issue a draft permit,
and an industrial user has 30 days to file a response to the draft modified
permit. Thereafter, the Department will issue a final permit and, unless
appealed in accordance with the procedures contained in division (x) of this
section the permit will become effective 20 days after issuance.
      (8)   Permit custody and transfer. Waste water discharge permits are
issued to a specific person as defined herein for a specific discharge. A waste
water discharge permit shall not be re-assigned or transferred or sold to a
different person, new owner, new industrial user, different premises or a new
or changed operation without the written approval of the Control Authority. It
shall be the permit holder's duty to notify the Department of any such change
at least 30 days before the date of the change. Waste water discharge permits
which do not receive the written approval of the Department prior to the change
shall be null and void, regardless of reassignment, transfer, or sale. The
Control Authority may revoke a permit if it determines that an unreported
change has occurred. The Control Authority may require the application for a
new or modified permit if a change takes place. Any succeeding person shall
comply with the terms and conditions of any existing permit which the Control
Authority allows to be retained.
      (9)   Permit notification requirements. All industrial users shall
promptly notify the Department in advance of any substantial change in the
volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or
characteristic hazardous waste for which initial notification under 40 C.F.R.
403.12(p) has been made, request a permit application form, and apply for a
modification of the permit at least 30 calendar days prior to the change.
Failure of the industrial user to so apply shall be considered a violation of
this division.
   (s)   Monitoring Facilities. Significant industrial users shall provide,
operate and maintain at their own expense a sampling manhole or special
structure to facilitate monitoring, inspection, sampling, and flow measurement
of their discharge, by the Department and the industrial user, and to enable
the Control Authority to conduct such other monitoring, inspection and sampling
as required for determining compliance with discharge requirements, limits and
standards as provided by this chapter. In the event the Department determines
that the monitoring facility identified in the permit application is
inadequate, a new monitoring facility must be identified, or provided, which
shall allow for collection of a representative sample of the waste water
discharged from the facility. Unless otherwise determined at the discretion of
the Department, said facility shall be provided within 90 days of receipt of
notification by the Department. The industrial user shall provide the
Department with:
      (1)   A drawing showing all sewer connections and sampling manholes by
the size, location, elevation and points or places of discharges into the POTW;
      (2)   A flow schematic showing (i) which connections receive each
national categorical process wastestream; (ii) which connections receive storm
water, sanitary water or cooling water, and (iii) which lines handle each
combined wastestream. This report shall be certified by a professional
engineer. If a significant industrial user fails to install the monitoring
facilities within the prescribed time limits, then the Department may install
such structure or device and the significant user shall reimburse the
Department for any costs incurred therein.
   The sampling manholes should be situated on the industrial user's premises
in a location readily accessible to the Control Authority. It shall be the
responsibility of the industrial user to obtain any necessary approvals from
the Village or other government entities, which approvals may be required
because of the location and construction of monitoring facilities in a public
street or sidewalk area. Such construction shall occur only when another
location would be impractical or cause undue hardship upon the industrial
users. In no case shall the location be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling or monitoring
manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis. The facility and any permanently installed sampling and measuring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition at the expense of the industrial user. Whether constructed on public
or private property, the sampling and monitoring facility shall be provided in
accordance with the Control Authority's requirements and all applicable local
construction standards and specifications.
   (t)   Inspection Sampling and Record Keeping.
      (1)   For purposes of administering and enforcing this chapter, the
Control Authority may inspect the establishment, facility or other premises of
the industrial user. The Control Authority shall have ready access to the
industrial user's premises to engage in inspection, sampling, compliance,
monitoring and/or metering activities. Each such inspection or sampling
activity shall be commenced and completed at reasonable times, within
reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner. The Control Authority shall, upon
arrival at the industrial user's premises, inform the industrial user or the
industrial user's employees that sampling and/or inspection is commencing and
that the industrial user has the right to observe the inspection and/or
sampling. The Control Authority shall neither refrain from nor be prevented or
delayed from carrying out its inspection or sampling duties due to the
unavailability of the authorized representative of the facility to observe or
participate in the inspection or sampling activity. While performing work on
private properties, the Control Authority in the Village shall observe all
reasonable safety, security and other reasonable rules applicable to the
premises established by the industrial user. Representatives of the Control
Authority shall bear proper credentials and identification and shall be
accompanied by a representative of the industrial user, at the industrial
user's option. The Control Authority shall have no authority to inquire into
any process beyond that point having a direct bearing on the kind and source of
discharge into the POTW.
      (2)   However, such employees or representatives shall not be restricted
from viewing any of the facility site. The Control Authority may take
photographs of facilities subject to this chapter, unless specifically
prohibited by the industrial user upon request to be permitted to take
photographs. Where an industrial user has security measures in force, the
industrial user shall make prompt and necessary arrangements with the security
personnel so that upon a presentation of appropriate credentials, the Control
Authority will be permitted to enter immediately for the purposes of performing
its specific responsibilities. Significant users shall sample and analyze their
discharges in accordance with the provisions of their permits. The Control
Authority may request such samples to be split with the Control Authority for
the Control Authority's independent analysis. Industrial users shall maintain
records of all information from monitoring activities required by this chapter
or by 40 C.F.R. 403.12(n). Industrial users shall maintain the records for no
less than three years. This period of record retention shall be extended during
the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the discharge of pollutants
by the industrial user, or regarding the operation of the City of Detroit's
industrial pretreatment program, or when requested by the Control Authority,
the EPA or the State. Industrial users shall, upon the request of the Control
Authority, furnish information and records relating to discharges to the POTW.
Industrial users shall make such records readily accessible at all reasonable
times and allow the Control Authority to copy such records. In the event the
Control Authority obtains samples, and analyses are made of such samples, a
copy of the results of such analyses shall be promptly furnished to the owner,
operator or agent in charge of the premises upon written request by the
industrial user's authorized representative. When requested by the industrial
user, the Control Authority shall leave a portion of any sample of the user's
discharge taken from any sampling point on or adjacent to the premises for the
user's independent analysis. In cases of disputes arising over shared samples,
the portion taken and analyzed by the Control Authority shall be controlling
unless proven invalid. In the event a grab sample of the industrial user's
discharge is obtained and analyzed in accordance with 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and
found to contain concentrations or pollutants which are two or more times
greater than the numeric limitations for composite samples as listed in
division (c)(1) of this section, the industrial user shall implement its slug
control plan, and shall be required to provide a written report describing the
cause of greater concentration and a description of the means by which such
concentration may be held to values of less than two times the composite sample
concentration limitation in the future.
   (u)   Confidential Information.
      (1)   Information and data on an industrial user obtained from written
reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits, monitoring programs and
inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agencies
without restriction unless the industrial user specifically requests
confidentiality and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Control
Authority that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of
the industrial user. All claimed confidential information must be clearly
marked "confidential." When requested by the person furnishing the report, the
portions of a report which disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not
be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available
upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter,
the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, the State
disposal system permit and/or pretreatment programs, provided, however, that
such information shall be treated as confidential by the governmental agency,
until such time as the information has been determined to be non-confidential
by the governmental agency. Confidential information on industrial users, which
the Department releases pursuant to a request of another governmental agency,
should be handled by the other governmental agency pursuant to its own
confidentiality procedures. The Department cannot control how another
governmental agency handles such confidential information, and assumes no
responsibility for the disposition of the information released to the
governmental agency. The Department will use sufficient care to inform the
other governmental agency of the existence of the industrial user's
confidentiality claim. The Department shall determine whether the information
requested to be treated as confidential, in fact, satisfies the requirements of
confidential information as defined herein. The decision of the Department
shall be made in writing. Waste water constituents and characteristics will not
be recognized as confidential information. Information accepted by the Control
Authority as confidential shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency
until and unless a ten-day notification of intent to transmit is first given to
the industrial user.
      (2)   Except as otherwise determined by the Department or provided for by
applicable law, all information with respect to an industrial user on file with
the Control Authority shall be made available upon request by that user or the
user's authorized representative during normal business hours.
   (v)   Statutes, Laws and Regulations. The National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards defined in 40 C.F.R. Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471, shall be
and are incorporated by reference herein and made a part hereof. Unless
otherwise provided, any reference in this chapter to a code, standard, rule,
regulation or law enacted, adopted, established or promulgated by any private
organization, or any element or organization of government other than the
Village, shall be construed to apply only to such code, standard, rule,
regulation or law in effect or existence on the date of enactment of this
chapter.
   (w)   Enforcement.
      (1)   Violations. It shall be a violation of this chapter for any user
to:
         A.   Fail to completely and/or accurately report the waste water
constituents and/or characteristics of the industrial user's discharge;
         B.   Fail to report significant changes in the industrial user's
operations or waste water constituents and/or characteristics within the time
frames provided in division (r)(7) of this section;
         C.   Refuse reasonable access to the industrial user's premises, waste
discharge, or sample location for the purpose of inspection or monitoring;
         D.   Restrict, lockout or prevent, directly or indirectly, access to
any monitoring facilities constructed on public or private property. The
locking or securing of the monitoring facility shall not constitute a violation
pursuant to this division, provided that, upon request, reasonable access to
the facility is promptly provided to the Department;
         E.   Restrict interfere, tamper with, or render inaccurate any of the
Department's monitoring devices, including but not limited to samplers;
         F.   Fail to comply with any condition or requirement of the
industrial user's waste water discharge permit;
   G.   Fail to comply with any limitation, prohibition or requirement of this
chapter, including any rule, regulation or order issued hereunder. However, if
an industrial user acts in full accordance with a compliance schedule approved
and incorporated into the industrial user's waste water discharge permit
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, that industrial user shall be
deemed to be in compliance with those requirements of this chapter addressed by
the compliance schedule. Industrial users acting in full compliance with waste
water discharge permits issued prior to the effective date of this chapter
shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this chapter, and
such permits shall remain in effect and be enforceable under this chapter until
the expiration date of such permit or until a superseding permit is issued,
whichever occurs first. Industrial users shall comply with National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards and requirements on the date specified in the Federal
regulations, regardless of compliance schedules.
      (2)   Upsets. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an
action brought for noncompliance with limits imposed under this chapter or
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards if the requirements of this
division (v)(2) are met.
         A.   An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative
defense shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs or other relevant evidence, that:
            1.   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the
specific cause(s) of the upset;
            2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
            3.   The industrial user has submitted the following information to
the department, orally or in writing, within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
upset, except that if this information is provided orally, a written submission
must be provided within five days:
               a.   A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance;
               b.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and
times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected
to continue;
               c.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
         B.   In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
         C.   The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to
the extent necessary to maintain compliance with this chapter upon reduction,
loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in a
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
      (3)   Bypass. Bypasses are prohibited unless the bypass does not cause a
violation of pretreatment standards or requirements, but only if it is for
essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the treatment system.
These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of divisions (w)(3)A. and B.
of this section.
         A.   Notice of anticipated bypass. Industrial users anticipating a
bypass shall submit notice to the Department at least ten days in advance.
         B.   Notice of unanticipated bypass. An industrial user shall submit
oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes or should
have become aware of the pass. A written submission shall be provided within
five days of the time the industrial user becomes or should have become aware
of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue, and steps taken or
planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
         C.   Prohibition of bypass and enforcement. Bypass is prohibited, and
the Department may take enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated waste, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
            3.   The industrial user properly notified the Department as
described in (w)(3)B. of this section.
         D.   Bypass approval. Where it meets all conditions in division (w)
(3)C. of this section, the Department may approve an anticipated bypass.
      (4)   Emergency suspension and orders. The Control Authority may order
suspension of the sewer or waste water treatment service and/or a waste water
discharge permit where such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the
Control Authority, to stop any actual or threatened discharge which presents or
may present an imminent or significant hazard to the health or welfare of
persons or to the environment, interferes or may interfere with the POTW, or
causes or may cause the City of Detroit to violate any condition of its NPDES
permit. Any person notified of a suspension of the sewer or waste water
treatment service and/or the waste water discharge permit shall immediately
stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to
comply voluntarily with a suspension or revocation order, the Control Authority
shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection or services, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system
or danger to any individual or the environment. In the event such steps are
taken, the Director shall notify the industrial user in writing within 24 hours
of such action and the recourse available and shall provide the industrial user
with an opportunity for a hearing before the Director or his or her designated
representative within ten days of such action. The Control Authority shall
notify the Village whenever notification is made to an industrial user pursuant
to this division, in writing, within 72 hours of such action.
   The Control Authority shall reinstate the waste water discharge permit and/
or the sewer or waste water treatment service upon proof of the elimination of
the noncompliant discharge. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written
statement to the Control Authority within 15 days of the occurrence describing
the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any
future occurrence. Upon proof of elimination of the noncomplying discharge, the
Department shall reinstate the waste water discharge permit and/or the sewer or
waste water treatment service.
      (5)   Notice of violation. Except in the case of any actual or threatened
discharge as specified in division (w)(3) of this section, whenever the Control
Authority has reason to believe that any industrial user has violated or is
violating this chapter, the Control Authority shall serve upon such industrial
user a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Where applicable,
the Department shall pursue appropriate escalating enforcement action as
defined within its approved enforcement response plan. The failure of the
Department to issue a notice of violation shall not preclude the Department
from escalating its enforcement response.
      (6)   Notice of Control Authority action. The Village or a designated
department thereof shall be notified by the Control Authority of any
enforcement activity taken within its boundaries.
      (7)   Administrative actions. Whenever the Control Authority has
reasonable grounds to believe that a user is violating, or has violated a
provision of its waste water discharge permit, or a pretreatment standard or
requirement or ay prohibition of this section, the Department, except in the
case of emergency or flagrant violation, may initiate appropriate
administrative enforcement action in order to compel the industrial user to
eliminate or to remedy such violation as soon as possible.
         A.   Conferences. The Control Authority may order any person who
violates this chapter to attend a conference wherein the Control Authority may
endeavor to cause the user to eliminate or remedy the violation by establishing
an enforceable compliance schedule. The notice of violations shall be served at
least ten days before the scheduled conference and shall set forth the date,
time and place thereof. The Village shall be notified in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the delegation agreement which it shall enter into with
the Control Authority. The conference shall be conducted by a representative of
the Control Authority. The industrial user shall present a plan and schedule
for achieving compliance with this chapter. The conference attendees may agree
upon a compliance schedule which sets forth the terms and conditions and time
period or schedule for full compliance. Nothing contained herein shall require
the Control Authority to accept or agree to any proposed plan or schedule or
prevent the Control Authority from proceeding with the show cause hearing as
set forth in division (w)(7)D. of this section. Should the attendees agree to a
compliance schedule, the user and the Department's duly authorized
representative may enter, by consent, into a compliance agreement or an
administrative order setting forth the terms of such agreement. An industrial
user must make good faith and expeditious efforts to comply with this chapter
and any procedures, requirements and agreements hereunder.
         B.   Compliance schedules. The user and the Department may agree upon
a schedule which sets forth the terms and conditions, and time periods or
schedules for completion of actions to remedy or to eliminate the causes of
violation. These schedules may be developed as part of a compliance agreement,
or an administrative consent order. Schedules developed under this division
shall adhere to the following conditions:
            1.   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form
of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of upgraded or additional pretreatment facilities,
or to the implementation of additional operation and maintenance procedures
required for the industrial user to meet the applicable pretreatment
requirements and standards, including but not limited to hiring an engineer,
completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contracts for
major components, commencing construction, and completing construction;
            2.   No single increment referred to in division (r)(5)H. of this
section shall exceed nine months:
            3.   Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and
the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress
report to the Department, including, at a minimum, whether it complied with the
increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date which it
expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason(s) for delay, and
the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the established
schedule; and
            4.   Any deviations from the compliance schedule may result in the
industrial user being found in violation of this division.
         C.   The Department may order any industrial user who violates or
continues to violate this division or a duly issued permit to install and to
properly operate devices, treatment facilities, or other related appurtenances.
In addition, orders may contain such other requirements as might reasonably be
necessary and appropriate to address the violation, including the installation
of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring and management
practices, implementation of a waste minimization assessment to identify and
implement feasible source reduction, and recycling practices to reduce the
generation or release of pollutants at the facility. An order may be either an
administrative consent order, which is the result of an agreement, or a
unilateral administrative order.
         D.   Show cause hearing. The Control Authority may order any
industrial user who violates this chapter, or allows such violation to occur,
to show cause before the Control Authority why a proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the industrial user specifying
the time and place of the hearing before the Control Authority regarding the
violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, and the proposed
enforcement action, and directing the industrial user to show cause before the
Control Authority why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The
notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days before the hearing with
copies to be provided to the Village as provided to the delegation agreement.
Service may be on any agent or officer of a corporation or authorized
representative.
   E.   Hearing proceeding. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with
the procedures adopted by the Board. A hearing officer shall conduct a show
cause hearing and take the evidence, and may:
            1.   Issue in the name of the Control Authority notices of hearings
requesting the attendance and the testimony of the witnesses and production of
evidence relevant to any matter involving such hearings;
            2.   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations, to the Director
and the Village for action thereon.
            At any show cause hearing held pursuant to this chapter, testimony
taken must be under oath and recorded by a court reporter.
            3.   After a show cause hearing has been conducted, an order may be
issued to the industrial user by the Control Authority directing any of the
following actions:
               a.   Immediate compliance with the industrial user's waste water
discharge permit or with any applicable limitation, condition, restriction or
requirement of this chapter or applicable local, State or Federal law or
regulation;
               b.   Pretreatment of waste by installation of adequate treatment
equipment, or by proper operation and maintenance of existing treatment
equipment, within a specified time period. Sewer or waste water treatment
service may be discontinued upon failure to comply.
               c.   Submission of compliance reports on effluent quantity and
quality as determined by self-monitoring and analysis during a specified time
period;
               d.   Submission of period reports on effluent quality and
quantity as determined by self-monitoring analysis throughout the final period
set by a compliance date;
               e.   Control of discharge quantities;
               f.   Payment of costs and reasonable and necessary inspection,
monitoring and administration of the industrial user's activities by the
Control Authority during compliance efforts; and/or
               g.   Any such other orders as are appropriate, including, but
not limited to, immediate termination of sewer or waste water treatment
services, or revocation of a waste water discharge permit, or orders directing
that, following a specified time period, sewer or waste water treatment service
will be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or operation
and maintenance practices have been employed.
               h.   A finding the user has demonstrated by a preponderance of
the evidence that a violation, either of this division or of a duly issued
permit, did not occur.
         F.   Public notification of significant noncompliance. The Department
shall publish in the largest daily newspaper published in the City of Detroit
and the Village a list of all industrial users which were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment requirements at any time during the
previous 12 months. All industrial users identified in the proposed publication
shall be provided with a copy of that proposed notice at least 30 days before
publication and with an opportunity to comment as to its accuracy.
      (8)   Legal actions.
         A.   Any user who violates any provision of this chapter, including
the failure to pay any fees, charges or surcharges imposed hereby, or violates
any condition or limitation of a permit issued pursuant hereto, or knowingly
makes any false statement, representation or certification in any application,
record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained
pursuant to this chapter or a waste water discharge permit, or tampers with, or
knowingly renders inaccurate, any monitoring device required under this
chapter, is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to the penalty
provided in Section
1042.99. The Control Authority is hereby authorized, consistent with the terms
and conditions of the delegation agreement entered into by the Village with the
Control Authority, to seek, through the Village Attorney, prosecution of
criminal charges against any person violating any provision of this chapter.
         B.   If any person discharges sewage, industrial waste or other waste
into the POTW contrary to the provisions of this chapter, or a permit or order
issued hereunder, the Village or the Control Authority, or both, may commence a
civil action to enjoin such discharge or to enforce compliance with this
chapter or a permit or order issued hereunder, in the Circuit Court for the
County of Oakland or other appropriate court. Upon a proper showing of a
violation of this chapter, or a permit or order issued hereunder, a permanent
or temporary injunction may be granted without bond. The Control Authority or
the Village, or both, may also seek additional legal and/or equitable relief.
Instituting suit in a circuit court does not constitute an exclusive election
of remedies and does not prohibit the Control Authority or the Village from
commencing action in Federal court for discharges believed to be in violation
of this chapter, State and Federal requirements pursuant to the Clean Water
Act, the City of Detroit's NPDES permit, or other applicable laws or
requirements. The Control Authority or the Village may also recover reasonable
attorneys' fees, court costs, court reporters' fees and other unusual expenses
related to enforcement activities or litigation against the person found to
have violated this chapter or orders, rules, regulations and permits issued
hereunder.
         C.   All fines, costs and penalties which are imposed by any court of
competent jurisdiction shall be payable to the City of Detroit Water and
Sewerage Department and the Village where applicable.

and appeal, a user may contest actions, determinations, or decisions of the
Department which result from its construction, application and enforcement of
this division. The procedures contained within this section govern
reconsideration and appeal with respect to construction, application, and

shall be conducted neither less than ten days nor more than 30 days after
mailing of the notice. For cause and at the discretion of the hearings officer,
the hearing may be continued for a reasonable time.
         D.   The hearing for reconsideration shall be an informal consultation
and conference where the requester in person, or by counsel, shall present
their argument, evidence, data and proof in connection with the issue(s) being
reconsidered. The parties shall not be bound by the Michigan Rules of Evidence.
The hearing shall be transcribed and the requester may obtain a copy of the
hearing transcript, as appropriate, from the Department or from the court
reporter.
         E.   Within 30 days after the close of the hearing, the hearings

USER CHARGE SYSTEM
1042.12   RATES AND CHARGES ESTABLISHED; REVISIONS; APPLICATION AND BASIS FOR
CHARGES.
   Rates and charges for the use of the sewer system of the Village of Franklin
are hereby established. Revisions to the rates and charges herein shall be
established by resolution of the Village Council as necessary to ensure
sufficiency of revenues to meet the operation, maintenance, replacement and
debt service costs of the system. All premises which may have any connection to
the sewer system, or which may otherwise discharge sewage, industrial waste or
any other substance into the sewer system, either directly or indirectly, shall
be subject to such rates and charges. Because there are no water meters used in
the Village, such charges shall be based upon a flat rate based upon the
estimated quantity of water used therein after adjustment for specific
additional pollutants as described in this chapter.
(Ord. 179. Passed 8-17-92.)
1042.13   RATES AND CHARGES.
   The rates for use of the sewer system shall be as follows for all users of
the system, whether inside or outside of the Village limits:
   (a)   Sewage Disposal Charge. A quarterly charge for sewage disposal shall
be made to each premise connected to the Village of Franklin Sewage Disposal
System in the amount of three hundred dollars and eighty-one cents ($300.81)
per residential equivalent unit (REU) quarterly or as may be established from
time to time. All residential customers with simplex grinder pump installations
will be assigned a value of 1 REU. All residential customers with duplex or
centrifugal pump installations will be assigned a value of 1.5 REUs. REU
assignments for all nonresidential customers will be based on the current
Schedule of Unit Assignment factors, as set forth in Section
1042.14 .
   (b)   Grinder Pump Alarm Installation Charge. For any customers who elected
not to pre-pay for grinder pump alarm installations, the quarterly charge will
be eighty-two dollars and eighty-nine cents ($82.89) per REU, and sixty-six
dollars and thirty-one cents ($66.31) per REU for those who installed their
grinder pump alarm panel after December 31, 2014.
   (c)   Service Fee. A fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per service
call shall be charged for all customer-related grinder pump repairs or
replacements due to system misuse, excessive water discharge, customer power
interruptions, non-grinder pump odors, internal plumbing issues, sump pumps,
well problems and other issues not directly related to the actual operation of
the grinder pump. A customer may appeal the assessment of a service fee to the
Village Administrator who may waive the fee upon determining the customer was
not negligent or at fault for the service call.
   (d)   Industrial Surcharge. An industrial surcharge shall be levied against
industrial and commercial customers contributing sewage to the system with
concentrations of pollutants exceeding the levels described as follows:
      275 milligrams per liter (mg/l) of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
      350 milligrams per liter (mg/l) of total suspended solids (TSS)
       12 milligrams per liter (mg/l) of phosphorus (P)
      100 milligrams per liter (mg/l) of fats, oils and grease (FOG)
 
Amount of                       Total Charge Per
Industrial Surcharge            Pound of Excess Pollutants
Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) $ 0.361
Total suspended solids (TSS)    0.496
Phosphorus (P)                  6.629
Fats, oils and grease (FOG)     0.115
 
      It is assumed that normal domestic customers do not contribute sewage
with concentrations of pollutants exceeding the above levels. Therefore, the
industrial surcharge will not apply to domestic customers. Further, restaurants
shall also be exempt from industrial surcharge per Federal Court Order “Second
Interim Order,” dated July 10, 1981.
   (e)   Industrial Waste Control (IWC). Each nonresidential user will be
billed for industrial waste control based on an assigned water meter size from
the following size schedule and the following charge schedule.

1042.15   FINANCIAL PLAN.
   (a)   The financial plan for the pressure sewer system is as follows: it
will be paid for and maintained by the users of that system, and the Village of
Franklin shall periodically establish suitable and appropriate rates, charges
and fees sufficient to accomplish payment for all capital costs, operation,
maintenance and replacements.
   (b)   The following capital and connection charges are hereby established:
      (1)   For initial grant properties, a one-time capital charge as follows:
         System participation charge   $ 5,565.00
         Additional street pipe   2,000.00
         Total:   $ 7,565.00
      (2)   For subsequently connected properties, a one-time capital charge as
follows:
         Service connection charge (approx.)   $ 1,000.00
         Additional street pipe    2,000.00
         Total (approximate):   $ 3,000.00
   (c)   Initial grant properties will be billed by the Village of Franklin for
the above capital charges. The property owner(s) may elect to pay the total
amount within 30 days of billing or, in the alternative, to pay such charges
over a ten-year period, together with interest on unpaid balances at a rate to
be established by the Village Council. In the event no payment is made within
the 30-day period following billing, then the entire sum billed shall be placed
as a lien on the subject property as if it were an unpaid and delinquent tax.
   (d)   Initial grant properties which have been or may be removed from the
grant funded contract shall be charged the local share of design costs and the
cost of street pipe, grinder pump and service connections covered by the grant,
as well as additional street pipe costs. Such properties shall obtain their own
permits and approvals as provided in this chapter for property owners
installing their own street-to-house segment. Financing methods as set forth in
division (c) of this section may apply.
   (e)   Each property owner connecting to the public sewer system shall be
responsible for construction and installation of any building sewer as well as
all electrical and plumbing connections for such segment, including connections
to the grinder pump. No such work shall proceed until a permit therefor has
been obtained from the Village of Franklin and until applicable permit fees
have been paid and other requirements have been met.
   (f)   Owners of properties to be connected to the public sewer system shall
have the option of either constructing the street-to-house portion themselves
(including the grinder pump) or having such construction completed by the
Village of Franklin through its designated engineers and contractors. All
construction and connections shall comply with this chapter, and specifically
Section
1042.16.
(Ord. 179. Passed 8-17-92; Ord. 182. Passed 2-8-93; Ord. 2001-08. Passed 12-10-
01.)
1042.16   CONSTRUCTION AND COSTS OF SUBSEQUENTLY CONNECTED PROPERTIES.
   (a)   Construction and Connection Performed by Village.
      (1)   Any property owner(s) desiring the Village of Franklin to perform
construction of the street-to-structure segment shall first provide an
appropriate easement in favor of the Village of Franklin. Said instrument shall
be in writing, in a form satisfactory to the Village of Franklin, and shall
provide for a temporary construction easement from the street to the structure
of a width of not less than 20 feet and a permanent maintenance easement not
less than ten feet in width.
      (2)   The Village must receive a nonrefundable payment of four hundred
dollars ($400.00) for the on-site design. Once the design is completed and
approved by the property owner and the Village Engineer, the owner must sign a
construction and O&M easement to allow the designed work to be constructed.
      (3)   The homeowner must obtain electrical and plumbing permits at forty-
five dollars ($45.00) each and hire a contractor to do the necessary plumbing
and electrical work to connect the grinder pump to the house.
      (4)   Once the property is connected to the system, the homeowner will
receive a bill for all actual on-site construction charges for connecting his
or her property to the sewer as well as the charges referred to in Section
1042.15(b)(2). The homeowner may pay these costs in one payment or over a
multi-year period not to exceed 17 years, with interest at a rate to be
determined by the Village Council. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any homeowner
who connects to the sewer after December 31, 1999, shall be required to fully
pay such costs prior to connecting.
      (5)   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (a)(4) of this section,
the owners of newly-constructed homes, the construction of which was commenced
on or after June 8, 1998, that are designated as being on sewer construction
contract "F" or a subsequent contract shall, prior to connecting their property
to the sewer, be required to pay in full all on- site charges for connecting to
the sewer, as well as the charges referred to in Section
1042.15(b)(2), and related installation and engineering charges. The owners of
all new construction that, prior to June 8, 1998, was already completed or in
progress and that is designated as being on contract "F" shall be required to
pay in full all such charges within 30 days of being invoiced by the Village.
   (b)   Construction and Connections Performed by Property Owner.
      (1)   The property owner shall hire a Village-approved contractor. A list
of such contractors will be available in the Village offices. The contractor
shall obtain a permit for one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Included in the
fee are costs of Village administration (fifty dollars ($50.00)) and Oakland
County inspection (one hundred dollars ($100.00)).
      (2)   Before a permit will be issued, the property owner shall provide a
detailed sketch of the location of the grinder pump and lines leading to the
service connection. The homeowner shall sign an O&M easement and agree to
construct the on-site portion according to Village specifications.
      (3)   The property owner must provide:
         A.   A five hundred dollar ($500.00) cash deposit for any emergencies
that may arise while connecting to the system. This is refundable if not used.
         B.   A five thousand dollar ($5,000) surety bond, to ensure that the
connection and on-site construction are made in accordance with then current
rules and regulations and that any damage to the Village-owned sewer is
promptly and properly repaired.
      (4)   Such fees and deposits shall be collected by the Village or its
designated representatives prior to the start of construction. Such fees and
deposits shall be fixed and revised from time to time, as necessary, by the
Village Council so as to insure that all users pay their proportionate share of
the costs of the systems.
      (5)   The property owner shall pay the charges set forth in Section
1042.15(b)(2). Financing methods as set forth in Section
1042.15(c) may apply.
(Ord. 98-183. Passed 10-19-98.)
1042.17   ANNUAL AUDIT; REVIEW AND REVISION OF RATES.
   The rates hereby fixed are estimated to be sufficient to provide for the
expenses of operation, maintenance and replacement of the system and to
preserve the same in good repair and working order. Such rates shall be fixed
and revised from time to time as may be necessary to produce these amounts. An
annual audit shall be prepared. Based on said audit, rates for sewage services
shall be reviewed annually and revised as necessary by the Franklin Village
Council by resolution to meet system expenses and to ensure that all user
classes pay their proportionate share of operation, maintenance and equipment
replacement costs.
(Ord. 179. Passed 8-17-92.)
1042.18   NO FREE SERVICE.
   No free service shall be allowed for any user of the sewer system.
(Ord. 179. Passed 8-17-92.)
1042.19   ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.
   All customers of the Village of Franklin waste water system will receive an
annual notification, either printed on the bill or enclosed in a separate
letter, which will show the breakdown of the waste water disposal bill into its
components for operation, maintenance and replacement and for debt service.
(Ord. 179. Passed 8-17-92.)
1042.20   BILLING FOR SEWER USE; LATE PAYMENT CHARGE.
   (a)   Quarterly bills for operation, maintenance and replacement of the
sewer system shall be sent by United States mail to the address receiving the
sewer service. Bills may be sent to the occupant or to the owner. Failure to
receive a bill for sewer service shall not relieve the owner or occupant from
the responsibility for prompt and complete payment of the bill. Bills shall be
due upon receipt and may be payable for 30 days after the billing date without
penalty.
   (b)   If such charges are not paid within 30 days after the billing date, a
penalty of 10% shall be added thereto, and shall thereafter be subject to a 1%
penalty per month for each additional month, or fraction thereof, that the same
remains unpaid.
(Ord. 179. Passed 8-17-92; Ord. 2005-08. Passed 4-11-05.)
1042.21   COLLECTION OF DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS.
   Unpaid charges for sewer disposal service, or any obligation for sewer
services incurred pursuant to this chapter, or furnished to any premises within
the Village of Franklin, shall be a lien against the premises. Enforcement of
this lien shall be made pursuant to Village codes or ordinances, or under any
applicable statute. Unpaid charges that are more than 90 days delinquent shall
be added to the next tax roll to be collected in the same manner as Village
taxes.
(Ord. 179. Passed 8-17-92.)
SAVINGS AND PENALTY
1042.22   SAVINGS.
   All proceedings pending, and all rights and liabilities existing, acquired
or incurred at the time this chapter takes effect, are hereby saved and may be
consummated according to the law in force when they are commenced, except to
the extent that they shall be superseded, altered or modified by this chapter.
This chapter shall be construed and interpreted so as to give full effect to
the goals and objectives herein stated.
(Ord. 179. Passed 8-17-92.)
1042.99   PENALTY; EQUITABLE REMEDIES.
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: See Section
202.99 for general Code penalty if no specific penalty is provided.)
   Violations of this chapter are hereby declared and determined to be a
nuisance per se and, in addition to other remedies, shall be subject to
abatement and injunction in a court of competent jurisdiction.

(Ord. 2019-07. Passed 8-12-19.)
1048.06   DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   Prohibition of Illegal Discharges. No person shall discharge or cause
to be discharged into the storm drain system or watercourses, any materials,
including, but not limited to, pollutants or waters containing any pollutants
that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards,
other than stormwater. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal
discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited; however, the following
discharges are exempt from prohibition as described:
      (1)   The discharges and flows from firefighting activities if they are
identified as not being a significant source of pollutants to the waters of the
State.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the Village Administrator as
being necessary to protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Dye testing, when there has been verbal notification to the Village
Administrator and EGLE procedures have been followed.
      (4)   Discharges permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste
discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority
of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is
in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and

uncontaminated pumped groundwater, except for groundwater cleanups specifically
authorized by NPDES permits; foundation drains, water from crawl space pumps,
footing drains and basement sump pumps; air conditioning condensation; waters
from noncommercial car washing; street wash water; dechlorinated swimming pool
water from single-, two- or three-family residences. Other swimming pools shall
not be discharged to stormwater or to surface waters of the state without NPDES
permit authorization from EGLE.
   (b)   Prohibition of Illicit Connections.
      (1)   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of
illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
      (2)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (3)   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to a storm drain system or MS4, or
allows such a connection to continue.
   (c)   Prohibition of Direct Dumping or Disposal of Materials into the MS4.
The direct dumping of materials or discharges into the MS4 is prohibited except
for those illicit discharges identified as not being a significant contributor
to violations of water quality standards.
(Ord. 2019-07. Passed 8-12-19.)
1048.07   RIGHT OF ENTRY.
   The Village Administrator and the Village's Code Enforcement Officer, or
other authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter upon all
properties for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling
and testing of suspected non-stormwater discharges in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. Refusal of reasonable access to the Village
Administrator, the Village's Code Enforcement Officer, and/or representatives
of the authorized enforcement agency to any part of the premises is a violation
of this chapter.
(Ord. 2019-07. Passed 8-12-19.)
1048.09   SUSPENSION OF STORM SEWER SYSTEM ACCESS.
   (a)   Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The Code
Enforcement Officer at the direction of the Village Administrator or other
authorized enforcement agency may seek immediate injunctive relief to suspend
storm sewer system discharge access to a person when such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may
present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or
welfare of persons, or to the storm sewer system or the waters of the United
States or this State. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps
as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the storm sewer system or
waters of the United States or this State, or to minimize danger to persons.
   (b)   Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person
discharging to the storm sewer system in violation of this chapter may have
their storm sewer system access terminated by order of the District Court, or
other court of competent jurisdiction, if such termination would abate or
reduce an illicit discharge. The Code Enforcement Officer or the Village
Administrator will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its storm
sewer system access. The violator may petition the Village Council for
reconsideration and hearing.
(Ord. 2019-07. Passed 8-12-19.)
1048.09   INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to
the Village engineer prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
(Ord. 2019-07. Passed 8-12-19.)
1048.10   MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   The Village Administrator has the right to require non-residential
dischargers to install monitoring equipment as necessary, in accordance with
court order, if a non-stormwater discharge is suspected. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All
devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
(Ord. 2019-07. Passed 8-12-19.)
1048.11   REQUIREMENTS TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS
BY THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The Village Administrator or his or her designee will adopt requirements
identifying best management practices for any activity, operation, or facility
which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the
storm drain system, or waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial
or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural
and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated
with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance
with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater
pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements
of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 2019-07. Passed 8-12-19.)
1048.12   NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or water of the U.S. said
person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and
cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials
said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the
occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-
hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency
in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the Village Administrator within three business days of
the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for
at least three years.
(Ord. 2019-07. Passed 8-12-19.)
1048.13   ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Notice of Violation. Whenever the Village Administrator or his or her
designee determines that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet
a requirement of this chapter, the Village of Franklin may issue a notice of
violation to the responsible person and the owner of the property where the
violation is occurring- requiring compliance within a period set forth within
the notice. Such notice may require without limitation:
      (1)   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
      (2)   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
      (3)   That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
      (4)   The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination of hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
      (5)   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs;
and
      (6)   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   (b)   Abatement of a Violation. If abatement of a violation and/or
restoration of affected property is required, the notice shall set forth a
deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said
notice shall advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore
within the established deadline, the Village may issue a municipal civil
infraction citation and may seek an order of the District Court, or file a
civil suit with a court of competent jurisdiction requiring the restoration to
be completed within an established deadline and authorizing the Village or its
designee to complete the work at the violator's expense.
   (c)   Penalties. Violations of this chapter shall be municipal civil
infractions in accordance with
Chapter 212  of the Village Code and the Schedule of Civil Fines adopted
pursuant to Section 212.04.
(Ord. 2019-07. Passed 8-12-19.)
1048.14   COST OF THE ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.
   In the event the violator fails to correct the violation as required, and
the Village undertakes the corrective action in accordance with an order of the
District Court, or other court of competent jurisdiction, within 30 days after
abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the
cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The court order may provide
that if the amount due is not paid within a timely manner, the charges shall
become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on
the property for the amount of the assessment. Unpaid assessments may be placed
on the Village's delinquent tax roll and may be collected in the same manner as
unpaid property taxes.
(Ord. 2019-07. Passed 8-12-19.)
1048.15   REMEDIES NOT EXCLUSIVE.
   The remedies listed in this chapter are not exclusive of any other remedies
available under any applicable Federal, State, or local law and it is within
the discretion of the authorized enforcement agency to seek cumulative
remedies, including, but not limited to circuit court actions in law or equity.

of the Village Council, which shall be adequate to pay the cost of reviewing
the proposed plat.
(Ord. 95-26. Passed 2-13-95.)
1225.06   REVIEW OF PRELIMINARY PLAT FOR TENTATIVE APPROVAL.
   Upon receipt of copies of the proposed plat for tentative approval, the
Village Clerk, on behalf of the Village Council, shall forward copies to the
Village Planning Commission, the local Soil Conservation District and the
County Road Commission (or the State Highway Department, as may be applicable)
for recommendation. The Village Planning Commission shall examine said proposed
preliminary plat with such assistance and review by the Village Planner, the
Village Engineer and the Village Attorney as the Planning Commission and
Village Council shall require. Upon recommendation by the Planning Commission,
the Village Council shall determine whether said proposed preliminary plat
complies with all Village ordinances and State statutes and makes adequate
provision for the following:
   (a)   Streets.   
      (1)   All proposed streets shall comply with the major street
thoroughfare plan adopted by the Village.
      (2)   The arrangement of streets shall provide for a continuation of
existing streets from adjoining areas into the new subdivision.
      (3)   Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of
streets in the proposed subdivision shall be extended to the boundary line of
the tract to make provision for the future projection of streets into adjoining
areas, provided, however, that minor streets within the subdivision shall be so
laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
      (4)   Where the proposed subdivision abuts or contains a county primary
road or major thoroughfare as defined in the Village Master Plan or the Village
Major Thoroughfare Plan, the Village Council may require marginal access
streets approximately parallel to the right of way of the primary road or major
thoroughfare and may require such other improvements as are deemed necessary
for the adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation
of through and local traffic.
      (5)   Private streets may be permitted by the Village Council if the
Village Council finds that private streets within the plat will not adversely
affect the public health, safety or welfare.
      (6)   All new streets shall be named as follows: Streets with a
predominant north-south direction shall be named "Street"; streets with a
predominant east-west direction shall be named "Avenue"; meandering streets
shall be named "Drive", "Lane", "Path", "Road" or "Trail", etc.; and cul-de-
sacs shall be named "Circle", "Court", "Way" or "Place", etc.
      (7)   Streets should intersect at a ninety-degree angle or closely
thereto and in no case less than eighty degrees.
      (8)   Where the proposed continuation of a street at an intersection is
not in alignment with an existing street, it must not intersect with the cross
street closer than 175 feet from the opposite existing street, as measured from
the centerline of said street.
      (9)   The maximum length allowed for residential blocks shall be 1,000
feet.
      (10)   All primary road rights of way, as designated by the Village
Council, within or abutting plats hereafter recorded, shall provide a fifty-
foot half-width. All other rights of way within or abutting such plats shall be
not less than sixty-six feet in width. Permanent dead-end streets in excess of
660 feet in length shall be prohibited except upon prior approval of the
Village Council, to be granted only where the topography of the area, rivers,
streams, other natural conditions or the prior development of the area prevents
a through street from being constructed.
      (11)   A subdivision or extension of an existing subdivision which
creates a total of thirty or more lots must be developed so as to provide two
or more access streets.
   (b)   Lots.
         (1)   All lots shall be created so as to be consistent with the
dimensional and area requirements of the Village Zoning Code and shall be
buildable sites.
         (2)   Corner lots shall be created with additional width so as to
permit front yard setback requirements to be attained from both streets.
   (c)   General Provisions.
      (1)   Privately held reserve strips controlling access to streets shall
be prohibited.
      (2)   Existing natural features which add value to residential
development and that enhance the attractiveness of the community (such as
streams, watercourses, historic spots and similar irreplaceable assets) shall
be preserved insofar as possible in the design of the subdivision. The
requirements of Chapter 1226 regarding wetlands development regulations and
Chapter 1464 regarding floodplain development regulations shall be complied
with in the creation of subdivisions under these Regulations.
      (3)   Lands subject to flooding or otherwise determined by the Village to
be uninhabitable shall not be platted for residential, commercial or industrial
purposes. Such lands within a subdivision may be set aside for other purposes,
such as parks and open space.
      (4)   If the Village Council determines that the proposed preliminary
plat complies with all applicable ordinances and statutes and the provisions
set forth in this section, it shall grant tentative approval of the preliminary
plat. Approval shall confer upon the proprietor, for a period of one year from
the date of the approval, approval of lot sizes, lot orientation and street
layout. Such tentative approval may be extended in the discretion of the
Village Council upon application of the proprietor.
(Ord. 95-26. Passed 2-13-95. Ord. 2003-08. Passed 12-8- 03.)
1225.07   SUBMISSION OF PRELIMINARY PLAT FOR FINAL APPROVAL.
   (a)   Every person who shall hereafter submit copies of a proposed
preliminary plat to the Village Council for final approval shall submit the
following relevant data:
      (1)   Evidence that all requirements imposed by the Village Council at
the time of granting tentative approval have been incorporated into the
proposed plan.
      (2)   Detailed working drawings showing grades, drainage structures,
proposed utilities and road construction plans for public and/or private roads
within and adjoining the plat. Prior to submitting copies of the preliminary
plat to the Village Council for final approval, the developer shall document
consultation with all public utilities which will be servicing the subdivision
to resolve any conflicts in location between public utility facilities and
other improvements.
   (b)   A fee shall accompany the plat, in an amount established by resolution
of the Village Council, which shall be adequate to pay the cost of reviewing
the proposed plat.
(Ord. 95-26. Passed 2-13-95.)
1225.08   REVIEW OF PRELIMINARY PLAT FOR FINAL APPROVAL.
   (a)   Upon receipt of all required copies of the preliminary plat for final
approval, the Village Council shall examine the same with such assistance and
review by the Village Planning Commission, the Village Planner, the Village
Engineer and the Village Attorney, and with such advice from other experts, as
the Village Council may request. Upon completing its review, the Village
Council shall determine whether said proposed preliminary plat complies with
the requirements imposed by the Village Council at the time of the tentative
approval, whether the proprietor has obtained the required statutory approval
of other governmental agencies and, in addition, whether the plat meets the
following requirements:
      (1)   No road grade shall exceed a seven percent grade or be less than a
0.5 percent grade, except upon approval by the Village Engineer.
      (2)   All grades in excess of three percent shall require the
installation of curb and gutter. Said curb and gutter shall be set apart not
less than thirty-five feet, as measured from back to back, and shall be fully
paved between the lip of the gutters.
      (3)   All road rights of way within or abutting such plat shall be
constructed with not less than six-inch compacted gravel base, twenty-two feet
wide and covered with not less than two inches of bituminous aggregate
pavement, twenty-feet wide.
      (4)   All rights of way shall be graded to the full width thereof for
proper drainage and prospective future widening and improving. Road grading
shall be accomplished so as to establish a one-half foot higher elevation at
the boundary of the right of way than at the crown of the traveled roadway. All
trees or other obstructions within the right of way which interfere with the
grading and/or drainage shall be removed. The foregoing one-half foot elevation
and tree and obstruction removal may be varied or adjusted by the Village
Council upon recommendation of the Village Engineer, where valuable trees or
obstacles are involved and as long as drainage and safety will not be impaired.
      (5)   Permanent dead-end streets shall be provided at the closed end with
a turn-around having an outside improved roadway diameter of at least 100 feet,
as measured from the centerline of the gutter or the back of the curb, and a
street right-of-way diameter of at least 120 feet. Temporary dead-end streets
shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around constructed the full
width of the right of way.
      (6)   All surface waters shall be adequately drained within each plat by
a separate system of drainage structures or through the connection of such
separate system to an adequate adjoining system. Where storm sewers are used,
inlet basins must not be spaced farther apart than 300 feet except upon express
approval of the Village Council, upon recommendation of the Village Engineer,
to be granted only where other equivalent and sufficient drainage inlets are
provided. Where such outlets are not thus available, such drainage structures
may consist of leaching basins so spaced that water shall not be required to
run on the surface of the road farther than 250 feet to such basin, or so
spaced as to afford equivalent and sufficient drainage. The determination of
what is equivalent and sufficient drainage shall be left to the Village
Council, upon the recommendation of the Village Engineer.
      (7)   Connection to sanitary sewers and/or water mains may be required by
the Village Council when it determines, in its discretion, that said sewers
and/or water mains are reasonably available to the proposed subdivision.
      (8)   In the discretion of the Village Council, the proprietor shall make
arrangements for all distribution lines for telephone, electric, television and
other similar services distributed by wire or cable to be placed underground
entirely through the residential subdivided area. Electric distribution lines
shall be defined in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by
the Michigan Public Service Commission. Such conduits or cables shall be placed
within private easements provided to such service companies by the proprietor
or within dedicated public ways. All such facilities placed in dedicated public
ways shall be planned so as not to conflict with other underground utilities.
All such facilities shall be constructed in accordance with standards of
construction approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission. Private
easements for underground utilities shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
      (9)   Storm water disposal methods proposed for the subdivision must be
adequate to insure that each building site and roadway will not be flooded and
that all necessary easements for storm sewers or open drains can feasibly be
dedicated to the public for such purposes.
      (10)   No land within the subdivision may be isolated from a public
highway nor may any adjoining land of the proprietor or others be isolated from
a public thoroughfare, thereby creating land-locked parcels.
      (11)   Street lighting may be required by the Village Council if it
determines that street lighting is necessary for the public health, safety and
welfare.
      (12)   Pedestrian and bicycle paths may be required by the Village
Council when the Village Council determines, in its opinion, that paths are
necessary for pedestrian safety, public health and welfare. When required,
paths shall be constructed of concrete or asphalt, four feet in width and four
inches in depth, upon a two-inch minimum sand base.
   (b)   The Village Council shall complete the review and consideration of the
proposed preliminary plat submitted for final approval at the next regular
meeting of the Council or within twenty days after the date of submittal of the
proposed preliminary plat. If the Village Council determines that the
preliminary plat has obtained the required statutory approval of other
governmental agencies and complies with the requirements set forth in this
chapter, the Village Council shall grant final approval of the preliminary
plat, which shall confer upon the proprietor, for a period of two years from
the date of approval, the conditional right that the general terms and
conditions under which said approval was granted will not be changed. Said two-
year period may be extended in the discretion of the Village Council upon
application by the proprietor.
(Ord. 95-26. Passed 2-13-95.)
1225.09   SUBMISSION OF FINAL PLAT FOR FINAL APPROVAL.
   (a)   Every person who shall hereafter submit a proposed final plat to the
Village Council for final approval shall also submit an abstract of title or
title insurance policy showing merchantable title in the proprietor of the
subdivision.
   (b)   A fee shall accompany the final plat, in an amount established by
resolution of the Village Council, which shall be adequate to pay the cost of
reviewing the proposed plat.
(Ord. 95-26. Passed 2-13-95.)
1225.10   REVIEW OF FINAL PLAT FOR FINAL APPROVAL.
   (a)   The Village Council shall review the proposed final plat and determine
that:
      (1)   All monuments required to be placed in the subdivision have been
placed or a cash or equivalent deposit has been made with the Village and a
deposit agreement executed by the proprietors.
      (2)   All roads, streets, bridges and culverts have been completed and
installed or a cash or equivalent deposit has been made with the Village and a
deposit agreement executed by the proprietors.
   (b)   If the subdivision has any county drains or other waterways, as set
forth in Section 188 of the Michigan Subdivision Control Act, all such county
drains and waterways shall be installed or a cash or equivalent deposit made to
the Village and a deposit agreement executed by the proprietors.
   (c)   If any floodplains are involved in the proposed subdivision, then such
floodplains shall be restricted, as provided by the Michigan Subdivision
Control Act and Chapter 1464 of the Building and Housing Code. Such
restrictions shall be submitted to the Village Council for review and approval
prior to recording and thereafter shall be recorded in the office of the
Oakland County Register of Deeds contemporaneously with the recording of the
plat.
(Ord. 95-26. Passed 2-13-95.)
1225.11   LAND DIVISIONS NOT REQUIRING PLATTING.
   (a)   No lot, outlot or other parcel in a recorded subdivision plat shall be
further divided or changed without the written approval of the Village Council
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. No division of
unplatted land within the Village into more than four parcels of land of ten
acres or less shall be permitted without the written approval of the Village
Council in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section.
   (b)   Applicants for division of a lot, outlot or other parcel division
shall submit a written application to the Village Clerk. The application shall
be accompanied by a scaled drawing depicting the original parcel, the proposed
division, existing buildings, utilities, easements, drainage, all pertinent
dimensions, legal descriptions of the new parcels created by the division and
such other pertinent data as the Clerk shall request. Accuracy shall be
certified by a licensed and registered land surveyor.
   (c)   No lot, outlot or other parcel in a recorded subdivision plat or
unplatted land shall be divided into more than four new lots of ten acres or
less in size. The new lots shall be buildable sites and shall conform to the
minimum standards for area, width and depth according to the zoning
requirements for the district in which the lots are located, provided, however,
that if existing lots which do not conform to these minimum standards are being
realigned to create larger lots, this requirement may be waived by the Village
Council.
   (d)   The Village Clerk shall deliver the application to the Planning
Commission, which shall determine compliance herewith and with the Subdivision
Control Act. Upon completion of the review, and provided that all taxes and
special assessments on the original parcel have been paid, the Planning
Commission shall recommend approval or rejection of the application to the
Village Council.
   (e)   The Village Council shall act on the application at its next regularly
scheduled meeting after receipt of the recommendation from the Planning
Commission.
   (f)   In the case of an application for a parcel division of nonresidential

indicate potential development of the parcel, either as an independent parcel
or in conjunction with abutting land owned by the applicant.
   (g)   Upon approval by the Village of a land division pursuant to this
section, the Clerk shall notify the Assessor and such division shall be noted
upon the Village assessment roll and thereafter the divided portions of the
lot, outlot or parcel shall be considered to be separate for tax assessment and
all other purposes. If portions of the lot have been added to another lot,
outlot or parcel, the enlarged area shall be considered to be a single lot for
tax assessment and all other purposes.
(Ord. 95-26. Passed 2-13-95. Ord. 2003-08. Passed 12-8-03.)
1225.12   VARIANCES.

this chapter, the Commission may recommend to the Village Council approval of a
variance from these Regulations. The Planning Commission may recommend
conditions to the variance consistent with the objectives of these Regulations.
   (d)   The Village Council may grant a variance if it finds that:
      (1)   The variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety
and general welfare, nor injurious to other property.
      (2)   The conditions underlying the variance request are unique to the
property and are not generally applicable to other property.
      (3)   Due to particular physical characteristics, the shape or
topographical conditions of the property, a particular hardship to the owner,
as distinguished from inconvenience or monetary loss, will result if these
Regulations are enforced.
      (4)   The variance will not violate the requirements of the Zoning Code,

1226.01   PURPOSES AND POLICIES.
   The wetlands and watercourses of the Village of Franklin are indispensable
but sensitive natural resources, subject to flooding, erosion, soil bearing
capacity limitations and other hazards. In their natural state, wetlands and
watercourses serve multiple functions for flood control, storm water storage
and release, pollution control, erosion control, wildlife habitat, aesthetics,
open space and recreation. The continued destruction and loss of wetlands and
watercourses constitute distinct and immediate dangers to the public health,
safety and general welfare. These standards are intended to define wetlands and
watercourses for the purpose of regulating uses within them, to develop use
permit standards for the alteration of wetlands and watercourses, to develop
regulations for the preservation and continued function of wetlands as a
healthy ecological system, to establish an administrative procedure for review
of development petitions involving wetlands and watercourses, to provide for
the enforcement of this chapter and to prescribe penalties for violations
thereof.
   The Village finds that it is necessary to adopt this chapter in order to
implement the goals and policies of the Village of Franklin General Development
Plan for Land Use, dated December 14, 1977, in particular, Goal No. 8 and the
policies which accompany it. It is, therefore, the policy of the Village of
Franklin:
   (a)   To protect wetlands, watercourses and flood and natural retention
basins, while taking into account varying economic, ecological, hydrologic,
recreational and aesthetic values.
   (b)   To provide for the protection, preservation, replacement, proper
maintenance and use of wetlands, watercourses and flood and natural retention
basins located in the Village of Franklin in order to minimize disturbance to
them and to prevent damage from erosion, siltation and flooding.
   (c)   To provide for the issuance of permits and approved activities.
   (d)   To establish standards and procedures for the review of proposed
activities in wetlands and watercourses.
   (e)   To establish penalties for violations of this chapter.
(Ord. 190. Passed 5-9-94.)
1226.02   DEFINITIONS.
   The following terms, phrases and words, and their derivatives, shall have
the meanings given herein, unless the context otherwise requires:
   (a)   "Activity" means any use, operation, development or action caused by
any person, including, but not limited to, constructing or erecting buildings
or other structures; depositing or removing material; dredging; ditching;
draining or diverting water; pumping or discharging surface water; grading;
land balancing; and excavation.
   (b)   "Aquatic vegetation" means plants and plant life forms which naturally
occur in, at, near, or predominantly near water.
   (c)   "Bottomland" means all land area of a lake, stream or watercourse
which lies below the ordinary high water mark and which may or may not be
covered by water.
   (d)   "Buffer area." No specific wetland buffer or construction setback from
wetlands or watercourses is provided for under this chapter. Construction
setbacks and setbacks from proposed structures and roadways are specified in
the Zoning Code of the Village of Franklin.
   (e)   "Channel" means the geographical area within the natural or artificial
banks of a watercourse required to convey continuously or intermittently
flowing water under normal or average flow conditions.
   (f)   "Contiguous wetland" means those wetlands adjacent to a stream, drain,
lake or pond. A pond consists of one acre or more of permanent, open water.
   (g)   "Drainageway" means any drain, pipe, stream, creek or swale which
serves to transport water runoff to the primary watercourse system.
   (h)   "Fill material" means any soil, sand, gravel, rocks, clay, peat,
debris, refuse, waste or any other material which displaces soil or water or
reduces water retention potential.
   (i)   "Final wetland determination" means a formal, scientific inventory and
analysis of a wetland or watercourse, by the Village consultants, to determine
its boundaries, to describe its biotic and hydrogeologic setting and to suggest
remedial measures or alternative designs to minimize disruption to the wetland
resulting from proposed development.
   (j)   "Minor projects" means a proposed activity that would contribute ten
cubic yards or less of fill material in a defined wetland or watercourse, such
as installation of a utility, driveway or accessory building on an existing lot
of record.
   (k)   "Ordinary high water" means the line between upland and bottomland
which persists through successive changes in water levels, below which the
presence and action of the water is so common or recurrent that the character
of the land is markedly distinct from the upland and is apparent in the soil
itself, in the configuration of the surface of the soil and in the vegetation.
On an inland lake which has a level established by law, the term "ordinary high
water mark" means the high establishing level. When water returns to its
natural level as a result of the permanent removal or abandonment of a dam, the
term means the natural ordinary high water mark.
   (l)   "Owner" means any person who has dominion over, control of, title to
and/or any other proprietary interest in wetland and watercourse areas, or
title to an obstruction, natural or otherwise, to wetland and watercourse

structure.
   (r)   "Structure" means any assembly of materials above or below the surface
of the land or water, including, but not limited to, houses, buildings,
bulkheads, piers, docks, landings, dams, waterway obstructions, towers and
utility transmission devices.
   (s)   "Temporary" means a time period as specified in the use permit or, if
unspecified, an uninterruptible time period less than one year in duration.
   (t)   "Upland" means the land area adjoining a lake, stream, watercourse or
wetland above the ordinary high water mark, the uses of which are essentially
nonaquatic.
   (u)   "Watercourse" means any waterway, drainageway, drain, river, stream,
lake, pond or any body of surface water having beds, banks and continuous or
intermittent flow.
   (v)   "Wetlands" means lands characterized by the presence of water at a
frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal
circumstances do support, wetland vegetation or aquatic life and are commonly
referred to as bogs, swamps or marshes.

of all other applicable ordinances are met. If the proposed activity is
initially deemed by the Building Official to be a minor project, as defined
herein, then an application may be accepted without requiring a final wetland
determination.
   (b)   Final Wetland Determination. After the Building Official or other duly
authorized representative has determined that the proposed activity may
encroach into a wetland or watercourse and is deemed not to be a minor project,
then the applicant shall arrange to have a final wetland determination,
completed by a Village wetland consultant chosen by the Village Planning
Commission, to delineate the precise boundaries of the wetland or watercourse

or performance bond in an amount equal to 100 percent of the value of the
permitted work (as determined by the Village) to assure the Village that soil
erosion and wetland preservation efforts will be undertaken in accordance with
the approved plans. These assurances shall run to the Village and shall be
forfeitable by its terms and conditions automatically fifteen days after the
Village has provided notice to the applicant, either by personal delivery,
certified mail or first class mail, that the requirements of the plan have not
been complied with and that failure to proceed poses harm to the protected
wetlands. If the applicant fails to perform within the fifteen-day period, the
value of the assurance shall be automatically transferred to the Village or
otherwise be enforceable by the Village by any means available. Thereafter, the
Village shall be authorized to go onto the property and complete the
construction in accordance with the requirements of the approved plans. In the
case of the deposit, certified check or irrevocable letter of credit, the
amount on deposit may be reduced as the work progresses, provided that at all
times the deposit or letter of credit amount is sufficient in the estimation of
the Village to assure the completion of the approved work. If the assurance
does not sufficiently cover the cost of implementing the necessary improvements
as determined by the Village, the applicant will be responsible for reimbursing
the Village for any and all costs incurred in completing the work. (Ord. 190.
Passed 5-9-94.)
1226.16   EMERGENCY REMEDY.
   If, during the course of construction under a wetlands permit, an applicant
takes action or through a lack of action threatens the function of a wetland or
watercourse area and fails to remedy the condition within a reasonable period
of time, as determined by the Village, the Village shall be permitted to enter
the property of the applicant to take remedial action to alleviate the threat.
The applicant will be subject to reimbursing the Village for any and all
expenses incurred by the Village in remedying the condition. A stop work order
shall be issued and remain in effect until the time the Village is reimbursed
for any remedial action.
(Ord. 190. Passed 5-9-94.)
1226.17   MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS; CONFLICTS OF LAWS.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter
shall be held to be minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the
public health, morals, safety, comfort, convenience or general welfare. It is
not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair or
interfere with any existing provisions of law or ordinance, or with any rules,
regulations or permits previously adopted or issued or which shall be adopted
or issued pursuant to the law relating to activities within wetland areas,
provided, however, that where this chapter imposes a greater restriction than
is required by an existing ordinance or by rules, regulations or permits, the
provisions of this chapter shall control. (Ord. 190. Passed 5-9-94.)
1226.18   DECLARATION OF NUISANCE; ABATEMENT; EQUITABLE REMEDY.
   (a)   Any use or activity in violation of the terms of this chapter is
hereby declared to be a nuisance per se, and may be abated by order of any
court of competent jurisdiction. The Village Council, in addition to other
remedies, including those provided in subsection (b) hereof, may institute any
appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, abate or restrain the violation.
All costs, fees and expenses in connection with such action shall be assessed
as damages and charged to the violator.
   (b)   In the event of a violation, the Village of Franklin shall have the
power to order complete restoration of the wetland area involved by the person
or agent responsible for the violation. If such responsible person or agent
does not complete such restoration within the time specified in the order (not
to exceed eighteen months), the Village shall have the authority to restore the
affected wetlands to their prior condition wherever possible and the person or
agent responsible for the original violation shall be held liable to the
Village for the cost of restoration.

development or addition to an existing development must retain/detain the
increased runoff on-site unless otherwise directed by the Village Engineer.
Acceptable means of retention/detention can be achieved through standing water
in parking areas (to a maximum depth of six inches) or a separate retention/
detention basin.
   The County method of retention basin design, as available from the County
Drain Commissioner's Office, shall be utilized in determining the volume of
retention required. Basins with orifice outlets will be required to hold the
volume of a ten-year storm, while basins with no outlets will be required to
hold two consecutive 100-year storms. Discharge through an orifice outlet shall
not exceed 0.2 cfs/acre.

1229.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to:
   (a)   Protect and enhance the water quality of local watercourses, water
bodies, and groundwater pursuant to and consistent with the Clean Water Act, 33
USC 1251 et seq., as amended.
   (b)   Control non-stormwater discharges to stormwater conveyances and reduce
pollutants in stormwater discharges.
   (c)   Provide standards for the design, construction, operation and
maintenance of stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) for water quality
treatment, channel erosion protection, and flood prevention.
(Ord. 2010-10. Passed 12-13-10.)
1229.02   DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   “Best Management Practices (BMPs)” refers to a broad range of physical
structures, plantings, or management practices. The common denominator that
makes them BMPs is that they either reduce stormwater runoff, reduce pollutants
that could reach surface waters, or treat stormwater before it enters a natural
water body. Examples of structural BMPs include sedimentation basins and wet
ponds (or manufactured wetlands). Vegetated BMPs could include vegetated swales
or rain gardens. Management practice BMPs include washing vehicles in
commercial car washes (versus in an area where the soapy water could wash into
a storm drain), and soil testing before applying fertilizers.
   (b)   “Owner” means the property owner or operator of any stormwater
management system or activity subject to this chapter.
   (c)   “Stormwater management plan” means drawings and written information
prepared by a registered engineer or other certified professional which
describe the ways in which stormwater runoff is proposed to be controlled,
having as its purpose to ensure that the objectives of this chapter are met.
(Ord. 2010-10. Passed 12-13-10.)
1229.03   APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   The Oakland County Water Resources Commissioners “Stormwater
Engineering Design Standards”, as amended from time to time, are hereby adopted
by reference by the Village of Franklin for the control and treatment of
stormwater runoff. All developments subject to this chapter shall provide
acceptable water quality treatment BMPs designed to achieve eighty percent
removal efficiency of total suspended solids from the runoff produced by a
water quality storm.
   (b)   These Standards are established in addition to the existing
Engineering Design Standards in Chapter 1228 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (c)   These Standards shall apply to all new construction, redevelopment,
infill, or site expansions in the Village that include an area of disturbance
of one acre or more, including projects less than one acre that are part of a
larger plan of development or sale that would disturb one acre or more.
   (d)   All permanent and temporary stormwater management BMPs constructed as
part of the requirements of this section are subject to this chapter.
   (e)   These Standards may include the use of stormwater credits where low
impact development, open space preservation, or other site design practices
have been used to maintain the predevelopment site hydrology.
   (f)   This chapter also applies to any activities which may affect the
quantity or quality of a private or stormwater conveyance system or any
waterway within the Village. Any person(s) engaged in activities that may
result in excessive quantities of pollutants entering any stormwater conveyance
systems or waterways may be subject to the remedies for violation of this
section. Examples of such pollutants may include, but are not limited to,
debris, concrete washings, de-icing materials, fertilizers, heavy metals,
automobile fluids, topsoil, yard wastes, and commercial or light industrial
wastes.
   (g)   Natural swales and channels should be preserved, whenever possible. If
channel modification must occur, the physical characteristics of the modified
channel will meet the existing channel in length, cross-section, slope,
sinuosity, and carrying capacity. Streams and channels will be expected to
withstand all events up to the two- year storm without increased erosion.
(Ord. 2010-10. Passed 12-13-10; Ord. 2023-09. Passed 12-11-23.)
1229.04   STORMWATER DRAINAGE/EROSION CONTROL.
   All stormwater drainage and erosion control plans shall meet the standards
adopted by the Village and Oakland County for design and construction and
shall, to the maximum extent feasible, utilize nonstructural control
techniques, including, but not limited to:
   (a)   Limitation of land disturbance and grading;
   (b)   Installation and maintenance of vegetated buffers and natural
vegetation;
   (c)   Minimization of impervious surfaces;
   (d)   Use of terraces, contoured landscapes, runoff spreaders, grass or
rock-lined swales; and
   (e)   Use of infiltration devices.
(Ord. 2010-10. Passed 12-13-10.)
1229.05   STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   (a)   As part of the site plan submittals, three copies of a stormwater
management plan shall be submitted to the Village for every development subject
to this chapter. The contents of the stormwater management plan shall include
the information requirements as outlined in the Oakland County “Engineering
Design Standards for Storm Water Facilities, Procedures for Submittal and
Review, Part 1 through 5,” as applicable.
   (b)   The Village Council shall establish certain fees and escrow
requirements by resolution. Fees and escrow account payments shall be
sufficient to cover administrative and technical review costs anticipated to be
incurred by the Village including the costs of on-site inspections.
   (c)   An as-built certification for stormwater management BMPs must be
provided to the Village prior to final approval of the development.
   (d)   For sites that store or use chemicals, a spill response plan is
required which clearly defines the emergency steps to be taken in the event of
an accidental release of harmful substances that may migrate to the storm water
system. Plans shall be submitted and approved by the Village.
(Ord. 2010-10. Passed 12-13-10.)
1229.06   LONG-TERM MAINTENANCE OF STORMWATER FACILITIES.
   (a)   A long-term maintenance plan shall be submitted to the Village for
approval. A maintenance agreement shall be signed by the owner or operator and
shall be included as an obligation in the restrictive covenants, master deed,
easement document, or in another recordable form and recorded with Oakland
County.
   (b)   Stormwater facilities shall be maintained by the owner and shall be
repaired and/or replaced by such person when such facilities are no longer
functioning as designed. Disposal of waste from maintenance of facilities shall
be conducted in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws and
regulations.
   (c)   Records of installation and maintenance and repair shall be retained
by the owner and shall be made available to the Village upon request.
(Ord. 2010-10. Passed 12-13-10.)
1229.07   MAINTENANCE AND GUARANTEE BOND.
   The owner shall provide a maintenance and guarantee bond to the Village for
inspection and emergency maintenance of stormwater management BMPs for a period
of at least five years following final acceptance. The bond amount shall be
determined as ten percent of the total cost of construction of each stormwater
management BMP and drainage facility listed or as determined by the Village.
The Village reserves the right to periodically modify the bonding amounts and
requirements by resolution.
(Ord. 2010-10. Passed 12-13-10.)
1229.08   EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Stormwater management easements shall be provided as necessary and
recorded as directed by the Village to ensure access for inspections,
maintenance, and preservation of primary and secondary drainageways needed to
serve other properties.
   (b)   The location and purpose of easements for stormwater management and
drainage shall be clearly described in development deed restrictions or
condominium master deeds. Easements shall be recorded with the Oakland County
Register of Deeds according to Oakland County requirements.
(Ord. 2010-10. Passed 12-13-10.)
1229.09   VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   If the stormwater management BMPs have not been adequately maintained,
the Village may notify the owner(s) in writing and require the necessary
maintenance or repairs within 90 days of the written notice. Should the owner
fail to comply with the provisions of this chapter, the Village may, after
giving reasonable notice and opportunity for compliance, have the necessary
work done and the owner shall be obligated to promptly reimburse the Village
for all such costs incurred. If the costs are not paid by the owner, the
Village may pursue the collection of same through appropriate court actions or
as lien on the property.
   (b)   When emergency measures are necessary to mediate a nuisance, to
protect public safety, health, welfare, or to prevent loss of life, injury or
damage to property, the Village is authorized to, but not require to, carry out
or arrange for all such emergency measures. Property owners shall be
responsible for the cost of such measures made necessary as a violation of this
chapter and shall promptly reimburse the Village for all such costs. If the
costs are not paid by the owner, the Village may pursue the collection of same
through appropriate court actions or as lien on the property.
(Ord. 2010-10. Passed 12-13-10.)
1229.10   EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   Activities contained entirely within federal, state, or county lands
and that do not impact adjacent property within the Village are exempt from the
requirements of this chapter.
   (b)   Routine single family landscaping and/or gardening that does not alter
the existing storm water management facilities or require a grading plan as
determined by the Village.
   (c)   Any person performing construction work in the Village shall maintain
compliance with the county and state requirements for soil erosion and sediment
control.
   (d)   The prohibition of discharges shall not apply to any discharge
regulated under a NPDES point source permit issued and administered by the
State, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements
of the permit and other applicable laws or regulations. Compliance with an
applicable NPDES permit governing discharges into a stormwater conveyance
system shall be considered compliance with this chapter. NPDES permitted storm
water discharges are still subject to the County design criteria.
(Ord. 2010-10. Passed 12-13-10.)
1229.11   WAIVERS.
   The Village recognizes that, due to the specific requirements of any given
development, inflexible application of the design standards may result in
development with excessive paving, stormwater runoff, and a waste of space
which could be left as an open space. The Village Council shall have the
authority to grant waivers from specific control provisions of the stormwater
management standards due to site-specific conditions, but only if the waiver(s)
are as restrictive as the Oakland County Standards. All requests for waivers or
variances must be provided in writing along with justifications. Alternatives
that are consistent with the overall intent of stormwater quantity and quality
management may be proposed, subject to the approval of both the Village and, if
applicable, the County.
(Ord. 2010-10. Passed 12-13-10; Ord. 2023-09. Passed 12-11-23.)
1229.12   DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific, engineering, and other
relevant technical considerations. The standards set forth herein are minimum
standards and this chapter does not imply or guarantee that compliance will
ensure that there will be no unauthorized discharge of pollutants into the
waters of the United States. This chapter shall not create liability on the
part of the Village, any agent or employee thereof for any damages that result
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder.

1230.04   HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION.
   (a)   Establishment. In order to execute the purposes declared in this
chapter, there is hereby established a commission to be called the Franklin
Historic District Commission.
   (b)   Membership; Terms; Appointments; Vacancies; Removals.
      (1)   The Historic District Commission shall consist of seven members
whose residence is located in the Village of Franklin. They shall be appointed
by the Village Council for terms of office of three years. The Commission
members currently in office on the date of the adoption of this chapter shall
remain and continue as Commission members with their terms of office unchanged.
Members of the Commission may be reappointed after their terms expire.
      (2)   At least one member of the Commission shall be appointed from a
list of citizens submitted by a duly organized and existing preservation
society or societies, and at least one member of the Commission shall be a
graduate of an accredited school of architecture who has two years of
architectural experience or who is an architect duly registered in this State,
if such person resides in the Village and is available for appointment. A
majority of the members of the Commission shall have a clearly demonstrated
interest in or knowledge of historic preservation.
      (3)   A vacancy occurring in the membership of the Commission for any
cause shall be filled within 60 calendar days by a person appointed by the
Village Council for the unexpired term.
      (4)   The members of the Commission shall serve without compensation.
      (5)   Any member or members of the Commission may be removed by vote of
the Village Council for inefficiency, neglect of duty, conflict of interest,
misfeasance or malfeasance in office.
      (6)   Absence from three consecutive regular meetings of the Commission
shall automatically operate to vacate the seat of a member of the Commission,
unless the absence is excused by the Commission by resolution setting forth
such excuse.
   (c)   Duties and Powers.
      (1)   It shall be the duty of the Commission to review all plans for the
construction, addition, alteration, repair, moving, excavation or demolition of
resources in the Historic District, and the Commission shall have the power to
pass upon such plans before a permit for such activity can be granted. In
reviewing the plans, the Commission shall follow the U.S. Secretary of the
Interior's standards for rehabilitation and guidelines for rehabilitating
historic buildings, as set forth in 36 CFR Part 67, or their equivalent as
approved or established by the Michigan Department of History, Arts and
Libraries, and shall also give consideration and significance to:
         A.   The historical or architectural value and significance of the
historic resource and its relationship to the historic value of the surrounding
area;
         B.   The relationship of the exterior architectural features of such
historic resource to the rest of the resource and to the surrounding area;
         C.   The general compatibility of the exterior design, arrangement,
texture and materials proposed to be used; and
         D.   Any other factor, including aesthetics, which it deems pertinent.
      (2)   The Commission shall review plans for proposed major changes to
open spaces in a Historic District, such as the removal of large trees (over 12
inches in diameter as measured four feet above ground) or the making of major
contour changes in terrain features. The Commission may use its discretion to
decide if proposed changes are major in nature or not.
      (3)   The Commission shall review and act upon only exterior features of
a resource, and shall not review and act upon interior arrangements, unless
specifically authorized to do so by the Village Council, or unless interior
work will cause visible changes to the exterior of the historic resource. The
Commission shall not disapprove applications except in regard to considerations
as set forth in the previous division.
      (4)   The Commission may delegate the issuance of certificates of
appropriateness for specified minor classes of work to its staff, to the
Building Official or to another delegated authority. The Commission shall
provide to said delegated authorities specific written standards for issuing
the certificates of appropriateness under this division. Said delegated
authorities shall come before the next regularly scheduled Commission meeting
and the Commission shall review the certificates of appropriateness so issued.
These reviews are to serve the purpose of keeping the Commission informed as to
what certificates of appropriateness for minor work have been issued since the
last Commission meeting.
      (5)   In case of an application for work affecting the appearance of a
resource or for the alteration, moving or demolition of a resource which the
Commission deems so valuable to the Village that the loss thereof will
adversely affect the public purpose of the Village, the Commission shall
endeavor to work out with the owner an economically feasible plan for
preservation of the historic resource.
      (6)   If all efforts by the Commission to preserve a resource fail, or if
it is determined by the Village Council that public ownership is most suitable,
the Village Council, if considered to be in the public interest, may acquire
the resource using public funds, public or private gifts, grants or proceeds
from the issuance of revenue bonds. Such an acquisition shall be based upon the
recommendation of the Commission or the committee. The Commission or the
committee is responsible for maintaining publicly owned resources using its own
funds, if not specifically designated for other purposes, or public funds
committed for that use by the Village Council. Upon recommendation of the
Commission or the committee, the Village may sell resources acquired under this
division with protective easements included in the property transfer documents,
if appropriate.
      (7)   The Commission shall have no other powers, express or implied,
beyond those listed in this section, except as may be otherwise expressly
authorized by ordinance or resolution of the Council.
   (d)   Officers; Quorum; Notice of Meetings; Records and Reports.
      (1)   The Historic District Commission shall elect from its membership a
Chairperson and a Vice-Chairperson whose terms of office shall be fixed by the
Commission. The Chairperson shall preside over the Commission and shall have
the right to vote. The Vice-Chairperson shall, in the case of the absence or
disability of the Chairperson, perform the duties of the Chairperson.
      (2)   One member of the Commission shall be Secretary. The Secretary
shall keep a record of all resolutions, proceedings and actions of the
Commission and report regularly to the Village Council.
      (3)   At least four members of the Commission shall constitute a quorum
for the transaction of its business. The Commission shall adopt rules for the
transaction of its business which shall provide for the time and place of
holding regular meetings. The Commission shall provide for the calling of
special meetings by the Chairperson or by at least two members of the
Commission. All meetings of the Commission shall be open to the public, and any
person or his or her duly constituted representative shall be entitled to
appear and be heard on any matter before the Commission reaches its decision.
      (4)   Public notice of the time, date and place of meetings shall be
given in the manner required by Act 267 of the Public Acts of 1976, as amended.
Each notice shall contain the name, address and telephone number of the
Commission. The notice must be posted at the principal office of the
Commission, in addition to any other location deemed appropriate by the Village
Council, and may also be given on cable television. A meeting agenda shall be a
part of the notice and shall include a listing of each permit application to be
reviewed or considered by the Commission. The requirements of the
aforementioned Act include:
         A.   For regular meetings of a public body, there shall be posted
within ten days of the first meeting of the Commission in each calendar or
fiscal year a public notice stating the dates, times and places of its regular

Commission, a notice shall be posted within three days after the meeting at
which the change is made, stating the new dates, times and places of its
regular meetings;
         D.   Nothing in this section shall bar the Commission from meeting in
an emergency session should there occur a severe and imminent threat to the
health, safety or welfare of the public when two-thirds of the Commission
members decide that delay would be detrimental to efforts to lessen or respond
to the threat.
      (5)   The Commission shall keep a record, which shall be open to public
view, of its resolutions, proceedings and actions. A writing prepared, owned,
used, in the possession of, or retained by the Commission in the performance of
an official function shall be made available to the public in compliance with
the Freedom of Information Act, being M.C.L.A. 15.231 et seq. The concurring
affirmative vote of four members shall constitute approval of plans before it
for review or for adoption of any resolution, motion or other action of the
Commission.
      (6)   The Commission shall submit an annual report to the Council of the
general activities of the Commission and shall submit such special reports as
requested by the Village Council.
(Ord. 2000-65. Passed 7-10-00; Ord. 2003-01. Passed 4-14-03.)
1230.05   PROCEDURE FOR REVIEW OF PLANS TO CONSTRUCT, REPAIR, DEMOLISH, ETC.
   (a)   Filing of Application.
      (1)   Application for a building permit to construct, alter, repair,
move, add to, excavate or demolish any resource in a Historic District, such as
the Franklin Village Historic District, shall be made to the Building
Department. The Building Official shall determine whether the property is in a
Historic District such as the Franklin Village Historic District. Plans shall
be submitted showing the structure in question and also showing its relation to
adjacent structures.
      (2)   Upon the filing of such application, the Building Department shall
immediately determine the zoning classification of the parcel, and if it is
determined to be located within a residential zoning district and for work on a
new or existing residence or a new or existing residential accessory structure,
the Building Department shall immediately notify the Historic District
Commission of the receipt of such application and shall transmit it together
with accompanying plans and other information to the Commission. If the parcel
is determined to be within any zoning classification other than residential or
for consideration of any kind of request other than work on a new or existing
residence or new or existing residential accessory structure, then processing
requirements for site plan review, as set forth in Section 1268.30 of the
Zoning Code, must be completed and approved prior to review by the Historic
District Commission. The Planning Commission may, however, at any time during
its review, refer such application to the Historic District Commission for the
Historic District Commission's preliminary review. Upon approval of the
required site plan in accordance with Section 1268.30 of the Zoning Code, the
Building Department shall immediately notify the Historic District Commission
of the application and shall transmit the application to the Historic District
Commission for its review.
      (3)   The application shall include the applicant's certification that
the property where work will be undertaken has, or will have before the
proposed project completion date, a fire alarm system or smoke alarm complying
with the requirements of the Stille-Derossett-Hale Single State Construction
Code Act, 1972 PA 230, M.C.L.A. 125.1501 to 125.1531.
      (4)   The Building Department shall not issue a permit and no proposed
work shall proceed until the Commission has acted on the application by issuing
a certificate of appropriateness or a notice to proceed.
   (b)   Action Upon Application.
      (1)   The Historic District Commission shall meet within 35 days after a
complete application has been received by the Building Department, and shall
review the plans according to the duties and powers specified in this section
and in Section 1230.04. In reviewing the plans the Commission must make every
effort to confer with the applicant for the building or demolition permits. No
fee shall be charged to process a permit application through the Commission
beyond the existing Building Department fees, unless it is necessary for the
Historic District Commission to review the application pursuant to Section
1230.10.
      (2)   The failure of the Historic District Commission to approve or
disapprove of such plans within 60 days from the date of a completed
application for permit, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the applicant
and the Commission, in writing, shall be deemed to constitute approval, and the
Building Department shall proceed to process the application without regard to
a certificate of appropriateness.
   (c)   Approval of Application.
      (1)   If the Commission approves the application, it shall issue a
certificate of appropriateness which is to be signed by the Chairperson,
attached to the application for a building permit and immediately transmitted
to the Building Department. The Chairperson shall also stamp all prints
submitted to the Commission signifying its approval.
      (2)   After the certificate of appropriateness has been issued and the
building permit granted to the applicant, the Building Department shall, from
time to time, inspect the work approved by such certificate and shall take such
action as is necessary to enforce compliance with the approved plan.
      (3)   The Commission shall not issue a certificate of appropriateness
unless the applicant has provided the fire or smoke alarm certification
required by division (a)(3) above.
      (4)   Period of validity. Approval granted under this section shall be
effective for a period of one year. If a building permit has been obtained
pursuant to an approval granted under this section, then the effective period
for such approval shall be automatically extended to coincide with the
expiration of any such building permit. If a building permit issued pursuant to
an approval granted under this section is cancelled, terminated or otherwise
expires, then any corresponding site plan approval would otherwise have
expired, it shall be deemed to have thus expired. Notwithstanding any provision
of this division, the Historic District Commission may, on proper application,
grant an extension or extensions of any approval granted under this section for
good cause shown. No such extension shall be granted unless there is full
compliance with all applicable Village of Franklin requirements which may be in
effect at the time of the application for extension.
   (d)   Denial of Application.
      (1)   If the Commission disapproves of the application, it shall state
its reasons for doing so and shall transmit a record of such action and reasons
therefor, in writing, to the Building Department and to the applicant. The
Commission may advise what it thinks is proper if it disapproves of the
application submitted. The applicant, if he or she so desires, may make
modifications to his or her application and shall have the right to resubmit
the application at any time after so doing.
      (2)   A denial of a permit application shall be binding on the Building
Department, Building Official or any such other relevant authority.
      (3)   The denial of the plan shall also include a notice to the applicant
of his or her rights of appeal to the State Historic Preservation Review Board
of the Michigan Historical Commission within the Michigan Department of
History, Arts and Libraries and to the Circuit Court.
   (e)   Ordinary Maintenance and Prior Permit Work. Nothing in this chapter
shall be construed to prevent ordinary maintenance of a resource within a
Historic District, or to prevent work on any resource under a permit issued by
the Building Official or another duly delegated authority before this chapter
was enacted.
   (f)   Notice to Proceed. Work within a Historic District shall be permitted
through the issuance of a notice to proceed by the Commission, if any of the
following conditions prevail and if the proposed work can be demonstrated by a
finding of the Commission to be necessary to substantially improve or correct
any of the following:
      (1)   The resource constitutes a hazard to the safety of the public or
the occupants of a structure;
      (2)   The resource is a deterrent to a major improvement program which
will be of substantial benefit to the community, and the applicant proposing
the work has obtained all necessary planning and zoning approvals, financing
and environmental clearances;
      (3)   Retention of the resource would cause undue financial hardship to
the owner when a governmental action, an act of God or other events beyond the
owner's control created the hardship, and all feasible alternatives to
eliminate the financial hardship, which may include offering the resource for
sale at its fair market value or moving the resource to a vacant site within
the Historic District, have been attempted and exhausted by the owner; or
      (4)   Retention of the resource would not be in the interests of the
majority of the community.

1230.06   APPEALS.
   (a)   Any permit applicant aggrieved by a decision of the Franklin Historic
District Commission may file an appeal with the State Historic Preservation
Review Board of the Michigan Historical Commission within the Department of
History, Arts and Libraries. The appeal shall be filed within 60 days after the
decision is furnished to the applicant.
   (b)   A permit applicant aggrieved by a decision of the State Historic
Preservation Review Board may appeal the decision to the Circuit Court. Said
applicant may only appeal to the Circuit Court after appealing to the State
Historic Preservation Review Board.
   (c)   In addition, any citizen or duly organized historic preservation
organization in the Village, other than the resource property owner, jointly or
severally aggrieved by a decision of the Commission, may appeal the decision to
the Circuit Court.

1230.07   DEMOLITION BY NEGLECT.
   (a)   Upon a finding by the Franklin Historic District Commission that a
historic resource, either in the Historic District or in a proposed Historic
District, which is subject to Commission review pursuant to the terms under
Section
1230.11, is threatened by demolition by neglect, the Commission may do either
of the following:
      (1)   Require the owner of the resource to repair all conditions
contributing to demolition by neglect; or
      (2)   If the owner does not make the repairs within a reasonable time,
the Commission or its agents may, after approval by the Village Council, enter
the property and make such repairs as are necessary to prevent demolition by
neglect.
   (b)   The costs of the work under division (a)(2) hereof shall be charged to
the owner and may be levied by the Village of Franklin as a special assessment
against the property. The Commission or its agents may, after approval by the
Village Council, enter the property for purposes of this section upon obtaining
an order from the Circuit Court.
(Ord. 2000-65. Passed 7-10-00.)
1230.08   FAILURE TO OBTAIN A PERMIT.
   (a)   When work has been done upon a historic resource without a permit, and
the Franklin Historic District Commission finds that the work does not qualify
for a certificate of appropriateness, the Commission may require an owner to
restore the resource to the condition the resource was in before the
inappropriate work was performed or to modify the work so that it qualifies for
a certificate of appropriateness.
   (b)   If the owner does not comply with the restoration or modification
requirement within a reasonable time, the Commission may, after approval by the
Village Council, seek an order from the Circuit Court to require the owner to
restore the resource to its former condition or to modify the work so that it
qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness.
   (c)   If the owner does not comply or cannot comply with the order of the
Court, the Commission or its agents may, after approval by the Village Council,
enter the property and conduct work necessary to restore the resource to its
former condition or modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of
appropriateness in accordance with the Court’s order. The cost of the work
shall be charged to the owner and may be levied by the Village of Franklin as a
special assessment against the property. When acting pursuant to said order of
the Circuit Court, the Commission or its agents may enter a property for
purposes of this section.

Register of Historic Places, as set forth in 36 CFR Part 60, and repeated
below:
      The quality of significance in American history, architecture,
archeology, engineering, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings,
structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association and:
            1.   That are associated with events that have made a significant
contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or
            2.   That are associated with the lives of persons significant in
our past; or
            3.   That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period,
or method of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that
possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and
distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
            4.   That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information
important in prehistory or history; and criteria established or approved by the
Michigan Department of History, Arts and Libraries, if any;
         D.   Prepare a preliminary Historic District Study Committee report
that addresses at a minimum all of the following:
            1.   The charge of the Committee;
            2.   The composition of the Committee membership;
            3.   The Historic District or Districts studied;
            4.   The boundaries for each proposed Historic District in writing

resources found within the District, relative to the evaluation criteria;
         E.   Transmit copies of the preliminary report for review to the
Village Council, the Village Planning Commission, the Franklin Historic
District Commission, the Michigan Department of History, Arts and Libraries,
the Michigan Historical Commission and the State Historic Preservation Review
Board; and
         F.   Make copies of the preliminary report available to the public.
      (2)   The Village Council may prescribe the time for preparation and
transmittal of the preliminary report if the Council deems it in the public
interest to do so.
      (3)   Not less than 60 nor more than 75 calendar days after the
transmittal of the preliminary report, the Committee shall hold a public
hearing. Notice will be published of the time, date and place of the hearing.
Written notice shall be mailed by first class mail not less than 14 calendar
days before the hearing to the owners of properties within the proposed
Historic District, as listed on the tax rolls of the Village of Franklin.
      (4)   The Committee shall have no other powers, express or implied,
beyond those listed in this section, except as may be otherwise expressly
authorized by ordinance or resolution of Council.

      (1)   The Committee shall prepare and submit a final report with its
recommendation and the recommendation, if any, of the Village Planning
Commission to the Village Council. If the recommendation is to establish,
modify or eliminate a Historic District or Districts, the final report shall
include a draft of a proposed ordinance or ordinances.
      (2)   After receiving a final report that recommends the establishment,
modification or elimination of a Historic District or Districts, the Village

Districts. If the Village Council passes an ordinance or ordinances
establishing, modifying or eliminating one or more Historic Districts, the
Village Council shall file a copy of that ordinance or ordinances, including a
legal description of the property or properties located within the Historic
District or Districts, with the Register of Deeds. The Village Council shall

1232.01   FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   The tree canopy contributes to the distinctive rural character of the
Village of Franklin. Trees are important natural resources and assets of the
Village that residents and visitors admire and cherish. The Village’s trees
provide a vital link to nature by softening the visual landscape; improving air
quality; creating habitat for birds and wildlife; reducing floods and erosion;
protecting against wind and heat; providing important physical, aesthetic,
recreational, and economic benefits to Village residents; and supporting
property values. Through the years, the tree inventory in the Village has been
threatened, due to development, disease, or infestation. Therefore, in the
interest of promoting the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the
community, it is necessary to establish the regulations set forth herein to
protect, preserve, and conserve mature trees, manage and provide oversight of
the removal of trees, and provide for the replacement of trees removed in the
Village.
(Ord. 2010-04. Passed 5-10-10.)

1232.04 shall apply to all trees in the Village that are defined as “protected
trees” and are six inches in caliper or greater and not on the non-protected
trees list. The provisions dealing with dead, diseased, infested, decayed,
defective, or damaged trees shall apply to all trees in the Village.

indicate where the trees will eventually be located, where they will be stored
and protected during construction, and how they will be maintained after
construction.
      (9)   The plan shall explain and depict how protected trees proposed to
remain will be protected during land clearance, construction and development.
      (10)   A cost estimate and plan shall be provided for tree replacement.

   (d)   On-Site Examination in Lieu of Tree Location Survey and Plan. The
Village Administrator or his or her designee may permit an on-site examination
by the Village Administrator or his or her designee in lieu of a tree location
survey and plan, provided that both of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The tree removal permit application pertains to removal or
relocation of protected trees on an occupied single-family residential lot or
parcel; and
      (2)   No more than four protected trees are proposed for removal,
provided that none of the trees are heritage trees.
   (e)   Review Criteria. When reviewing an application for a tree removal
permit, the Village Council or Village Administrator shall consider the
following:
      (1)   Whether a satisfactory and viable plan designed and intended to
avoid or minimize negative impacts to protected trees has been presented;
      (2)   Whether all desirable, prudent and reasonably feasible alternatives
that would reduce or avoid negative impacts to protected trees have been
considered;
      (3)   Whether trees proposed for removal pose a safety hazard; cause
unsafe vision clearance or threaten to injure or disrupt persons; threaten to
damage property or utility service; prevent or obstruct access to a lot or
parcel; or unreasonably prevent development, improvement or use of a lot or
parcel. It is the intent of this provision that a permit should not be granted
for the removal of a protected tree where a reasonable alternative design
solution exists that is consistent with the permitted use of the property;
      (4)   Whether the proposed tree removal does not threaten the public
health and safety or materially increase the risk of flooding or erosion on the
subject or adjacent property, nor will it endanger a wetland or watercourse;
      (5)   Whether an alternative location for the proposed structure or
improvement exists that would not necessitate the removal of the protected
tree, without causing undue hardship to the applicant;
      (6)   Whether heritage trees are being protected and preserved to the
fullest extent reasonable and feasible; and
      (7)   Whether the application complies with the tree replacement
requirements of this chapter.
   (f)   Review and Decision. The decision to approve, approve with conditions,
or deny a tree removal permit application shall be made as follows:
      (1)   Site Plan, Plat or Site Condominium. If a tree removal permit
application is submitted in connection with a site plan, plat or site
condominium, the Planning Commission shall first complete its review of, and
take action on, the site plan, plat or site condominium and make a
recommendation to the Village Council relative to the tree removal permit
application. The Village Council shall have final authority to act on the tree
removal permit application. If tree replacement is required, then the Village
Council shall specify the time by which the replacement must be completed.
      (2)   No Site Plan, Plat or Site Condominium. If a site plan, plat or
site condominium is not required for the proposed activity associated with the
tree removal, then the Village Administrator or his or her designee shall be
responsible for reviewing and rendering a decision on the tree removal permit
application. Any such decision to deny an application shall be in writing and
shall set forth the reasons for denial. If tree replacement is required, then
the Village Administrator shall specify the time by which the replacement must
be completed.
      (3)   Appeal from the Village Administrator’s Decision. Any applicant who
is aggrieved by the Village Administrator’s decision concerning a tree removal
permit application may appeal to the Village Council by filing a written appeal
with the Village Clerk within ten calendar days after the date of the decision.
Upon receipt of a properly filed written appeal, the Village Clerk shall
schedule the appeal for the Village Council’s next available regular meeting.
The Village Council shall have the power to affirm, modify, or reverse the
Village Administrator’s decision.
      (4)   Conditions. The Village Council or the Village Administrator may
attach reasonable conditions to the approval of a tree removal permit
considered by them to be necessary to ensure the intent of this chapter will be
fulfilled, and to minimize damage to, encroachment upon, or interference with
protected trees.
      (5)   Denial of a Site Plan, Plat, Site Condominium, or Building Permit.
When a site plan, plat, site condominium, or building permit is submitted in
connection with a tree removal permit application and the site plan, plat, site
condominium, or building permit is denied, the tree removal permit application
shall also be denied. Alternatively, the site plan, plat, site condominium, or
building permit may be tabled to allow the applicant to modify the plan to
reduce or eliminate the negative impact on protected trees.
      (6)   Performance Guarantee. The recipient of a tree removal permit shall
post a performance guarantee in the form of a cash deposit, corporate surety
bond, irrevocable bank letter of credit, or other form of guarantee that is
acceptable to the Village, in an amount determined adequate by the Village
Administrator to guarantee compliance with the tree removal permit, any
conditions attached thereto, and the requirements of this chapter.
      (7)   Consultants. The Village may engage consultants to review and
advise the Village regarding tree removal permit applications, such as but not
limited to an arborist, forester, landscape architect, planner or engineer.
   (g)   Issuance and Duration of a Permit.
      (1)   Issuance of a Permit. For tree removal permit applications
submitted in connection with an application for a site plan, plat, site
condominium, or building permit, a tree removal permit shall not be issued nor
be effective, nor shall the applicant remove or cause the removal of any
protected tree, until after final approval of the site plan, plat, site
condominium, or building permit, and, if applicable, the Village Engineer has
approved construction and engineering plans for the proposed construction or
development activity.
      (2)   Duration. A tree removal permit shall remain in effect for one year
or the duration of approval for the site plan, plat, site condominium, or
building permit, if any, whichever period is greater.
   (h)   Tree Replacement.
      (1)   Replacement Ratio. A tree removal permit holder shall either
replace or relocate every removed protected tree on a one-for-one basis.
      (2)   Deciduous Trees. All deciduous replacement trees shall have a
three-inch caliper or greater. However, for every additional one-half inch
increment a replacement tree exceeds the minimum three-inch caliper, the
Village shall credit the permit holder with having replaced an additional one-
half tree.
      (3)   Coniferous Trees. All coniferous replacement trees shall measure at
least eight feet in height. However, for every additional one foot increment a
replacement tree exceeds ten feet, the Village shall credit the permit holder
as having replaced an additional one-half tree.
      (4)   Heritage Trees. When a heritage tree is permitted to be removed,
replacement trees shall be provided at a minimum of fifty percent of the
caliper of the heritage tree being removed. Such replacement trees may be
provided individually or on a cumulative basis to meet the fifty percent
caliper requirement.
      (5)   Dense Woods Option. As a full or partial alternative to the above,
the Village may approve replacement trees that are smaller in size in
situations where the intent is to create or re-create a densely wooded area.
This option shall consist of groupings of trees that have a minimum caliper of
one-fourth of an inch, and shall be used only in situations where it is
appropriate to create a densely wooded effect. When this alternative is used,
the sum of the caliper of the replacement trees shall be equal to the sum of
the caliper of the trees being replaced.
      (6)   Quality of Trees. Replacement trees shall have the shade potential
and other characteristics determined by the Village to be comparable to the
removed trees. All trees shall be Michigan Department of Agriculture Nursery
Grade No. 1 or better, and shall meet the following standard: ANSI Z60.1.
      (7)   Planting Standards; Guarantee. Replacement trees shall be staked,
wrapped, fertilized and mulched. Replacement trees shall be guaranteed by the
permit holder to exhibit a normal growth cycle for at least one year following
planting or else they shall be replaced.
      (8)   Damage to Saved Trees. Protected trees that were intended to be
saved shall be replaced on an inch-for-inch basis if they become damaged or
illegally removed during construction or development.
      (9)   Replacement Tree Locations. The Village shall approve replacement
tree locations to provide optimum enhancement, preservation and protection of
trees in wooded areas. To the extent feasible and desirable, replacement trees
shall be located on-site and within the same general area as the trees removed,
but such trees shall not be relocated or replaced in the building envelope of a
structure or within ten feet thereof. Replacement trees shall not substitute
for or count toward landscape screening or buffer requirements that may be
imposed under other ordinances.
      (10)   Off-Site Relocation or Replacement. Where it is not feasible nor
desirable to relocate or replace trees on-site, relocation or replacement may
be made at another approved location in the Village.
      (11)   Village Tree Fund. Where it is not feasible nor desirable to
relocate or replace trees on- or off-site, the tree removal permit holder may
satisfy the tree replacement requirement by paying into the Village Tree Fund a
sum of money approximating the current market price to purchase and plant the
replacement trees, as determined by the Village Administrator or his or her
designee. The Village shall use the Village Tree Fund for the purposes of
planting, replacing, maintaining and preserving trees in the Village.
   (i)   Tree Protection During Construction or Development.
      (1)   Prior to any land clearing or tree removal, the tree removal permit
holder shall clearly mark all trees to be removed by painting, flagging, or
other approved method, and shall erect and maintain suitable barriers to
protect the remaining protected trees. Protective barriers must be inspected
and approved by the Village before the work begins. Protective barriers shall
be kept in place until the Village authorizes their removal.
      (2)   The permit holder shall not cause or allow any construction or
development activity to occur within the drip line of a protected tree proposed
to remain, nor shall any solvents, building materials, vehicles, construction
equipment, soil deposits or fill, or other harmful materials be allowed to be
placed, kept, parked or stored within the drip line of such tree(s).
      (3)   No damaging wire, signs, or other devices shall be attached to any
protected tree that is proposed to remain.

1232.05   DEAD, DISEASED, INFESTED, DECAYED, DEFECTIVE, OR DAMAGED TREES.
   (a)   Public Nuisance. The Village of Franklin determines that all dead,

a tree, branch or limb threatens or endangers the public or persons, structures
or property on-site or on adjoining land, the Village shall be guided by the
International Society of Arboriculture Guide to Evaluation of Hazard Trees in
Urban Areas.
   (d)   Notice that Action Must be Taken.
      (1)   On Private Property.
         A.   The Village may notify an owner of land on which a dead,
diseased, infested, decayed, defective, or damaged tree, branch, or limb is
found, to abate the nuisance by pruning, treating and/or removing the tree,
branch or limb. The notice shall be in writing, shall be served personally or
by certified mail on the land owner according to the current property tax
rolls, shall specify the nature of the pruning, treatment and/or removal work
needed, and shall prescribe the time period within which it must be performed,
which shall be not more than 30 days unless the Village Administrator or his or
her designee determine exigent or special circumstances necessitate a different
time period.
         B.   Should such nuisance not be abated within the 30-day period, the
owner or occupant, or both, shall be deemed in violation of this division and
subject the penalties set forth in Section

   The provisions of this Zoning Code shall be administered by the Building
Department and the Enforcement Official and his or her deputies.
(Ord. 2000-38. Passed 5-8-00.)
1242.02   DUTIES OF ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL.
   The Enforcement Official, as designated by Council, shall have the power to
grant zoning compliance and occupancy permits and to make inspections of
buildings or premises necessary to carry out his or her duties in the
enforcement of this Zoning Code. The Enforcement Official shall not approve any
plans or issue a zoning compliance permit or a building permit for any
excavation or construction until he or she has caused such plans to be
inspected in detail and found them in conformity with this Zoning Code. To this
end, the Enforcement Official shall require that every application for a zoning
compliance permit for excavation, construction or alteration or change in type
of use or occupancy be accompanied by written statements and plans or plats
drawn to a scale of not less than one inch equals thirty feet, in duplicate,
and showing the following in sufficient detail to enable the Enforcement
Official to ascertain whether the proposed work or use is in conformance with
this Zoning Code.
   (a)   The legal description, actual shape, location and dimensions of the
lot.
   (b)   The shape, size and location of all buildings or other structures to
be erected, altered or moved, and of any buildings or other structures already
on the lot.
   (c)   The existing and intended use of the lot and all such structures upon
it.
   (d)   Such other information concerning the lot or adjoining lots as may be
essential for determining whether the provisions of this Zoning Code are being
observed.
   (e)   Existing and proposed grades to an extent necessary to allow the
Enforcement Official and the Village Engineer to properly determine the results
of the proposed work.
   If the proposed excavation, construction or alteration, or use of land, as
set forth in the application, are in conformity with the provisions of this
Zoning Code, the Enforcement Official shall issue a zoning compliance permit.
If any application for such permit is not approved, the Enforcement Official
shall state in writing on the application the cause for such disapproval.
Issuance of a permit shall in no case be construed as waiving any provisions of
this Zoning Code.
   The Enforcement Official is, under no circumstances, permitted to grant
exceptions to the actual meaning of any clause, order or regulation contained
in this Zoning Code to any person making application to excavate, construct,
move, alter or use either buildings, structures or land within the Village.
   The Enforcement Official is, under no circumstances, permitted to make
changes to this Zoning Code, nor to vary the terms of this Zoning Code in
carrying out his or her duties as Enforcement Official.
   The Enforcement Official shall record all nonconforming uses existing at the
effective date of this Zoning Code within twelve months after the adoption of
this Zoning Code for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of Chapter
1264.
(Ord. 2000-38. Passed 5-8-00.)
1242.03   PERMITS.
   The following provisions shall apply in the issuance of any permit:
   (a)   Permits Required. No person shall commence excavation for, or
construction of, any building or structure or for the moving of an existing
building, without first obtaining a building permit from the Enforcement
Official. No permit shall be issued for the construction, alteration or
remodeling of any building or structure until an application has been submitted
in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Code, showing that the
construction proposed is in compliance with the provisions of this Zoning Code
and with the Building and Housing Code.
   No plumbing, electrical, drainage or other permit shall be issued until the
Enforcement Official has determined that the plans and designated use indicate
that the structure and premises, if constructed as planned and proposed, will
conform to the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   Alteration or repair of an existing building or structure shall include any
changes in structural members, stairways, basic construction, type, kind or
class of occupancy, light or ventilation, means of egress and ingress or any
other changes affecting or regulated by the Building and Housing Code, or this
Zoning Code, except for minor repairs or changes not involving any of the
aforesaid provisions. (See the definition of "alteration" in Section
1240.08.)
   (b)   Permits for New Uses of Land. A building permit shall also be obtained
for the new use of land, whether such land is presently vacant or a change in
land use is proposed.
   (c)   Permits for New Uses of Buildings or Structures. A building permit
shall also be obtained for any change in use of an existing building or
structure to a different class or type.
(Ord. 2000-38. Passed 5-8-00.)
1242.04   CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY.
   No person shall use or permit the use of any land, building or structure for
which a building permit is required, or use or permit to be used any building
or structure hereafter altered, extended, erected, repaired or moved, until the
Enforcement Official shall have issued a certificate of occupancy stating that
the provisions of this Zoning Code and the Building and Housing Code have been
complied with.
   (a)   Certificate Validity. The certificate of occupancy as required in the
Building and Housing Code for new construction of, or renovations to, existing
buildings and structures, shall also constitute certificates of occupancy as
required by this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Certificates for Existing Nonresidential Buildings. Certificates of
occupancy shall be issued for existing nonresidential buildings, structures or
parts thereof, or existing uses of land, if after inspection it is found that
such buildings, structures or parts thereof, or such use of land, is in
conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   Where an existing nonresidential building has been occupied without the
issuance of a proper certificate of occupancy, the Enforcement Official shall,
as soon as possible, issue a temporary certificate of occupancy which shall set
forth all of the alterations and changes necessary to bring the structure or
use in compliance with the requirements of this Zoning Code and other
ordinances of the Village of Franklin. The said date for bringing the structure
or use into compliance with the requirements of this Zoning Code shall not be
more than six months later than the date of the temporary certificate of
occupancy.
   If the structure or use cannot be made to conform with the requirements of
this Zoning Code and other ordinances of the Village of Franklin, then the
structure or use shall be vacated within the six-month period.
   (c)   Temporary Certificates. Temporary certificates of occupancy may be
issued for a part of a building or structure prior to the occupation of the
entire building or structure, provided that such temporary certificate of
occupancy shall not remain in force more than six months, nor more than five
days after the building or structure is fully completed and ready for occupancy
and, provided, further, that such portions of the building or structure are in
conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (d)   Records of Certificates. A record of all certificates of occupancy
shall be kept in the office of the Enforcement Official, and copies of such
certificates of occupancy shall be furnished upon request to a person or
persons having a proprietary or tenancy interest in the property involved.
   (e)   Certificates for Accessory Buildings to Dwellings. Accessory buildings
or structures to dwellings shall not require a separate certificate of
occupancy, but rather may be included in the certificate of occupancy for the
principal dwelling, building or structure on the same lot when such accessory
buildings or structures are completed at the same time as the principal use.
   (f)   Application for Certificates. A certificate of occupancy shall be
applied for coincident with the application for a building permit and shall be
issued within ten days after the erection or alteration of such building shall
have been completed in conformity with the provisions and requirements of this
Zoning Code. If such certificate is refused for cause, the applicant therefor
shall be notified of such refusal and the cause thereof within ten days.
   (g)   Certificates for Nonconforming Buildings and Uses. Reference is made
to Section
1264.02 of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2000-38. Passed 5-8-00.)
1242.05   NOTIFICATION OF ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL DURING CONSTRUCTION OR
ALTERATION.

Enforcement Official will be notified as construction or alteration reaches
specific stages as specified in the Building and Housing Code.
(Ord. 2000-38. Passed 5-8-00.)
1242.06   FEES.
   Fees for inspections and the issuance of permits or certificates or copies
thereof required or issued under the provisions of this Zoning Code shall be
collected in advance of the issuance of such permits or certificates.
   The amount of such fees shall be established by the Village Council, from
time to time, and shall cover the cost of inspection and supervision relating
to the enforcement of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2000-38. Passed 5-8-00.)
1242.07   PERFORMANCE BONDS.
   Where in this Zoning Code there is delegated to Council or the Board of
Zoning Appeals the function of establishing certain physical site improvements
as a contingency to securing a site plan approval, special approval or
variance, the Enforcement Official shall, to insure strict compliance with any
regulation contained herein or required as a condition of the issuance of a
permit, require the permittee to furnish a performance or surety bond, or cash
bond at the discretion of the Enforcement Official or Board of Zoning Appeals,
executed by a reputable surety company authorized to do business in the State
of Michigan in an amount determined by Council or the Board of Zoning Appeals
to be reasonably necessary to insure compliance hereunder, provided, however,
that in fixing the amount of such performance or surety bond, Council or the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall take into account the size and scope of the
proposed improvement project, current prevailing cost for the Village to
rehabilitate the premises upon default of the operator, estimated expense to
compel the operator to comply with a court judgment and such other factors and
conditions as might be relevant in determining the sum reasonable in the light
and circumstances surrounding such application. If cash or a check is received
as a bond, the cash or check need not be maintained in an interest bearing
account.
   The Enforcement Official shall monitor the progress of the work under
permit. Upon request of the permit holder, the Enforcement Official shall
inspect the work site within a reasonable period of time for purposes of
determining compliance with the permit as issued by the Village. If, in the
opinion of the Enforcement Official, all work, including restoration of soil
and other property disturbed by the work, has been completed in compliance with
the permit and all applicable laws, then the remaining portion of any
performance, surety or cash bond held by the Village shall be returned to the
permit holder. Interest shall not be paid on the surety or cash bond.

1242.08   STANDARD NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING.

and to the occupants of all structures within one thousand (1,000) feet of the
subject property, regardless of whether the property or occupant is located in
the Village. If the name of an occupant is not known, the term occupant may be
used.
      (4)   For any notice given regarding a plan applying the Single-Family
Planned Residential Development Option, described in Chapter 1252, the notice
shall be delivered as specified in subsection (c) above, except that the
distance shall be fifteen hundred feet (1,500) feet.

before the date the application will be considered for approval. The notice

1244.01   ESTABLISHMENT.
   There is hereby established a Board of Zoning Appeals which shall perform
its duties and exercise its powers as provided in Article VI of Act 110 of the
Public Acts of 2006, as amended, in such a way that the objectives of this
Zoning Code shall be observed, public safety secured and substantial justice
done.

1244.02   MEMBERSHIP; APPOINTMENT; REMOVAL; VACANCIES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals, consisting of seven members, is hereby created
to replace the Board heretofore created by the Village of Franklin in Ordinance
No. 21, effective August 18, 1964. When the term of an individual member of the
Board expires, the Village Council shall appoint a successor for a three-year
term from the date of expiration of said original member's term, except for the
seventh member added by this section to the earlier six-man Board, which member
shall be appointed for a three-year term at the time the next reappointment or
appointment is made to the Board. All members shall be citizens of the United
States and residents of the Village of Franklin and shall not be employees of
the Village. One member of the Board shall be a member of the Village Planning
Commission. One member of the Board may be a member of the Village Council, but
shall not serve as chairperson of the Board. Members may be removed by the
Village Council for misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office only
after consideration of written charges and a public hearing. A member shall
disqualify himself or herself from a vote in which the member has a conflict of
interest; failure to do so constitutes malfeasance in office. Any vacancy in
the Board shall be filled by the Village Council for the remainder of the
expired term.
   Appointments to the Board shall be made annually on July 15. Vacancies of
specific unexpired terms may be filled throughout the year. Each term shall
begin on July 15 and end on July 14.
   The Village Council may appoint not more than two alternate members for the
same term as regular members to the Board. An alternate member may be called as
specified to serve as a member of the Board in the absence of a regular member
if the regular member will be unable to attend one or more meetings. An
alternate member may also be called to serve as a member for the purpose of
reaching a decision on a case in which a regular member has abstained for
reasons of conflict of interest. The alternate member appointed shall serve in
the case until a final decision is made. The alternate member has the same
voting rights as a regular member of the Board.

of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Building Official shall forthwith
transmit to the Board all of the papers constituting the record upon which the
action appealed from was taken.
   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from unless the Building Official certifies to the Board, after the notice of
appeal has been filed with him or her that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate, a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life
or property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed, otherwise than
by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court of record.
   The Board shall select a reasonable time and place for the hearing of the
appeal and give due notice thereof to the parties and shall render a decision
on the appeal without unreasonable delay. Notice of the hearing shall be given

      (2)   Height, Yard Space and Area Requirements. Permit such modification

new and existing buildings where there are practical difficulties or

provide substantial justice to the applicant, secure the safety of the public,
and observe the spirit of the Zoning Code.
      (5)   Temporary Buildings, Uses and Signs. Permit temporary buildings,
uses and signs for periods not to exceed six months.
      (6)   Performance Bonds. Establish performance bonds to insure compliance
with any requirement which may be deemed necessary for approving any variance.

thirds of the members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order,
requirement, decision or interpretation of the Zoning Code in favor of the
applicant on any matter upon which the Board is authorized by this Zoning Code
to render a decision.

Zoning Map is reserved to the Village Council of the Village of Franklin in the
manner provided by law.
   (d)   Standards for Variances. In consideration of all appeals and all
proposed variances from this Zoning Code, the Board shall ensure that the
intent of the Zoning Code is observed, public safety is secured, and
substantial justice is done:
      (1)   The Board may brant a requested “non-use” or “dimensional” variance
only upon finding that practical difficulties exist. A finding of practical
difficulties must require demonstration by the applicant of all of the
following:
         A.   Strict compliance with restrictions governing area, setback,
frontage, height, bulk, density or other non-use matters will unreasonably
prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose or will
render Zoning Code conformity unnecessarily burdensome.
         B.   The variance will do substantial justice to the applicant, as
well as other property owners.
         C.   A lesser variance than requested will not give substantial relief
to the applicant and/or be consistent with justice to other property owners.
         D.   The need for the variance is due to unique circumstances peculiar
to the property and not generally applicable in the area or to other properties
in the same zoning district.
         E.   The problem and resulting need for the variance has not been
self- created by the applicant and/or the applicant’s predecessors. Self-
created conditions include, but are not limited to:
            1.   The property owner not knowing or discovering local zoning
restrictions and opportunities.
            2.   The property owner making financial commitments prior to
zoning approval.
            3.   The property owner constructing without necessary permits.
            4.   The property owner creating a unique situation.
            5.   The property owner overbuilding or not building to market
conditions.
            6.   The property owner falsifying information.
      (2)   The Board may grant a requested “use” variance only upon a finding
that an unnecessary hardship exists. A finding of unnecessary hardship must
require a demonstration by the applicant of all of the following:
         A.   The property cannot be put to a reasonable use is permitted to be
used only for uses allowed in the district in which it is located.
         B.   The hardship of the owner is due to unique circumstances peculiar
to the property and not to general neighborhood conditions.
         C.   The problem is not self-created. Self-created conditions include,
but are not limited to:
            1.   The property owner not knowing or discovering local zoning
restrictions and opportunities.
            2.   The property owner making financial commitments prior to
zoning approval.
            3.   The property owner constructing without necessary permits.
            4.   The property owner creating a unique situation.
            5.   The property owner overbuilding or not building to market
conditions.
            6.   The property owner falsifying information.
         D.   The proposed variance will cause development of such location,
size and character that it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly
development of the surrounding neighborhood.
         E.   The proposed variance will be of a nature that will make
vehicular and pedestrian traffic no more hazardous than is normal for the
district involved, taking into consideration vehicular turning movements in
relation to routes of traffic flow, proximity and relationship to
intersections, adequacy of sight distances, location and access of off-street
parking and provisions for pedestrian traffic, with particular attention to
minimizing child-vehicle contacts in Residential Districts.
         F.   The location, size, intensity, site layout and periods of
operations of any such proposed development allowed by the variance will be
designed to eliminate any possible nuisance emanating therefrom which might be
noxious to the occupants of any other nearby permitted uses, whether by reason
of dust, noise, fumes, vibration, smoke or lights.
         G.   The location and height of buildings or structures and the
location, nature and height of walls and fences allowed by the variance will be
such that the proposed use will not interfere with or discourage the
appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings or unreasonably
affect their value.
   (e)   Conditions of Variances. The Board, in acting on any appeal in
connection with a request for a variance, may attach any conditions to its
approval which it finds necessary to accomplish the reasonable application of
the foregoing standards.
         In exercising the above powers, the Board may reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify, the order, requirement, decision or
interpretation appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or
determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of
the Building Official.
(Ord. 101. Passed 2-20-70; Ord. 2017-02. Passed 2-13-17.)
1244.08   NOTICE OF HEARING.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals, in conducting any public hearing, shall fix a
reasonable time for hearing and appeal within thirty days of receipt of the
notice of appeal, and shall give due notice to the parties concerned in
accordance with Section
1242.08. The Board shall decide the appeal within a reasonable period of time,
not to exceed thirty days.
(Ord. 2006-03. Passed 11-13-06.)
1244.09   APPROVAL PERIOD.
   No order of the Board of Zoning Appeals permitting the erection or
alteration of a building shall be valid for a period longer than 12 months
unless such use is established within such period; provided, however, that
where such use permitted is dependent upon the erection or alteration of a
building, such order shall continue in force and effect if a building permit
for said erection or alteration is obtained within such period, and such
erection or alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with
such permit within twelve months after the order of the Board. The Board may,
upon application, in writing, stating the reasons therefor, extend the 12-month
period for an additional six-month period.

1250.01   STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   The R-E, R-L, R-M, R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4 Single-Family Residential Districts
are hereby established as Districts in which the principal use of land is for
single-family dwellings and related educational, cultural and religious uses
where appropriate and harmonious with the residential environment. For these
Single-Family Residential Districts, in promoting the general purpose of this
Zoning Code, the specific intent of this chapter is to:
   (a)   Encourage the construction of, and the continued use of, the land for,
single-family dwellings.
   (b)   Prohibit business, commercial or industrial use of the land, and to
prohibit any other use that would interfere with development or maintenance of
single-family dwellings in the District. To that end, the Village Council
determines and finds that a developing trend toward short-term rental occupancy
in traditional single-family residential dwellings is undesirable and
inconsistent with maintaining the character and integrity of the Village’s
single-family residential neighborhoods; that it is considered to be a
commercial use of residential premises akin to a motel or inn, which are uses
that are not permitted in single-family residential districts; and that such
commercial uses have not been, and are not, permitted to be located in single-
family residential districts.
   (c)   Encourage the discontinuance of existing uses that would not be
permitted as new uses under the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (d)   Discourage any land use that would generate traffic on minor or local
streets, other than normal traffic to serve the residences on those streets.
   (e)   Discourage any use that, because of its character or size, would
create requirements and costs for public services, such as fire and police
protection, water supply and sewerage, substantially in excess of such
requirements and costs if the District were developed solely for single-family
dwellings.
(Ord. 158. Passed 9-14-87; Ord. 2005-01. Passed 1-10-05; Ord. 2021-04. Passed

   (b)   Municipal parks and municipal recreation areas operated exclusively
for the use and enjoyment of the public.
   (c)   State-licensed residential facilities, subject to the provisions of
Section 206 of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, PA 110 of 2006, as amended

   (e)   Accessory structures, buildings, uses and signs, customarily
incidental to the above permitted uses in accordance with Section 1268.13.

1252.01   INTENT; CRITERIA; APPLICATION.
   This chapter may be cited as the Village of Franklin Single-Family Planned
Residential Development Option. It is the intent of this chapter to permit an
optional means of development of single-family residential properties through
design alternatives. This chapter is not intended to create any additional
rights on the part of any property owner nor as an addition to any of the
permitted uses allowed in
Chapter 1250. The grant or denial of permission to utilize the Single- Family
Planned Residential Development Option will be based upon the criteria
hereinafter set forth, giving realization to the increased public importance of
protecting natural assets while preserving the integrity and density of the
single-family zoning districts consistent with the character of residential
development of the Village of Franklin. Subject to the terms of this chapter,
this option will be applicable to those areas where a modification to the
Schedule of Regulations may be permitted without impairing or threatening the
public health, safety or welfare, and where utilization of this option will
result in the preservation of natural assets which might otherwise be destroyed
by virtue of conventional subdividing or development of property. Except as set
forth in this chapter, all requirements and provisions of
Chapter 1250 shall be fully applicable, including those requirements set forth
in the Schedule of Regulations provided in
Appendix B following the text of this Zoning Code, as amended from time to
time.
(Ord. 170. Passed 8-27-90: Ord. 2017-02. Passed 2-13-17.)
1252.02   OPTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS.
   So long as the overall density of any single-family residential development
does not exceed that density set forth in the Schedule of Regulations provided
in
Appendix B following the text of this Zoning Code for the zoning classification
in which the property is located, the Village Council may, after reviewing
reports or recommendations from the Village Planning Commission, approve, in
whole or in part, either of the following single-family planned residential
optional development patterns when the property is under single ownership and
where the Village Council is satisfied that the utilization of a planned
residential option would be beneficial to the public health, safety and welfare
of the Village of Franklin and consistent with surrounding zoning and natural
concerns, and will not impose any vehicular or pedestrian traffic impediments.
   (a)   Lot Size Averaging. The Village Council, subject to the requirements
set forth in this chapter, may allow a variation in lot size from those
requirements set forth in the Schedule of Regulations provided in
Appendix B  following the text of this Zoning Code, where conditions so
warrant, provided that the average lot size for any such development shall be
equal to or greater than that minimum lot size set forth in
Appendix B  for the particular residential zoning district. No single lot may
be reduced by more than twenty-five percent from the scheduled minimum lot size
set forth in
Appendix B . Average lot size shall be calcuated by adding together the area of
each buildable lot and dividing by the number of building lots proposed for
said development.
   (b)   Open Space Plan. This provision allows the Village Council, pursuant
to this chapter, to approve a reduction of those single-family lot sizes set
forth in
Appendix B  by an amount not to exceed fifty percent of the scheduled minimum
lot size of the particular single- family zoning district as set forth in said
Appendix B . The open space plan shall create a permanent open space, park or
preservation area utilizing all of the areas reduced from the scheduled minimum
lot site requirements as set forth in
Appendix B , as said
Appendix B  may be amended from time to time. The created open space must
include the provision of ongoing maintenance guarantees by the applicant and
their successors. Average lot size, including open space for any such
development, shall be equal to or greater than that minimum lot size set forth
in
Appendix B for the particular residential zoning district.
(Ord. 170. Passed 8-27-90; Ord. 2017-02. Passed 2-13-17.)
1252.03   COMBINATIONS OF DEVELOPMENT CONFIGURATIONS.
   A planned residential development under this chapter may incorporate either
or both of the development alternatives set forth in Section
1252.03 in combination with the lot size and development configurations as set
forth in the Schedule of Regulations provided in Appendix B following the text
of this Zoning Code. Such combination of configurations may be proposed by the
developer in the submission of the development plan or may be proposed by the
Village of Franklin Planning Commission or Village Council during any of the
hearing or approval processes. It is intended by this section to permit the
Village of Franklin to alter or modify a proposed development plan so as to
amend configuration options, so as to substitute, eliminate or add any of the
permitted development configuration options, including those set forth in
Appendix B. Under no circumstances, by reason of any utilization or combination
of any of the development configurations set forth in this chapter, shall the
overall development density or the number of single-family residential units
per acre be increased in any zoning district over and above that set forth in
Appendix B. It is the intent of this section, while allowing maximum
flexibility of development configuration for the good of the health, safety and
welfare of the people of the Village of Franklin, to allow increases in density
only by means of a rezoning applicaiton and procedure in accordance with this
Zoning Code.
(Ord. 170. Passed 8-27-90.)
1252.04   CONTIGUOUS LAND AREA.
   A planned residential development under this chapter shall include a
contiguous land area for at least three dwelling units as may be required under
applicable zoning regulations. (Ord. 170. Passed 8-27-90.)
1252.05   CONDITIONS FOR APPROVAL.
   In reviewing an area for a Single-Family Planned Residential Development
Option, in whole or in part, the Planning Commission and Village Council shall
not approve any proposed single-family development unless any portion of the
area in question shall be within 300 feet of any of the following streets and
thoroughfares: Telegraph Road, Franklin Road, Thirteen Mile Road, Fourteen Mile
Road or Inkster Road, and one or more of the following conditions are found to
exist with regard to the subject property:
   (a)   The subject parcel is of such a depth and/or width or is shaped in
such a way that it contains acute angles which would make a normal subdivision
difficult to achieve in accordance with the strict letter of the Schedule of
Regulations provided in
Appendix B following the text of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   The parcel contains a flood plain or poor soil conditions, including
high ground water tables, which result in a substantial portion of the total
area of the subject parcel being unbuildable. In such event, satisfactory soil
test borings, flood plain maps or other documented evidence shall be submitted
to the Planning Commission as part of the application for a planned development
option in order to substantiate the parcel's qualification for optional
development.
   (c)   The subject parcel contains natural assets which would be preserved
through the use of a Single-Family Planned Residential Development Option. Such
assets may include natural stands of large trees, natural habitat for wildlife,
unusual topographic features or other unique and valuable conditions, such as
flora, fauna and still water waterways.
   (d)   The subject parcel is situated such that utilization of the Single-
Family Planned Residential Development Option will allow flexibility of design
and placement of open space for increased insulation and protection for the
single-family residential units from major thoroughfares.
   (e)   The subject parcel contains natural land forms which are so arranged
that the change of elevation within the site includes both slopes in excess of
one foot vertical for every siz feet horizontal between the elevations and the
topography of the subject property, such that the grades are so steep that
building sites would be impossible unless the site were mass graded, such as
would destroy the natural topography.
(Ord. 170. Passed 8-27-90; Ord. 2017-02. Passed 2-13-17.)
1252.06   CONDITIONS FOR DENIAL.
   A request for a Single-Family Planned Residential Development Option shall
not be approved under any circumstances when any of the following applies:
   (a)   The Village Council makes a finding that the proposal would be
contrary to the health, safety and general welfare of the developed and
established residential areas in the immediate vicinity.
   (b)   The request would be contrary to the purpose of the planned
development option, which is solely to maintain important natural assets and
improve the open space and residential characteristics of a given area.
   (c)   The request is not consistent with the goals and objectives of the
Village of Franklin Master Plan.
   (d)   The request is not consistent with the goals of creating optional
single- family residential developments so as to create a sound and stable
residential area and improve the health, safety and welfare of surrounding
residential areas.
   (e)   The request would generate undue noise or vehicular traffic, or create
an inability to adequately deal with on-site ground water or sanitary
facilities based upon existing conditions.
   (f)   The request, if approved, would conflict with or violate deed
restrictions applicable to the subject parcel.
   (g)   The request is not consistent with the Village of Franklin Historic
District or will impair or impede the character or preservation of the Historic
District or structures within said Historic District.
(Ord. 170. Passed 8-27-90.)
1252.07   CONDITIONS FOR WAIVING SETBACK AND LOT SIZE REQUIREMENTS.

   (g)   Shared Parking.
      (1)   Shared parking is the concept of using parking facilities jointly
between different nearby businesses or uses to take advantage of different peak
parking characteristics. For example, office buildings typically experience
their peak parking demand during weekday daytime hours while restaurants
experience their peak during weekend evening hours.
      (2)   Shared parking is permitted, subject to the conditions in this
section, for the following purposes:
         A.   To make efficient use of parking facilities;
         B.   To minimize the amount of impervious surface;
         C.   To minimize the amount of storm water runoff and ponding,
flooding and contamination often associated with storm water runoff; and
         D.   To maintain the character of the Village by avoiding an
overabundance of parking.
      (3)   To determine if a shared parking proposal should be approved, the
Planning Commission and Village Council shall first evaluate the parking needs
of each use individually as set forth in the Schedule of Off-Street Parking,
and the peak parking characteristics of each use. The following criteria must
be met:
         A.   At minimum, there shall be an adequate number of spaces to
accommodate the user with the highest demand for parking.
         B.   The applicant(s) shall provide documentation that indicates the
businesses or uses have distinctly different hours of operation.
         C.   The closest parking space in the shared parking facility shall be
500 feet or less from the site occupied by a building or use that is making use
of the shared parking.
         D.   If, after receiving a recommendation from the Planning
Commission, the Village Council approves the joint parking proposal, the
applicant(s) shall prepare a Reciprocal Parking Agreement (RPA) for review by
the Village administration. The RPA shall cover the following topics, at
minimum:
            1.   Use of parking facilities (exclusive, joint, time(s) and day
(s) of the week of usage).
            2.   Types of uses that will share the parking, including floor
area for each use.
            3.   Peak hours of parking demand for each use.
            4.   Maintenance responsibilities (cleaning, striping, seal
coating, asphalt repair).
            5.   Payment of taxes and utilities (lighting).
            6.   Method of allocating parking in the event that peak demand
changes for one of the uses.
            7.   Rights of access.
            8.   Liability insurance.
            9.   Cooperation (parties must agree to cooperate to the best of
their abilities to mutually use the facilities without disruption to either
party).
            10.   Conflict resolution (method of determining which party has
first choice).
            11.   Term and termination of agreement.
      (4)   Prior to receiving final approval to implement the shared parking
arrangement, the Reciprocal Parking Agreement shall be recorded at the Oakland
County Register of Deeds, and a copy of the recorded document shall be provided
to the Village.
(Ord. 101. Passed 2-20-70; Ord. 2013-06. Passed 7-8-13; Ord. 2017-02. Passed 2-
13-17.)
1262.02   PARKING DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS.
   Parking developed for three or more vehicles shall comply with the design
and construction standards in this section.
   (a)   Parking Layout. Parking shall comply with the dimensions specified in
the illustration below. The Village Council, upon receiving a recommendation
from the Planning Commission, may allow modifications to these dimensional
requirements where deemed appropriate because of the configuration of building
(s) relative to the shape and size of the lot. Parking spaces located on
asphalt or concrete shall be striped, based on the approved dimensions. Compact
car parking spaces are permitted in off-street parking lots that provide more
than ten parking spaces. Ten percent of the total spaces may be compact car
spaces, provided that the first ten spaces shall be standard size spaces.
Compact car spaces shall be labeled "Compact" with appropriate signage.

   (b)   Parking Plans. A proposal for new, improved, or expanded off-street
parking for any use other than single family residential shall be subject to
the site plan review requirements in Section
1268.30. Parking shall be sealed by an engineer registered in the State of
Michigan. They shall illustrate all relevant aspects of the project, including
but not necessarily limited to: existing and proposed grades, drainage, and
utilities; surfacing and base materials; and, layout of parking spaces.
   (c)   Surfacing. All parking, including maneuvering aisles, driveways, and
approaches, shall be surfaced with either pavement (concrete or asphalt) or
crushed limestone. Parking shall be graded and drained to properly dispose of
surface water without draining onto adjoining property or across a public
sidewalk. Parking shall not be located over a septic tank or tile field.
   (d)   Lighting. Lighting fixtures, if proposed, shall not exceed a height of
20 feet measured from the ground level to the centerline of the light source.
Lighting fixtures shall be focused downward and shall be fully shielded to
prevent glare and sky glow and minimize light trespass onto adjoining
properties. Parking lot lighting shall emit no light above 90 degrees. Lighting
shall be arranged as to reflect the light away from all residentially zoned
properties. Lighting in the Historic District shall be subject to review and
approval by the Historic District Commission. Lighting shall comply with the
National Electrical Code.
   (e)   Setbacks. The following setbacks shall apply:
      (1)   In the Historic District, a minimum setback of five feet shall be
required wherever a parking lot in a nonresidential district abuts a
residential district.
      (2)   In areas not within the Historic District, a minimum setback of ten
feet shall be required wherever a parking lot in a nonresidential district
abuts a residential district.
      (3)   Parking in the front yard of an RO-1 or C-l district shall not
encroach into the road right-of-way. Parking along a street that is otherwise
residentially-used and zoned, shall comply with the front yard setback
requirement for the adjoining residential district. Existing parking spaces
that do not comply with the requirements in this subsection shall be considered
legally nonconforming.
   (f)   Screening. Screening shall be required wherever parking abuts a single
family zoned district. Such screening shall comply with Section
1268.29. Screening may be located in the required setback described in
subsection (e).
   (g)   Curb or Wheel Stops. Curbs or wheel stops shall be provided at the
foot of each space to prevent vehicles from driving onto lawns, landscape areas
and sidewalks.
   (h)   Ingress and Egress. Adequate means of ingress and egress, shall be
provided, which shall be subject to review by the Village Planner, Village
Engineer, Police Chief and the appropriate road agency. The nearest edge of a
driveway serving a parking lot shall be at least 20 feet from any adjoining
residential district. Access to off-street parking that serves a non-
residential use shall not be permitted across land that is zoned or used solely
for residential purposes. Spaces backing directly onto a street shall be
prohibited.
   (i)   Maintenance. Areas surrounding parking lots, including areas occupied
by screening, shall be kept free from tall grass, weeds, rubbish and debris.
Parking consisting of pavement shall be maintained with a hard, smooth, dust
free surface.
   (j)   Servicing, Sale, and Storage of Vehicles. Parking lots shall not be
used for servicing or sale of vehicles, except that emergency service required
to start vehicles shall be permitted. Vehicles shall not be parked or stored
for continuous periods of more than 72 hours. A parking lot may not be used for
the following:
      (1)   Storage or parking of trailers, mobile homes, travel trailers,
boats, boat trailers, or junked or wrecked vehicles of any type;
      (2)   Storage of industrial equipment or material; or
      (3)   A place to deposit refuse.
   (k)   Buildings. No buildings or structures shall be permitted, except one
parking lot attendant building may be permitted, provided it does not exceed 25
feet in area and ten feet in height.
   (l)   Parking for the Physically Handicapped. Each parking lot that serves a
building, except single-family units, shall have a number of level parking
spaces, identified by an above-grade sign that indicates that spaces are
reserved for physically handicapped people. Parking for the physically
handicapped shall comply with State and Federal laws, as well as the adopted
Building Code. The number of required barrier-free spaces is as follows:

Residential Design Standards
1263.01   Purpose.
1263.02   General requirements.
1263.03   Design compatibility requirements.
1263.04   Accessory structures.
1263.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish standards governing the design
and appearance of all single-family residential structures, including mobile
homes and manufactured housing, when developed on individual lots or home sites
in the Village. It is the intent of these regulations to allow a mix of housing
types and living styles in a manner that will not adversely affect the
appearance and character of existing neighborhoods. Single-family residential
structure shall be erected or constructed in compliance with the following
residential design standards.
(Ord. 2001-05. Passed 9-10-01.)
1263.02   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Area and Bulk Regulations. A residential structure, including any
mobile home dwelling unit, shall comply with the minimum floor area
requirements specified for the zoning district where such structure is located.
Mobile homes shall comply with all regulations normally required for site-built
housing in the zoning district in which it is located, unless specifically
indicated otherwise herein.
   (b)   Foundation. Any residential structure, including a mobile home, shall
be placed on a permanent foundation to form a complete enclosure under the
exterior walls. The foundation shall be constructed in accordance with the
Village Building Code. A mobile home shall be securely anchored to its
foundation. The wheels, tongue and hitch assembly, and other towing
appurtenances, shall be removed before attaching a mobile home to its permanent
foundation.
   (c)   Other Regulations. Residential structures shall be constructed in
compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws or ordinances,
including the Michigan State Construction Code. Mobile homes shall comply with
the most recent regulations specified by the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development, Mobile Home Construction and Safety Standards,
24 C.F.R. 3280, as amended.
   (d)   Location. For the purposes of this chapter, a mobile home or other
manufactured housing type may be located on an individual lot in any of the
zoning districts which allow for the development of single-family residential
structures, subject further to the regulations contained herein relative to
floor area, lot size, setback yards and the use and improvement of lots and
structures.
   (e)   Floodplain. No dwelling unit, including mobile homes, shall be located
within a floodplain, as defined and regulated in Chapter 1464 of these Codified
Ordinances.
   (f)   Use. Mobile homes and other structures shall be used only for the
purposes permitted in the zoning district in which they are located.
   (g)   Attachments. Any exterior attachments or extensions onto a dwelling
unit, such as entry steps, porches and storage buildings, shall comply with the
Village building code, shall be designed to be permanently attached to the
ground and to the structures, and shall be comparable to steps, porches and
storage buildings of existing homes with which the dwelling is to be
compatible.
   (h)   Services. A residential structure shall be connected to a waste
treatment and potable water supply system approved by the Village and the
Oakland County Health Department.
(Ord. 2001-02. Passed 4-9-01.)
1263.03   DESIGN COMPATIBILITY REQUIREMENTS.
   To ensure the compatibility in appearance with existing homes in the
Village, dwelling units erected after the effective date of this chapter shall
comply with the general requirements set forth in Section
1263.02 and with the following design and site standards:
   (a)   Roof Pitch. The pitch of the main roof shall have a minimum vertical
rise of one foot for each four feet of horizontal run, and the minimum distance
from the eaves to the ridge shall be ten feet, except where the customized
architectural design dictates otherwise (e.g. French provincial, Italianate).
   (b)   Roof Drainage and Materials. Dwellings shall be designed with a
minimum six-inch roof overhang on all sides or an eave with a roof drainage
system that will collect and concentrate the roof discharge of storm water or
snow away from the sides of the dwelling. The roof shall have wood shake,
asphaltic or other shingles or other materials commonly used in standard
residential construction in the vicinity, and meet the snow load standards for
this portion of the State of Michigan, as specified by the applicable
construction code requirements.
   (c)   Exterior Materials. The exterior siding of a mobile home or
manufactured dwelling shall consist of materials that are generally acceptable
for existing housing in the vicinity, provided that the reflection from such
exterior surface shall be no greater than from white semi-gloss exterior
enamel, and provided further that any such exterior is comparable in
composition, appearance, and durability to the exterior siding commonly used in
standard residential construction.
   (d)   Dimensions. The dimensions and placement of dwellings shall be
comparable to typical dimensions and placement of existing housing in the
vicinity. Therefore, a dwelling shall be located on the lot so that the minimum
width of the front elevation is no less than 34 feet and the minimum dimension
along any side or rear elevation is no less than 24 feet. If there are any
extensions or additions off of the front of the dwelling, the minimum width of
any such secondary front elevation shall be 24 feet. Such dimensions shall be
measured from the outer extremities and shall include additions to the main
body of the home, such as living or recreation rooms, garages, carports,
utility rooms, and the like, the front portions of which are within ten feet of
the front of the main body of the dwelling.
   (e)   Perimeter Foundation Wall. Every dwelling shall have a wall of the
same perimeter dimensions as the dwelling and constructed of such materials and
type as required in the applicable building code for single-family dwellings.
In the event that a manufactured dwelling is installed pursuant to the
manufacturer's set-up instructions, such dwelling shall be secured to the
premises by an anchoring system or device complying with the rules and
regulations of the Michigan Manufactured Housing Commission, and shall have a
perimeter wall as required above.
   (f)   Exterior Doors. Dwellings shall have no less than two exterior doors,
which shall not be located on the same side of the building. Where required
because of a difference in elevation, all exterior doors shall be provided with
steps that are permanently attached to the building.
   (g)   Design Features. The design and position of exterior features of
dwellings shall be compatible and in harmony with existing homes within 1,000
feet of the dwelling lot. The foregoing shall not be construed to prohibit
innovative design concepts involving such features as solar energy, view,
unique land contour, or relief from the common or standard design homes.
   The compatibility of design and appearance shall be determined in the first
instance by the Village Building Official upon review of the plans submitted
for a particular dwelling. An applicant aggrieved by an adverse decision by the
Building Official may appeal to the Board of Appeals.
(Ord. 2001-05. Passed 9-10-01.)
1263.04   ACCESSORY STRUCTURES.
   Detached accessory structures, as permitted in the Zoning Ordinance shall be
built consistent with standards and requirements of the Village Building Code.
If the accessory structure is attached to the house it shall be similar in
material and integrity and meet the construction standards of the HUD National
Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 or the
Michigan Construction Code, as applicable. The dwelling shall not have a
detached accessory structure or garage if attached garages are typical to homes
with which the dwelling is to be compatible.
(Ord. 2001-05. Passed 9-10-01.)

1264.01      STATEMENT OF INTENT.
   Nonconformities are uses, structures, buildings, or lots which do not
conform to one or more provisions or requirements of this Zoning Code or a
subsequent amendment hereto, but were lawfully established before the time of
adoption of this Zoning Code or such amendment. Such nonconformities are
declared to be incompatible with the current or intended use of land in the
district in which they are located.
   It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue
until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the
intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon,
expanded or extended, nor be used as the basis to justify adding other
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
   Accordingly, the purpose of this chapter is to establish regulations that
govern the completion, restoration, reconstruction, extension, or substitution
of nonconformities, and to specify the circumstances and conditions under which
nonconformities shall be permitted to continue.
   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require
a change in plans, construction, or the designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully initiated prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code and where actual construction is
ongoing. "Actual construction" is hereby defined to include the positioning and
placement of construction materials in permanent positions and their fastening
in a permanent manner. If demolition or removal of an existing building in
compliance with Chapter 1460 of these Codified Ordinances has been
substantially initiated preparatory to rebuilding, such work shall be deemed to
be actual construction, provided that such work shall be diligently performed
until completion of the building involved.
(Ord. 97-45. Passed 3-17-97.)
1264.02   NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   A nonconforming lot is a lot of record existing at the effective date of
this Zoning Code that does not meet the minimum area or lot dimensional
requirements of the district in which the lot is located. The following
regulations shall apply to any nonconforming lot:
   (a)   Use of Nonconforming Lot. Any nonconforming lot shall be used only for
a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
   (b)   Single-Family Dwellings. In any district in which single-family
dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other
provisions of this Zoning Code, a single-family dwelling and customary
accessory buildings may be erected on a single lot of record existing at the
effective date of adoption of this Zoning Code or an amendment hereto. This
provision shall apply even though such single-family lot fails to meet the
requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the
district, provided that: 
      (1)   The lot is in conformance with all other applicable yard and lot
requirements for the district in which it is located.
      (2)   The lot cannot be reasonably developed for a single-family dwelling
without such deviations.
      (3)   The lot can be developed as proposed without any significant
adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health and safety.
   (c)   Variation From Area or Bulk Requirements. If the use of a
nonconforming lot requires a variation from the bulk or setback requirements,
then such use shall be permitted only if a variance is granted by the Board of
Zoning Appeals.
   (d)   Contiguous Lots Under Common Ownership. When two or more contiguous
lots are under common ownership and at least one of the lots is nonconforming
at the time of adoption or subsequent to adoption of this provision, then the
nonconforming lot or lots shall be considered to be combined with one or more
of the other contiguous lots as necessary to eliminate, or reduce, the
nonconformity. The combined lots shall be considered a single lot for purposes
of compliance with the remaining provisions of this section, including for
purposes of compliance with the lot area and lot width requirements. The
combined lots shall not be used, occupied or sold in such a way as to diminish
compliance with the provisions of this ordinance. The combined lots shall not
be divided except in full compliance with the requirements of the subdivision
regulations of Chapter 1255 herein and with the Michigan Land Division Act.
This provision shall not apply to contiguous lots in single ownership where
each of the lots is occupied by a dwelling existing at the time of adoption of
this paragraph. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not grant a variance to the
requirements of this provision.
(Ord. 97-45. Passed 3-17-97. Ord. 2004-02. Passed 1-12-04.)
1264.03   NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   A nonconforming use of land occurs when property is used for a purpose or in
a manner inconsistent with the use regulations applicable to the district in
which the property is located.
   Where, on the effective date of this Zoning Code, or the effective date of
an amendment hereto, a lawful use of land exists that is made no longer
permissible under the terms of this Zoning Code, as enacted or amended, such
use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions:
   (a)   Expansion of Use. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or
increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at
the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Moving. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part
to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code.
   (c)   Discontinuation of Use. If such nonconforming use of land ceases for
any reason for a period of more than ninety days, any subsequent use of such
land shall conform to the regulations specified by this Zoning Code for the
district in which such land is located. In applying this subsection to seasonal
uses, the time during the off-season shall not be counted, provided that the
off-season time for such uses is reported to the Village.
(Ord. 97-45. Passed 3-17-97.)
1264.04   NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   A nonconforming structure exists when the height, size, minimum floor area,
or lot coverage of a structure, or the relationship between an existing
building and other buildings or lot lines, does not conform to the regulations
applicable to the district in which the property is located.
   Where a lawful structure exists on the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Code that could not be built under the terms of this
Zoning Code, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   Expansion of Structure. No such structure may be enlarged or altered
in a way which increases its nonconformity. Such structure may be enlarged or
altered in a way which does not increase nonconformity.
   (b)   Damage to Structure. Should such structure be destroyed by any means
to an extent of more than fifty percent of its estimated cash value, it shall
be reconstructed only in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
The estimated cash value shall be equal to the result of multiplying the state
equalized valuation recorded in the tax roll by a factor of two.
   (c)   Moving. Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatsoever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is relocated after it is moved.
(Ord. 97-45. Passed 3-17-97.)
1264.05   NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES AND LAND.
   If a lawful use of a structure, or of a structure and land in combination,
exists on the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code that
would not be permitted in the district under the terms of this Zoning Code, the
lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
   (a)   Expansion of Structure. No existing structure devoted to a use not
permitted by this Zoning Code in the district in which it is located shall be
enlarged extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered
except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district
in which it is located.
   (b)   Expansion of Use. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any
parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use,
and which existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code, but
no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
   (c)   Change to Another Nonconforming Use. If no structural alterations are
made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or a structure and premises, may be
changed to another nonconforming use, provided that the Board of Zoning
Appeals, either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case,
shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to
the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change,
the Board may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with
the purpose and intent of this Zoning Code.
      Where a nonconforming use of a structure, or a structure and land, is
hereafter changed to a more conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed
to a less conforming use, nor shall the Board of Zoning Appeals grant a
variance from this subsection.
   (d)   Change to Permitted Use. Any structure, or a structure and land in
combination, in or upon which a nonconforming use is superseded by a
permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
   (e)   Discontinuation of Uses. If a nonconforming use of a structure, or a
structure and land in combination, ceases for any reason for a period of six
months, the structure, or the structure and land in combination, shall not
thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district
in which it is located. In applying this subsection to seasonal uses, the time
off-season shall not be counted, provided that the off-season time for such
uses is reported to the Village.
   (f)   Moving. No building in which a nonconforming use exists shall be moved
to any other part of the lot or parcel upon which it was located on the
effective date of the adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code.
   (g)   Removal of Structure. Where a nonconforming use status applied to a
structure and premises in combination, the removal or destruction of the
structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
(Ord. 97-45. Passed 3-17-97.)
1264.06   ALTERATIONS, REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   Repairs and Maintenance. On any building devoted in whole or in part
to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve consecutive
months on ordinary repairs or on repair or replacement of non-loadbearing
walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding 100 percent of
the assessed value of the building as determined by the Assessor, provided that
the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or
amendment of this Zoning Code shall not be increased.
   (b)   Alterations That Decrease Nonconformity. Any nonconforming structure
or any structure or portion thereof containing a nonconforming use may be
altered if such alterations serve to decrease the nonconforming nature of the
structure or use. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall determine if a proposed
alteration will decrease the nonconforming nature of the structure or use.
   (c)   Protecting Public Safety. Repairs or maintenance deemed by the
Building Official as necessary to keep a nonconforming building structurally
safe and sound are permitted. However, if a nonconforming structure or a
structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful
due to lack of maintenance and repairs and is declared as such by the Building
Official, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in
full conformity with the regulations in the district in which is located.
(Ord. 97-45. Passed 3-17-97.)
1264.07   SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS AS CONFORMING USES.
   Any use for which a special exception is permitted as provided in this
Zoning Code shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall, without further
action, be deemed a conforming use in the district in which it is located.
(Ord. 97-45. Passed 3-17-97.)
1264.08   VILLAGE REMOVAL OF NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES.
    In order to accomplish the elimination of nonconforming uses and structures
which constitute a nuisance or are detrimental to the public health, safety and
welfare, the Village, pursuant to Section 208 of Act 110 of the Public Acts of
2006, as amended, may acquire by purchase, condemnation or otherwise, private
property for the purpose of removal of the nonconformity.
(Ord. 97-45. Passed 3-17-97; Ord. 2006-03. Passed 11-13-06.)
1264.09   CHANGE IN TENANCY OR OWNERSHIP.
   There may be a change of tenancy, ownership or management of any existing
nonconforming uses of land, structures and premises, provided there is no
change in the nature or character of such nonconforming uses, except in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 97-45. Passed 3-17-97.)
1264.10   UNLAWFUL NONCONFORMITIES.
   No nonconformity shall be permitted to continue in existence if it was
unlawful at the time it was established.
(Ord. 97-45. Passed 3-17-97.)

1265.01   PURPOSE.
   It is the general purpose and intent of the Village of Franklin to carry out
the will of the United States Congress by authorizing facilities needed to
operate wireless telecommunication systems. However, it is the further purpose
and intent of the Village of Franklin to provide for such authorization in a
manner which will preserve and protect the integrity, character, property
values, and aesthetic quality of neighborhoods and the community at large, by
locating such facilities to minimize or mitigate their visual and environmental
impacts.
   This chapter is designed to encourage applicants to co-locate their wireless
telecommunication facilities on existing structures, whenever possible. New
ground mounted facilities are to be permitted only when co-location on existing
structures is determined to be infeasible.
   Therefore, it is the intent of the Village of Franklin to exercise its
authority granted by law to regulate the placement, construction and
modification of wireless telecommunication facilities.
(Ord. 98-41. Passed 3-16-98; Ord. 2004-04. Passed 12-13-04; Ord. 2013-10.
Passed 10-14-13.)
1265.02   PERMITTED LOCATIONS.
   Subject to the requirements and regulations of this chapter, and further
subject to site plan review and approval within Section
1268.30 and the general regulations set forth in Section
1265.03, below, wireless telecommunication facilities shall be permitted in all
zoning districts.
   (a)   Utility Pole. Wireless telecommunication facilities may be located on
an existing, new or replacement utility pole located within a public or private
right-of-way or public utility easement; sites owned, leased or operated by the
Village or other governmental agencies; parks or other large, permanent open
spaces; cemeteries; or public or private school sites. The height of the pole
shall not exceed 70 feet, except that the Village Council may permit height of
up to ten feet above the tree canopy height pursuant to Section
1265.03(b)(1), below.
   (b)   Essential Services. Wireless telecommunication facilities located on
publicly owned or operated sites and incorporated into an emergency
communication network as “essential services” in accordance with Sections
1240.08 and
1268.24.
   (c)   Existing Structures. Wireless telecommunication facilities may be
located on existing structures, including but not limited to buildings, towers,
existing telecommunication facilities, poles, and related facilities provided
that the installation does not reduce the character and structural integrity of
those structures. However, wireless telecommunication facilities shall not be
located on any residential dwelling or residential accessory building.
   (d)   Ground Mounted Facilities. A new ground mounted wireless
telecommunication facility may be permitted as a special approval use subject
to the special approval use procedure set forth in Sections
1265.07 and
1268.32 and the feasibility considerations of this subsection.
      (1)   Feasibility; Burden of Proof. The applicant for a new ground
mounted wireless telecommunication facility shall have the burden of proving it
is not feasible to locate its wireless telecommunication facility on an
existing structure. A proposal for a new ground mounted wireless
telecommunication facility shall not be approved unless it is established to
the Village’s reasonable satisfaction by the applicant that the proposed
wireless telecommunication facility cannot feasibly be colocated or installed
on an existing structure due to one of the following reasons:
         A.   The proposed facility would exceed the structural capacity of the
existing structure, as documented by a State licensed and registered
professional engineer, and the existing structure cannot be reinforced,
modified or replaced to accommodate the proposed or equivalent facility.
         B.   The proposed facility would cause interference that would
materially affect the functionality of other existing or planned equipment at
the existing structure as documented by a State licensed and registered
professional engineer, and the interference cannot be prevented by any other
reasonable means.
         C.   Existing structures within the coverage area cannot accommodate
the proposed facility at a height necessary for the proposed facility’s
coverage area and capacity needs, as documented by a State licensed and
registered professional engineer.
         D.   Other technical reasons that make it infeasible to locate the
proposed facility upon an existing structure.
      (2)   Feasibility. Location on an existing structure shall be deemed to
be “feasible,” for the purposes of this section, where all of the following are
met:
         A.   The owner of an existing structure under consideration will
accept market rent or other market compensation for location of the proposed
wireless telecommunication facility on the existing structure.
         B.   The existing structure under consideration, with reasonable
modification, can provide adequate structural support.
         C.   Location on an existing structure under consideration is
technologically reasonable, and the location will not result in unreasonable
interference, given appropriate physical and other adjustments in relation to
the structure, antennas and the like.
         D.   The height of the existing structure being considered will not be
increased more than 20 feet or 10% of its original height, whichever is
greater.
      (3)   Camouflaged. If the applicant demonstrates to the Village’s
satisfaction that it is not feasible to locate on an existing structure, a new
ground mounted wireless telecommunication facility shall be designed to be
concealed, disguised or camouflaged to the fullest extent reasonably possible,
including, but not limited to, use of compatible building materials and colors,
screening, landscaping and placement among trees.
      (4)   Location of Ground Mounted Facilities. New ground mounted wireless
telecommunication facilities shall not be located within 200 feet of a
residential dwelling. This requirement shall be in addition to any other
setback required in this chapter.

Village, be in the form of cash, surety bond, or irrevocable bank letter of
credit, or an agreement in a form approved by the Village Attorney and
recordable at the Oakland County Register of Deeds, committing the applicant
and owner of the property to remove the facility in a timely manner as required
under this chapter, with the further provision that the applicant and owner
shall be responsible for paying any costs and attorney fees incurred by the
Village in securing removal.
      (12)   Included with the site plan for a new ground mounted facility, a
landscape plan. The purpose of landscaping is to provide screening for the
wireless telecommunication facility, accessory buildings and enclosures. Any
fencing shall conform to Section
1268.28.
      (13)   Evidence of approval from the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) or proof that such approval is not required.

mounted wireless telecommunication facilities, the applicant shall further
demonstrate that the wireless telecommunication facility and/or support
structure will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to
the public health, safety and welfare, and that the wireless telecommunication
facility will be located and designed to be harmonious with the surrounding
areas and to be aesthetically and architecturally compatible with the natural
environment and the architectural, historic and residential character of the
surrounding area, and will not interfere with television, telephone and radio
reception in nearby residential areas.
      (1)   Maximum height.
         A.   The maximum height of any new ground mounted wireless
telecommunication facility shall be the minimum height demonstrated to be
necessary by the applicant for reasonable communication, and shall not exceed
70 feet, except that the Village Council may approve a greater height up to ten
feet above the average tree canopy height within 150 feet of the facility, if
the Council deems the increased height to be necessary or appropriate, based on
the following considerations:
            1.   Effects of topography, terrain and nearby tree canopy on
transmission or reception ability.
            2.   Construction and design of facilities in regard to safety
regulations and fall zone requirements.
            3.   Visual impact on surrounding properties and existing or
proposed screening and buffering.
            4.   Minimization or elimination of need or demand for additional
facilities due to increased colocation ability.
         B.   Any accessory building contemplated to enclose such things as
switching equipment shall be limited to the maximum height for accessory
structures within the zoning district.
      (2)   Setback. The setback from the lot line of a ground mounted wireless
telecommunication facility shall be equal to the fall zone which shall be no
less than the height of the structure, unless it can be demonstrated and
certified by a State licensed and registered professional engineer, to the
satisfaction of the Village’s Engineer or consultant, that the area within
which there is a potential hazard from falling ice or debris or collapsing
material is less than the height of the structure. Setbacks for equipment,
support shelter or structures, and fence enclosures shall be in accordance with
the required setbacks for the main or principal buildings as provided in the
schedule of regulations for the zoning district in which the ground mounted
wireless telecommunication facility is located.
      (3)   Access. There shall be unobstructed access to the ground mounted
wireless telecommunication facility, for operation, maintenance, repair and
inspection purposes, which may be provided through an easement. This access
shall have a width and location determined by such factors as the location of
adjacent thoroughfares and traffic circulation within the site; utilities
needed to service the wireless telecommunication facility; the location of
buildings and parking facilities, proximity to residential districts and
minimizing disturbance to the natural landscape; and the type of equipment
which will be needed to access the site.
      (4)   Land Division. The division of land for the purpose of locating a
ground mounted wireless telecommunication facility is prohibited unless all
zoning requirements and conditions are met.
   (c)   Standards Applicable to Location on Existing Structure. An applicant
may locate a wireless telecommunication facility on an existing support
structure, including a structure, building, tower or pole, provided it shall
not increase the height of the existing structure by more than 20 feet and
shall be camouflaged. Setback regulations of the zoning district shall apply.
Where a wireless telecommunication facility is proposed on the roof of a
building, it shall be designed, constructed and maintained to be
architecturally compatible with the principal building. The equipment enclosure
may be located within the principal building or may be an accessory building,
provided that an accessory building conforms with all district requirements for
accessory buildings, including yard setbacks and building height.
   (d)   Additional Standards Applicable to All Wireless Telecommunication
Facilities.
      (1)   Color. The Planning Commission shall, with respect to the color of
the wireless telecommunication facility and all accessory buildings, review and
approve the same so as to minimize distraction, reduce visibility, maximize
aesthetic appearance, and ensure compatibility with surroundings. Metal
structures shall be constructed of, or treated with, corrosion-resistant
material. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to maintain the
wireless telecommunication facility in a neat and orderly condition.
      (2)   Construction Code Compliance. Wireless telecommunication facilities
shall be constructed in accordance with all applicable construction codes and
shall include the submission of a certification from a State-licensed and
registered professional engineer that the structure will withstand high winds
and foreseeable impacts, and that the likelihood of failure or collapse is
insignificant; and shall also include a soils report from a geotechnical
engineer licensed in the State. The soils report shall include soil borings and
statements confirming the suitability of soil conditions for the proposed use.
The requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Federal
Communication Commission (FCC), and the Michigan Aeronautics Commission shall
be noted.
      (3)   Maintenance Plan. A maintenance plan, and any applicable
maintenance agreement, shall be presented as part of the site plan for the
proposed facility. Such plan shall be designed to ensure the long term,
continuous maintenance to a reasonably diligent standard.
      (4)   Camouflage.
         A.   Camouflage for facilities on existing structures - roof mounts.
When a wireless telecommunication facility extends above the roof height of a
structure on which it is mounted, the facility shall be disguised, concealed or
camouflaged within or behind existing or new architectural features to limit
its visibility from public ways. Facilities mounted on a roof shall be set back
from the front facade in order to minimize their visual impact.
         B.   Camouflage for facilities on existing structures - side mounts.
Wireless telecommunication facilities that are side mounted shall blend with
the existing structure’s architecture and, if individual antenna panels are
more than five square feet, the panels shall be painted or shielded with
material consistent with the design features and materials of the existing
structure.
         C.   Camouflage for ground mounted facilities. All ground mounted
wireless telecommunication facilities shall be surrounded by a dense vegetative
buffer to screen the view of the facility in all directions. This buffer must
be existing on the subject property planted on site, or be within a landscape
easement on an adjoining site. The Village Council shall have the authority to
decrease, relocate or alter the required buffer based on site conditions. The
vegetative buffer area shall be protected by a landscape easement or be within
the area of the applicant’s lease. The easement or lease shall specify that the
trees within the buffer shall not be removed or topped, and that dead or dying
trees shall be replaced.
      (5)   Equipment Shelters. Equipment shelters for wireless
telecommunication facilities shall be designed consistent with one of the
following design standards:
         A.   Equipment shelters shall be located in underground vaults;
         B.   Equipment shelters shall be designed so that the shelters are
architecturally consistent, with respect to materials and appearance, to the
buildings in the area of the wireless telecommunication facility;
         C.   Equipment shelters shall be camouflaged behind an effective year-
round landscape buffer, equal to the height of the proposed shelter and/or
wooden fence. The Planning Commission shall determine the style of fencing and/
or landscape buffer that is compatible with the neighborhood; or
         D.   If mounted on a rooftop, the equipment shall be concealed or

1266.01   INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   It is the intent of this chapter to require a minimum setback from natural
features and to regulate property within such setback in order to prevent
physical harm, impairment and/or destruction of or to a natural feature. It has
been determined that, in the absence of such a minimum setback, intrusions in
or onto natural features would occur, resulting in harm, impairment and/or
destruction of natural features contrary to the public health, safety and
general welfare. The regulation provided for in this chapter is based on the
police power for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare,
including the authority granted in the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to establish and preserve minimum setbacks
from natural features in order to recognize and make provision for the special
relationship, interrelationship and interdependency regarding physical
location, plant species, animal species and an encouragement of diversity and
richness of plant and animal species; over land and subsurface hydrology; water
table; water quality; and erosion or sediment deposition.
(Ord. 191. Passed 6-13-94; Ord. 2006-03. Passed 11- 13-06.)
1266.02   MAINTENANCE OF SETBACKS.
   A natural feature setback shall be maintained in relation to all areas
defined in this chapter as being a "natural feature," unless and to the extent
that it is determined to be in the public interest not to maintain such a
setback.
(Ord. 191. Passed 6-13-94.)
1266.03   NATURAL FEATURE DEFINED.
   As used in this chapter, "natural feature" means a wetland and/or a
watercourse.
(Ord. 191. Passed 6-13-94.)
1266.04   AUTHORIZATION AND PROHIBITION.
   (a)   The natural feature setback shall be an area or feature with
boundaries and limitations determined in accordance with the standards and
provisions of this chapter in relation to respective types of natural features.
   (b)   In conjunction with the review of plans submitted for authorization to
develop property or otherwise undertake an operation in, on or adjacent to a
natural feature, applicable natural feature setbacks shall be determined and
authorizations and prohibitions established by the body undertaking the plan
review.
   (c)   Within an established natural feature setback, unless and only to the
extent determined to be in the public interest by the body undertaking plan
review, there shall be no deposit of any material, including structures;
removal of any soils, minerals and/or vegetation; dredging, filling or land
balancing; and/or constructing or undertaking seasonal or permanent operations.
This prohibition shall not apply with regard to those activities exempted from
this prohibition in Section
1266.05.
   (d)   In determining whether proposed construction or operations are in the
public interest, the benefit which would reasonably be expected to accrue from
the proposal shall be balanced against the reasonably foreseeable detriments of
the construction or other operation, taking into consideration local, State and
national concern for the protection and preservation of the natural feature in
question. If, as a result of such balancing, there remains a debatable question
as to whether the proposed project and/or operation is clearly in the public
interest, authorization for the construction and/or operation within the
natural feature setback shall not be granted. The following general criteria
shall be applied in undertaking this balancing test:
      (1)   The relative extent of the public and private need for the proposed
activity.
      (2)   The availability of feasible and prudent alternative locations and
methods to accomplish the expected benefits from the activity.
      (3)   The extent and permanence of the beneficial or detrimental effects
which the proposed activity may have on the public and private use to which the
area is suited, including the benefits the natural feature and/or natural
feature setback provides.
      (4)   The probable impact of the proposed construction and/or operation
in relation to the cumulative effect created by other existing and anticipated
activities in the natural feature to be protected.
      (5)   The probable impact on recognized historic, cultural, scenic,
ecological or recreational values, and on fish, wildlife and the public health.
      (6)   The size and quantity of the natural feature setback being
considered.
      (7)   The amount and quantity of the remaining natural feature setback.
      (8)   Proximity of the proposed construction and/or operation in relation
to the natural feature, taking into consideration the degree of slope, general
topography in the area, soil type and the nature of the natural feature to be
protected.
      (9)   Economic value, both public and private, of the proposed
construction and/or operation, and economic value, both public and private, if
the proposed construction and/or operation were not permitted.
      (10)   The necessity for the proposed construction and/or operation.
(Ord. 191. Passed 6-13-94.)
1266.05   EXEMPTIONS.
   If, and to the extent that, the Municipality is prohibited by its ordinances
and/or law from regulating the proposed activity in or on the respective
natural feature, then regulation under this chapter shall be exempted.
(Ord. 191. Passed 6-13-94.)
1266.06   APPLICATION FORM.
   Application for plan review consistent with this chapter shall be made on
forms as approved by the Franklin Village Council.
(Ord. 191. Passed 6-13-94.)
1266.07   SETBACK STANDARDS.
   Unless otherwise determined by the body undertaking the plan review, the
following setbacks shall apply:
   (a)   A twenty-five foot setback from the boundary or edge of a wetland, as
defined and regulated in Chapter 1226.
   (b)   A twenty-five foot setback from the ordinary high water mark of a
watercourse, including, from a natural or artificial lake, pond or impoundment,
river, stream or creek which may or may not be serving as a drain as defined by
Act 40 of the Public Acts of 1956, as amended, or any other body of water which
has definite banks, a bed and visible evidence of a continued flow or continued
occurrence of water.
   (c)   A setback distance determined during plan review to be reasonably
required in order to prevent probable and unreasonable physical intrusion in or
onto a protected natural feature, taking into consideration degree of slope,
soil type, the nature and type of activities anticipated to impact upon the
natural feature and the nature and type of the natural feature to be protected,
provided, in all events, that the setback shall not be greater than twenty-five
feet. For purposes of this provision, unreasonable physical intrusion shall be
deemed to be a physical intrusion which would be damaging, impairing and/or
undermining to the usefulness and/or function of the natural feature. Such
unreasonable physical intrusions may include an architectural feature of a
dwelling or accessory building, including porches and decks, or playground
equipment and other similar structures.

1268.13A   ROOF-MOUNTED SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS.
   Roof-mounted solar energy systems in Zones R-E, R-L, R-M, R-1, R-2, R-3 and
R-4 Single-Family Residential Districts, RO-1 Restricted Office District and C-
1 Commercial District shall comply with the following regulations.
   (a)   Permit Required. A building permit shall be required for installation
of roof mounted systems.
   (b)   Type of System. Roof-mounted solar energy systems, also referred to as
solar panels, may include integrated solar panels as the surface layer of the
roof structure with no additional apparent change in relief or projection, or
separate flush mounted solar panels attached to the roof.
   (c)   Mounting and Projection.
      (1)   Sloped Roofs:
         A.   Solar panels shall be mounted flush (within six inches of the
roof surface), shall not project above the peak of the roof, and if integrated
solar panels that also serve as the surface layer of the roof structure with no
additional apparent change in relief or projection, then not beyond any roof
edge.
         B.   Solar panels shall not be mounted on any roof that is steeper
than 11/12 pitch or on the face of any building.
         C.   Solar panels that are separate flush mounted solar panels
attached to the roof shall be set back a minimum of two feet from any roof
edge.
      (2)   Flat Roofs:
         A.   Solar panels shall not project more than two feet above the roof
plane at its highest point on the back edge of any panel. Front edge of the
panel shall be no greater than six inches from the roof plane.
         B.   Solar panels shall be set back a minimum of two feet from any
roof edge.
         C.   Framework and/or hardware used to affix the solar panels that is
visible from the edge of the structure must be the same color as the roof
underneath so as to minimize the visual impact of the system.
   (d)   Height. In no case is a roof mounted solar energy system in Zones R-E,
R-L, R-M, R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4 Single-Family Residential Districts, RO-
1 Restricted Office District and C-1 Commercial District permitted to be
installed in a manner that would exceed the maximum height restrictions
applicable for the property.
   (e)   Glare and Screening.
      (1)   Glare: Glare shall not be generated that would project onto
adjacent property; therefore, non-reflectiveness through design, material, or a
combination of both, must be demonstrated in the submitted plans.
      (2)   Screening: Vegetative or architectural screening may be required
if, in the determination of the Building Official, the roof mounted solar
energy system is proposed in a location or manner that is reasonably expected
to be negatively impactful in terms of glare, noise, or visual impact to
adjacent property owners and the effects can be mitigated by such means.
   (f)   Removal. If a roof-mounted solar energy system in Zones R-E, R-L, R-M,
R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4 Single-Family Residential Districts, RO-1 Restricted
Office District and C-1 Commercial District ceases to perform its intended
function (generating electricity) for more than six consecutive months, the
operator must remove the collectors, mounts, and associated equipment and
facilities no later than 90 days after the end of the six-month period. Where
the removal has not been lawfully completed as required above, and after at
least 30 days' written notice, the Village may remove or secure the removal of
the solar energy system or portion thereof, with the Village's actual cost of
administrative and legal charges to be placed as a lien on the property.
(Ord. 2020-05. Passed 9-14-20.)

1268.15   AUTOMOBILE SERVICE STATIONS AND PUBLIC GARAGES.
   In order to regulate and control the problems of noise, odor, light, fumes,
vibration, dust, danger of fire and explosion, and traffic congestion which
result from the unrestricted and unregulated construction and operations of
automobile service stations, and to regulate and control the adverse affects
which these and other problems incidental to the automobile service station may
exercise upon adjacent and surrounding areas, the following additional
regulations and requirements are provided herein for automobile service
stations located in any zone. All automobile service stations erected after the
effective date of this Zoning Code, as amended, shall comply with all
requirements of this section. No automobile service station existing on the
effective date of this Zoning Code, as amended, shall be structurally altered
so as to provide a lesser degree of conformity with the provisions of this
section than existed on the effective date of this Zoning Code, as amended.

adjoining a residentially zoned district.
   (c)   All driveways providing ingress to or egress from an automobile
service station shall be not more than thirty feet wide at the lot line. No
more than one curb opening shall be permitted for each fifty feet of frontage
or major fraction thereof along any street. No driveway or curb opening shall
be located nearer than twenty feet to any intersecting street right of way or
adjacent residential property. No driveway shall be located nearer than thirty
feet, as measured along the property line, to any other driveway giving access
to or from the same automobile service station.
   (d)   A raised curb six inches in height shall be erected along all street
lot lines, except for driveway openings.
   (e)   The entire lot, excluding the area occupied by a building, shall be
hard-surfaced with concrete or a plant-mixed bituminous material, except
desirable landscaped areas which shall be separated from all paved ares by a
low barrier or curb.
   (f)   All lubrication equipment, motor vehicle washing equipment, hydraulic
hoists and pits shall be enclosed entirely within a building. All gasoline
pumps shall be located not less than twenty feet from any lot line, and shall
be arranged so that major vehicles shall not be supplied with gasoline or
serviced while parked upon or overhanging any public sidewalk, street or right
of way.
   (g)   An automobile service station shall include not more than four double
gasoline pumps or eight single gasoline pumps and three enclosed stalls for
servicing, lubricating, greasing and/or washing motor vehicles.
   (h)   Where an automobile service station adjoins property located in any
residential zone, a solid masonry wall five feet in height shall be erected and
maintained along the lot line adjoining the residential zone, or, if separated
from the residential zone by an alley, then along the alley lot line. In
addition, all outside trash areas of used tires, auto parts and other items
shall be enclosed on all sides by said five-foot masonry wall. All masonry
walls shall be protected by a fixed curb or barrier to prevent vehicles from
contacting the wall. Walls shall be gradually reduced in height (e.g. stepped
down) within twenty-five feet of any street right of way.

(Ord. 101. Passed 2-20-70.)
1268.16   GARAGES, BASEMENTS AND ACCESSORY AND TEMPORARY BUILDINGS USED FOR
DWELLING PURPOSES.

1268.17   BUILDING GRADES.
   Any building requiring yard space shall be located at such an elevation that
a sloping grade shall be maintained to cause the flow of surface water to run
away from the walls of the building. A sloping grade, beginning at the curb
level as determined by the Building Department, shall be maintained and
established from the center of the front lot line to the finished grade line at
the front of the building. The rear and side yards shall be sloped to allow for
the flow of surface water away from the building without creating a nuisance.
However, this shall not prevent the grading of a yard space to provide sunken
or terraced areas, provided that proper means are constructed and maintained to
prevent the run-off of surface water from creating a nuisance on the adjacent
properties.
   When a new building is constructed on a vacant lot between two existing
buildings or adjacent to an existing building, the reference level, as defined
in Section
1240.08, shall be used in determining the grade around the new building, and
the yard around the new building shall be graded in such a manner as to meet
existing grades and not to permit run-off of surface water to flow onto the
adjacent properties.
   Final grades shall be approved by the Building Department, which may require
a certificate of grading and location of building within the Village of
Franklin, in accordance with the approved grading plan on file with the
Building Department, which has been duly completed and certified by a
registered civil engineer or land surveyor.
   At no point on a site shall the combined effect of filling or excavation
result in a change of grade of greater than five feet over the entire site.
This provision shall not apply to filling and excavation necessary to provide
vehicular access to a site.
(Ord. 101. Passed 2-20-70; Ord. 2005-05. Passed 1-10-05.)
1268.18   MOVING OF BUILDINGS.
   No building or structure which has been wholly or partially erected on any
premises shall be moved except as provided for in Section
1264.07.
(Ord. 101. Passed 2-20-70.)
1268.19   EXCAVATIONS OR HOLES.
   The construction, maintenance or existence within the Village of Franklin of
any unprotected, unbarricaded, open or dangerous excavations, holes, pits or
wells, or of any excavations, holes or pits which constitute a danger or menace
to public health, safety or welfare, are hereby prohibited. However, this
section shall not prevent any excavation under a permit issued by the Building
Code of the Village of Franklin where such excavations are properly protected
and warning signs are posted in such a manner as may be required by the
Building Department per Section
1268.28, Fences. This section shall not apply to natural bodies of water or to
ditches, streams, reservoirs or other bodies of water created or existing by
authority of the State of Michigan, County of Oakland, Village of Franklin or
other governmental agency.
(Ord. 101. Passed 2-20-70; Ord. 2017-07. Passed 10-9-17.) Penalty, see Section
1242.99
1268.20   EXCAVATION, REMOVAL AND FILLING OF LAND.
   The excavation, removal, filling or depositing of any type of earth
material, topsoil, gravel, rock, garbage, rubbish or other wastes or by-
products, is not permitted in any zoning district except as provided for in a
separate soil removal and landfill ordinance of the Village. (Ord. 101. Passed
2-20-70.)

   (a)   Definitions.
      (1)   Fence. “Fence” means an artificially constructed, non-vegetative
barrier of natural or artificial materials used to prevent or control ingress/
egress, confine within, or mark a boundary. A fence may be decorative or
ornamental. Gates or barriers to entry and exit, driveway entrance features,
screening walls, and other types of boundary protection shall be included in
this definition.
      (2)   Perimeter feature. “Perimeter feature” means a type of fence
running along the perimeter of a lot either on or within six feet of a lot
line.
      (3)   Privacy screen. “Privacy screen” means a type of fence that is a
substantially opaque barrier intended to screen a selected use or particular
area in a private residential yard.
      (4)   Interior fence. “Interior fence” means a type of fence that is not
a perimeter feature or a privacy screen.
      (5)   Road. “Road” has the same meaning as “street” as defined in Section
1240.08 (b)(69).
      (6)   Construction fence. “Construction fence” means a temporary
artificially constructed fence used to prevent or control entrance or access
pursuant to a permit issued by the Village of Franklin Building Official under
Section
1268.19  of the Zoning Code.
      (7)   Garden enclosure. "Garden enclosure" is a type of interior fence
that is used to enclose an area used for the growing of vegetables, flowers,
etc. used for human consumption but not for commercial sale.
   (b)   General Requirements Applicable to All Fences.
      (1)   Ownership. Ownership and responsibility for maintenance of a fence
resides in the owner of the property on which the fence is located.
         A.   Provision for joint ownership. Owners of adjoining properties may
jointly apply for a fence permit, in which case the Building Official may
permit the fence to be constructed on the common property line. Both property
owners shall jointly own the fence and shall be jointly and severably
responsible for maintenance of the fence.
      (2)   Fence materials. In order to protect the beauty and established
historic character of the Village, the following standards shall apply:
         A.   The exterior of a fence shall be constructed primarily of wood,
stone, brick, wrought iron, or other material determined by the Zoning Board of
Appeals to mimic an above listed material.
         B.   Fence materials and construction pattern must be consistent along
a single lot line.
         C.   Fences constructed on properties where one did not exist before
must be constructed of the same material long any lot line where the fence is
proposed to be constructed.
         D.   Prohibited materials. Razor wire and barbed wire are prohibited
on any type of fence. Fences utilizing wire mesh or chain link are also
prohibited, except as otherwise expressly permitted (e.g., garden enclosures,
tennis court enclosures, dog runs, baseball backstops, cemeteries, fences
enclosing public areas, construction fences).
         E.   Prohibited designs. No permitted fence of any variety may contain
decorative fence toppers, finials, spears or other fence toppers which contain
a pointed finish if such decorative items are situated along the top of the
primary fencing material. Ball finials are permissible but only if they measure
not less than three inches each in diameter. A fence topper shall be considered
to be pointed if the upper most portion of the topper is not larger than its
base, or, if in the opinion of the Building Official, such a fence topper is
considered to be capable of impaling or otherwise penetrating the flesh of any
person or animal, either intentionally or through accidental or forceful
contact with same.
         F.   Electricity-conducting fences. A fence erected around the
perimeter of a pasture where horses or other permitted large animals are
restrained may include electrified wire strands around the top or interior of
the pasture fence. Other fences which carry electric current are prohibited,
except for underground electric fences as defined in Section
1240.08 (b)(23A).
      (3)   Finished appearance. If, because of design or construction, one
side of a fence has a more finished appearance than the other, the side of the
fence with the more finished appearance shall face the exterior of the lot.
This provision concerning the finished appearance does not apply to jointly
owned fences located on a property line.
      (4)   Height. Except as otherwise expressly permitted herein, fences
shall not exceed 48 inches in height. As used in this section, the height of a
fence is measured from the surrounding surface of the ground and not from any
structure or localized raised surface on which the fence is situated.
         A.   Fences enclosing public areas. Fences that enclose public parks,
playgrounds, or similar public areas located within a residential district
shall not exceed 8 feet in height, except that a fence enclosing one or more
public tennis courts can extend to 12 feet in height and a protective screening
used for a public baseball field backstop can be made at a suitable height and
length for its intended purpose. Tennis court fences and baseball backstops can
be made of chain link fencing.
      (5)   Location. A fence shall be located entirely on the private property
of the person responsible for the construction and maintenance of the fence.
         A.   Permitted locations. Except as specifically provided below,
fences are permitted only in rear yards and side yards. No fence shall be
permitted to extend into the front yard, except as otherwise specifically
provided herein. For side yards and rear yards abutting a street, no fence
shall be constructed or maintained within any required setback from the street.
         B.   Path setback. No fence shall be located closer than 12 inches
from the edge of a public sidewalk or other public path.
      (6)   Fence maintenance. Fences shall be maintained in good condition.
Rotten or broken components shall be replaced, repaired, or removed. If a fence
is found to be in need of repair by the Building Official, he or she shall
issue orders to complete such repairs to the owner of the land where the fence
is located. Failure to comply with written notice from the Building Official
shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning Code.
      (7)   Obstruction of use of adjoining property. No fence shall be erected
where it would prevent or unreasonably obstruct the use of or access to
adjacent property. The Building Official may require a fence to be set back up
to two feet from a driveway or property line to provide for the safe passage of
pedestrians, bicyclists, or vehicular traffic, or for other safety-related
concerns.
      (8)   Driver visibility. No fence shall be erected, established or
maintained on any lot which will obstruct the view of drivers in vehicles
traveling around sharp curves in the road or approaching an intersection of two
roads or the intersection of a road and a driveway.
         A.   Sharp curves. Fences located along a curve in a road shall
provide drivers with an unobstructed sight distance that is reasonable in view
of the road curvature and applicable speed limit for the road. The Building
Official may restrict or deny a fence permit as necessary to provide this
unobstructed sight distance.
         B.   Intersections. Fences located adjacent to an intersection of two
roads or an intersection of a road and a driveway shall not exceed 30 inches in
height. An unobstructed triangular area shall be maintained at each
intersection of roads and streets and driveways. Fences located in the
triangular area shall not be permitted to obstruct cross-visibility above a
height of 30 inches above the lowest point of the intersecting road(s) or
driveway(s). The unobstructed triangular area shall consist of:
            1.   In the case of two roads, the triangular area formed at the
corner intersection of the two road right-of-way lines, with two sides of the
triangular area being 25 feet in length measured along the intersecting right-
of-way lines, and the third side being a line connecting the distal ends of the
two 25 foot sides; and
            2.   In the case of an intersecting road and driveway, the
triangular area formed at the corner intersection of the road right of way and
an edge of the driveway, with one side of the triangular area being ten feet in
length measured along the right-of-way line, a second side being 10 feet in
length measured along the edge of the driveway, and the third side being a line
connecting the distal ends of the two ten foot two sides.
      (9)   Tennis court enclosures. A private tennis court located on a
residential lot may include a chain link fence enclosing each end of the court
and extending towards the net no farther than the midpoint between the base
line and service line. The chain link fence may have a maximum height of 12
feet and the opacity of such fence shall not exceed 50 percent.
      (10)   Outdoor dog runs. One fenced pet exercise area ("dog run") may be
permitted per residential lot, subject to the following:
         A.   Location. A dog run shall not be permitted in any required front
yard or required street side yard.

of a lot, subject to the following:
         A.   Location. A garden enclosure shall not be permitted in any front
yard nor any required side yard.
         B.   Height. Garden enclosures shall not exceed eight feet in height,
inclusive of any structures on which they sit, including raised planter beds.
         C.   Materials. Garden enclosures shall be constructed of any
combination of treated wood or galvanized or welded wire, which may be coated
with vinyl or PVC. The fencing commonly referred to as "chicken wire" is
expressly permitted, only so long as it is made of galvanized wire. Chain link
fencing is a prohibited material.
         D.   Opacity. Garden enclosures' opacity shall not exceed 20 percent.
         E.   Spacing. There shall be a maximum spacing of 1" by 2" between the
enclosure wires.

iron-type fences and gates.
      (1)   Perimeter feature area defined. For the purposes of this section,
“perimeter feature area” shall be defined as the vertical rectangular area
having sides defined as follows:
         A.   Base. The base of the rectangle shall be the existing average
ground surface elevation at the nearest perpendicular lot line.
         B.   Top. The upper side of the rectangle shall be parallel to the
base and 60 inches above the base.
         C.   Sides. The two remaining sides of the rectangle shall be lines
extending vertically between the base and top at the ends of the fence.
         D.   Only one rectangle shall be used to measure each perimeter
feature area on a single extent of the property line.

      (2)   Opacity defined. For the purposes of this subsection, opacity shall
be defined as the percentage measurement of the area obstructed by wood, metal,
wire, plants, and all other materials used in the creation of a perimeter
feature. Opacity equals the area of construction materials divided by the
“perimeter feature area”.
      (3)   Maximum opacity. The opacity of a perimeter feature shall not
exceed 40 percent, except that the opacity of perimeter features constructed of
stone or other natural materials (e.g., stone walls) shall be 50 percent. This
maximum opacity limitation shall not apply to driveway entrance features for
which the total length does not exceed ten percent of the length of the lot
line along which it is located.
      (4)   Location. In addition to the permitted locations provided in
Section
1268.28 (b)(5), perimeter features may be located in the front and side yards,
and street side yards under the following conditions.
         A.   Historic District. Subject to Historic District Commission
approval as required by Section
1268.28 (e)(2)(E), a perimeter feature may be located in a front yard or street
side yard of a parcel located in the Franklin Village Historic District.
         B.   Natural stone walls. Perimeter features made from natural stone
having a height not exceeding 30 inches can be located in a front yard or
street side yard. In the event that a particular architectural element
(entrance gate, column, etc.) is included as an integral component of the stone
perimeter feature, that architectural element may exceed 30 inches in height.
The total horizontal length of such architectural elements shall not exceed the
greater of ten feet or ten percent of the total length of the perimeter
feature.
      (5)   Setbacks. A perimeter feature shall be set back at least two feet
from all road rights-of-way or public easements.
      (6)   Materials at a property corner. To reduce the safety hazard to
pedestrians and bicyclists, a perimeter feature used at a property corner must
be primarily constructed of materials that will be easily visible at night or
during other times of low visibility. By way of example, thin strands of wire,
cable, or cord shall not be permitted to be attached to standing poles to form
a perimeter feature.
      (7)   Maximum height. The maximum height of perimeter features is 48
inches.
   (d)   Privacy screens. Privacy screens may be placed on the interior of a
lot, subject to the following:
      (1)   Height. Privacy screens shall not exceed six feet in height.
      (2)   Location. Privacy screens shall not be located in a required yard
setback area.
      (3)   Limits on enclosure. A privacy screen shall be designed to screen a
selected use or area (such as a swimming pool or patio) but not an entire side
or rear yard. In no case shall a privacy screen be located in a front yard or
both side yards.
      (4)   Materials. Privacy screens shall be constructed primarily of wood,
masonry, or wrought iron.
   (e)   Construction Fences.
      (1)   Height. Construction fences shall not exceed seven feet in height.
      (2)   Location. Construction fences shall be required around any open
holes during excavation or construction, and may be located anywhere on public
or private property, including in any required yard.
      (3)   Materials. Construction fences shall be constructed of neutral-
colored metal hoarding or wire mesh or chain link.
      (4)   Duration. Construction fences are permitted for the period of time
during which an open hole, pit or well is present associated with excavation or
construction, or as otherwise required by the Building Official as deemed
necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.
   (f)   Review and Approval Procedures.
      (1)   Permit required. No fence shall be erected, constructed, or altered
until a permit has been issued in accordance with the provisions of this
section.
         A.   Site plan review. If a fence is proposed in conjunction with a
development that requires site plan review, then the fence shall be shown on
the site plan, which shall be reviewed in accordance with normal site plan
review procedures. No additional permit is required when a fence is approved as
part of a site plan. Where a fence is proposed to be added to a property for
which a required site plan approval has previously been obtained, the approved
site plan must be modified to show the fence and then re-submitted for action
by the Building Official according to the application procedure of Section
1268.28 (e)(2).
      (2)   Application procedure. If a proposed fence is not part of a site
plan review as noted above, an application for a permit to construct a fence
shall be filed with the Village Clerk. The application shall be accompanied by
drawings and other information to illustrate the dimensions, design and
location of the proposed fence.
         A.   Information required. The following minimum information shall be
included on the drawing submitted in support of a fence permit application:
            1.   Fence location;
            2.   Location of all structures within 25 feet of the proposed
fence;
            3.   Location of all driveways within 25 feet of the proposed
fence;
            4.   Location of all sidewalks within 25 feet of the proposed
fence; and
            5.   Location of all existing fences within ten feet of the
proposed fence.
               The Building Official may determine if other additional
information is reasonably necessary to provide a complete review of the
proposed fence. Such additional information shall be provided by the applicant
as may be required by the Building Official.
         B.   Application fee. Each fence permit application shall be
accompanied by an application review fee to recover the reasonable costs for
review and permit issuance. The amount of the fee shall be fixed by resolution
of the Village Council.
         C.   Survey required. Where a perimeter feature is proposed, the lot
lines on the property shall be indicated through placement of permanent stakes
located by a licensed surveyor. Lot lines must be located before the fence
permit is issued. The Building Official shall withhold issuance of the permit
to construct the fence until the lot lines are located and permanent stakes are
placed by a licensed surveyor.
         D.   Review and approval. The Building Official shall review the fence
application and supporting data with respect to the standards set forth in this
Zoning Code, the adopted Building Code, and any administrative rules which may
be established to provide for proper administration of this section. The
Building Official shall grant a permit to construct a proposed fence upon
finding that it fully complies with all applicable regulations. All fences,
including fences approved as part of a site plan, are subject to inspection by
the Building Official to assure compliance with the regulations set forth in
this Zoning Code and to assure that the fence is constructed with sound
materials.
         E.   Fences in the Historic District. Except for construction fences,
fences proposed to be erected in the Franklin Village Historic District shall
be referred to the Franklin Historic District Commission for review and
recommendation prior to issuance of a building permit, consistent with the
provisions of Section
1230.05 . The Historic District Commission shall take action on the application
consistent with the provisions of Section
1230.05 . In no event shall the Historic District Commission approve a fence
that could not be otherwise constructed in accordance with the various
provisions of this section.
      (3)   Appeal of a decision. An applicant may appeal a decision of the
Building Official or the Planning Commission concerning a proposed fence or the
enforcement of the provisions of this section to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall review the appeal in accordance with the
standards and procedures set forth for a dimensional variance in this Zoning
Code.
   (4)   Administrative rules. The Village Council may establish reasonable
rules and procedures, consistent with the intentions of this Zoning Code, which
may be necessary to provide for the proper administration of this section.

1268.29   SCREENING.
   (a)   General Requirements. Screening, as described in this section, shall
be required whenever nonresidential uses in RO-1 and C-1 districts abut
residentially-zoned districts. Such screening shall be required whenever a new
nonresidential use is established, an existing nonresidential use is expanded,
or an existing nonresidential use is changed to another nonresidential use,
unless screening already exists that conforms to ordinance requirements.
   (b)   Coordination with Section
1268.28. Screening fence and wall requirements in this section supersede
comparable requirements in Section
1268.28, because fences and walls regulated in this section are intended
primarily to provide a visual barrier, whereas fences and walls regulated by
Section
1268.28 are intended primarily for enclosure or as an aesthetic feature.
   (c)   Screening Requirements and Options.
      (1)   Required screening shall be provided along the entire length of the
nonresidential property that abuts the residential property.
      (2)   Required screening shall be located on the nonresidential property.
      (3)   Required screening shall be maintained in perpetuity by the
property owner or his or her designee. Maintenance shall include replacement of
dead or diseased plant material.
      (4)   An applicant may select one of the following screening options, or
a combination thereof, subject to Village Council approval, upon receiving a
recommendation from the Planning Commission:
            A.   A “living fence,” consisting of trees, shrubs, or hedges, with
a minimum height of four and one-half feet.
            B.   A wooden fence, consisting of cedar, treated wood, or a
material similar in appearance to wood, with a minimum height of four and one-
half feet and a maximum height of six and one-half feet. Stockade fences are
not permitted.
            C.   A masonry wall, consisting of stone or having face brick, with
a minimum height of four and one-half feet and a maximum height of six and one-
half feet.
   (d)   Specifications. Proposed screening shall be shown on a site plan or
landscape plan in sufficient detail and at an appropriate scale to allow
evaluation by the Planning Commission and Village Council. Specifications
required for each screening option follow.
      (1)   Living Fence. The plan shall identity each proposed plant by common
and scientific name. A schedule shall be provided on the plan that indicates
the total number of each plant, spacing, and size at time of planting. Plants
shall be chosen that can be reasonably expected to form a visual barrier having
minimum opacity of 80% at least four and one-half feet above ground level
within two years of planting.
      (2)   Wooden Fence. The plan shall specify the type of wood to be used,
the style of fence, the proposed color or shade of stain, dimensions, and
construction details (e. g., depth and method of anchoring posts). To form a
visual barrier, a fence style shall be selected that provides as near to 100%
opacity as possible. Fences shall have a finished appearance on both sides.
However, a fence that is has a finished appearance on only one side may be
permitted provided landscaping is provided to screen the side that does not
have a finished appearance.
      (3)   Masonry Wall. The plan shall indicate brick color, cap design and
material, dimensions, and construction details.
   (e)   Approval Options.
      (1)   Site Plan Review. If the proposed screening is part of a
development that requires site plan review, then the screening shall be
considered in conjunction with the overall site plan, and therefore shall
require review by the Planning Commission and approval by the Village Council.
      (2)   Independent of Site Plan Review. If screening is proposed but site
plan review is not otherwise required, then only Planning Commission approval
shall be necessary.
      (3)   Option to Waive or Modify Requirements. The Village Council, upon
receiving a recommendation from the Planning Commission, may waive or modify
the screening requirements in this section upon making one or more of the
following findings:
         A.   Existing natural vegetation or plantings on the nonresidential
parcel already provide sufficient screening.
         B.   The areas, buildings, or uses to be screened are at least 200
feet from the nearest residential district.
         C.   Because of the juxtaposition of existing and/or proposed
buildings, screening would provide no discernible benefit.
         D.   Because of aesthetic qualities of buildings or uses on the
nonresidential parcel it is reasonable to waive or modify screening
requirements.
   (f)   Penalty. All violations of this section shall be municipal civil
infractions and upon a determination of responsibility therefor shall be
punishable by a civil fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00).

character as to be consistent with the zoning regulations and standards
contained herein. Furthermore, the development shall not be detrimental to the
orderly development of the zoning district in which it is located or of the
adjacent zoning districts.
      (2)   The location and size of the proposed development, the nature and
intensity of the principal use and all accessory to it, shall be such that
traffic to and from the use or uses, and the assembly of persons in connection
therewith, will not be hazardous or inconvenient to the neighborhood nor

1268.29  where such screening would serve no good purpose, where other methods
of screening would be suitable or where alternative solutions achieve the
intent and purpose of this Zoning Code.
   (f)   Planning Commission Action. The Planning Commission is authorized to
take the following action on the site plan, subject to the guidelines in the
zoning ordinance: recommend approval, approval with conditions, or denial to
the Village Council. The Planning Commission may also table the site plan.
      (1)   Approval. Upon determination that a site plan contains the
information required by the Zoning Ordinance and is in compliance with the
standards, conditions and requirements of this section, other statutorily
authorized and adopted Village planning documents, other applicable ordinances,
and state and federal statutes, the Planning Commission shall recommend
approval.
      (2)   Approval Subject to Conditions. Upon determination that a site plan

   Any portion of the fee not needed to pay expenses shall be refunded without
interest to the applicant after final action on the application.
   (i)   Revocation of Site Plan Approval. Site plan approval may be revoked if
construction is not in conformance with the approved plans, in which case the
Village Council shall give the applicant notice of intention to revoke approval
at least ten days prior to review at a public meeting by the Village Council.
Upon conclusion of such review, the Village Council may revoke its approval of
the plan if the Council feels that a violation in fact exists and has not been
remedied prior to such hearing. If the building has already been occupied and
the applicant fails to abide by any restrictions after due notice, the

terminated; if the site plan would otherwise have expired, it shall be deemed
to have thus expired. Notwithstanding any provision of this division (j), the
Village Council may, on proper application, grant an extension or extensions of
any approved site plan for good cause shown. No such extension shall be granted
unless there is full compliance with all applicable site plan requirements
which may be in effect at the time of the application for extension.

Council, the Village Council shall adopt a resolution by a majority of the
members then present and constituting a quorum, either approving or rejecting
the application for special approval use. The Village Council may, in its
conclusions and resolution, adopt the findings and recommendations of the
Planning Commission, may adopt some of the findings and conclusions of the
Planning Commission, may adopt and/or modify any of the conclusions or
recommendations of the Planning Commission, or may make its own findings.
      (1)   Approval of such proposed special use may provide for certain
specific seasonal, fundraising, charitable or other events of a defined and
limited nature;
      (2)   Nothing herein shall preclude the Village Council, on application
made in writing, and for good cause shown, to permit other specific events as
part of such proposed special use, provided that such an event is not of a
regularly recurring nature, is consistent with the special use approval, is
harmonious with surrounding land uses and is of a defined and specific nature.
The Village Council may impose requirements on such additional events as will
insure compliance with this Zoning Code. No approval of any such event or
activity shall be deemed to assure approval of any additional events or
activities, nor shall any such permit in any way expand or enlarge the special
use approval.
   (i)   In the event of rejection by the Village Council of an application for
special approval use, no application for the same special use shall be filed
for the same property within a period of twenty-four months from the date of
action by the Village Council.

approval use, such use shall immediately cease and may not continue. Such time
period may not be extended except by re-application consistent with the
provisions of this section.
   (k)   Where a special approval is also a use for which site plan review is
required in accordance with Section
1268.30, the applicant may elect at the time of application for special use
approval to file a joint application for special use approval and site plan
approval. In such event, the requirements of this section for special use
approval as well as each and every requirement for site plan approval shall be
applicable in accordance with this section as well as Section
1268.30. In the event of a joint application for special use approval and site
plan approval, no special use shall be approved unless it shall meet each and
every requirement for site plan approval, and no site plan approval shall be
granted unless such proposed use shall meet each and every requirement for
special use approval.

**   The minimum cubic content shall be calculated as defined herein (see
Section
1240.07(20)).
   (a)   The maximum building height in the R-E, R-L, R-M, R-1, and R-
2 districts shall be determined in accordance with the following graphic
representation 1 or mathematical representation 2:
      Graphic representation 1: In the appropriate location and at the proper
scale on the front elevation, draw a 15' x 20' "measurement triangle" as
illustrated below. Extend the dashed line to 35 feet high. No portion of the
building may extend into the setback or above the dashed line.
      Mathematical representation 2: The maximum permitted height relative to
the side property line is equal to: (1.33 x side setback measured in feet), up
to a maximum height at the peak of roof of 35 feet.
   (b)   The total of both side setbacks shall not be less than one-third (1/3)
of the lot width. The smaller of the side setbacks shall be equal to or greater
than 37% of the total of both side setbacks.
   (c)   In the R-E, R-L, R-M, R-1, and R-2 districts, the maximum height
measured at the rear of the building shall be determined using a measurement
triangle, in accordance with the following guidelines (see graphic 2):
      (1)   Extend the average grade line horizontally from the rear face of
the house to the rear property line (point A).
      (2)   Mark the 40-foot rear yard setback (35-foot in the R-2 district) on
the horizontal grade line.
      (3)   At the 40-foot mark (35-foot mark in the R-2 district), extend a
20-foot long line upward and perpendicular to the horizontal grade line. The
top of the perpendicular line is point B.
      (4)   Connect points A and B and extend the line until it intersects the
maximum height line established for the front elevation.
      (5)   No portion of the building may extend into the setback or above the
rear elevation maximum height line.

1464.01   PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of flood plain controls to apply special regulations to
the use of land in those areas of the Village which are subject to flooding at
recurring intervals, to protect economic property values, aesthetic values,
riparian rights and other natural resource values associated with the flood
plains of Franklin Village. Such regulations, while permitting reasonable
economic use of such properties, will protect the public health and reduce
financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental units and its
individuals by periodic floods, and reserve such areas for the impoundment of
the water to better stabilize stream flow and to better maintain the proper
ecological balance. Further, the purpose of this chapter is to comply with the
provisions and requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program, as
constituted in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and
subsequent enactments and rules and regulations promulgated in furtherance of
this program by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

or cause substantial damage to public or private property in the event of a
flood. Further, it is the intent of Council to avoid pollution of the Franklin
Branch of the Rouge River.

Council for review and consideration as to whether or not a resolution of
approval should be adopted. Construction or development shall not take place
within a flood plain unless prior approval is obtained from the Village
Council. Each application shall be filed with the Village Clerk’s office and
contain the following information as a condition precedent to consideration of
such request:
      (1)   Names and addresses of parties of interest in the premises setting
forth their legal interest in said premises.
      (2)   Full legal description of the premises wherein development is
proposed.
      (3)   A site plan sealed by a registered professional engineer or

1474.01   PURPOSE.
   These regulations are intended to permit signs and other outdoor displays
(referred to herein collectively as signs) that are needed for the purposes of
identification or advertising, or, in the case of special displays, are
intended to be decorative in nature, subject to the following objectives:
   (a)   By reason of their size, location, spacing, construction or manner of
display, signs shall not endanger life or limb, confuse or mislead drivers,
obstruct vision necessary for traffic safety, or otherwise endanger public
health or safety.
   (b)   Signs should enhance the aesthetic appeal of the Village, including
the preservation of its historic and cultural resources, scenic areas and
viewsheds, and the dark night sky. Thus, these regulations are intended to:
      (1)   Regulate oversized signs that are out-of-scale with surrounding
buildings and structures, and
      (2)   Prevent an excessive accumulation of signs that cause visual
clutter.
   (c)   The placement and design of signs should further the land use planning
objectives of the Village. Signs should protect neighborhood character and the
value of surrounding properties.

pass inspection. If, within fourteen (14) days of receiving written notice, the
owner has failed to take steps to correct the violation, then the Building
Official shall send written notice to remove the sign within fourteen (14)
days. If, after expiration of the additional fourteen (14) day period the owner
does not comply with the request of the Building Department, the Building
Department may cause such sign to be removed at the expense of the owner. The
fourteen (14) day period to correct violations may be extended at the
discretion of the Building Official due to weather-related restrictions.
   (c)   Correction of Unsafe or Unlawful Signs. When any sign becomes
unsecured, dilapidated, in danger of falling, or otherwise unsafe in violation
of any of the provisions of this chapter or any other ordinances of the Village
of Franklin, then the owner thereof, or the firm maintaining the sign, or the

      (1)   Power. The Sign Board of Appeals shall have the power to modify or
reverse, wholly or partly, the notice or order given under this chapter, grant
variances and grant extensions of time for the performance of any act where the
Sign Board of Appeals finds such extension is in harmony with the general
purpose of this chapter to secure the public health, safety and welfare.
      (2)   Necessary Vote. The concurring vote of a majority of the members of
the Sign Board of Appeals shall be necessary to reverse, wholly or partly, or
modify any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Building
Official or to decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon which it is
required to pass or to grant any variance to the requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   Period of Validity. No order or variance of the Sign Board of
Appeals permitting the erection or alteration of a sign, except for an
interpretation made by the Sign Board of Appeals shall be valid for a period
longer than six (6) months from the date of approval, unless a permit for such
erection or alteration is obtained within such period and such erection or
alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms
of such permit.
      (4)   Site Plan Transferability. A variance granted shall be valid only
under a site plan or layout of the property which was considered by the Sign
Board of Appeals. A variance granted shall run with the land and shall be
transferable to a new owner.
      (5)   Reconsideration. After a variance has been denied in whole or in
part by the Sign Board of Appeals, such application shall not be resubmitted
for a period of one (1) year from the date of the last denial. However, a
denied variance may be reconsidered by the Sign Board of Appeals when, in the
opinion of the Sign Board of Appeals, newly discovered evidence or materially
changed conditions warrant such reconsideration.
      (6)   Certificates of Approval. In authorizing a variance or extension,
the Sign Board of Appeals may attach conditions it determines to be reasonable,
necessary or appropriate to further the purposes and spirit of this chapter and
to protect the public health, welfare and safety.
   (d)   Stay. An appeal made under this section shall stay all proceedings in

shall not be stayed except by a restraining order or by the circuit court.
   (e)   Standards for Variance.
      (1)   Findings of Fact. A variance to this chapter may be granted by the
Sign Board of Appeals when it determines competent material and substantial
evidence presented supports all the following affirmative findings:
         A.   Special Conditions. That special conditions or circumstances
exist which are peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which
are not generally applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the
same district;
         B.   Unreasonable Limitation. That literal interpretation or
application of the provisions of this chapter would unreasonably prevent, limit
or obscure the placement of a sign on the property or adversely affect
vehicular or pedestrian traffic;
         C.   Substantial Justice. Allowing the variance will result in
substantial justice being done, considering the public benefits intended to be
secured by the chapter, the individual difficulties that will be suffered by a
failure of the Sign Board of Appeals to grant a variance, and the rights of
others whose property would be affected by the allowance of the variance, and
will be not contrary to the public purpose and general objectives and spirit
and intent of this chapter.
      (2)   Support of Findings. The findings of fact in subsection (1) of this
section shall be made by the Sign Board of Appeals, which is not empowered to
grant a variance without an affirmative finding of fact in each of the
categories listed in subsection (1) of this section. Every finding of fact
shall be supported in the record of the proceedings of the Sign Board.

site conditions.
   (d)   "Natural landscaped area" means premises that are landscaped so as to
exhibit the deliberate and conscious decision to plant, cultivate and maintain
those native plant species identified as wildflower, grass, shrub or tree. This
landscaping tries to capture the character and spirit of nature in a designed
landscape by arranging plants in a community context, similar to their
arrangement in nature.
   (e)   "Noxious Weeds" shall include Canada thistle (Circium arvense),
dodders (any species of Cuscuta), mustards (charlock, black mustard and Indian
mustard, species of Brassica or Sinapis), wild carrot (Daucus carota), bindweed

from a platted subdivision or single-family residential condominium, or within
a platted subdivision or single-family residential condominium, or within 100
feet of any public street or road, it shall be the duty of the owner of such

more than eight inches above ground level or a level which prohibits a flower-
bearing state, whichever level is less.
   (b)   Subsection (a) hereof shall not apply to noxious weeds or grass of any

lawn grass is not cut within such time period, then the Village Administrator
or his or her designee, agent or contractor may enter upon the land and cause
the noxious weeds or lawn grass to be cut. All expenses and costs incurred in
the cutting of the noxious vegetation or lawn grass, plus a 20% administration
charge, shall be charged to and paid by the owner.
   (b)   The Village shall have a lien for the cutting expenses, costs and 20%
administration charge which lien shall be enforced in the manner prescribed by
state law for the enforcement of tax liens.
(Ord. 2007-04. Passed 7-9-07.)
