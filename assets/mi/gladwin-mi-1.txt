§ 35.11 COLLECTION FEE.

4% of the amount of the assessment or installment and on the eleventh day of

collection fees shall belong to the city and be collectible in the same manner
as the collection fee for city taxes.

the cost of the improvement for which they were made, then the Council may make
additional pro rata assessments to supply the deficiency against the city and
the several lots and parcels of land in the same ratio as the original
assessments, but the total amount assessed against any lot or parcel of land
shall not exceed the value of the benefits received from the improvement.
(Ord. 148, passed 5-6-69)
§ 35.13 EXCESS ASSESSMENT FUNDS.
   (A)   Should the special assessment or the proceeds of sale of any special
assessment bonds prove larger than necessary to meet the costs of the
improvement or to meet the principal and interest requirements of any special
assessment bonds and expenses incidental thereto, the excess shall be placed in
the City Treasury. If more than 5%, the excess shall be returned pro rata
according to assessments; except as otherwise provided in §

roll. The City Treasurer shall, within ten days after such apportionment, send
notice of such action to the persons concerned at their last known address by

parties unless protest in writing is received by the City Treasurer within 20
days of the mailing of the aforesaid notice.
(Ord. 148, passed 5-6-69)
§ 35.15 INVALID OR ILLEGAL ASSESSMENTS.
   (A)   Whenever the Council deems any special assessment invalid or
defective, or whenever a court adjudges an assessment to be illegal in whole or
in part, the Council may cause a new assessment to be levied for the same
purpose, whether or not the improvement or any part thereof has been completed,
or any part of the special assessment collected. All proceedings on such
reassessment and for the collection thereof shall be conducted in the same
manner as provided for the original assessment. If any portion of the original
special assessment is collected and not refunded, it shall be applied upon the
reassessment, and the reassessment shall to that extent be deemed satisfied. If
more than the amount reassessed is collected, the balance shall be refunded to
the person making such payment.
   (B)   If in any action it shall appear that by reason of any irregularities
or informalities the assessment has not been properly made against the person
assessed or upon the lot or premises sought to be charged, the court may
nevertheless, on satisfactory proof that expense has been incurred by the city
which is a proper charge against the person assessed or the lot or premises in
question, render judgment for the amount properly chargeable against such
person or upon such lot or premises.
(Ord. 148, passed 5-6-69)

be filed within 30 days after the date of the resolution of the Council

§ 51.091 UPSET PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Definition. For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an
exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the
reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed
treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative
maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
   (B)   Effect of an upset. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense
to an action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards if the
requirements of division (C) below are met.
   (C)   Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. An industrial user
who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate,
through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant
evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s)
of the upset.
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures.
      (3)   The industrial user has submitted the following information to the
POTW and control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if
this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided
within five days):
         (a)   A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue;
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding the industrial user
seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   User responsibility in case of upset. The industrial user shall
control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain
compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its
treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of
treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among
other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced,
lost or fails.

REPORTS
§ 51.105 BASELINE REPORT.
   This section applies to categorical dischargers only.
   (A)   Industrial users subject to national categorical pretreatment
standards shall submit baseline reports to the POTW in a form prescribed and
furnished by the POTW.
   (B)   Within 180 days after the effective date of a national categorical
pretreatment standard, or 180 days after a final administrative decision has
been made upon a categorical determination submission in accordance with 40 CFR
Section 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, industrial users which are existing
sources subject to such national categorical pretreatment standards and
currently discharging to the POTW shall submit a properly completed baseline
report.
   (C)   New sources, when subject to a national categorical pretreatment
standard, shall submit a baseline report at least 90 days prior to commencement
of discharge to the POTW.
   (D)   In support of the baseline report, the industrial user shall submit,
in units and terms specified in the application, the following information:
      (1)   Name and address of the facility including the name of the operator
and owners.
      (2)   List of any environmental control permits held by or for the
facility.
      (3)   Brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and
standard industrial classification of the operation(s) carried out by such
user. This description shall include a schematic process diagram indicating
points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes.
      (4)   Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily
flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following:
         (a)   Regulated process streams, and
         (b)   Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste
stream formula of 40 CFR Section 403.6(e).
      (5)   The industrial user shall identify the national categorical
pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process, and shall:
         (a)   Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the
nature and concentration of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each
regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentrations shall be
reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations.
         (b)   A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other
pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-
proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The local agency may
waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that
demonstrates that flow- proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases
samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques
or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this
will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
         (c)   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this division.
         (d)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of
40 CFR Section 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment
standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated
in accordance with 40 CFR Section 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along with
supporting data shall be submitted to the POTW.
         (e)   Accurate records should be maintained, indicating the time,
date, location, type of sample, method of collection and preservation, name of
person who collected the sample, and any pertinent comments. These procedures
are commonly called chain-of-custody procedures.
      (6)   The industrial user shall provide a statement, reviewed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user and certified by a qualified
professional, indicating whether national categorical pretreatment standards
are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation
and maintenance measures (O&M) or additional pretreatment is required for the
industrial user to meet the national categorical pretreatment standards.
      (7)   If additional pretreatment or O&M will be required to meet the
national categorical pretreatment standards, the industrial user will provide
the shortest schedule which will provide such additional pretreatment or O&M.
The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance
date established for the applicable national pretreatment standard.
         (a)   Where the industrial user's national categorical pretreatment
standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR Section 403.7) or the
combined waste stream formula (40 CFR Section 403.6(e)), or net/gross
calculations (40 CFR Section 403.15), at the time the industrial user submits a
baseline report the information required in divisions (D)(6) and (7) of this
section shall pertain to the modified limits.
         (b)   If the national categorical pretreatment standard for the
industrial user is modified after the baseline report is submitted, the
industrial user shall make any necessary amendments to information provided as
a response to divisions (D)(6) and (7) of this section and submit them to the
POTW within 60 days after the modified limit is approved.
      (8)   The following conditions shall apply to any schedule submitted in
response to division (D)(7) above:
         (a)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable national categorical pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring
an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing
contract for major components, commencing construction, completing
construction, etc.).
         (b)   No increment referred to in division (8)(a) above shall exceed
nine months.
         (c)   Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and
the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the
POTW including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of
progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to
comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps
being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule
established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such
progress reports to the POTW.
         (d)   Such other information as may be reasonably requested by the
POTW.

51.999
§ 51.106 COMPLIANCE DATE REPORT.
   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject
to categorical pretreatment standards shall submit to the POTW a report
indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from
the regulated process which are limited by such standards and the average and
maximum daily flow for these process units in the user facility which are
limited by such pretreatment standards or requirements. Where equivalent mass
or concentration limits are established by the POTW for a user, this report
shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate.
Where a user is subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in
terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production, the report shall
include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period.
The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards are being
met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment
is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment
standards. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of
the industrial user, and certified to by a qualified professional.
(Ord. 214, passed 6-5-95) Penalty, see §
51.999
§ 51.107 PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.
   (A)   Any user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, after the
compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source,
after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the POTW
during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the
pretreatment standard or by the Superintendent, a report indicating the nature
and concentration, of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such
pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of all
daily flows which during the reporting period exceeded the average daily flow
reported in §
51.105(D)(4)(b). At the discretion of the Superintendent and in consideration
of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc.,
the Superintendent may agree to alter the months during which the above reports
are to be submitted.
   (B)   The POTW may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution
to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases
where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the
report required by division (A) of this section shall indicate the mass of
pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user.
These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the
discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production
and mass where requested by the Superintendent, of pollutants contained therein
which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards.
   (C)   For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established by the POTW in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR
403.6(c), the report required by division (A) of this section shall contain a
reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other
industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only
in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other
measure of operation), the report required by division (A) above shall include
the user's actual average production rate for the reporting period.
   (D)   Significant noncategorical industrial users shall submit to the POTW
at least once every six months (on dates specified by the local agency) a
description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required
to be reported by the local agency.

§ 51.108 MONITORING AND ANALYSIS IN SUPPORT OF SELF-MONITORING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The reports required by §§
51.105 through
51.107 and
51.109 shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered
by the report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40
CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the
EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW
or other persons, approved by the EPA. This sampling and analysis may be
performed by the POTW in lieu of the industrial user. Where the POTW itself
collects all the information required for the report, the significant
industrial user will not be required to submit the report.
   (B)   If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the
user shall notify the POTW within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation.
The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of
the repeat analysis to the POTW within 30 days after becoming aware of the
violation, except the industrial user is not required to resample if:
      (1)   The POTW performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency of
at least once per month, or
      (2)   The POTW performs sampling at the user between the time when the
user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the
results of this sampling.
   (C)   The reports required in §
51.105(D)(5)(a) and (b) shall be based upon data obtained through appropriate
sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which
data is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The
POTW shall require that frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure
compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards, and
requirements.
   (D)   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in
divisions (A) through (C) above monitors any pollutant more frequently than
required by the POTW, using the procedures prescribed in this section, the
results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
   (E)   Signatory requirements for industrial user reports. The reports
required by §
51.107 shall include the certification statement as set forth in 40 CFR 403.6
(a)(2)(ii), and shall be signed by an authorized representative.

substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a listed or characteristic
hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261, shall notify the POTW in writing of such
discharge at least 30 days prior to initiating such discharge. No discharge
shall occur unless expressly authorized by the local agency.
   (B)   All hazardous waste notifications shall include:
      (1)   The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261;
      (2)   The EPA hazardous waste number;
      (3)   The type of discharge;
      (4)   A certification that the user has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
   (C)   In addition to the information submitted in §
51.105(D)(6), an industrial user (IU) discharging more than 100 kg of hazardous
waste per calendar month to the POTW shall submit such information as known and
readily available to the IU;
      (1)   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
waste;
      (2)   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in
waste stream discharged during that calendar month; and
      (3)   An estimation of the mass of constituents in waste stream expected
to be discharged during the following 12 months.
   (D)   Hazardous waste notifications shall be submitted no later than
February 19, 1992, except that IUs commencing the discharge of listed or
characteristic hazardous wastes after August 23, 1991, shall provide the
notification no later than 180 days prior to the discharge of the wastes. Any
notification under this provision need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged, although notifications of changed discharges must
be submitted under §
51.058(B).
   (E)   IUs are exempt from the hazardous waste notification requirement
during a calendar month in which they discharge 15 kg or less of non-acute
hazardous wastes. Discharge of any quantity of acute hazardous waste as
specified in 40 C.F.R. 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a one-time
notification.

NOISE
§ 94.15 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DECIBEL. A unit used to express the magnitude of sound pressure and sound
intensity. The difference in decibels between two sound pressures is 20 times
the common logarithm of their ratio. In sound pressure measurements, the sound
pressure level of a given sound is defined to be 20 times the  common logarithm
of the ratio of that sound pressure to a reference pressure of 2 X 10-5N/m2
(newtons per meter squared). As an example of the effect of this formula, a
three decibel change in the sound pressure level corresponds to a doubling or
halving of the sound intensity, and a ten decibel change corresponds to a ten
fold increase or decrease to 1/10th the former intensity.
   dB(a). The sound pressure level in decibels measured on the "A" scale of a
standard sound level meter having characteristics defined by the American
National Standards Institute, Publication ANSISI.4-1971.

to comply with this provision allows the City to redeem and use the surety bond
or deposit to make said tree replacement(s).
      (7)   Each contractor must agree to replace any and all permanently
installed fixtures and structures that become removed or significantly damaged.
Failure to comply with this provision allows the City to redeem and use the

(Ord. 203, passed 9-7-93)
§ 110.03 RATE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY FCC.
   In connection with the regulation of rates for basic cable service and

(Ord. 203, passed 9-7-93)
§ 110.04 FILING; ADDITIONAL INFORMATION; BURDEN OF PROOF.
   (A)   A cable operator shall submit its schedule of rates for the basic
service tier and associated equipment or a proposed increase in such rates in
accordance with the Act and the FCC Rules. The cable operator shall include as
part of its submission such information as is necessary to show that its
schedule of rates or its proposed increase in rates complies with the Act and
the FCC Rules. The cable operator shall file ten copies of the schedule or
proposed increase with the City Clerk. For purposes of this chapter, the filing
of the cable operator shall be deemed to have been made when at least ten
copies have been received by the City Clerk. The City Council may, by
resolution or otherwise, adopt rules and regulations as allowed by law
prescribing the information, data and calculations which must be included as
part of the cable operator's filing of the schedule of rates or a proposed
increase.
   (B)   In addition to information and data required by rules and regulations
of the city pursuant to division (A) above, a cable operator shall provide all
information requested by the City Administrator that is related and helpful in
connection with the city's review and regulation of existing rates for the
basic service tier and associated equipment or a proposed increase in these
rates. The City Administrator may establish reasonable deadlines for submission
of the requested information and the cable operator shall comply with such
deadlines.
   (C)   A cable operator has the burden of proving that its schedule of rates
for the basic service tier and associated equipment or a proposed increase in
such rates complies with the Act and the FCC Rules including, without
limitation, 47 U.S.C. 543 and 47 CFR 76.922 and 76.923.

§ 110.05 PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.
   (A)   If this chapter, any rules or regulations adopted by the city pursuant
to §
110.04(A) of this chapter, or any request for information pursuant to §
110.04(B) of this chapter requires the production of proprietary information,
the cable operator shall produce the information. However, at the time the
allegedly proprietary information is submitted, a cable operator may request
that specific, identified portions of its response be treated as confidential
and withheld from public disclosure. The request must state the reason why the
information should be treated as proprietary and the facts that support those
reasons. The request for confidentiality will be granted if the city determines
that the preponderance of the evidence shows that non-disclosure is consistent
with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. The city
shall place in a public file for inspection any decision that results in
information being withheld. If the cable operator requests confidentiality and
the request is denied, then where the cable operator is proposing a rate
increase, it may withdraw the proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary
information will be returned to it; or the cable operator may seek review
within five working days of the denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the
information will be stayed pending review.
   (B)   Any interested party may file a request to inspect material withheld
as proprietary with the city. The city shall weigh the policy considerations
favoring non-disclosure against the reasons cited for permitting inspection in
light of the facts of the particular case. It will then promptly notify the
requesting entity and the cable operator that submitted the information as to
the disposition of the request. It may grant, deny or condition a request. The
requesting party or the cable operator may seek review of the decision by
filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Disclosure will be stayed pending
resolution of any appeal.
   (C)   The procedures set forth in this section shall be construed as
analogous to and consistent with the rules of the FCC regarding requests for
confidentiality including, without limitation, 47 CFR 0.459.

§ 151.003 APPLICATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   The provisions of the Housing Code shall apply to all structures used

inadequate provisions for light and air, lack of proper heating, unsanitary
conditions and overcrowding, or otherwise may be deemed to constitute a menace
to the safety, health or welfare of their occupants; except as provided in §
151.007 of this chapter. The existence of such conditions, factors or
characteristics adversely affect public safety, health and welfare and lead to
the continuation, extension and aggravation of urban blight. Adequate
protection of the public, therefore, requires the establishment and enforcement
of these minimum housing standards.
   (B)   All moveable units used for human habitation and the areas, grounds or
parcels on which they are located, as provided in Section 425 of the Basic
Building Code, or such other codes, laws or chapters of the city applicable
thereto, shall comply with the requirements of this Housing Code.

residential purposes, except hotels and motels serving transient guests only,
rest homes, convalescent homes, and nursing homes, shall comply with the

constructed, altered, or repaired, except as hereinafter provided.

151.999
§ 151.005 APPLICATION OF BUILDING CODE AND ZONING LAW.

caused directly or indirectly by the enforcement of this code shall be done in
accordance with applicable sections of the building code of the city.
   (B)   Nothing in this code shall permit the establishment or conversion of a
multi-family dwelling in any zone except where permitted by the zoning law; nor
the continuation of such nonconforming use in any zone except as provided
therein.
(Ord. 151, passed 4-21-69) Penalty, see §
151.999
§ 151.006 CONFLICT.
   Except as provided in §
151.007 of this chapter, in any case where a provision of this code is found to
be in conflict with a provision of any zoning, building, fire, safety, or
health chapter or code of this city existing on the effective date of this
code, the provision which establishes the higher standard for the promotion and
protection of the safety and health of the people shall prevail. In any case
where a provision of this code is found to be in conflict with a provision of
any other ordinance or code of this city existing on the effective date of this
code which establishes a lower standard for the promotion and protection of the
safety and health of the people, the provisions of this code shall prevail, and
such other ordinances or codes are hereby declared to be repealed to the extent
that they may be found in conflict with this code.
(Ord. 151, passed 4-21-69)

repair, alteration or use of buildings, equipment or facilities except as
provided in this section.

remedies of the city or its officers or agencies relating to the removal or
demolition of any buildings which are deemed to be dangerous, unsafe or
unsanitary.

§ 151.067 HOUSE NUMBERING.
   To provide proper police, fire, health, welfare and emergency services,
public or private, to residences and businesses, it is necessary to provide for
property identification numbers visible from the public roadways adjacent to
residences and businesses in the city.
   (A)   All property upon which houses, dwellings, buildings, mobile home,
businesses and other such structures are constructed or located within the city
shall be considered developed property and shall have property identification
numbers which shall be posted on the face and/or other appropriate side of the
house, dwelling, business or structure in a manner and location so that the
identification numbers are clearly and readily readable to a person of normal
vision from the adjacent roadway. House trailers shall have an individual space
identification number at least three inches in height on the side of the
trailer facing the access road. The operator of the trailer park shall be
responsible for assigning such numbers. If the house, dwelling, house trailer,
business or structure is located on the property so that the posted numbers are
not clearly readable from the roadway, due to distance or intervening sight
barriers such as, but not limited to, shrubbery, terrain features or
structures, the identification number shall also be posted separate from the
main structure (i.e. on a yard light post, entrance gate, driveway marketer,
mailbox, etc.) in a fashion that is clearly readable from the adjacent roadway.
Such additional identification numbers shall be either located centrally
between the side boundaries of the property or located immediately adjacent to
the driveway providing ingress to the property, and shall be located on the
same side of the adjacent roadway as the property it identifies.
   (B)   The property identification number or address shall use numbers not
less than three inches in height. If the dwelling, house trailer, building,
business or structure is located more than 90 feet from the centerline of the
traveled portion of the adjacent roadway, the identifying numbers shall be not
less than six inches in height, but in any case such numbers shall be of a size
sufficiently large so that they are readable from the centerline of the
adjacent roadway by a person of normal vision.
   (C)   The color of the numbers shall be in contrast with the immediate
background on which they are mounted.
   (D)   In the case of multiple units, either business or residential, it
shall be clearly indicated at each entrance the property identification numbers
of those apartments or businesses accessible through such entrance. The purpose
of this identification is to facilitate the rapid movement of emergency units
to a specific apartment or business unit in apartment buildings or business
complexes which have multiple entrances bearing the same number and series of
such units that are not accessible except through a specific entrance.
   (E)   The occupants of all buildings in the city used for commercial and/or
industrial purposes that are connected with or located so close to other
buildings as to prevent access between such buildings and which requires a
different route of access to the rear than that to the front of the building
shall cause the correct business name and street numbers to be placed on the
rear entrance door or immediately adjacent thereto. Such names and numbers
shall be not less than three nor more than six inches in height, and may
consist of standard manufactured letters and/or numerals. If painted on the
building or door such names and numbers shall be applied with standard-type
numeral and letter stencil. The name and number shall be placed as to be
plainly visible and readable from the alley, service drive, easement, parking
lot or any other rear access.

using a green background with reflective numerals, may be approved by the City
Administrator, and signs which conform to such approved design and construction

structures shall be required to attach a property identification number within
30 days of completed construction.

person in control of any developed property shall each be responsible for
identifying such property in compliance with this section.

IMPROVEMENTS; PUBLICATION OF REGULATIONS.

governing the subdivision of land within its jurisdiction. The regulations may
provide for the proper arrangement of streets in relation to other existing or

for traffic, utilities, access of firefighting apparatus, recreation, light and
air, and for the avoidance of congestion of population, including minimum width
and area of lots.

revocable and shall not be entered on the plat. In lieu of the completion of
the improvements and utilities prior to the final approval of the plat, the

§ 152.10 APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL OF PLATS; PROCEDURE; EFFECT.
   The Planning Commission shall approve, modify or disapprove a plat within 60
days after the submission thereof; otherwise the plat shall be deemed to have
been approved, and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the
Commission on demand; provided, however, that the applicant for the
Commission's approval may waive this requirement and consent to an extension of
the period. The ground of disapproval of any plat shall be stated upon the
records of the Commission. Any plat submitted to the Commission shall contain
the name and address of a person to whom notice of a hearing shall be sent, and
no plat shall be acted on by the Commission without affording a hearing
thereon. Notice shall be sent to the address by certified mail, with return
receipt requested, of the time and place of the hearing not less than five days
before the date fixed therefore. Similar notice shall be mailed to the owners
of land immediately adjoining the platted land, as their names appear upon the
plats in the county auditor's office and their addresses appear in the
directory of the city or on the tax records of the city or county. Every plat
approved by the Commission shall, by virtue of the approval, be deemed to be an
amendment of or an addition to or a detail of the city plan and a part thereof.
Approval of a plat shall not be deemed to constitute or affect an acceptance by
the public of any street or other open space shown upon the plat. The Planning
Commission may, from time to time, recommend to Council amendments of the
zoning ordinance or map or additions thereto to conform to the Commission's
recommendations for the zoning regulation of the territory comprised within
approval subdivisions. The Commission shall have the power to agree with the
applicant upon use, height, area or bulk requirements or restrictions governing
buildings and premises with the subdivisions, provided the requirements or
restrictions do not authorize the violation of then effective zoning ordinance
of the city. The requirements or restrictions shall be stated upon the plat
prior to the approval and recording thereof and shall have the same force of
law and be enforceable in the same sanctions and penalties and subject to the
same power of amendment or repeal as though set out as a part of the zoning
ordinance or map of the city.
(Ord. 146, passed 4-1-68)
§ 152.11 SUCCESSION TO ZONING COMMISSION.

Commission of the city, and from and after the creation of a Planning
Commission in the city, all powers and records of the Zoning Commission shall
be transferred to the Planning Commission; provided, however, that in the event

Commission's powers until the completion of the zoning plan, but the
postponement shall not exceed a period of one year.
