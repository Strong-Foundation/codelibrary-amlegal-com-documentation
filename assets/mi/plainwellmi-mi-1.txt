shall be exempt. He may sell the property seized to an amount sufficient to pay

(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993; Ord. 390, adopted 2-28-2022)
Sec. 16-3. INITIATION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENT PROJECTS.
   Proceedings for the making of local public improvements within the city may
be commenced by resolution of the City Council with or without a petition. The
City Council may require the filing of a petition meeting the requirements of
this chapter before deciding whether to proceed with an improvement under this
chapter.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-4. INITIATION BY PETITION.
   A.   Requirements for petition. A petition meeting the requirements of this
section may be filed with the City Clerk to request one or more local public
improvements. A petition meeting the requirements of this section may also be
filed with the City Clerk if required by the City Council pursuant to this
chapter. The petition shall be addressed to the City Council, shall describe,
in a general way, the improvement or improvements sought and shall contain a
brief description of the property owned by the respective signatories thereof.
If it shall appear that the petition is signed by not less than 51% of the
record owners of land to be assessed as required in this section, the City
Clerk shall certify the petition to the City Council.
   B.   Approval of record owners of land to be assessed. The petition
requesting the improvement must be signed by the record owners of land
constituting not less than 51% of the total land area of the assessable real
property located in the special assessment district as finally established by

assessment records, as defined herein, as of the day of the filing of a
petition.
   D.   Advisory nature of petition. A petition requesting a local public
improvement shall, in no event, be considered directory, but is advisory only.
The City Council has complete discretion to determine whether to proceed with
an improvement under this chapter. No action need be taken with respect to any
petition unless the same, after filing, shall be approved by resolution of the
City Council. Conversely, the City Council may commence proceedings for a
public improvement for which it has initially required that a petition first be
met, notwithstanding the fact that the petition is not filed or does not meet
the requirements of this section.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-5. COST ESTIMATE; PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   A.   Cost estimate; plans and specifications. If the City Council desires to
proceed with an improvement, the resolution adopted by the City Council shall
direct the City Clerk to cause to be prepared preliminary plans and
specifications describing the improvement and the location of the improvement
with an estimate of the cost of the improvement on a fixed or periodic basis,
as appropriate. If the nature of the improvement to be made is such that a
periodic redetermination of costs will be necessary without a change in the
special assessment district boundaries, the estimate of cost shall include any
projected incremental increases. Upon receipt of the plans, specifications and
cost estimate, the City Clerk shall report the same to the City Council.
   B.   If actual cost exceeds estimate by more than 10%. No increase in the
estimate of the cost to be assessed in excess of 10% of the original estimate
shall be made unless notice is given as provided herein and a hearing afforded
to the record owners of property to be assessed. If the nature of the
improvement to be made is such that a periodic redetermination of cost will be
necessary without a change in the special assessment district boundaries and,
at any time during the term of the special assessment district, an actual
incremental cost increase exceeds the estimate thereof by more than 10%, notice
shall be given as provided herein and a hearing afforded to the record owners
of property to be assessed. In the event that the actual cost of the
improvement exceeds the original estimate thereof by 10% or more, whether fixed
or periodic, the City Council may determine to assess up to 10% of the cost
above the original estimate and to pay any additional cost increase from city
funds available for that purpose. In that case, neither notice, nor a hearing,
shall be required.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-6. INITIAL DETERMINATION AS TO ALLOCATION OF COSTS; DECLARATION OF
INTENT TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS; TENTATIVE DESIGNATION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENT
DISTRICT.
   After receiving the estimate of cost, specifications and plans with respect
to an improvement, the City Council shall determine, by resolution, the
tentative necessity for the improvement and what portion, if any, of the
expense of the improvement shall be defrayed by an assessment upon the owners
of real estate to be benefitted and declare the amount, if any, of the cost of
the improvement which shall be levied upon the city at large and if it desires
to proceed further with the improvement, it shall, by resolution, tentatively
declare its intention to make the improvement and tentatively designate the
special assessment district against which any portion or all of the cost of the
improvement is to be assessed.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-7. PUBLIC HEARING ON NECESSITY.
   A.   Fix date of hearing; authorize notice. If the City Council, by
resolution adopted under § 
16-6, tentatively declares its intention to make an improvement, the City
Council, by resolution, shall fix a time and place to meet and hear any
objections to the improvement and to the special assessment district and to
determine the necessity for the improvement and shall cause notice of the
hearing to be given as provided below and in § 
16-8.
   B.   Content of notice. In addition to the date, time and place of the
hearing, the notice shall state that the preliminary plans and estimates are on
file with the City Clerk for public examination and shall contain a description
of the proposed public improvement and the proposed special assessment
district. If periodic determinations of cost will be necessary without a change
in the special assessment district, the notice shall state that the
redeterminations may be made without further notice to record owners or parties
in interest in the property.
   C.   Hearing. At the time of the hearing provided for in this section or any
adjournment thereof, which may be without further notice, the City Council
shall consider the necessity of the improvement and shall hear any objections
to the petition. to the improvement and to the special assessment district and
may revise, correct, amend or change the plans, estimate of cost or special
assessment district: provided, however, that, except as provided in § 
16-5, no increase in the estimate of cost, whether fixed or periodic, in excess
of 10% of the original estimate of the cost shall be made, nor shall any
property be added to the district, unless further notice is given and a hearing
afforded as provided in this section.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-8. NOTICE OF HEARINGS.
   A.   General. If special assessments are proposed to be made against
property, notice of hearings in the special assessment proceedings shall be
given as provided in this section.
   B.   Notice by first class mail and publication. Notice of hearings in
special assessment proceedings shall be given to each record owner of or party
in interest in, property to be assessed, whose name appears upon the last city
tax assessment records, by first class mail addressed to the record owner or
party in interest at the address shown on the tax records, at least ten days
before the date of the hearing. Notice shall also be published once at least
ten days before the date of the hearing in a newspaper published or circulating
in the city. The method of giving notice by mail as provided in this section is
declared to be the method that is reasonably certain to inform those to be
assessed of the special assessment proceedings.
   C.   Determination of record owners entitled to receive notice. The city tax
assessment records means the last assessment roll for ad valorem tax purposes
which was reviewed by the City Board of Review, as supplemented by any
subsequent changes in the names or the addresses of the owners or parties
listed on that roll. If a record owner’s name does not appear on the city tax
assessment records, then notice shall be given by first class mail addressed to
the record owner at the address shown by the records of the County Register of
Deeds at least ten days before the date of hearing. The City Clerk shall keep a
record of the names and addresses of record owners or parties in interest
entitled to notice in special assessment proceedings and shall, at all times,
keep the records current, complete and available for public inspection.
   D.   Notice to others upon request. If a person claims an interest in real
property whose name and correct address do not appear upon the last city tax
assessment records, that person shall give immediately his or her name and
address with the City Clerk. This filing is effective only for the purpose of
establishing a record of the names and addresses of those persons entitled to
notice in special assessment proceedings.
   E.   Failure to provide notice. Failure to give notice as required in this
section shall not invalidate an entire assessment roll, but shall affect, if at
all, only the assessment on property for which notice was not given. A special
assessment shall not be declared invalid as to any property if the owner or the
party in interest of that property actually received notice, waived notice or
paid any part of the assessment. If an assessment is declared void by a court
decree or judgment, a reassessment against the property may be made.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-9. FINAL DETERMINATION AS TO NECESSITY; APPROVAL OF COSTS, PLANS AND
SPECIFICATIONS; CREATION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENT DISTRICT; DATES OF PERIODIC
REDETERMINATIONS OF COST.
   A.   Resolution on necessity. After the hearing provided for herein, if the
City Council then desires to proceed with the improvement, it shall, by
resolution, make final determination of the necessity thereof and, by
resolution, finally determine to proceed with the making of the improvement and
shall approve or determine all of the following:
      1.   The plans, estimate of cost and specifications as originally
presented or as revised, corrected, amended or changed; and
      2.   The special assessment district of the properties especially
benefitted by the improvement, if any of the cost thereof is to be raised by
special assessment.
   B.   Periodic redeterminations of cost. If the nature of the improvement to
be made is such that a periodic redetermination of costs will be necessary
without a change in the special assessment district boundaries, the City
Council shall so state in the resolution, shall set the dates upon which the
redeterminations shall be made and shall specify the term of the special
assessment district.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-10. PREPARATION AND FILING OF ASSESSMENT ROLL.
   After finally determining the special assessment district, the City Council
shall, by resolution, determine whether the assessment shall be based upon
special benefits, frontage, area or factors permitted by law or a combination
thereof and shall direct the City Assessor to make a special assessment roll in
which shall be entered and described all the parcels of land to be assessed,
with the names of the respective record owners of each parcel, if known and the
total amount to be assessed against each parcel of land, which amount shall be
the relative portion of the whole sum to be levied against all parcels of land
in the special assessment district as the benefit to the parcel of land bears
to the total benefit to all parcels of land in the special assessment district.
There shall also be entered upon the roll the amount which has been assessed to
the city at large, if any. When the City Assessor shall have completed the
assessment roll, the City Assessor shall affix his or her certificate to the
roll, which shall state that the roll was made pursuant to a resolution of the
City Council adopted on a specified date and that, in making the assessment
roll, the Assessor, according to his or her best judgment, has conformed in all
respects to the directions contained in the resolution and to the provisions of
this chapter and the laws of the state. The Assessor shall then file the
special assessment roll with the City Clerk, who shall present the same to the
City Council.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-11. OBJECTION TO ASSESSMENT.
   If, at or prior to the final confirmation of any special assessment roll,
the record owners of more than 50% of the real property to be assessed shall
object in writing to the proposed improvement, the assessment shall not be made
without a four-fifths vote of the members of the City Council. For purposes of
determining the percentage of property owners objecting to an assessment, the
same principles shall be used as those set forth herein for determining the
sufficiency of a petition requesting a local public improvement.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-12. NOTICE, HEARING, CONFIRMATION OF ROLL.
   A.   Set hearing on roll; notice. Before confirming the assessment roll, the
City Council shall appoint a time and place when it will meet, review and hear
any objections to the assessment roll. The City Council shall cause notice of
the hearing to be given as provided below herein.
   B.   Content of notice. In addition to the date, time and place of the
hearing, the notice shall state that the assessment roll is on file with the
City Clerk for public examination and shall contain a description of the public
improvement and the special assessment district. The notice of hearing shall
also include a statement that appearance and protest at the hearing is required
in order to appeal the amount of the special assessment to the state tax
tribunal and shall state that the appearance may be in person, by Agent or by
letter.
   C.   Hearing. The hearing of the City Council, upon the special assessment
roll, may be adjourned from time to time without further notice. Any person
objecting to the assessment roll shall file the objection in writing with the
City Clerk before the close of the hearing. The City Clerk shall maintain a
record of parties who appear to protest their assessment at the hearing. If a
hearing is terminated or adjourned for the day before a party is provided the
opportunity to be heard, a party whose appearance is recorded is considered to
have protested the special assessment in person.
   D.   Confirmation of roll. After the hearing, at the same or at a subsequent
meeting, the City Council may confirm the special assessment roll as reported
to it by the City Assessor or as amended or corrected by the City Council or
may refer it back to the City Assessor for revision or may annul it and direct
a new roll to be made. Upon confirmation of any special assessment roll, the
City Council shall, by resolution, determine the number of installments in
which the assessments may be paid, the amount or method for determining the
amount of each installment and the payment dates thereof, the rate of interest
to be charged on the installments and the date from which the interest shall
commence and whether any assessments shall be deferred and the terms of the
deferral, all as provided herein.
   E.   Clerk’s endorsement. If a special assessment roll is confirmed, the
City Clerk shall endorse thereon the date of the confirmation and shall attach
a copy of the resolution to the special assessment roll. After the confirmation
on the special assessment roll, all assessments on that special assessment roll
shall be final and conclusive unless an action contesting an assessment is
filed in a court of competent jurisdiction within 30 days after the date of
confirmation.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-13. PAYMENT, INSTALLMENTS, DELINQUENCY.
   A.   Installment payments. The City Council may provide that special
assessments are payable in one or more installments. If the special assessments
are payable in more than one installment, the City Council shall by resolution
determine the amount or method for determining the amount of each installment.
The amount of each installment, if more than one, need not be extended upon the
special assessment roll until confirmation of that assessment roll. Subject to
§ 16-5, the amount of installments for improvements subject to periodic cost
revision may be extended upon the special assessment roll by the City Council
without additional public hearings or public notice; provided that, additional
property is not added to the special assessment roll.
   B.   Date of payments. The first installment of a special assessment shall
be due on or before the time after confirmation as the City Council shall fix.
Subsequent installments shall be due at annual or semi-annual intervals and on
dates to be determined by resolution of the City Council, which may correspond
with the date(s) for collection of other taxes; provided, however, that, if
special assessment bonds are issued by the city in anticipation of all or part
of the unpaid installments, the installments shall be due annually at intervals
of 12 months from the due date of the first installment or 12 months from a
date that the City Council shall fix.
   C.   Interest on unpaid installments. Except as payment of special
assessments may be otherwise deferred by the City Council at the time of
confirmation of the special assessment roll, all unpaid installments shall bear
interest, payable on each installment due date, at a rate to be set by the City
Council, not exceeding 1% above the average rate of interest borne by special
assessment bonds issued by the city in anticipation of all or part of the
unpaid installments, if any bonds are issued or, if bonds are not issued by the
city, not exceeding 12% per annum, commencing in each case from a date fixed by
the City Council. If special assessment bonds are issued by the city, the City
Council shall by resolution determine the interest rate for the special
assessments within 30 days from the date of the closing for the sale of the
bonds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the entire assessment or the first
installment thereof may be paid in full to the City Treasurer within 30 days
after the assessment first becomes payable without payment of any interest,
except the bond interest as may have been capitalized as part of the cost of
the improvement. Subsequent installments shall not be entitled to any grace
period for late payment. Future due installments of an assessment against any
parcel of land may be paid to the City Treasurer at any time in full, with
interest accrued through the month in which the final installment is paid.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-14. DEFERRED ASSESSMENTS.
   A.   Hardship. If, in the opinion of the City Council, any person holding
property subject to special assessment is unable to contribute toward the cost
thereof by reason of poverty, payment of the special assessment or any part
thereof may, by resolution of the City Council, be deferred until the death of
the person or until the person transfers any part or all of his or her interest
in the property. At that time, any deferred payments of the special assessment
shall become due and payable together with any and all interest accrued thereon
to the time. While payment is so deferred, interest on the amount of the
special assessment shall accrue and be added to the amount of the deferred
special assessment. In the alternative, the City Council may require that
interest payments be made during the period that the assessment is deferred.
   B.   Lien on deferred payment; resolution; changes in circumstances.
Deferment of the payment of any special assessment shall not destroy or impair
the lien of the city on the premises so assessed from the date of confirmation
of the special assessment roll as above provided. As a condition of granting
the deferred or partial payment of an assessment, the City Council may require
that any deferred assessment be shown as a recorded lien against the property.
The resolution deferring payment for any assessments may be made as part of the
resolution confirming the roll. If the City Council shall, by resolution,
determine, after notice to the owner of the property for which payment was
deferred, that there has been a material change in the circumstances on which
the deferment was based or that the best interests of the city so require, the
deferment may be terminated and all or part of the deferred payments and
accrued interest, if any, shall then become due and payable.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-15. ASSESSMENTS AS LIEN UPON PROPERTY.
   All special assessments contained in any special assessment roll, including
any part thereof deferred as to payment, shall, from the date of confirmation
of the roll, constitute a lien upon the respective parcels of land assessed.
The lien shall be of the same character and effect as the lien created for city
taxes and shall include accrued interest and penalties. No judgment or decree
or any act of the City Council vacating a special assessment shall destroy or
impair the lien of the city upon the premises assessed for the amount of the
assessment as may be equitably charged against the same or as by a regular mode
of proceeding might be lawfully assessed thereon.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-16. DELIVERY OF ASSESSMENT ROLL TO TREASURER FOR COLLECTION.
   After a special assessment roll has been ratified and confirmed by the City
Council, it shall be delivered by the City Clerk to the City Treasurer for
collection and the City Clerk shall take the receipt of the City Treasurer
thereof. At the time of the delivery of the assessment roll to the City
Treasurer, the Mayor shall attach thereto a warrant signed by the Mayor
commanding the City Treasurer to collect the assessments therein contained.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-17. NOTICE AS TO PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENT.
   Upon receipt of the assessment roll, the City Treasurer shall cause to be
served on each person whose name appears on the roll a written notice
specifying the amount of the assessment against the person, the time within
which the same may be paid without interest or collection fee and the time when
interest and collection fees shall be chargeable with respect thereto. The
notice shall also include a statement that the owner or any person having an
interest in the real property may file a written appeal of the special
assessment with the state tax tribunal within 30 days after the confirmation of
the special assessment roll if that special assessment was protested at the
hearing held for the purpose of confirming the roll. The notice shall be served
by sending the same by first class mail directed to the person in the same name
and at the same address as assessed. The City Treasurer shall attach his or her
certificate to the roll showing the date and manner of the service.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-18. COLLECTION FEE AND PENALTY FOR DELINQUENT ASSESSMENTS.
   A.   Collection fee. If a special assessment or any installment of a special
assessment is not paid within 60 days after it is first due, the same shall be
deemed to be delinquent and there shall be collected, in addition to interest
thereon, a collection fee equal to 4% of the amount of the installment or
assessment so due.
   B.   Penalty; transfer of tax roll. If any special assessment or installment
thereof which has been payable for more than 60 days shall be due and unpaid on
June 1 in any year, there shall be collected a penalty of 4% of the amount of
the assessment or installment so due. The amount of the assessment or
installment thereof, plus the accrued interest with respect thereto as of the
last installment payment date, the 4% collection fee and the 4% penalty by this
section provided shall be certified by the City Treasurer to the City Assessor
for inclusion upon the city tax roll of the year in a column headed “Special
Assessments” and the City Assessor shall include the same in the city tax roll
to be prepared by him or her and thereafter the same shall be collected as the
city taxes are collected, anything in this chapter to the contrary
notwithstanding.
   C.   Determination of collection fee and penalties based on amount of
installment. If the assessment roll has been divided into installments, then
the collection fee and any penalties shall attach only to the first
installment, in the first instance and thereafter to the succeeding
installments as they respectively fall due and shall be computed with respect
to each installment rather than the total amount of the assessment. For
purposes of determining any collection fee or penalties, the amount of each
installment shall include the interest due thereon as of the last installment
payment date.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-19. RETURN OF DELINQUENT ASSESSMENTS TO COUNTY TREASURER.
   The assessments and charges placed upon the city tax roll as provided
herein, with interest, penalties and charges which remain due and unpaid on
March 1 following the date when the city tax roll was received by the
Treasurer, shall be returned to the County Treasurer at the same time and in
the same manner and with like effect as returns by the City Treasurer of city
taxes. The returns shall be made upon a delinquent tax roll to be prepared by
the Treasurer under the provisions of the charter and shall be collected in the
same manner as taxes returned to the County Treasurer are collected under the
provisions of the general laws of the state and shall be and remain a lien upon
the lands against which they are assessed until paid.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-20. DEFICIENCY IN ASSESSMENTS.
   Should the assessments in any special assessment roll prove insufficient for
any reason to pay for the improvement or that portion or percentage of an
improvement for which they were made or to pay the principal and interest on
the bonds issued in anticipation of the collection of special assessments, then
the City Council shall make additional pro rata assessments to supply the
deficiency as shall be necessary; provided that, the total amount assessed
against any parcel of land shall not exceed the value of the benefits from the
improvement.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-21. EXCESS ASSESSMENTS.
   Should the total amount levied on special assessments prove larger than the
actual cost of the improvement by more than 5% of the original roll, then the
excess shall be prorated among the properties assessed in accordance with the
amount assessed against each and applied as a credit against future unpaid
installments in the inverse order in which they are payable to the extent the
installments then exist and the balance of the refund, if any, shall be paid in
cash to the persons who are the respective owners of the property on the date
of the passage of the resolution ordering the refund. Any excess of 5% or less
may be paid into the city general funds, the Special Improvement Revolving Fund
or disposed of as provided by this section, all as directed by resolution of
the City Council. No refunds may be made which contravene the provisions of any
outstanding evidence of indebtedness secured in whole or part by the special
assessments.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-22. APPORTIONMENT OF ASSESSMENT WHEN PROPERTY DIVIDED AFTER
CONFIRMATION OF ASSESSMENT AND BEFORE COLLECTION.
   A.   Should any parcel of land be divided after a special assessment thereon
has been confirmed and before the complete collection thereof, the City
Assessor shall apportion the uncollected amounts between the several divisions
thereof, subject to approval by resolution of the City Council. If the
interested parties do not agree in writing to the apportionment, the City
Assessor shall give notice by first class mail to the owner of each of the
several divisions of the property, insofar as the same are known to him or her,
of the amount of the uncollected assessment apportioned to each division of
property and the date, time and place of the meeting of the City Council at
which the apportionment shall be reviewed and at which objections may be heard.
The notice shall be mailed at least ten days before the meeting of the City
Council. The City Council shall review the apportionment made by the City
Assessor and shall by resolution either confirm the same or make other
apportionment as shall to City Council appear to be equitable in the
circumstances. The action of the City Council shall be final and conclusive
upon all parties.
   B.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, no assessment shall be apportioned under
this chapter if the effect of the apportionment is to allow more residential
equivalent units to receive a benefit from the improvement than what was
contemplated at the time of confirmation of the roll. In such case, the
interested parties shall pay to the city the amount which represents the then
current capital cost for the improvement for each residential equivalent unit
that was not included in the initial assessment. The City Council shall, in the
future, adopt resolutions or ordinances that are necessary to establish the
then current costs of certain improvements and to provide any procedural
mechanisms necessary to implement the charges.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-23. REASSESSMENT FOLLOWING INVALID ASSESSMENT.
   All proceedings in assessing and levying taxes for special improvements and
the correction of the assessments or installments thereof shall be presumed by
all courts of this state to be legal until the contrary is affirmatively shown.
Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of the City Council, be
invalid by reason of irregularities or informalities in the proceedings or if
any court of competent jurisdiction shall adJudge the assessment to be illegal,
the City Council shall, whether the improvement has been made or not and
whether any part of the assessment has been paid or not, have power to proceed
from the last step at which the proceedings were legal and cause a new
assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was
made. All proceedings on the reassessment and for the connection thereof shall
be conducted in the same manner as provided for in the original assessment and
whenever an assessment or any part thereof, levied upon any premises has been
so set aside, if the same has been paid and not refunded, the payment so made
shall be applied upon the reassessment and the reassessment to that extent
shall be deemed satisfied. If more than the amount reassessed shall have been
collected, the balance shall be refunded to the person making the payment.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-24. COLLECTION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
   Monies raised by special assessment to pay the cost of any local
improvements shall be held in a special fund to pay the cost or to repay any
money borrowed thereof. Each special assessment account must be used only for
the improvement project for which the assessment was levied, expenses
incidental thereto, including the repayment of the principal and interest on
money borrowed thereof and to refund excessive assessments, if refunds be
authorized. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event bonds are issued in
anticipation of the collection of special assessments, all collections on each
special assessment roll or combination of rolls shall be set in a separate fund
for the payment of the principal and interest on the bonds so issued in
anticipation of the payment of the special assessments and shall be used for no
other purpose until the bonds have been fully paid.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-25. COMBINATION OF PROJECTS.
   The City Council may combine one or more local public improvements into one
special assessment district if all lands included in the special assessment
district are benefitted by and assessed for each of the combined improvements.
The city may also combine the improvements for two or more special assessment
districts into one construction project. In that case, the City Council shall
by resolution allocate a portion of the combined cost to each of the special
assessment districts included in the combined project.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-26. BORROWING IN ANTICIPATION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENT COLLECTIONS; BONDS.
   The City Council may borrow money and issue bonds of the city thereof in
anticipation of the collection of special assessments to defray all or any part
of the cost of any improvement made under this chapter after the special
assessment roll thereof shall have been confirmed. The bonds shall not exceed
the amount of the special assessments in anticipation of the collection of
which they are issued. Collections on special assessments to the extent the
same are pledged for the payment of bonds shall be set aside in a special fund
for the payment of the bonds. Bonds may be issued in anticipation of the
collection of special assessments levied in respect to one or more public
improvements, but no special assessment district shall be compelled to pay the
obligation of any other special assessment district. The City Council may
pledge the limited tax, full faith and credit of the city for the prompt
payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds authorized herein, as the
same shall become due, in which event the city may levy a tax on all taxable
property in the city for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds,
subject to constitutional, statutory and charter tax rate limitations. Bonds
issued under this chapter shall be executed by the original or facsimile
signatures of the Mayor and City Clerk.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-27. PAYMENTS FROM IMPROVEMENT REVOLVING FUND.
   The City Council may create and designate a fund to be known as the Special
Improvement Revolving Fund and, in lieu of issuing bonds in anticipation of the
collection of future installments of a special assessment roll, may finance the
same out of the Revolving Fund as the City Council, by its resolution, may
determine. The amount advanced shall not exceed the amount the City Council
anticipates will be collected by the special assessments.
(Ord. 279, adopted 2-22-1993)
Sec. 16-28. SINGLE LOT SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
   A.   General. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the
contrary, when the city incurs or anticipates incurring a cost incidental to a
local improvement which is or may be chargeable against a single lot or parcel,
any special assessment regarding such cost will be implemented and governed by
the provisions of this section.
   B.   General non-applicability. Chapter 16, sections
16-3 through
16-12, inclusive, do not apply to special assessments implemented and governed
under this section.
   C.   General applicability. Withstanding the provisions of this section to
the contrary, Chapter 16, sections
16-13 through
16-27, inclusive, apply to special assessments implemented and governed under
this section.
   D.   Procedures. Special assessments implemented and governed under this
section will comply with the following requirements:
      1.   Report to City Council. When the city incurs or anticipates
incurring a cost incidental to a public improvement which is or may be
chargeable against a single lot or parcel, the estimated amount of applicable
costs, with a description of the lot or parcel for which the cost was or is
anticipated to be incurred, and the name of the owner or owners, if known, will
be reported to the City Council.
      2.   Determination of City Council. After reviewing the report, the City
Council may determine by resolution what amount or part of such estimated costs
will be charged and the property upon which the charge will be levied as a
special assessment. The City Council will determine the number of installments
in which the assessment may be paid, determine the rate of interest to be
charged, designate the property upon which the special assessment may be
levied, direct the preparation of a special assessment roll, and fix the time
and place for the hearing when the City Council will review the assessment
roll. Such hearing will not be less than ten calendar days after notice of the
time and place for the hearing has been provided to the owner of or party in
interest in the property to be assessed whose name appeared on the last local
tax assessment records. Notice will be provided to each owner of or party in
interest in the property to be assessed whose name appeared upon the last local
tax assessment records, by mailing such notice via regular first-class mail to
the owner of or party in interest at the address shown on the last local tax
assessment records. Notice will be deemed effective three business days
following such mailing or upon receipt, whichever is earlier.
      3.   Certificate of roll. When the assessment roll has been completed, it
will be filed with the City Clerk who will present it to the City Council.
      4.   Objections to roll. Any party claiming to be aggrieved by the
special assessment roll may file an objection and protest in writing with the
City Clerk at or prior to the time of the hearing. Any objection must specify
how the party is aggrieved. If the objection is timely and properly filed, the
objecting party's in person appearance is not required at the hearing.
      5.   Review of roll. The City Council will review the special assessment
roll at the hearing provided for herein and consider any objections. The City
Council may correct the roll as to any assessment or description of any lot or
parcel of land or other errors. Any changes made in the roll must be noted in
the minutes.
      6.   Confirmation of roll. After the hearing, the City Council may
confirm the special assessment roll, with any corrections that were made.
Following the confirmation of the special assessment role by the City Council,
the City Clerk will endorse the date of confirmation and, upon confirmation,
the roll will be final and conclusive. Thereafter, all charges and amounts
confirmed will be a lien on the property and collected in the manner authorized
by law.
   E.   Objections. If, at or prior to the final confirmation of the special
assessment roll, the record owner or owners of the property to be assessed
object in writing to the proposed improvement, the assessment will not be made
without a four-fifths affirmative vote of the City Council.
   F.   Actual cost exceeds estimate cost. An increase in the estimate of the
cost to be assessed up to ten percent of the original estimate may be made
without further notice and hearing. An increase in the estimate of the cost to
be assessed in excess of ten percent of the original estimate will not be made
unless notice and hearing is given as provided herein.
   G.   Failure to provide notice. A special assessment will not be declared
invalid as to any property if the owner or the party in interest of that
property actually received notice, waived notice, or paid any part of the
assessment. If an assessment is declared void by a court of competent
jurisdiction, a reassessment against the property may be made.

Violations Bureau (“Bureau”) as authorized by the Act to accept admissions of
responsibility for municipal civil infractions in response to municipal civil
infraction violation notices issued and served by authorized city officials and
to collect and retain civil fines and costs as prescribed by this chapter or
any other city ordinance.
   B.   Location; supervision; employees; rules and regulations. The Bureau
shall be located at the City Hall and shall be under the supervision and
control of the Clerk. The Clerk, subject to the approval of the City Council,
shall adopt rules and regulations for the operation of the Bureau and appoint
any necessary qualified city employees to administer the Bureau.
   C.   Schedule of civil fines. The schedule of civil fines payable to the
Bureau, as established by this chapter, shall be posted at the Bureau. The
schedule may provide that fines not paid with in certain time periods or for
repeated offenses, will be increased by the amounts as stated in the schedule.
   D.   Disposition of violations. The Bureau shall dispose only of municipal
civil infraction violations for which a fine has been scheduled and for which a
municipal civil infraction violation notice (as compared with a citation) has
been issued.
   E.   Bureau limited to accepting admissions of responsibility. The scope of
the Bureau’s authority shall be limited to accepting admissions of
responsibility for municipal civil infractions and collecting and retaining
civil fines and costs as a result of those admissions. The Bureau shall not
accept payment of a fine from any person who denies having committed the
offense or who admits responsibility only with explanation and in no event
shall the Bureau determine or attempt to determine, the truth or falsity of any
fact or matter relating to an alleged violation. No person shall be required to
dispose of a municipal civil infraction violation at the Bureau and may have
the violation processed before a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The
unwillingness of any person to dispose of any violation at the Bureau shall not
prejudice the person or in any way diminish the person’s rights, privileges and
protection accorded by law.
   F.   Municipal civil infraction violation notices. Municipal civil
infraction violation notices shall be issued and served by authorized city
officials under the same circumstances and upon the same persons as provided by
this chapter for the service of a municipal civil infraction citation. In
addition to any other information required by this chapter or any other city
ordinance, the notice of violation shall indicate the time by which the alleged
violator must appear at the Bureau, the methods by which an appearance may be
made, the address and telephone number of the Bureau, the hours during which
the Bureau is open, the amount of the fine scheduled for the alleged violation
and the consequences for failure to appear and pay the required fine within the
required time.
   G.   Appearance; payment of fines and costs. An alleged violator receiving a
municipal civil infraction violation notice shall appear at the Bureau and pay
the specified fine and costs at or by the time specified for appearance in the
municipal civil infraction violation notice. An appearance may be made by mail,
in person or by representation.
   H.   Procedure where admission of responsibility not made or fine not paid.
If an authorized city official issues and serves a municipal ordinance
violation notice and if an admission of responsibility is not made and the
civil fine and costs, if any, prescribed by the schedule of fines for the
violation are not paid at the Bureau, a municipal civil infraction citation may
be filed with the District Court and a copy of the citation may be served by
first-class mail upon the alleged violator at the alleged violator’s last known
address. The citation filed with the court does not need to comply in all
particulars with the requirements for citations as provided by §§ 8705 and 8709
of the Act, but shall consist of a sworn complaint containing the allegations
stated in the municipal ordinance violation notice and shall fairly inform the
alleged violator how to respond to the citation.
(Ord. 298, adopted 7-27-1998)
Sec. 17-7. SANCTIONS FOR MUNICIPAL CIVIL INFRACTIONS; REPEAT OFFENSES;
CONTINUING VIOLATIONS; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   A.   The sanction for a violation which is a municipal civil infraction
shall be a civil fine in the amount as provided by the ordinance violated (or
by the schedule of civil fines established by this chapter for admissions of
responsibility accepted at the Bureau in response to a municipal civil
infraction violation notice), plus any costs, damages, expenses and other
sanctions, as authorized under Chapter 87 of the Act and other applicable laws.
   B.   Increased civil fines may be imposed for repeat offenses by a person of
any requirement or provision of any ordinance. As used in this section, REPEAT
OFFENSE means a second (or any subsequent) admission or determination of
responsibility for the same municipal civil infraction made within the period
as specified by the ordinance violated.
   C.   Each day on which any violation designated as a municipal civil
infraction continues constitutes a separate offense and shall be subject to
sanctions as a separate violation.
   D.   In addition to any remedies available at law, the city may bring an
action for an injunction or other process against a person to restrain, prevent
or abate any municipal civil infraction violation.
(Ord. 298, adopted 7-27-1998)

or reduce any criminal liability or responsibility, including fines imposed by
a court; and
      4.   Any assessable cost, including litigation expenses, which become
known to the city following the transmittal of a statement to the responsible
party pursuant to this article shall be billed in the same manner on a
subsequent statement to the responsible party.
Sec. 34-11. RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.
   A.   The city shall bill persons, entities or corporations determined to be
responsible for certain assessable services provided by or through the Public
Safety Department or other city departments.
   B.   Any party benefitting from the services shall be liable for payment of
the full charge for the services rendered. When a particular service rendered
by or through the Public Safety Department or other city department directly
benefits more than one person or property, the owner of each property so
benefitted and/or each person so benefitted, if property protection is not
involved, shall each be liable for the payment of the full charge for services.
Parents and/or guardians shall be responsible for payment for assessable
services incurred by minors who caused the condition or event leading to the
charges.
   C.   Any person who, while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or
any controlled substance or the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and
any controlled substance, operates a motor vehicle which results in assessable
services, as defined by this article, shall be liable for those assessable
services.
   D.   For purposes of this article, a person is under the influence of an
alcoholic beverage or controlled substance or the combined influence of an
alcoholic beverage or a controlled substance when his or her physical or mental
abilities are impaired to a degree that he or she no longer has the ability to
operate a motor vehicle with the caution characteristic of a sober person of
ordinary prudence. Further, it shall be presumed that a person was operating a
motor vehicle while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage if a chemical
analysis of his or her blood, urine or breath indicates that the amount of
alcohol in his or her blood rendered him or her impaired.
Sec. 34-12. CHARGES FOR SERVICES.
   The city establishes the following charges for services:
   A.   A flat rate fee of $250 for:
      1.   Spill clean up from motor vehicle accident or motor vehicle fire;
and/or
      2.   Personal injury accident.

      4.   Pumper, all types: $250 per vehicle per hour.
   C.   Recovery cost for staff and manpower when not covered by a flat fee:
      1.   Manpower: multiply number of people times their current wage; and
      2.   Recovery cost where flat rate fee is not associated will include all
additional cost from outside agencies, persons or equipment that are used to
halt, abate or remedy the situation as seen fit by the City Manager.
   D.   The City Council may, by a resolution, change these fees or add
additional fees.
Sec. 34-13. PAYMENT FOR ASSESSABLE SERVICES.
   A.   The Public Safety Director or his or her designee, may, within ten days
of receiving itemized costs or any part thereof, incurred for an assessable
services, submit a bill for these costs by first class mail or personal service
to the responsible parties as provided by this article. The bill(s) shall
require full payment in 30 days from the date of service.
   B.   Any failure by a responsible party to pay the bill for assessable
services within 30 days of service shall be considered in default. In case of
default, the city may commence a civil suit to recover the expenses and any
costs allowed by law.
   C.   This article shall be construed to be a responsibility and liability of
a civil nature and shall not be construed to conflict, contravene, enlarge or
reduce any criminal liability or responsibility, including fines imposed by a
court under the State Vehicle Code against a person for operating a motor
vehicle while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage and/or controlled
substance.

(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS
Sec. 35-3. DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE. Any unintentional discharge that could result in
potential problems at the POTW treatment plant and includes, but is not limited
to, the following: (1) an upset in operation which places a user in a temporary
state of noncompliance; (2) a chemical spill to floor drains or which will
otherwise enter the wastewater treatment system; or (3) a discharge including
slug loading that could cause treatment system problems.
   ACT. Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act,
as amended, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq.
   ALTERNATIVE FOG PRETREATMENT TECHNOLOGY or AFPT. A device to trap, separate,
and hold FOG from wastewater and prevent it from being discharged into the
POTW, other than an outdoor FOG interceptor.
   AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE. When used in reference to a nondomestic user,
means:

RESPONSIBLE CORPORATE OFFICER means: (i) a president, secretary, treasurer, or
vice-president of the corporation in charge of a principal business function,
or any other person who performs similar policy- or decision-making functions
for the corporation; or (ii) the manager of one or more manufacturing,
production, or operating facilities, provided, the manager is authorized to
make management decisions which govern the operation of the regulated facility
including having the explicit or implicit duty of making major capital
investment recommendations, and initiate and direct other comprehensive
measures to assure long-term  environmental compliance with environmental laws
and regulations; can ensure that the necessary systems are established or
actions taken to gather complete and accurate information for control mechanism
requirements; and where authority to sign documents has been assigned or

      4.   A duly authorized representative of an individual designated in 1.,
2. or 3. above, if the representative is responsible for the overall operation
of the facilities from which the discharge to the POTW originates.
         a.   To be considered “duly authorized,” the authorization must be
made in writing by an individual designated in 1., 2. or 3. above. The
authorization must specify either an individual or a position having
responsibility for the overall operation of the facility (such as the position
of plant manager, operator of a well or well field, or a position of equivalent
responsibility, or having overall responsibility for the environmental matters
for the company or entity). The written authorization must be submitted to the
POTW Superintendent prior to or together with any reports to be signed by the
authorized representative.
         b.   If an authorization under 4.a. above is no longer accurate
because a different individual or position has responsibility for the overall
operation of the facility, or overall responsibility for environmental matters
for the company or entity, a new written authorization must be submitted to the
POTW Superintendent prior to or together with any reports to be signed by the
newly authorized representative.
   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE or BMP. Any practice, program, procedure, control,
technique or measure (used singularly or in combination), that a user is
required to adopt or implement to control, contain, treat, prevent, or reduce
the discharge of wastewater, pollutants or other substances to the POTW, as
determined necessary by the POTW Superintendent. BMPs include, but are not
limited to: schedules of activities; pollution treatment practices or devices;
prohibitions of practices; good housekeeping practices; pollution prevention,
minimization and reduction measures; educational practices and programs;
maintenance procedures; other management programs, practices or devices;
treatment requirements; notice, reporting, and record-keeping requirements; and
operating procedures and practices to control or contain site runoff, spillage
or leaks, batch discharges, biosolids or water disposal, or drainage from
product and raw materials storage. BMPs may be structural, non-structural, or
both. In determining what BMPs will be required of a user in a particular case,
the POTW Superintendent may consider all relevant technological, economic,
practical, and institutional considerations as determined relevant and
appropriate by the Superintendent, consistent with achieving and maintaining
compliance with the requirements of this article and other applicable laws and
regulations.
   BIOSOLIDS. Solid, semisolid, or liquid residues generated during the
treatment of sanitary sewage or domestic sewage in a treatment works. The term
BIOSOLIDS includes, but is not limited to, scum or solids removed in primary,
secondary, or advanced wastewater treatment processes and any derivative of the
removed scum or solids. Sometimes referred to as SLUDGE.
   BOD (BIOCHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND). The quantity of oxygen used in the
biochemical oxidation of a given amount of organic matter under standard
laboratory procedure in five days at 20º Centigrade, expressed in milligrams
per liter.
   BUILDING DRAIN. That part of the lowest horizontal piping of a drainage
system which receives the discharge from soil pipes, waste pipes, and other
drainage pipes inside the walls of the building and conveys it to the building
sewer, beginning five feet outside the inner face of the building wall. The
building drain shall be deemed to begin five feet outside the inner face of the
building wall.
   BUILDING SEWER. The extension from the building drain to the public sewer or
other place of disposal (such as a grinder pump). The BUILDING SEWER shall be
deemed to begin five feet outside the inner face of the building wall.
   BYPASS. The intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a
user’s treatment process or facility.
   CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS. Any regulation containing pollutant
discharge limits promulgated by the U.S. EPA in accordance with Sections 307(b)
and (c) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1317, which apply to a specific
category of users and which appear in 40 C.F.R. Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts
405-471.
   C.F.R. The Code of Federal Regulations, as amended.
   CHLORINE DEMAND. A measure of oxygen-consuming capacity of inorganic and
organic matter present in water or wastewater. It is expressed as the amount of
oxygen consumed from a chemical oxidant in a specified test. It does not
differentiate between stable and unstable organic matter and thus does not
necessarily correlate with biochemical oxygen demand. Also known as oxygen
consumed (OCR) and dichromate oxygen consumed (DO), respectively.
   CITY. The City of Plainwell, or its duly authorized agents or
representatives, including, but not limited to, representatives of the POTW.
   CITY’S COLLECTION SYSTEM. Those portions of the collection system owned,
operated, maintained, and controlled by the city.
   COD (CHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND). The total quantity of oxygen required for
oxidation of a waste to carbon dioxide and water, expressed in milligrams per
liter.
   COLLECTION SYSTEM. All of the sewers, force mains, intercepting sewers,
pipes and other conveyances, lift stations, and pumps, along with any metering
devices and other equipment and facilities, that are installed primarily to
receive discharges of wastewater and pollutants from users for collection and
conveyance to the POTW treatment plant. Unless otherwise expressly provided by
this chapter, the term COLLECTION SYSTEM refers collectively to the city’s
collection system and any regional collection systems.
   COMBINED SEWER. A sewer designed and used to convey both storm water runoff
and sanitary sewage, and which contains lawfully installed regulators and
control devices that allow for delivery of sanitary flow to treatment during
dry weather periods and divert storm water and sanitary sewage to surface
waters during storm flow periods.
   COMMERCIAL. Of or pertaining to any retail or wholesale business engaged in
selling merchandise or a service.
   COMMODITY CHARGES. Charges levied on users of the POTW for the operation and
maintenance costs, and equipment replacement costs of the POTW and its
facilities. COMMODITY CHARGES may also include surcharges.
   COMPATIBLE POLLUTANT. A pollutant that, as determined by the POTW
Superintendent, is susceptible to effective treatment by the POTW as designed,
and which will not interfere with, or pass through, the POTW, and which is
otherwise not incompatible with the treatment processes or in excess of the
capacity at the POTW. The term COMPATIBLE is a relative concept that must be
determined on a case-by-case basis. In determining whether or not a pollutant
is compatible with the POTW, the Superintendent may consider, without
limitation, the nature and qualities of the pollutant, and the concentration,
mass, and flow rate at which the pollutant is (or is proposed to be)
discharged. Thus, for example, even pollutants such as BOD, fats, oils or
grease, phosphorous, suspended solids, and fecal coliform bacteria, which may
typically be considered “compatible,” may be determined incompatible by the
Superintendent if discharged in concentrations or flows that would cause
interference or pass through or exceed the POTW’s capacity. Specifically
excluded from COMPATIBLE POLLUTANTS are “heavy” metals, PCBs, mercury, and any
pollutants that may contribute or cause operational or biosolids disposal
problems or unacceptable discharges to the receiving waters.
   COMPOSITE SAMPLE. A series of individual samples, collected on a flow or
time proportional basis, taken at regular intervals over a specific time
period, and combined into a single sample (formed either by continuous sampling
or by mixing discrete samples) representative of the average stream during the
sampling period. For categorical sampling, a composite sample shall consist of
at least four individual samples taken within a 24-hour period.
   COOLING WATER. Water used for cooling purposes only, including both contact
and non-contact cooling water.
   COOLING WATER (CONTACT). Water used for cooling purposes only that may
become contaminated or polluted either through the use of water treatment
chemicals (such as corrosion inhibitors or biocides) or by direct contact with
process materials and/or wastewater.
   COOLING WATER (NON-CONTACT). Water used for cooling purposes only that has
no direct contact with any raw material, intermediate product, final product,
or waste, and that does not contain a detectable level of contaminants higher
than that of the intake water (for example, the water discharged from uses such
as air conditioning, cooling, or refrigeration, or to which the only pollutant
added is heat).
   COST, COSTS, or COSTS AND EXPENSES AND SIMILAR TERMS. As used generically in
the context of payments or amounts that must be paid by any person to the city,
must be reimbursed to the city, or are due and payable to the city under this
chapter, the terms COST, COSTS, COSTS AND EXPENSES AND SIMILAR TERMS shall be
construed to mean and include, but shall not be limited to, all costs,
expenses, fines, fees, charges, surcharges, penalties, assessments, claims,
losses, liabilities, and damages (direct or indirect), including natural
resource damages, and other amounts, and the full value of any city staff time
(including any required overtime), consultant and engineering fees, and actual
attorney fees and defense costs, as applicable to the circumstances and related
to the intent and purposes of this chapter.
   DAILY MAXIMUM. The maximum discharge of pollutants or flow (expressed in
terms of concentration, mass loading, pounds, gallons or other unit of
measurement) that shall not be exceeded on any single calendar day. Where daily
maximum limitations are expressed in terms of a concentration, the daily
discharge is the arithmetic average measurement of the pollutant concentration
derived from all measurements taken that day. Where daily maximum limitations
are expressed in units of mass, the daily discharge is the total mass
discharged during the day. If a composite sample is required for a parameter,
the determination whether the daily maximum limitation for that parameter has
been exceeded on a single calendar day shall be based on the composite sample
collected for that parameter on that calendar day. If grab samples are required
for a parameter, the determination whether the daily maximum limitation for
that parameter has been exceeded on a calendar day shall be based on the
average of all grab samples collected for that parameter on that calendar day.
If only one grab sample is collected for a parameter on a given day, the
determination whether the daily maximum limitation for that parameter has been
exceeded for the day shall be based on the results of that single grab sample.

Notes
1.   Discharges that contain more than one pollutant that may contribute to fume
toxicity shall be subject to more restrictive limitations, as determined necessary
by the POTW. The more restrictive discharge limits will be calculated based on the
additive fume toxicity of all compounds identified or reasonably expected to be
present in the discharge, including, without limitation, the specific compounds,
if any, listed in this Section
35-32.
See also, Section
35-35(D), regarding application of most restrictive or additional standards or
requirements under local, state, and federal laws and regulations.
In place of using the Standard Concentration Limits, the POTW Superintendent may
allocate specified portions of the available total load to individual Users as
provided by Section
35-32(B) (“Headworks Mass Limits”). A User may also request the POTW
Superintendent to develop alternative concentration limits to be used in place of
the Standard Concentration Limits for specific pollutants (“Special Alternative
Limits” or “SALs”) as provided by Section
35-34.
2.   The instantaneous maximum and daily maximum discharge limit for Mercury is
non-quantifiable concentration, defined as a concentration at or below the
quantification level of 0.2 ug/l using U.S. EPA Method 245.1 (or at or below other
quantification levels applicable under alternative test methods required by the
POTW or by other applicable laws or regulations). Mercury sampling procedures,
preservation and handling, and analytical protocol for compliance monitoring of a
User’s discharge shall be in accordance with U.S. EPA method 245.1, unless the
POTW Superintendent requires U.S. EPA Method 1631 (or other appropriate method).
The quantification level shall be 0.2 ug/l for Method 245.1 or 0.5 ng/l for Method
1631, unless higher levels are approved by the POTW Superintendent because of
sample matrix interference. Any discharge of mercury at or above the level of
quantification is a specific violation of this Chapter.
3.   The instantaneous maximum and daily maximum discharge limit for PCBs is non-
detect. Except as otherwise required by the POTW Superintendent, compliance with
this limit shall be determined as follows:
A compliance limit of “non-detect” shall he used for instantaneous maximum and
daily maximum. Any discharge of PCBs at or above the quantification level is a
specific violation of this Chapter.
PCB sampling procedures, preservation and handling, and analytical protocol for
compliance monitoring of a User’s discharge shall be in accordance with U.S. EPA
method 608. The quantification level shall be 0.1 ug/l, unless higher levels are
determined appropriate by the POTW Superintendent because of sample matrix
interference. Total PCBs shall be defined as the sum of the Aroclors 1016, 1221,
1232, 1242, 1248, 1254 and 1260. In addition, any detected Aroclor-specific
measurements shall be reported.
4.   Total phenol is defined as the sum of any of the following phenolic
compounds: 2-Chlorophenol, 4-Chlorophenol, 2,4-Dicholorophenol, 2,4-
Dimenthylphenol, 2-Methylphenol, 2-Nitrophenol, 4-Nitrophenol and Phenol.
 
 
5.   For Ammonia Nitrogen, BOD, Phosphorous and TSS, the listed daily maximum
limits are the concentrations which may not be exceeded and at which enforcement
begins. The surcharge threshold concentrations as specified in notes 5 through 8
below are the concentrations above which surcharges may be imposed. Discharges
exceeding the surcharge thresholds, but which are less than the daily maximum
limits (and which do not violate any other applicable prohibitions, limitations
or requirements), are not violations of this Chapter, but are subject to
surcharges as provided by this Chapter. All violations of applicable discharge
prohibitions and limitations and all instances of noncompliance with applicable
discharge requirements constitute a violation of this Chapter, subject to
applicable fines, penalties and other enforcement actions. In no event shall the
imposition of a surcharge for a discharge which does not meet the applicable
prohibitions, limitations or requirements be construed as authorizing the
illegal discharge or otherwise excuse a violation of this Chapter.
6.   Any discharge of ammonia nitrogen in excess of 37 mg/l (daily maximum)
shall be subject to surcharge as provided by this Chapter.
7.   Any discharge of BOD in excess of 325 mg/l (daily maximum) shall be subject
to surcharge as provided by this Chapter.
8.   Any discharge of Total Phosphorous in excess of 9 mg/l (daily maximum)
shall be subject to surcharge as provided by this Chapter.
9.   Any discharge of TSS in excess of 350 mg/l (daily maximum) shall be subject
to surcharge as provided by this Chapter.
 
   B.   Headworks Mass Limits. In place of using the Standard Concentration
Limits provided in Section
35-32(A), or a SAL concentration limit developed for a User under Section
35-34, the POTW Superintendent may allocate specified portions of the available
reserve loadings to an individual User as provided by this Section
35-32(B).
      1.   As of the effective date of this Chapter, the maximum allowable
headworks loadings (MAHL), the maximum allowable industrial loadings (MAIL),
and the available reserve loadings for the following pollutant parameters are
as follows:
 
Pollutant  MAHL         MAIL         Available Reserve Loadings
           (pounds/day) (pounds/day) (pounds/day)
BOD5       1373         667          540
TSS        1398         580          475
Ammonia    249          105          95
Phosphorus 64           40           25
 
      2.   The POTW Superintendent may allocate portions of the available
reserve loadings for one or more of the pollutants listed in the table in
Section
35-32(B)(l) to one or more specific individual Users.
      3.   The amounts of the loadings allocated to each User shall be
specified in the User’s User Permit, along with any conditions as determined
necessary by the POTW Superintendent. The allocation may be specified in the
form of an equivalent calculated daily maximum concentration limit (mg/l) or as
a daily maximum loading (pounds/day), as determined appropriate by the POTW
Superintendent based on the quality and quantity of the user’s discharge. Any
discharge by a User in excess of the amount of the loadings allocated to the
User in the User Permit shall constitute a violation of the User Permit and
this Chapter.
      4.   The POTW shall keep a record of how much of the available reserve
loadings for each parameter listed above has been allocated and maintain at all
times a current total of how much remains available for allocation consistent
with the requirements of this Section
35-32(B).
      5.   Before allocating any amount of the available reserve loadings as
provided by this Section 
35-32(B), the POTW Superintendent must determine that the proposed allocation
will not cause the average composite loading of all Users discharging to the
POTW to exceed the MAHL, MAIL, or available reserve loadings as provided by the
table in Section
35-32(B)(1); will not interfere with the POTW’s ability to accept and treat
wastewater as required by the POTW’s NPDES Permit and other applicable laws and
regulations; and that the allocation is otherwise reasonable and appropriate
under all of the circumstances.
      6.   If the POTW Superintendent allocates a portion of the available
reserve loadings for some, but not all, of the pollutant parameters listed in
the table in Section
35-32(B)(1) to a User, any pollutant parameter in the User’s discharge that is
not allocated a portion of the available reserve loadings shall be subject to
Standard Concentration Limits provided by Section
35-32(A), or the Special Alternative Limit for the pollutant parameter, if any,
that has been developed for the User under Section
35-34.
      7.   The allocation of available reserve loadings to an individual User
for a pollutant shall not affect the applicability of surcharges to the
pollutant (or any other pollutant in the User’s discharge) as provided by
Section
35-32(A).
      8.   Unless determined otherwise by the POTW Superintendent, all costs
and expenses, direct and indirect, associated with developing a Headworks Mass
Limit for a User shall be paid for by the User, including, but not limited to,
the costs of reviewing the appropriateness of a proposed Headworks Mass Limit,
all studies and reports, and all monitoring, sampling and generation of data;
the full value of any City staff time (including any administrative and
overhead costs and any required overtime), consultant and engineering fees, and
actual attorney fees (including the POTW’s legal counsel and any special legal
counsel), associated with developing the Headworks Mass Limit for a User.
      9.   At anytime prior to or during the Headworks Mass Limit development
process, the POTW may require a User that will be subject to the limit to post
a performance bond (or other form of surety acceptable to the POTW
Superintendent) sufficient to cover all costs and expenses (direct and/or
indirect) that might reasonably be incurred by the POTW in developing the
limit, as determined necessary by the POTW Superintendent.
      10.   If determined necessary by the POTW Superintendent, an updated
maximum allowable headworks loading (MAHL) study shall be done at the expense
of the User that will be subject to the Headworks Mass Limit. The MAHL shall be
representative of the current flow and loading conditions at the POTW and
demonstrate that there is sufficient available reserve loadings for the
allocation of the specific pollutants to which the Headworks Mass Limit will
apply. The MAHL study shall take into consideration the total load from all
Users and the allocation of load from the study shall be divided as determined
appropriate by the POTW Superintendent.
      11.   The POTW Superintendent may require a User to submit any
information that the POTW determines will be necessary to adequately evaluate
the appropriateness of a proposed Headworks Mass Limit. This information may
include, but shall not be limited to, any of the information that is required
to be provided in a User Permit application as set forth by Section
35-44 of this Chapter. If deemed necessary by the POTW Superintendent, a site
inspection may be required. Further, the POTW Superintendent may require a
review of historical data from sampling and monitoring the User’s discharge,
including, but not limited to, concentration and flow data. The User may be
required to update this data using any means or methods determined necessary by
the POTW Superintendent. The POTW Superintendent may also require a review of
typical discharge concentrations and flows for similar Users, and any
applicable categorical standards.
      12.   After the proposed Headworks Mass Limit and associated monitoring
frequency have been prepared, the POTW Superintendent shall determine whether
or not to approve the limit, or to approve the limit subject to whatever
conditions the POTW Superintendent deems appropriate. If approved, or approved
subject to conditions, the User may accept or reject the Headworks Mass Limit
and associated monitoring frequency. If the User accepts the Headworks Mass
Limit, the POTW Superintendent may modify or reissue the User’s discharge
permit to incorporate the limit and associated monitoring frequency, and any
other conditions or requirements as determined appropriate by the POTW
Superintendent.
      13.   The allocation of load for a pollutant parameter shall not convey
to any person any property rights or privilege of any kind whatsoever, nor
shall it be construed to authorize any injury to private or public property or
any invasion of personal rights, or any violation of local, state or federal
laws or regulations. An allocation may be reviewed, reevaluated, modified, and/
or revoked without notice at any time and for any reason determined appropriate
by the POTW Superintendent. At a minimum, all existing allocations shall be
reviewed whenever the POTW’s NPDES permit is subject to renewal.
      14.   Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Section
35-32(B), the allocation of available reserve loadings for a pollutant as
provided by this Section shall not affect a User’s obligation to comply with
any of the requirements and standards of this Chapter and other applicable laws
and regulations.
   C.   Additional Discharge Prohibitions. In addition to the prohibitions set
forth in Sections
35-32(A) and
35-32(B), no person shall discharge or contribute to the POTW, directly or
indirectly, any of the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater:
      1.   Any liquid, solid, gas or other pollutant (including, but not
limited to, gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel or fuel oil) which by reason of
its nature or quantity is sufficient either alone or by interaction with other
substances to create a fire or explosion hazard or be injurious in any other
way to persons, the POTW, or to the operation of the sewerage system,
including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed cup flashpoint of
less than 140° F or 60° C using test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21.
      2.   Pollutants that may cause corrosive structural damage to the POTW,
or that due to their corrosive properties are capable of causing injury to
persons or POTW personnel or harm to fish, animals or the environment.
Discharges that have a pH lower than 6.5 s.u. (instantaneous minimum limit) or
greater than 9.5 s.u. (instantaneous maximum limit) shall not be discharged.
      3.   Any solid, insoluble or viscous substance in concentrations or
quantities which may cause obstruction to the flow in the POTW, may create an
encumbrance to the POTW operations, or which otherwise may result in
interference, including, but not limited to, grease, animal entrails or
tissues, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, whole blood, feathers, ashes,
cinders, sand, cement, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw,
shavings, grass clippings, rags, strings, fibers, spent grains, spent hops,
wastepaper, wood, plastics, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining or
processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud or glass grinding or polishing
wastes or tumbling and deburring stones; or any material that can be disposed
of as trash.
      4.   Any pollutant, including, but not limited to, oxygen demanding
pollutants (BOD, etc.), released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration
that may cause pass through or interference with the POTW or constitute a slug
load, or is otherwise discharged to the POTW in excessive amounts.
      5.   Wastewater (or vapor) having a temperature that will inhibit
biological activity in the POTW or result in interference, or heat in such
quantities that the temperature at any lift station or at the POTW treatment
plant exceeds 104° Fahrenheit (40° C). No discharge to the POTW shall have a
temperature less than 40° Fahrenheit (4.4° C) or greater than 135° Fahrenheit
(57.2° C), unless approved in advance by the POTW Superintendent.
      6.   Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral
oil origin in amounts that may cause interference or pass through.
      7.   Pollutants that result in the presence of gases, vapors or fumes
within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety
problems. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, wastewaters which
contain liquids, solids or gases that cause gases, vapors or fumes from the
discharge to exceed 10% of the immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH)
concentration. Discharges that contain more than one pollutant that may
contribute to fume toxicity shall be subject to more restrictive limitations,
as determined necessary by the POTW. The more restrictive discharge limits
shall be calculated based on the additive fume toxicity of all compounds
identified or reasonably expected to be present in the discharge.
      8.   Substances that, either alone or by interaction with other
substances, cause or substantially contribute to increases in sewer gas
hydrogen sulfide levels above 10 parts per million vapor (ppmv) concentration
in downstream collection system lift stations, manholes or sewers. If the POTW
Superintendent determines that a User’s discharge is in violation of this
prohibition, the POTW Superintendent may require the User to take whatever
actions are determined necessary and appropriate by the POTW Superintendent to
reduce the concentration of sewer gas hydrogen sulfide levels to less than 10
ppmv.
      9.   Trucked or hauled pollutants, except those introduced into the
system at discharge points designated by the POTW, subject to the prior
approval of the POTW Superintendent and prior issuance of a User Permit.
         a.   The POTW Superintendent shall determine whether to allow the
discharge of trucked or hauled pollutants based on the particular nature,
character or quantity of the proposed discharge in accordance with the
discharge prohibitions, limitations and requirements provided by this Chapter.
         b.   The POTW Superintendent may impose any conditions on the
discharge determined necessary to ensure compliance with this Chapter,
including, without limitation, conditions regarding the time, place, and manner
of discharge, restrictions on the quantity and quality of the discharge, and
sampling requirements.
         c.   The discharge shall not commence without prior notice to, and
authorization from, the POTW Superintendent, and a representative of the POTW
shall be present at all times during the discharge.
         d.   All trucked or hauled wastes to be discharged to the POTW must be
accompanied by a completed waste manifest form signed by the permittee and the
hauler as provided by the minimum requirements of this Subsection. The
permittee shall certify in writing on the manifest as to the source of all
wastes in the load proposed to be discharged and that the wastes have been
pretreated as required by applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
The hauler shall certify in writing on the manifest that the hauler has
accepted no wastes other than those listed on the manifest. The manifest must
be reviewed by the POTW Superintendent prior to commencing discharge of the
load. Failure to accurately record every load, falsification of data, or
failure to transmit the form to the POTW Superintendent for review prior to
discharge shall constitute a violation of the permit and may result in
revocation of the permit and/or the imposition of fines and penalties as
provided by this Chapter.
         e.   The permittee’s discharge of hauled wastes shall be subject to
sampling by the POTW at any time, including, without limitation, prior to and
during discharge. The POTW Superintendent may require the permittee to refrain
from, or suspend, discharging until the sample analysis is complete.
         f.   Trucked or hauled pollutants will be accepted only if transported
to the POTW in compliance with state and federal hazardous waste and liquid
industrial waste laws.
         g.   Each discharge of trucked or hauled pollutants will be accepted
only after payment to the POTW of a trucked or hauled pollutant discharge fee
to cover the POTW’s administrative, consulting and legal expenses, and any
additional treatment, handling or inspection expenses incurred by the POTW in
connection with the discharge. The fee shall be established, paid, and
collected as provided for IPP fees by Article XXI. This discharge fee shall be
in addition to any sewer rates, fees, charges, or surcharges otherwise required
by this Chapter.
      10.   Wastewater with objectionable color or light absorbency
characteristics that may interfere with treatment processes or analytical
determinations, including, without limitation, dye wastes and vegetable tanning
solutions.
      11.   Any garbage or other solid material that has not been properly
shredded.
      12.   Solvent extractibles, including, without limitation, oil, grease,
wax, or fat, whether emulsified or not, in excess of applicable local limits;
or other substances that may solidify or become viscous (with a viscosity of
110% of water) at temperatures between 32° Fahrenheit and 150° Fahrenheit in
amounts that may cause obstruction to the flow in sewers or other interference
with the operation of the POTW.
      13.   Soluble substances in a concentration that may increase the
viscosity to greater than 10% over the viscosity of the water or in amounts
that will cause obstruction to the flow in the POTW resulting in interference.
      14.   Any substance that exerts or causes a high or unusual concentration
of inert suspended solids, as determined by the POTW Superintendent, including,
but not limited to, lime slurries, diatomaceous earth and lime residues.
      15.   Any wastewater that contains suspended solids of such character,
quantity or concentration that special attention is required, or additional
expense inclined, to process such materials at the POTW.
      16.   Any substance that exerts or causes a high or unusual concentration
of dissolved solids, including, but not limited to, sodium chloride or sodium
sulfate.
      17.   Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, fumes, or solids that either
singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public
nuisance, cause workplace conditions in violation of any applicable workplace
health or safety standard, pose a hazard to life, sufficient to prevent entry
into the sewers for maintenance and repair, or cause any hazardous or unsafe
conditions for the general public.
      18.   Anti-freeze, motor oil, brake fluid, transmission fluid, hydraulic
fluid, cleaning solvents, oil-based paint, water-based paint with mercury
biocides and paint thinners.

that may exceed limits established by applicable City, state or federal laws,
rules or regulations.
      20.   Any pollutant that results in excess foaming during the treatment
process. Excess foaming is any foam that, in the opinion of the POTW
Superintendent, may interfere with the treatment process.
      21.   Wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity,
either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere
with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or
animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or to
exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard.
      22.   Any hazardous waste as defined by this Chapter.
      23.   Any medical waste, or infectious waste as defined by the MDEQ.

(Ord. 372, passed 3-16-2015)
Sec. 35-33. POLLUTANT REDUCTION PLANS.
   If the POTW Superintendent determines that a user has the reasonable
potential to discharge any regulated pollutant (including, but not limited to,
mercury or PCBs) to the POTW in quantities or magnitude that may cause
interference or pass through; adversely impact the POTW, its processes or
beneficial use of biosolids; cause noncompliance with applicable federal or
state laws or regulations; cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit, or
otherwise fail to meet the purposes and objectives of this chapter, then the
POTW Superintendent may require the user to develop, submit for approval, and
implement a reduction plan (RP) for the pollutant, as provided by this section.
The RP may be imposed as a condition to a user permit, or may be required
independently and even if a user permit has not been issued to the user.
   A.   At a minimum, the RP shall contain such requirements and conditions, as
determined necessary by the POTW Superintendent to ensure that the pollutant
reduction efforts will be effective in achieving the goals of this chapter
(including, but not limited to, requirements and conditions regarding user
source identification; best management practices; schedules of compliance;
monitoring, sampling and analysis; reporting; treatment system for removal of
the pollutant from the discharged wastewater; written procedures for disposal
of contaminated wastes and wastewater; employee training, and on-going employee
training requirements regarding pollutant related issues; elimination, if
feasible, of any purchased materials containing the pollutant; and any other
elements determined necessary and appropriate under the circumstances by the
POTW Superintendent).
   B.   The goal of an RP shall be to maintain the amount of one or more
pollutants or substances at or below the applicable discharge limits or levels,
or such other goals as required by the POTW. The POTW Superintendent may, in
the POTW Superintendent’s discretion, consider cost-effectiveness during the
development and implementation of an RP.
   C.   The POTW Superintendent may require any user to submit an RP that
describes the control strategy designed to proceed toward achievement of the
specified goal and shall at a minimum include, but shall not be limited to, all
of the following as determined necessary by the POTW Superintendent on a case-
by-case basis:
      1.   Periodic monitoring for the pollutant in the user’s discharge.
      2.   Periodic monitoring of the potential sources of the pollutant in the
user’s discharge.
      3.   A commitment by the user that reasonable control measures and/or
best management practices will be implemented when sources of the pollutant are
discovered. Factors to be considered by the POTW may include the following:
         a.   Significance of sources.
         b.   Economic considerations.
         c.   Technical and treatability considerations.
         d.   Such other factors as determined appropriate by the POTW
Superintendent.
      4.   An annual status report. The report shall be sent by the user to the
POTW and shall include, at a minimum, all of the following:
         a.   All RP monitoring results for the previous year.
         b.   A list of potential sources of the pollutant in the user’s
discharge.
         c.   A summary of all actions taken by the user to reduce or eliminate
the identified sources of the pollutant or substance.
   D.   As determined necessary by the POTW Superintendent, the Superintendent
may require a user to develop, submit and implement an RP for any pollutant or
substance regulated by this chapter. The POTW Superintendent may also modify an
approved RP at any time as determined necessary by the POTW Superintendent to
meet the goals and objectives of this chapter.
   E.   Failure to submit an approvable RP within the specified deadlines or to
fully and timely comply with any condition or requirement of an approved RP
shall constitute a violation of this chapter, subject to the fine, penalty, and
other enforcement provisions of this chapter.
   F.   Holding enforcement action in abeyance. Except as provided for in § 
35-33F.3.f., if the effluent sample analysis results of a user’s discharge
exceeds the applicable discharge limit, detection level, or quantification
level for a pollutant, the POTW Superintendent may, in the POTW
Superintendent’s sole discretion, nevertheless allow that discharge to continue
and may hold any enforcement action regarding the prohibited discharge in
abeyance, subject to the terms, conditions, and requirements of this
subdivision F., as follows:
      1.   If an approved RP is already in place: If effluent sample analysis
results exceeds the applicable discharge limit, detection level, or
quantification level for a pollutant for which an approved RP is already in
place, then the POTW Superintendent may, in the POTW Superintendent’s sole
discretion, nevertheless allow that discharge to continue and may hold any
enforcement action regarding the prohibited discharge in abeyance for the
period that the sample represents if the RP (and all terms, conditions and
requirements thereof) is being fully and continually performed in good faith by
the user, as determined by the POTW Superintendent, and subject to all of the
requirements and conditions of § 
35-33F.3..
      2.   If an approved RP is not already in place: If effluent sample
analysis results exceeds the applicable discharge limit, detection level, or
quantification level for a pollutant for which an approved RP is not already in
place, then the POTW Superintendent may, in the POTW Superintendent’s sole
discretion, nevertheless allow that discharge to continue and may hold any
enforcement regarding the prohibited discharge in abeyance, subject to all of
the requirements and conditions of § 
35-33F.3., and provided further as follows: The user with the non-compliant
discharge shall develop and implement an RP approved by the POTW Superintendent
to minimize the user’s discharges of the pollutant in question to the POTW. The
RP shall meet all of the requirements of this division F..
      3.   The following requirements and conditions shall apply to any
situation under this division F. in which an enforcement action is held in
abeyance as provided by this division (regardless of whether or not an RP was
in place at the time of the non-compliance):
         a.   The user with the non-compliant discharge shall have a POTW-
accessible point for monitoring all discharges from the user to the POTW, as
approved by the POTW. All costs and expenses for and related to the
installation and maintenance of this monitoring point and any required sampling
devices shall be paid for solely by the user.
         b.   The user with the non-compliant discharge shall routinely self-
monitor its discharges to the POTW for the pollutant in question using the
sampling methods, procedures, preservation and handling, and analytical
protocol required by the POTW Superintendent and at the frequency specified by
the POTW Superintendent. All costs and expenses of this sampling and analysis
shall be paid for solely by the user.
         c.   The POTW may collect any additional samples of the user’s
discharge as determined necessary by the POTW Superintendent, all costs and
expenses to be paid for by the user.
         d.   If the user complies with all of the requirements and conditions
for the RP as specified by the POTW Superintendent; and if the POTW
Superintendent determines that all reasonable and cost-effective actions based
on the economic, technical, and treatability considerations, including, but not
limited to, all elements of the user’s RP, have been, and continue to be, fully
and satisfactorily implemented by the user; and if the user’s discharge does
not cause interference or pass through; adversely impact the POTW, its
processes or beneficial use of biosolids; cause noncompliance with applicable
federal or state laws or regulations; cause the POTW to violate its NPDES
permit, or otherwise fail to meet the purposes and objectives of this chapter,
then the POTW may, in its discretion, hold enforcement action in abeyance and
allow the user to continue the non-compliant discharge.
         e.   Notwithstanding any provision of this division F. to the
contrary, and regardless of whether a user fully complies with all requirements
and conditions of this section and/or of an approved RP, the POTW
Superintendent shall have the unconditional right to prohibit and terminate any
non-compliant discharge at any time and without prior notice, and to take any
enforcement action in response thereto, including any enforcement action that
had previously been held in abeyance under this division F..
         f.   Notwithstanding any provision of this division F. to the
contrary, the POTW Superintendent shall not hold an enforcement action in
abeyance as provided by this subdivision for any pollutant parameter other than
mercury and PCBs unless the POTW Superintendent has first obtained approval
from the MDNRE to implement the requirements of this division F. for the
specific pollutant parameter in question.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-34. SPECIAL ALTERNATIVE LIMITS.
   Notwithstanding the Standard Local Limits provided by Section
35-32(A), the POTW may, but shall in no case be required to, develop
alternative User-specific maximum limits (“Special Alternative Limits” or
“SAL”) for specific pollutants, as provided by this Section
35-34.
   A.   Prerequisites For SAL Development. Special Alternative Limits for
specific pollutants may be developed for a User, and the resulting SAL may be
implemented, subject to meeting all of the following conditions, as determined
by the POTW Superintendent:
      1.   All costs and expenses, direct and indirect, associated with
developing a SAL for a User shall be paid for the User, including, but not
limited to, the costs of reviewing the User’s request for a SAL, all studies
and reports, and all monitoring, sampling and generation of data; the full
value of any City staff time (including any administrative and overhead costs
and any required overtime), consultant and engineering fees, and actual
attorney fees (including the POTW’s legal counsel and any special legal
counsel), associated with developing the SAL for the User.
         At anytime prior to or during the SAL development process, the POTW
Superintendent may require a User that requests the development of a SAL to
post a performance bond (or other form of surety acceptable to the POTW
Superintendent) sufficient to cover all costs and expenses (direct and/or
indirect) that might reasonably be inclined by the POTW as a result of the
User’s request, as determined necessary by the POTW Superintendent.
      2.   A maximum allowable headworks loading (MAHL) study has been done
that is representative of the current flow and loading conditions at the POTW
and that demonstrates sufficient capacity for the change in the specific
pollutant. The MAHL study shall take into consideration the total load from all
Users and the allocation of load from the study shall be divided as determined
appropriate by the POTW Superintendent.
      3.   Any change to the load limits resulting from the SAL shall not (1)
significantly hinder the capacity of the POTW to accept additional waste from
new or existing domestic or nondomestic customers; or (2) exceed the capacity
of the POTW.
      4.   The POTW Superintendent has determined that the SAL is reasonable
and appropriate under all of the circumstances, and that it is consistent with
the purposes and objectives of this Chapter, the POTW’s NPDES permit, and other
applicable laws and regulations.
      5.   The proposed change to the load limits as a result of the SAL has
been submitted to the MDEQ and has received MDEQ approval before
implementation.
   B.   SAL Review Process. The process for the POTW Superintendent to
determine whether replacing a Standard Local Limit with a SAL is reasonable and
appropriate shall be as follows, as determined applicable by the POTW
Superintendent:
      1.   The User shall request in writing that the POTW develop a SAL for a
particular specific pollutant.
      2.   The POTW Superintendent may review the User’s request and may
require the User to submit any additional information that the POTW
Superintendent determines will be necessary to adequately evaluate the User’s
request. This information may include, but shall not be limited to, any of the
information that is required to be provided in a User Permit application as set
forth in Section
35-44 of this Chapter. If deemed necessary by the POTW Superintendent, a site
inspection may be required.
      3.   The POTW Superintendent may require a review of historical data from
sampling and monitoring the User’s discharge, including, but not limited to,
concentration and flow data. The User may be required to update this data using
any means or methods determined necessary by the POTW Superintendent. The POTW
Superintendent may also require a review of typical discharge concentrations
and flows for similar Users, and any applicable categorical standards.
      4.   The POTW Superintendent shall review the status of the current
Maximum Allowable Industrial Loadings (“MAIL”) for the pollutant for which the
SAL is being requested to determine if sufficient loading remains to
accommodate all, any part, or none, of the requested SAL.
      5.   After the proposed SAL and associated monitoring frequency have been
prepared, the POTW Superintendent shall determine whether or not to approve the
SAL, or to approve the SAL only subject to whatever conditions the
Superintendent deems appropriate.
      6.   If approved, or approved subject to conditions, the User may accept
or reject the SAL and associated monitoring frequency. If the User accepts the
SAL, the POTW Superintendent may revise and reissue the User’s discharge permit
to incorporate the SAL and associated monitoring frequency, and any other
conditions or requirements as determined appropriate by the POTW
Superintendent.
      7.   The development of a SAL or implementation of a SAL in a User’s
discharge permit shall not convey to any person any property rights or
privilege of any kind whatsoever, nor shall it be construed to authorize any
injury to private or public property or any invasion of personal rights, nor
any violation of local, state or federal laws or regulations. A SAL may be
reviewed, reevaluated, modified, and/or revoked by the POTW Superintendent
without notice at any time and for any reason determined appropriate by the
POTW Superintendent. At a minimum, all existing SALs shall be reviewed whenever
the POTW’s NPDES permit is subject to renewal.
(Ord. 372, passed 3-16-2015)
Sec. 35-35. PRETREATMENT STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   A.   Compliance with applicable standards and requirements. The categorical
pretreatment standards when finalized for specific industries shall become a
part of the requirements of this chapter in accordance with federal and state
laws and regulations. A user shall comply with all categorical pretreatment
standards and any other pretreatment requirements established under the FWPCA
that are applicable to that user. A user shall also comply with all applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements established under this chapter and
other state laws and regulations.
   B.   Deadlines for compliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
Compliance by existing sources with categorical pretreatment standards shall be
within three years of the date the standard is effective unless a shorter
compliance time is specified by 40 C.F.R. Chapter I, Subchapter N. Existing
sources that become nondomestic users subsequent to promulgation of an
applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall be considered existing
nondomestic users except where such sources meet the definition of new source.
New sources shall install and have in operating condition, and shall start-up
all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest
feasible time (not to exceed 90 days), new sources must meet all applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements.
   C.   Alternative categorical limits. Categorical pretreatment standards
shall apply to a user subject to categorical standards, unless an enforceable
alternative limit to the corresponding national categorical standards is
derived using any of the methods specified in MAC R 323.2313 (regarding removal
credits, fundamentally different factor variances, net/gross calculations,
equivalent mass per day limitations, and combined wastestream formula
alternative limitations). If local limits are more stringent than derived
alternative categorical limits, the local limits shall control.
   D.   Most restrictive standards and requirements apply. Notwithstanding any
provision of this chapter to the contrary, the most stringent or restrictive
standard or requirement applicable to a user’s discharge shall control, whether
established by this chapter, by any notice, order, permit, decision or
determination promulgated, issued or made by the POTW under this chapter, by
state laws or regulations, including the POTW’s NPDES permit, or by federal
laws or regulations. Further, if state or federal laws or regulations provide
for standards and requirements not covered by this chapter that are otherwise
applicable to a user’s discharge, those standards and requirements shall apply
to the user in addition to those required by this chapter, and the most
restrictive of those additional standards or requirements shall control and
shall be complied with by the user within the time period required by the law
or regulation.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-36. RESERVED RIGHT OF REVISION.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, the
city reserves the right to revise this chapter and other local laws and
regulations to establish more restrictive prohibitions, limitations or
requirements for discharges to the POTW (and to revise or revoke user permits
accordingly) or as otherwise necessary to prevent interference or pass through,
to protect the POTW, to comply with applicable federal or state laws or
regulations, to comply with the POTW’s NPDES permit, or as otherwise determined
necessary by the POTW Superintendent.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-37. POTW’S RIGHT TO REFUSE OR CONDITION DISCHARGE.
   The POTW may refuse to accept, or may condition its acceptance of, all or
any portion of any proposed or existing discharge to the POTW, regardless of
whether or not a wastewater discharge permit has been issued for the discharge,
if the POTW Superintendent determines that the discharge has a reasonable
potential to adversely affect the operation of the POTW; result in pass through
or interference; violate any pretreatment standard or requirement; cause the
POTW to violate its NPDES permit; or if the impacts of the discharge on the
POTW or the POTW’s discharge are uncertain or unknown (because, for example, no
local limits or headworks analysis has been conducted for particular pollutants
in the discharge). If the POTW Superintendent denies any person permission to
commence or continue all or any portion of a discharge to the POTW, the person
shall refrain from commencing to discharge or shall immediately terminate the
discharge to the POTW and shall not thereafter recommence discharge without
written authorization from the POTW Superintendent. Similarly, if the POTW
Superintendent denies any person permission to commence or continue all or any
portion of a discharge to the POTW except subject to conditions determined
necessary and appropriate by the POTW Superintendent, the person shall refrain
from commencing or continuing the discharge except in full compliance with
those conditions.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-38. DILUTION PROHIBITED AS SUBSTITUTE FOR TREATMENT.
   Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment
standard or requirement (and subject to the prior written approval of the POTW
Superintendent), no user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in
any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute
for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or
requirement. The POTW may impose mass limitations on users that are using
dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements and in other
cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-39. PRETREATMENT REQUIRED PRIOR TO POINT OF DISCHARGE.
   Unless specified otherwise in an user’s permit, the prohibitions and
limitations provided by this article shall apply at the point where wastewater
and pollutants are discharged or caused to be discharged into the POTW and any
required pretreatment shall be effected before that point of discharge is
reached.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-40. AUTHORITY FOR CONTROL OF DISCHARGES TO THE POTW.
   If any user discharges, or proposes to discharge wastewaters or pollutants
to the POTW which are prohibited or limited by this chapter, the Superintendent
may take any action as authorized by this chapter or other applicable law or
regulation to assure and require compliance with the provisions of this
chapter, including, but not limited to, the issuance of orders, the imposition
of surcharges, and the assessment of fines and penalties.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
ARTICLE VII. USER PERMITS
Sec. 35-41. USER PERMIT REQUIRED.
   A.   Nondomestic user permits. It is unlawful and prohibited for any
significant industrial user (SIU), or any other user as determined necessary by
the POTW Superintendent to carry out the purposes of this chapter, to discharge
to the POTW without a nondomestic user permit as provided by this article.
   B.   General user permits. For any person or user that is not an SIU (or
that is not otherwise required to obtain a nondomestic user permit), the POTW
Superintendent may require the person or user to obtain a general user permit
to discharge to the POTW, subject to such terms and conditions as are
determined necessary and appropriate by the POTW Superintendent to achieve the
purposes, policies and objectives of this chapter.
      1.   A general user permit may contain, but shall not be required to
contain, any of the terms and conditions that would apply to a nondomestic user
permit issued to a SIU as provided by this article to comply with the general
and specific discharge prohibitions of this chapter, including, but not limited
to, discharge limitations, and requirements regarding sampling and monitoring;
pretreatment; pollution prevention, minimization or reductions plans;
accidental discharge, spill prevention, and containment requirements; flow
equalization; and implementation of best management practices or a best
management practices plan.
      2.   To the extent determined appropriate by the POTW Superintendent on a
case-by-case bask otherwise applicable to permits for SIUs. However, all
general user permits shall be non-transferable, and are subject to the permit
fee and permit appeals provisions of this chapter.
      3.   It is unlawful and prohibited for any person required by the POTW
Superintendent to obtain a general user permit to discharge to the POTW without
a general user permit as provided by this article.
      4.   Failure to comply with a general user permit issued under this
subdivision constitutes a violation of this chapter.
      5.   In no case shall a general user permit be construed to authorize the
illegal discharge or otherwise excuse a violation of this chapter.
   C.   Exception. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
contrary, if determined necessary by the POTW Superintendent to achieve the
goals and purposes of this chapter, the Superintendent may issue a user permit
to any person without first requiring the person to submit or complete a permit
application or if a person has failed or refused to submit or complete a permit
application upon the POTW Superintendent’s request.
   D.   Violation. Any violation of the terms or conditions of a user permit is
a violation of this chapter, subject to the fine, penalty, and other
enforcement provisions of this chapter. Obtaining a user permit shall not
relieve a person of the obligation to obtain other permits or approvals that
may be required by other local, state or federal laws or regulations.
   E.   Permit limits. The issuance of a user permit shall not convey to any
person any property rights or privilege of any kind whatsoever, nor shall it be
construed to authorize any injury to private or public property or any invasion
of personal rights, nor any violation of local, state or federal laws or
regulations.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-42. DETERMINATION OF USER STATUS.
   A.   The POTW may require any person to submit information to the POTW for
its use in determining the person’s status as a user, including, but not
limited to, whether the user is a SIU, as well as to determine changes or the
absence or inadequacy of changes in a user’s facilities.
   B.   The POTW shall notify a user of the POTW’s belief that the user is, or
may be, a SIU. Upon such notification, the user must complete and submit an
application for a nondomestic user permit on a form furnished by the POTW. The
failure of the POTW to so notify a user shall not relieve any SIU of the duty
to obtain a permit as required by this chapter.
   C.   Upon determination that user permit is required, no connection to the
POTW shall be made and no discharge thereto shall occur until a permit is duly
issued; provided, however, that the POTW may at its discretion issue a written
authorization in place of a permit, which authorization shall be valid for a
period not to exceed 60 days.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-43. PERMIT APPLICATION DEADLINES.
   Each user must file an application for a user permit on the form provided by
the POTW within the following deadlines:
   A.   Existing SIUs. Any SIU discharging into the POTW as of the effective
date of this chapter shall submit a completed permit application form to the
POTW as provided by this article within 60 days of being so directed and
provided a form by the POTW.
   B.   Proposed new SIUs. Any SIU proposing to commence (or recommence)
discharging into the POTW after the effective date of this chapter shall, at
least 60 days prior to the anticipated date on which discharging will commence
(or recommence), request a permit application form and submit the completed
application to the POTW.
   C.   Categorical users subject to new standard. A user which becomes subject
to a new or revised national categorical pretreatment standard, and which has
not previously submitted an application for a permit as required herein, shall
apply to the POTW for a nondomestic user permit within 90 days after the
promulgation of the applicable national categorical pretreatment standard. The
POTW may also initiate this action; however, the failure of the POTW so to do
shall not relieve a user of its obligation to obtain a permit.
   D.   Other users. Any other user directed by the POTW to complete and submit
a user permit application shall do so within 60 days of being so directed by
the POTW and provided a form by the POTW. Any user not required to obtain a
user permit for existing discharges must apply for and receive a user permit
prior to changing the user’
   E.   Others required to file. The POTW Superintendent may also require any
other person to file the information required by § 
35-44 of this chapter (whether or not that person is currently a user, and
whether or not that person is otherwise currently discharging to the POTW, a
storm sewer, or receiving waters), if the Superintendent determines that there
is a reasonable potential for the person to discharge to the POTW, a storm
sewer, or receiving waters, whether due to an accidental spill or for any other
reason. Any person directed by the POTW Superintendent to submit the required
shall do so within the time frame as directed by the POTW Superintendent.
   F.   Failure/refusal to submit/complete an application. The failure or
refusal of any person to submit or complete a permit application shall not in
any way relieve the person from the duty to comply with a permit issued by the
POTW Superintendent. In no case shall the receipt or non-receipt of a completed
permit application prevent the issuance of a permit by the Superintendent or
relieve a person from the duty of fully complying with a permit that is issued
by the Superintendent.

   B.   All user permits issued to a particular user are void upon the issuance
of a new user permit to that user.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-50. CONTINUATION OF EXPIRED PERMITS.
   An expired user permit will continue to be effective until the permit is
reissued only if:
   A.   The user has submitted a complete permit application (in a form and
containing the information required by the POTW Superintendent) at least 90
days prior to the expiration date of the user’s existing permit (or at least
180 days prior to the expiration date of a five-year permit); and
   B.   The failure to reissue the permit, prior to expiration of the previous
permit, is not due to any act or failure to act on the part of the user:

reasonable potential to endanger human health or the environment and the threat
can be abated only by suspension or revocation of the permit.
   N.   Upon suspension or revocation of a permit, a user shall immediately
terminate its discharge to the POTW and shall not thereafter recommence
discharge without further authorization from the POTW Superintendent as
provided by this chapter. The POTW may reissue a revoked permit upon a showing
satisfactory to the POTW Superintendent that the permittee has corrected the
violation or condition that led to the revocation. A person who has had a
permit revoked may apply for a new permit.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-52. LIMITATIONS ON PERMIT TRANSFER.

specific facility and operation and shall not be assigned or transferred or
sold to a new or different owner, operator, User, discharger, facility or
premises, or to a new or changed facility or operation, without the prior
written approval of the POTW. If the transfer of a permit is approved, any
succeeding transferee permittee must also comply with the terms and conditions
of the existing permit. The POTW shall approve the transfer of a permit only if
all of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The transferor (permittee) shall give at least 60-days’ advance
notice to the POTW of the proposed transfer of the permit (unless a shorter
notice period is approved by the POTW in advance). The notice shall include a
written certification signed by the proposed transferee that (a) states that
the transferee has no present intent to change the facility’s operations and
processes; (b) identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur;
(c) acknowledges that the transferee has read and fully understands all terms
and conditions of the permit; and (d) acknowledges that the transferee accepts
all of the terms and conditions of the permit as written and accepts full
responsibility for complying with the existing permit if the transfer is
approved.
      2.   As of the date of the proposed transfer, there are no unpaid
charges, fines, penalties or fees of any kind due to the POTW from the
transferor or the transferee related to use of the POTW.
      3.   Except as to the identity of the new discharger (the transferee),
the application materials for the permit to be transferred as originally filed
by the transferor, as well as the terms and conditions of the permit itself,
are completely accurate with respect to, and fully applicable to, the
discharge, facilities, and activities of the transferee.
      4.   The permit transfer fee as established by the POTW has been paid to
the city.
   B.   If the transfer of a permit is approved and the permit transfer fee has

the permit to show the transferee as the permittee, and a copy of the permit
shall be provided to the transferee for signature and certification by the
transferee as provided by § 
35-68 of this chapter. The transferor (permittee) shall remain liable for any
discharges to the POTW from the facility (along with any other persons actually
discharging from the facility to the POTW) until a transfer of the permit has
been approved as provided by this section.
   C.   This section is not intended to, and shall not be construed to, limit
in any way the transfer of ownership of the property involved.
   D.   Any attempt to transfer a user permit that does not comply with the
requirements of this section renders the permit void as of the date of the
invalid transfer.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-53. DUTY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION.
   Users shall furnish to the POTW any available information that the POTW
requests to determine whether cause exists for modifying, revoking and
reissuing, or terminating a User Permit, to determine compliance with a permit,
to determine whether a permit is required, or as otherwise determined necessary
by the POTW. Users shall also, upon request, furnish to the POTW copies of any
records required to be kept by a permit. The information and records requested
by the POTW shall be provided by the user to the POTW within 24 hours of the
request, unless an alternative time frame is specified by the POTW when making
the request or unless the POTW allows additional time for the user to submit
the requested information based on a showing by the user of good cause for any
delay. The user’s failure to submit the requested information to the POTW
within 24 hours (or within any alternate time period approved by the POTW as
provided by this section) shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-54. PERMIT APPEALS.
   Except as otherwise provided by this section, an appeal to the Wastewater
Board of Appeals (WBA) of any final decision made by the POTW Superintendent in
connection with issuing or implementing a user permit shall be governed by
Article XVIII of this chapter. An appealing party must specify in its notice of
appeal the action of the POTW being appealed and the grounds for the appeal. If
a particular permit provision is objected to, the notice of appeal must specify
the reasons for the objection, and the alternative provision, if any, sought to
be placed in the permit. The effectiveness of a permit or any final decision
made by the POTW Superintendent shall not be stayed pending a decision by the
WBA. If, after considering the record on appeal including any statements
provided by the POTW in response to the appeal, the WBA determines that a
permit or any provision of a permit should be reconsidered, the WBA shall
remand the matter to the POTW Superintendent for further action as determined
appropriate by the WBA. Specific provisions of a permit that are remanded by
the WBA for reconsideration by the POTW Superintendent shall be stayed pending
further final action taken by the POTW Superintendent as required by the
decision of the WBA. A decision of the WBA not to remand any matter shall be
considered final administrative action for purposes of judicial review.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-55. PERMITS NOT STAYED.
   Except as otherwise expressly provided by § 
35-54, no action taken or request filed by any permittee shall operate to stay
the effect of any permit or of any provision, term or condition of any permit,
including, without limitation, a request for permit modification, reissuance,
or transfer, or a notification of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance.

Sec. 35-57. REPORTING AND NOTICE REQUIREMENTS; COMPLIANCE
   All users shall comply with the minimum reporting and notice requirements
provided by this article, as follows.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-58. REPORTS BY NONDOMESTIC USERS REGARDING CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT
STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   A.   Baseline monitoring reports. Within 180 days after the effective date
of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final
administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under MAC
R 323.2311(2) whichever is later, an existing nondomestic user subject to the
categorical pretreatment standards and that currently discharges or is
scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit a report to the POTW as
required by MAC R 323.2310(2). At least 90 days prior to commencement of
discharge, new sources, and sources that become nondomestic users subsequent to
the promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall
submit the reports to the POTW as required by MAC R 323.2310(2). Any changes to
the information required to be submitted by a nondomestic user pursuant to MAC
R 323.2310(2)(a) through (e) shall be submitted by the user to the POTW within
60 days of when the user becomes aware of the change.
   B.   Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline.
Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standard or, in the case of a new source, following
commencement of the discharge to the POTW, any nondomestic user subject to
categorical pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit the reports to
the POTW required by MAC R 323.2310(3).
   C.   Periodic reports on continued compliance. Any nondomestic user subject
to a categorical pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of the
categorical pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source, after
commencement of the discharge into the public sewer or POTW, shall submit the
periodic reports to the POTW required by MAC R 323.2310(4). These periodic
reports shall be submitted at least once every six months (during the months of
June and December unless alternate months are approved by the POTW), unless
required more frequently by the applicable pretreatment standard, by the POTW,
or by the state. The reports shall include a record of all average and maximum
daily flows during the prior six-month reporting period, except that the POTW
may require more detailed reporting of flows. All flows shall be reported on
the basis of actual measurement unless the POTW Superintendent agrees, due to
cost or nonfeasibility, to accept verifiable estimates of the average and
maximum flows estimated using techniques approved by the POTW Superintendent.
The combined wastestream formula may be used for reporting purposes after the
initial information has been furnished to the POTW, provided there has been no
change to the elements composing the combined wastestream. The results of
sampling of the discharge and analysis of pollutants appearing in the report
shall be cross-referenced to the related flow and mass to determine compliance
with National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. In cases where the
pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (or
pollution prevention alternative), the user shall submit documentation required
by the POTW Superintendent or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine
the compliance status of the user.

and analysis performed in the period covered by the report in accordance with
the sampling, analysis and monitoring requirements provided by Article IX of
this chapter.
   B.   For significant industrial users, the reports shall be submitted at
least once every six months for the preceding six months (during the months of
April and October unless alternate months are specified by the POTW
Superintendent), unless required more frequently by the POTW Superintendent.
   C.   If required by the POTW Superintendent for nondomestic users other than
significant industrial users, the reports shall be submitted at least once
every 12 months for the preceding 12 months (during the month of October unless
an alternate month is specified by the POTW Superintendent), unless required
more frequently by the POTW Superintendent.
   D.   The reports for all nondomestic users shall be submitted on forms
provided by (or in a format required by) the POTW, and shall include, without
limitation, the volume of wastewater; the concentration of pollutants; the
names of all person(s) responsible for operating and maintaining any
pretreatment equipment, pretreatment processes, or responsible for wastewater
management at the user’s facilities, with a brief description of each person’s
duties; information regarding materials or substances that may cause
interference or pass through; and any other information deemed necessary by the
POTW Superintendent to assess and assure compliance with applicable discharge
requirements or to safeguard the operation of the POTW.

Sec. 35-60. NOTICE BY USER OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.
   All nondomestic users, whether or not subject to categorical pretreatment
standards, shall notify the POTW immediately by telephone of all discharges by
the user that could cause problems to the POTW, including, without limitation,
accidental discharges, slug loadings, discharges of a non-routine, episodic
nature, non-customary batch discharge, or discharges that exceed a discharge
prohibition or limitation provided by this chapter. The notification shall
include available information regarding the location of the discharge, its
volume, duration, constituents, loading and concentrations, corrective actions
taken and required, and other available information as necessary to determine
what impact the discharge may have on the POTW. A detailed written report
providing the same and any additional available information (including
specifying the measures that will be taken by the user to prevent similar
future discharges) shall also be provided by the user to be received by the
POTW Superintendent within five days of the incident.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-61. NOTICE BY USER OF VIOLATION OF PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall notify

including, without limitation, the hazardous wastes for which the user has
submitted initial notification under § 
35-63 of this chapter.
      5.   The discharge of any ground waters purged for a removal or remedial
action.
      6.   The discharge of any pollutants that are present in the discharge
due to infiltration.
      7.   A change in discharge that may convert a nondomestic user into a
significant industrial user, or a nondomestic user into a categorical user.
      8.   A change in discharge that would cause a change in the categorical
standards that apply to the user.
   D.   In determining whether to accept any changed discharge, or, if so,
under what conditions, the POTW Superintendent shall evaluate the changed
discharge pursuant to the general and specific discharge prohibitions under § 
35-30 and other applicable provisions of this chapter. The user may be required
to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of a user permit application.
   E.   No user shall implement the planned changed conditions until and unless
the POTW Superintendent or his or her designee has responded to the user’s
notice.

ARTICLE IX. SAMPLING, ANALYSIS, AND MONITORING
Sec. 35-69. SAMPLING, ANALYSIS, AND MONITORING; REQUIREMENTS.
   This article provides the sampling, analysis and monitoring requirements
applicable to users of the POTW. It does not apply to domestic users except as
may be determined appropriate in specific cases by the POTW. All users required
by this chapter (or by any permit, order, decision or determination issued or
made under this chapter) to sample, monitor and analyze their discharges to the
POTW shall do so according to the minimum requirements provided by this
article. Additional or more restrictive sampling, analytical or monitoring
requirements may be required for a particular user by a permit, order, decision
or determination issued or made under this chapter.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-70. SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES.
   All sampling, measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of
discharges to the POTW shall be performed in accordance with the procedures
approved by the U.S. EPA contained in 40 C.F.R. Part 136. If, as determined by
the POTW Superintendent, the sampling and analytical techniques contained in 40
C.F.R. Part 136 are not available, do not apply to the discharge or pollutants
in question, are not appropriate under the circumstances for application to the
discharge or pollutants in question, or where one or more alternate techniques
are available under 40 C.F.R. Part 136, sampling and analysis shall be
performed using validated sampling and analytical methods and procedures
approved or required by the POTW Superintendent.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-71. SAMPLING FREQUENCY.
   Users shall sample their discharges to the POTW at a frequency necessary to
assess and assure compliance with the requirements of this chapter, any permit
or order issued pursuant to this chapter, all applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements, other applicable state and federal laws and regulations, or
as otherwise determined necessary by the POTW Superintendent consistent with
the purposes and intent of this chapter. At a minimum, all significant
industrial users shall sample their effluent two times per year (once every six
months) or as often as provided by their permits, whichever is more frequent,
and report the results to the POTW. Each discharge point to the POTW shall be
sampled and reported individually.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-72. SAMPLE TYPES.
   A.   Where representative samples are required to be taken for facilities
for which historical sampling data does not exist (or if otherwise requested by
the POTW Superintendent), a user shall take a minimum of four grab samples for
pH, temperature, cyanide, phenols (T), residual chlorine, oil and grease,
sulfide, and volatile organics (and any other parameters designated by the POTW
Superintendent), unless a greater number of grab samples is required in advance
by the POTW Superintendent. For facilities for which historical sampling data
is available, or under other circumstances determined appropriate by the POTW
Superintendent, the Superintendent may authorize a lower minimum number of grab
samples. In all cases, users shall take the minimum number of grab samples
determined necessary by the POTW Superintendent to assess and assure compliance
by users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. Grab samples
may be required to show compliance with instantaneous minimum or instantaneous
maximum discharge limits. For all other pollutants and sampling, 24-hour
composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the POTW Superintendent. Where time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW Superintendent, the samples
must be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the
alternative sampling must be documented in the user file for that facility or
facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in
40 C.F.R. Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples
collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as
follows: For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited
in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil & grease the
samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved
EPA methodologies may be authorized by the POTW Superintendent, as appropriate.
   B.   The POTW Superintendent may require any user (categorical or non-
categorical) to conduct continuous pH monitoring instead of using grab samples.
A user required to conduct continuous monitoring will be subject to enforcement
under § 35-117H..
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-73. SAMPLING METHODS, EQUIPMENT AND LOCATION.
   A.   General. A user shall use the sampling methods, sampling equipment, and
sampling location specified by the user’s user permit, or, in the absence of a
permit, as otherwise required by the POTW Superintendent.
   B.   Contaminated groundwater. For discharges to the POTW from remedial
actions related to leaking underground storage tanks or other sources of
contaminated groundwater, the POTW Superintendent may require the following
analyses or such other analyses as determined appropriate by the
Superintendent:
      1.   Samples shall be analyzed for benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and
xylene using the latest methods approved by U.S. EPA.
      2.   For total petroleum hydrocarbons, samples shall be analyzed
according to the latest methods approved by U.S. EPA.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-74. COSTS OF MONITORING, SAMPLING AND ANALYSES.
   All required monitoring, taking of samples, and sample analyses, whether
performed by the POTW or by a user, including, but not limited to, the costs or
fees associated with inspection or surveillance, shall be at the sole cost of
the user.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-75. SELF-MONITORING.
   A.   Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, self-monitoring shall be
conducted by each nondomestic user to insure compliance with all applicable
requirements of this chapter and other applicable laws and regulations.
   B.   A user performing its own sampling shall submit the samples for
analysis to a laboratory (which may include the user’s own laboratory) approved
by the POTW Superintendent.
   C.   A user performing its own sampling or monitoring shall record and
maintain for all samples and monitoring (including any sampling and monitoring
associated with best management practices) the date, exact location (which
shall match sampling locations identified in the user’s user permit, as
applicable), time (including start time and stop time) and method of sampling
or measurement, and the name(s) of person(s) taking the samples or
measurements; sampler programming information; the sample preservation
techniques or procedures used; the full chain-of-custody for each sample; the
dates the analyses were performed and completed; who performed the analyses;
the analytical techniques and methods used; the detection limits and/or
quantification level used per parameter; quality assurance/quality control (QA/
QC) procedures used and QA/QC data; and the results of the analyses.
   D.   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall
notify the POTW Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the POTW within 30 days after becoming aware
of the violation. If the POTW has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu
of the user, the POTW must perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless the
POTW notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the
repeat sampling and analysis. The user shall not be required to resample if (a)
the POTW performs sampling at the user at a frequency of at least once per
month, or (b) the POTW performs sampling at the user between the time when the
user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user or the POTW
receives the results of the sampling that indicates the violation.
   E.   If a user uses its own laboratory for sample analysis, the POTW
Superintendent may require the user to send split samples to an independent
laboratory at a frequency specified by the Superintendent as a quality control
check.
   F.   Users required to do monthly sampling shall submit sample results to
the POTW Superintendent by the tenth day of the following month, unless
specified otherwise in the user’s user permit.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-76. SAMPLING AND ANALYSES PERFORMED BY POTW.
   A.   The sampling and analysis required by this chapter may be performed by
the POTW instead of the user, as determined necessary by the POTW
Superintendent for purposes of this chapter. The POTW shall provide the user
with copies of analytical results prepared by the POTW. If the results of any
sampling and analysis performed by the POTW instead of the user show that a
pretreatment standard has been violated, the POTW shall provide the user with
copies of the analytical results within ten days after the results are
available.
   B.   If the POTW performs the required sampling and analysis for a user, the
user shall pay a sampling fee to the POTW to fully reimburse the POTW for the
sampling, including administrative and overhead costs. The POTW may contract
with an independent firm to perform the sampling and analysis and the user
shall fully reimburse the POTW for amounts paid by the POTW to the independent
firm.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-77. SPLIT SAMPLES AND SAMPLE RESULTS.
   A.   If requested by the POTW, the POTW shall be provided with splits of any
sample taken by a user. The user shall provide splits to the POTW at no cost to
the POTW.
   B.   If requested by a user prior to the collection of a sample of the
user’s discharge, the POTW shall leave a portion of the sample of the discharge
taken from any sampling point on or adjacent to the premises for the user’s
independent analysis.   
   C.   In cases of disputes arising over split samples, the portion taken and
analyzed by the POTW shall be controlling unless proven invalid. The burden of
proving the POTW’s results invalid shall be on the user and at the user’s sole
cost.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-78. MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND CALIBRATION OF EQUIPMENT .
   A.   A user who performs self-monitoring shall contract with an independent
company (unless the requirement to use an independent company is waived in
advance by the POTW Superintendent as determined appropriate by the
Superintendent) to maintain, repair, and calibrate the sampling and flow
measurement equipment and instruments used to monitor the user.
   B.   The maintenance, repair, and calibration shall be performed as often as
necessary to ensure that monitoring data is accurate and representative, and
consistent with the accepted capability of the type of equipment used, and
shall be at the sole cost of the user.
   C.   A user shall keep a complete and accurate written record of all
calibrations, inspections and maintenance done (including, without limitation,
the date and time of the activity, a description of what was done and the
methods used, the names of persons conducting the activity, and any required or
recommended follow-up). The record shall also include a description of all
problems discovered regarding the equipment whether in response to a regularly
scheduled inspection or otherwise.
   D.   The POTW, in any event, may inspect and test a user’s sampling and flow
measurement equipment and instruments at all times.
   E.   In no case shall a user’s failure to keep its equipment, instruments
and facilities in good working order constitute grounds for the user to claim
that sample results are not representative of its discharge.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-79. REQUIRED SAMPLING STRUCTURES AND DEVICES.
   A.   The POTW may require any user to install suitable control structures
(such as sampling manholes or sampling vaults) and necessary measuring and
sampling devices (including automatic devices) to facilitate the observation,
sampling, and measurement of the quantity, composition, and concentrations of
discharges to the POTW. The POTW may require the user to install control
structures and measuring and sampling devices at every discharge point and/or
outfall. Further, multiple separate and discrete building sewers, control
structures, and measuring and sampling devices may be required for a single
user, premises, building, facility or user, as determined necessary by the POTW
Superintendent. The structures and devices shall be maintained at all times in
a safe, clean and proper operating condition at the sole expense of the user.
   B.   There shall be ample room in or near the control structure to allow
accurate monitoring, measuring, sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis, as determined necessary by the POTW Superintendent. At a minimum, all
sewers shall have an inspection and sampling manhole or structure with an
opening of no less than 24 inches in diameter and an internal diameter of no
less than 36 inches containing flow measuring, recording and sampling equipment
as required by the POTW Superintendent to assure compliance with this chapter.
   C.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction for safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the verbal or written request of the POTW and shall not be replaced. The
costs of clearing such access shall be borne solely by the user.
   D.   The location and complexity of the required control structure or
devices may vary with sampling requirements determined necessary by the POTW
Superintendent to protect the POTW and to comply with applicable laws and
regulations.
   E.   The required sampling structures and devices shall be constructed and
installed at the user’s sole expense in accordance with plans submitted to the
POTW, and in compliance with all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Users shall submit to the POTW plans and specifications for
construction or modification of monitoring facilities at least 30 days before
the proposed commencement of construction or modification. If a user constructs
or modifies monitoring facilities before POTW approval or without an inspection
during construction and the POTW determines that the monitoring facilities are
not acceptable, then the user shall at its cost reconstruct or modify the
monitoring facilities according to the requirements of the POTW. Construction
shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by the POTW,
or within such other shorter or longer time period specified by the POTW
Superintendent as required by the particular circumstances to meet the
requirements of this chapter. The structures and devices shall be operated and
maintained by the user at the user’s sole expense so as to be safe and
accessible to POTW personnel at all times and so as to provide accurate and
representative monitoring data. If a user fails to install or maintain a
required structure or device, the POTW may do so and charge the costs to the
user. No person shall use a required control structure for any purpose other
than the sampling and monitoring activities specifically approved by the POTW.
   F.   The sampling structures and devices must be provided on the user’s
premises as approved by the POTW, but the POTW may, if it determines that such
a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship to the user, allow the
facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so
that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
   G.   Samples shall be taken at a control structure approved by the POTW.
However, in the absence of a suitable control structure as required by this
section, samples shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if pretreatment facilities exist, or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment facilities exist. If other wastewaters are
mixed with a regulated process wastestream prior to pretreatment, the user must
measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined
wastestream formula under MAC R 323.2311(7) or other methods required by the
POTW to evaluate compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements.
   H.   No user shall change monitoring points or monitoring methods without
first notifying and receiving the approval of the POTW Superintendent. The POTW
Superintendent shall not approve any change in a user’s monitoring point or
points that would allow the user to substitute dilution for adequate treatment
to achieve compliance with applicable standards.
   I.   A user shall allow the POTW access to all sampling and monitoring
facilities as provided by § 17(B) of this chapter.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-80.   DETERMINATION OF FLOW.
   The city may use any of the following methods, singly or in combination, to
determine the amount of wastewater flow discharged to the POTW from a user’s
premises, as determined appropriate by the city:
   A.   If the premises are metered, the amount of water supplied to the
premises by the city or a private water company as shown by the water meter;
   B.   If the premises are supplied with river water or water from private
wells, the city may estimate the amount of water supplied from such sources
based on the water, gas or electric supply to the premises;
   C.   If the premises are used for an industrial or commercial purpose of
such a nature that the water supplied to the premises cannot be (or is not)
entirely discharged to the POTW, the city may estimate the amount of amount of
wastewater discharged to the POTW based on the water, gas or electric supply to
the premises;
   D.   The city may determine the amount of wastewater discharged to the POTW
based on measurements and samples taken by the city from a manhole installed by
the owner of the premises, at the owner’s sole expense, as required by the city
under this chapter; or
   E.   The city may determine the amount of wastewater discharged to the POTW
from a premises using a combination of any of the above methods, or using any
other method determined appropriate by the city.

(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-111. ORDERS AND SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT TOOLS.
   The POTW Superintendent may issue an order to any person as determined by
the Superintendent to be appropriate under the circumstances, as provided by
this section. Multiple orders may be issued simultaneously or in combination as
a single order with respect to a single person.
   A.   Service. An order shall be served upon a person and shall contain the
information as provided by § 35-112 of this chapter. However, orders to
immediately cease and desist discharge, or to terminate sewer services, or
other emergency orders where delay might endanger human health, the
environment, or the POTW, may be oral and may be served by telephone, to be
followed within five days by written confirmation of the oral order by the POTW
Superintendent.
   B.   Types of orders. The POTW Superintendent may issue the following types
of orders:
      1.   Order to immediately cease and desist discharge. The POTW
Superintendent may issue an order to cease and desist from discharging any
wastewater, pollutant, or discharge not in compliance with this chapter. The
order shall have immediate effect if the POTW Superintendent determines that
the actual or threatened discharge to the POTW presents, or may present,
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to
the environment; or causes, or may cause, interference or pass through; or may
cause the POTW to violate any term or condition of its NPDES permit. The POTW
Superintendent shall implement whatever action is necessary to halt or prevent
the discharge, including, but not limited to, emergency suspension of service.
The person shall be assessed for any penalties, fines, charges, surcharges,
expenses, or losses incurred due to the actual or threatened discharge of
pollutants as provided by this chapter.
      2.   Order to cease discharge within a time certain. The POTW
Superintendent may issue an order to cease and desist from discharging any
wastewater, pollutant, or discharge not in compliance with this chapter by a
certain time and date. The proposed time for remedial action shall be specified
in the order. In addition to any other circumstances as determined appropriate
by the POTW Superintendent, an order may be issued under this section for the
failure to pay applicable permit fees or to comply with any term of a user
permit.
      3.   Order to effect pretreatment. The POTW Superintendent may issue an
order to a user requiring the user to pretreat its discharge in accordance with
this chapter. Any user subject to an order to pretreat shall prepare a plan to
pretreat its discharge so that the discharge complies with the requirements of
the order and this chapter. The plan shall be submitted to the POTW
Superintendent within a reasonable period as specified in the order. The plan
shall be prepared in accordance with good engineering practice and shall state
whether construction is necessary, as well as identify measures that can be
completed without construction. The plan shall contain a schedule of compliance
for completion of each of the various phases necessary to implement full
pretreatment. The schedule of compliance must be approved by the POTW
Superintendent. The schedule of compliance shall consist of one or more
remedial measures, including enforceable timetables for a sequence of actions
or operations leading to compliance with an effluent standard, or other
prohibition or standard. The following steps or phases shall be included in the
schedule of compliance as determined necessary by the POTW Superintendent:
         a.   Retain a qualified engineer and/or consultant.
         b.   Obtain any engineering or scientific investigation or surveys
deemed necessary.
         c.   Prepare and submit a preliminary plan to achieve pretreatment.
         d.   Prepare plans and specifications, working drawings, or other
engineering or architectural documents that may be necessary to effect
pretreatment.
         e.   Establish a time to let any contract necessary for any
construction.
         f.   Establish completion times for any construction necessary.
         g.   Establish a time limit to complete full pretreatment pursuant to
the final order.
         h.   If a phase or unit of construction or implementation may be
effected independently of another phase or unit, establish separate timetables
for the phases or unit.
      4.   Order to affirmatively respond. The POTW Superintendent may issue an
order requiring a person to perform any action required under this chapter,
including, without limitation, requiring a person to submit samples; to install
sampling, metering and monitoring equipment; to submit reports; to permit
access for inspection, sampling, testing, monitoring and investigations; to
reduce or eliminate a discharge or pollutants in a discharge; or to pay permit
fees or other applicable charges.
      5.   Order to terminate sewer services. The POTW Superintendent may issue
an order to terminate the sewer services of a user, including, but not limited
to, immediate physical blockage of the user’s sewer connection, for reasons
including, without limitation, the following:
         a.   A discharge that violates any general or specific discharge
prohibition, including any pretreatment standard or requirement, and that
reasonably appears to present an imminent endangerment to human health, the
environment or the POTW.
         b.   Failure of a user to notify the POTW of any discharge as
described in § 
35-111B.5.a. of which the user was aware or reasonably should have been aware.
         c.   Failure of a user to sample, monitor, pretreat or report, or
failure to install monitoring or pretreatment facilities, as required by an
order of the POTW Superintendent.
         d.   A knowing, willful violation of any term, condition or
requirement of an order or user permit, or any provision of this chapter.
         e.   A negligent violation of any major term, condition or requirement
of an order or user permit. For purposes of this section, a MAJOR TERM,
CONDITION or REQUIREMENT is one the violation of which is reasonably likely to
endanger human health, the environment, the POTW, or cause the POTW to violate
its NPDES permit.
      6.   Physical blockage. If the POTW Superintendent determines that
physical blockage is necessary, the POTW shall make a reasonable attempt to
deliver to the person who appears to be in control of the user’s facility a
written notice describing the reason for the physical blockage order. After
delivery of the notice (or after a reasonable attempt to deliver the notice,
even if delivery was unsuccessful), the POTW may immediately install the
physical blockage. No person shall remove or tamper with a physical blockage
installed by the POTW without prior written permission from the city.
      7.   Order to show cause. The POTW Superintendent may issue an order
requiring a person to appear and explain any noncompliance with the
requirements of this chapter or any permit, order, decision or determination
promulgated, issued or made under this chapter, and to show cause why more
severe enforcement actions against the person should not go forward. A show
cause hearing shall be held within ten days after the order to show cause is
issued, as follows:
         a.   The Wastewater Board of Appeals shall conduct the hearing and
take evidence. Notice of the hearing shall be provided to require the
attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant
to any matter involved in the hearing.
         b.   Any testimony taken at the hearing shall be under oath and
recorded. A copy of the transcript of the hearing shall be made available at
cost to any person upon payment of applicable charges for the transcript.
         c.   After reviewing the evidence taken at the hearing, the Wastewater
Board of Appeals shall decide whether further enforcement action is required
and, if so, the nature and extent of that further action, including, without
limitation, the issuance of any order or imposition of any fines, fees,
surcharges or penalties, as authorized by this chapter.
   C.   Immediate response to order by user may be required. Any user issued an
order as provided by this section to immediately suspend its discharge to the
POTW shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge using whatever means are
necessary to do so, or take any other action as required by the order. If the
user fails to comply voluntarily with the order to immediately suspend its
discharge, the POTW shall take any action determined necessary as authorized by
this chapter, including, without limitation, immediate suspension of water
service and/or severance of the sewer connection or commencement of judicial
proceedings, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW or endangerment to
public health, safety or the environment. The POTW may reinstate the wastewater
treatment service and terminate any judicial proceedings, as applicable, upon
satisfactory proof or other demonstration by the user that the noncomplying
discharge has been eliminated or will not reoccur. A detailed written statement
submitted by the User describing the causes of the noncomplying discharge and
the measures taken to prevent any further occurrence shall be submitted to the
POTW Superintendent within 15 days of the occurrence.
   D.   Noncompliance due to factors beyond user’s control. If noncompliance
with an order is unintentional and temporary and due to factors beyond the
reasonable control of a user, and the user can demonstrate the conditions
necessary for demonstration of an upset as provided by § 
35-90A., the POTW Superintendent may modify the order or take other actions as
determined appropriate. However, a user shall not be relieved of liability for
noncompliance with an order to the extent caused by operational error,
improperly designed or inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative
maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
   E.   Amendment, suspension and revocation of orders. An order shall be
subject to amendment, suspension or revocation as determined appropriate by the
POTW Superintendent. Notice of the amendment, suspension or revocation shall be
served upon the person in the same manner as notice was provided for the
original order. An amendment, suspension or revocation of an order shall be
subject to the same procedures for review and appeal as the original issuance
of the order, as provided by this chapter.
   F.   Consent orders and agreements. The POTW Superintendent may enter into a
consent order or agreement with a person to resolve disputed claims and address
identified and potential deficiencies in the person’s compliance status. The
order or agreement shall be in the form of a written agreement with the person
and may contain appropriate provisions, including, without limitation,
compliance schedules and stipulated fines and remedial actions.
   G.   POTW authority to require financial assurances. The POTW may require
any user to post a performance bond (or other form of surety acceptable to the
POTW Superintendent) sufficient to cover expenses (direct and/or indirect) that
might reasonably be incurred by the POTW as a result of the user’s discharges
to the POTW (including, but not limited to, the costs to restore or repair any
damage to the POTW) or sufficient to achieve consistent compliance with
applicable laws and regulations, as determined necessary by the POTW
Superintendent. Further, any person that has in the prior two years been
responsible for causing interference or pass through at the POTW may be
required to obtain liability insurance sufficient to cover the reasonable costs
of responding or restoring the POTW in the event of a second such incident.
These financial assurance requirements may also be made conditions of a user
permit.

provision of this chapter (including, without limitation, any notice, order,
permit, decision or determination promulgated, issued or made by the POTW under
this chapter) is responsible for a municipal civil infraction, subject to
payment of a civil fine of not less than $1,000 per day for each infraction and
not more than $10,000 per day for each infraction, plus costs and other
sanctions.
   B.   Repeat offenses; increased fines. Increased fines may be imposed for
repeat offenses. As used in this section, REPEAT OFFENSE means a second (or any
subsequent) municipal civil infraction violation of the same requirement or
provision of this chapter (i) committed by a person within any 90-day period
and (ii) for which the person admits responsibility or is determined to be
responsible. The increased fine for a repeat offense under this chapter shall
be as follows:
      1.   The fine for any offense that is a first repeat offense shall be not
less than $2,500, plus costs.
      2.   The fine for any offense that is a second repeat offense or any
subsequent repeat offense shall be not less than $5,000, plus costs.
   C.   Amount of fines. Subject to the minimum fine amounts specified in
§§ 35-114A. and B., the following factors shall be considered by the court in
determining the amount of a municipal civil infraction fine following the
issuance of a municipal civil infraction citation for a violation of this
chapter: the type, nature, severity, frequency, duration, preventability,
potential and actual effect, and economic benefit to the violator (such as
delayed or avoided costs or competitive advantage) of a violation; the
violator’s recalcitrance or efforts to comply; the economic impacts of the fine
on the violator; and such other matters as justice may require. A violator
shall bear the burden of demonstrating the presence and degree of any
mitigating factors to be considered in determining the amount of a fine.
However, mitigating factors shall not be considered unless it is determined
that the violator has made all good faith efforts to correct and terminate all
violations.

pollutant or substance was discharged contrary to any provision of this
chapter, or contrary to any notice, order, permit, decision or determination
promulgated, issued or made by the POTW under this chapter; or
      2.   Intentionally makes a false statement, representation, or

Sec. 35-116. CONTINUING VIOLATION.
   Each act of violation, and each day or portion of a day that a violation of
this chapter (or of any permit, order, notice or agreement issued or entered
into under this chapter) exists or occurs, constitutes a separate violation
subject to the fines, penalties and other sanctions and remedies as provided by
this chapter.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-117. NUMBER OF VIOLATIONS.
   The number of violations resulting from a user’s noncompliance with
applicable discharge prohibitions or effluent limitations shall be determined
as follows:
   A.   Applicable concentration limitations and mass (or loading) limitations
shall be treated as separate limitations, and a user may be liable and
penalized separately for exceeding any of those limitations for a single
pollutant or sampling parameter.
   B.   Each violation of a daily maximum limit for a single pollutant or
sampling parameter shall constitute a separate violation for each day on which
the violation occurs or continues.
   C.   Each violation of an instantaneous minimum or instantaneous maximum
limit for a single pollutant or sampling parameter shall constitute a separate
violation for each such occurrence, and there may be multiple violations for
each day on which such a violation occurs or continues.
   D.   Each violation of a monthly average limit (or of some other average
limit period) for a single pollutant or sampling parameter shall constitute a
separate violation for each day of the month (or other stated period) during
which the violation occurred, regardless of the number of days on which samples
were actually taken. (For example, in a month with 31 days, a violation of the
monthly average limit for that month constitutes 31 violations for each
pollutant parameter for which the monthly average limit was exceeded during the
month.)
   E.   Except with regard to violations of average limits as provided by § 35-
117D., a violation will be deemed to have continued to occur each day beginning
with the first day the violation occurred to the day the user is able to
demonstrate through appropriate sampling results that the violation is no
longer occurring.
   F.   If for any period a user has violated both a daily maximum limit and an
average limit for a particular pollutant parameter, then the total number of
violations is the sum of the days on which the daily maximum limit was violated
plus the number of days in the averaging period.
   G.   If a user permit regulates more than one outfall, each outfall shall be
considered separately in computing the number of violations as provided by this
section.
284   Plainwell - Code of Ordinances
   H.   If a user is discharging a wastestream that is required to be monitored
and analyzed under continuous monitoring procedures (such as for pH or any
other parameter that is required to be monitored and analyzed under continuous
monitoring) then all of the following shall apply:
      1.   If at any time during a daily 24-hour period the continuous
monitoring shows that the monitored parameter exceeded the instantaneous
minimum, instantaneous maximum, or daily maximum limit for that parameter, then
a violation has occurred.
      2.   If during a daily 24-hour period under continuous monitoring the
monitored parameter exceeds the instantaneous minimum, instantaneous maximum,
or daily maximum limit more than once after returning to compliance during that
period, then each such exceedence shall be considered a separate violation.
      3.   If during a daily 24-hour period under continuous monitoring the
monitored parameter exceeds the instantaneous minimum, instantaneous maximum,
or daily limit into the next daily 24-hour period (i.e., the exceedence occurs
both before and after midnight), then the exceedence will be considered a
separate violation on both days.
      4.   If during a daily 24-hour period under continuous monitoring the
monitored parameter exceeds instantaneous minimum, instantaneous maximum, or
the daily limit for more than 66% of the 24-hour, as determined in minutes of
the day, then the user will be considered to be in significant non-compliance.
   I.   One violation occurs on: each day that a report is late; and each day
after an action required to be completed is not completed.

and enforcing the requirements of this chapter.
      2.   Further, the POTW is authorized to correct any violation of this
chapter or damage or impairment to the POTW caused by a discharge and to bill
the person causing the violation or discharge for the amounts to be reimbursed.
The costs reimbursable under this section shall be in addition to fees, amounts
or other costs and expenses required to be paid by users under other sections
of this chapter.
   B.   In determining the amounts to be reimbursed, the POTW may consider
factors such as, but not limited to, the following:

assessed to the user as provided by § 35-112 of this chapter, or as otherwise
determined appropriate by the POTW Superintendent in conjunction with an
enforcement action.
   D.   The failure by any person to pay any amounts required to be reimbursed
to the POTW as provided by this section shall constitute an additional
violation of this chapter.

Sec. 35-120. REVIEW OR APPROVAL BY CITY.
   In no case shall the review and/or approval by the city of a user’s plans,
specifications or operating procedures entitle a user to relief from
enforcement actions for failure to achieve compliance with the applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements.

Sec. 35-137. USER CHARGE SYSTEM.
   A.   The City Council shall adopt from time-to-time by resolution a user
charge system to establish the user charges as determined necessary and
appropriate by the City Council to pay the operation and maintenance costs
(including replacement costs), and such other costs and expenses that are or
may be incurred by the city in connection with the city’s ownership and
operation of the POTW, and to pay any other POTW-related costs and expenses
that may otherwise be required by applicable local, state, and federal laws and
regulations, or POTW-related financial obligations such as debt service.
   B.   The user charge system may include commodity charges, readiness-to-
serve charges, and such other charge components and other provisions as
determined necessary and appropriate by the City Council to meet the purposes
and intent of this article and this chapter, consistent with applicable laws
and regulations.
   C.   The specific rates, rate methodologies, and rate policies and
procedures for user charges as applicable to users (or user classes) shall be
established from time-to-time by resolution of the City Council.
   D.   User charges established by the City Council and levied on users may be
based on a user’s actual or estimated flow (volume and/or rate), actual or
estimated wastewater strength, and such other factors determined necessary and
appropriate by the City Council. The City Council may also establish user
classes to which user charges are applied, including, but not limited to, user
classes that distinguish between domestic and nondomestic users and/or
subclasses thereof (such as residential, commercial, institutional, industrial,
and other subclasses).
   E.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, in
situations where user charges are to be based on estimated wastewater flow and/
or wastewater strength for a particular user (or user class), the following
methodologies may apply (singly or in combination) as determined appropriate by
the city and consistent with the city’s then current rate methodologies,
policies and procedures:
      1.   The flow may be estimated by the city based on a user’s most recent
water meter reading (or most recent water meter reading for winter water use).
      2.   If no city water is available to a user or in other circumstances
determined appropriate by the City Council, the user’s flow may be estimated
based on a specified number of gallons per month per facility (or residential
equivalent) unit as determined by the city.
      3.   If a discharge meter has been installed for a user’s discharge, for
any period that the meter is not in operation or the user’s daily effluent flow
is not measured for any reason, the daily effluent flow for that period may be
deemed to be an amount equal to the average of the daily flow meter readings
for the prior 90 days on which reliable, accurate, and representative flow
meter readings were obtained, as determined by the POTW Superintendent.
      4.   Such other methodologies to estimate wastewater flow and/or strength
as determined appropriate and consistent with good utility practices by the
POTW Superintendent.
   F.   In lieu of estimated flows, and subject to approval (with or without
conditions) by the POTW Superintendent, a user may install a water meter to
measure the actual water consumption to calculate the applicable user charge.
All costs and expenses for and related to the installation, maintenance, and
calibration of water meter shall be paid for solely by the user.
   G.   As determined necessary and appropriate by the POTW Superintendent or
as otherwise required by a user permit, order, notice or agreement issued or
entered into under this chapter, a user may be required to install a water
meter and/or sampling and monitoring equipment or facilities to measure the
user’s actual wastewater flow and/or strength upon which the user charge shall
be based. All costs and expenses for and related to the installation,
maintenance, and calibration of the water meter and/or sampling and monitoring
equipment or facilities shall be paid for solely by the user.

charges determined appropriate by the City Council.
   A.   Wastewater treatment service charges. For discharges treated at the
POTW treatment plant, a wastewater treatment service charge shall be
established and levied based on the wastewater flow and/or strength and/or
other factors as determined appropriate by the City Council.
   B.   Surcharges. Surcharges shall be established and levied to reimburse the
POTW for all costs incurred by the POTW in handling or treating a discharge
that contains pollutants in excess of specified surcharge concentrations,
loadings or other applicable limits.
      1.   Any user exceeding applicable surcharge threshold limitations shall
be subject to the imposition of one or more surcharges as provided by this
section to reimburse the POTW for any costs or expenses, direct or indirect,
the POTW may incur in handling or treating the discharge, or which may be
imposed upon the city, where the exceedence of applicable limits causes or
contributes to those costs or expenses. These costs may include, but are not
limited to, the actual extra costs of treatment including chemical, equipment,
and personnel costs.
      2.   The amount of a surcharge shall be based on the surcharge rate
schedule prepared by the POTW Superintendent and approved from time-to-time by
resolution of the City Council, plus other costs and expenses as provided by
this section.
      3.   The applicable surcharge for a User shall be assessed for all
discharges during the entire period beginning with the first sample results
that exceed the surcharge threshold limit and continuing until statistically
significant sample results are obtained which do not exceed the surcharge
threshold limit, as determined by the POTW. To be considered statistically
significant, the user shall take a minimum of four samples over the three
consecutive months following any sample result that exceeds the surcharge
threshold limit, and shall continue such sampling until the expected value of
the mean of the sampling results is less than the applicable surcharge
threshold limit. The cost and responsibility to demonstrate that a discharge no
longer exceeds the surcharge threshold shall be borne solely by the user.
      4.   All exceedences of applicable discharge prohibitions and limitations
and all instances of noncompliance with applicable discharge requirements shall
constitute a violation of this chapter, subject to applicable fines, penalties
and other enforcement actions provided by this chapter. In no event shall the
imposition of a surcharge for a discharge which does not meet the applicable
prohibitions, limitations or requirements be construed as authorizing the
illegal discharge or otherwise excuse a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-139. READINESS-TO-SERVE CHARGE.
   A readiness-to-serve charge shall be established and levied by the city on
users of the POTW. The effective rate for RTS charges shall be calculated each
year by the city on the basis of the estimated need for the current year,
considering capital improvement plans and actual expenses incurred by the city
during the prior 12-month audit period, using the methodology as established
from time-to-time by resolution of the City Council.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-140. APPLICATION OF USER CHARGES.
   A.   Bulk metered discharges. For discharges from a user that are bulk
metered and treated at the city’s wastewater treatment plant, monthly user
charges shall be determined by applying the applicable commodity charge rates
to the monthly wastewater flow and strength characteristics from each bulk
metering station.
      1.   The confirmation of wastewater flow and the determination of
wastewater strength characteristics shall be performed by the user at least
twice each year under dry weather conditions during the months of May or June,
and October or November (or such other months as specified by the POTW
Superintendent) using representative samples and testing for sample parameters
as determined necessary by the POTW Superintendent, at the user’s sole cost.
      2.   The wastewater characteristics for each bulk metering station shall
be updated each year. Updated wastewater characteristics from May and June
sampling shall be used for monthly billings of July through December. Updated
wastewater characteristics from October and November shall be used for monthly
billings of January through June. If the POTW Superintendent requires (or the
User performs) additional wastewater sampling and analysis, then the cost of
such work shall be paid for by the user.
      3.   The city and the user may mutually agree to an alternate system of
determining wastewater characteristics if the alternate system is more accurate
and cost effective than the system described in this paragraph.
      4.   The specific methodology used for computing monthly user charges for
bulk metered flow shall be as established from time-to-time by resolution of
the City Council.
      5.   If an analysis of wastewater discharged by the user identifies any
strength characteristic in excess of normal strength domestic waste, then a
surcharge may be levied against the user by the city on any such excess
characteristic.
   B.   Individually metered discharges. If any discharge from a user is not
bulk metered, but is individually metered (such as at a user’s premises) and
passes through the city’s wastewater facilities, monthly user charges shall be
determined by applying the applicable commodity charge rates to the monthly
wastewater flow and strength characteristics of the individually metered
discharge.
      1.   The specific methodology used to compute user charges for
individually metered discharges shall be as established from time-to-time by
resolution of the City Council.
      2.   Except as otherwise specified by this chapter (or by any permit,
order, decision or determination issued or made under this chapter), users
shall follow the sampling, analysis, and monitoring requirements and procedures
as provided by Article IX of this chapter.
      3.   If an analysis of wastewater discharged from any user identifies any
strength characteristic in excess of normal strength domestic waste, then a
surcharge may be levied by the city against the user on any such excess
characteristic.
   C.   If any required meter fails, the meter shall be fixed or replaced at no
expense to the city by no more than 90 days from the date of the failure.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-141. RATES, CHARGES AND BILLING PROCEDURE.
   The amounts to be charged to users by the POTW under this chapter shall be
established from time-to-time by resolution of the City Council. All sums due
shall be billed according to a schedule established by resolution of the City
Council. If not paid within 15 days of due date, an additional charge equal to
10% of the total unpaid balance shall be added. Any delinquent bills with
penalties due the city (including any delinquent amounts determined to be
payable to the city under Sec. 4 of Article XI) shall be a lien against the
premises served and shall be spread on the next regular city tax roll. The lien
arising under this section shall be of the same effect as a lien created by
state and county taxes and collection shall be enforced in a like manner.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-142. USER CHARGE REVISIONS.
   A.   City to review. The City Council will review user wastewater
contributions, the total costs of operation and maintenance of the POTW, and
its user charge system, as provided by this section.
   B.   Purpose of review. The City Council will review and revise user charges
as determined necessary by the City Council to accomplish the following: (1)
maintain the proportionate distribution of operation and maintenance costs
among users and/or user classes; (2) generate sufficient revenue to pay the
total operation and maintenance costs necessary to the proper operation and
maintenance (including replacement) of the POTW; and (3) generate sufficient
revenue to pay for capital improvements and/or requirements of the POTW five-
year plan. The review process shall be conducted at least once every five
years.
   C.   User charge rates to be reviewed and amended. User charge rates shall
be reviewed and amended for the projected 12-month service period as determined
necessary by the City Council. Amendments to user charge rates shall be
determined following the applicable methodologies as established from time-to-
time by resolution of the City Council. If a User or the city identify a
substantive error in calculation or measurement of wastewater that has affected
the user charges, the party identifying the error shall present documentation
that confirms the error, and the city will either refund the amount of the
error or charge the correct amount to the user, as applicable. Either the
refund paid by the city to the user or the balance due from the user to the
city shall be paid prior to the first day of March in the year in which the
biennial review process is completed, unless other payment arrangements are
mutually agreed to by the city and the user. In no case shall the city issue a
refund to a user for any period in excess of the 12-month period that occurs
immediately prior to identification of an error confirmed by the city as
provided by this division.
   D.   Interim cost adjustments. User charges shall be adjusted by the city
based on revised budgets, as determined necessary by the city.
(Ord. 355, passed - -2010)
Sec. 35-143. NO FREE SERVICE.
   No free service, or service at less than cost, shall be furnished by the

ARTICLE XXIII. DISCHARGES FROM OTHER LOCAL
UNITS OF GOVERNMENT
Sec. 35-144. WASTEWATER TREATMENT SERVICE AGREEMENTS; LOCAL UNIT SEWER USE
ORDINANCES.
   A.   Any local unit of government, other than the city, that discharges into
the POTW (or that has users or premises located within the local unit that
discharge into the POTW) shall, as a condition to commencing and/or continuing
such discharges, meet all of the following requirements:
      1.   The local unit shall enter into a wastewater treatment service
agreement (WTSA) With the city that sets forth the terms, conditions, and
requirements applicable to current and future discharges from the local unit
(and from any user or premises located within the local unit) to the POTW, and
to the city’s acceptance and treatment of such discharges. The WTSA shall
specify the boundaries of the service district within the local unit that is
eligible to discharge to the POTW. No portion of a local unit’s service
district shall extend outside the political and/or geographical limits of the
local unit; provided that the city may agree to extend a local unit’s service
district to include specified areas located outside the local unit’s boundaries
if the local unit has jurisdiction and regulatory control over sewer service
related matters outside its boundaries (such as through a valid, enforceable
agreement under Public Act 425 of 1984) as determined sufficient by the city,
subject to any terms and conditions as determined necessary by the city to
enable the city to fully meet it’s obligations under applicable laws and
regulations regarding the city’s POTW and the city’s NPDES permit. If a local
unit’s service district is allowed to extend outside the local unit’s
boundaries as provided by this section, the local unit’s WTSA shall, as a
condition to commencing or continuing discharges from the extended service
district to the POTW, be amended accordingly to specify and delineate the
extended service district.
      2.   The local unit shall adopt, and keep continually in force and up-to-
date, an ordinance that, except as specifically provided by this subdivision,
shall be identical to the sewer use regulations as provided by this chapter
(and as this chapter is amended from time to time by the city). (If the local
unit does not have authority to adopt an ordinance, the local unit shall
instead adopt regulations or other provisions with the force of law that meet
the requirements of this subdivision otherwise applicable to a local unit’s
ordinance, as determined sufficient by the city.)
         a.   The ordinance adopted by the local unit (the “local unit’s sewer
use ordinance”) shall expressly designate, empower and authorize the city to
act as the agent and representative of the local unit for purposes of
administering and enforcing the local unit’s sewer use ordinance within the
local unit’s service district. This shall include, but shall not be limited to,
the power and authority of the city, as deemed necessary by the city, to
immediately and independently investigate, enforce, and prosecute
(administratively or judicially, and civilly or criminally) any violation of
this chapter, of the local unit’s sewer use ordinance, or of any notice, order,
permit, decision or determination promulgated, issued or made by the POTW
Superintendent under this chapter or the local unit’s sewer use ordinance, and
to otherwise implement the requirements of this chapter and the local unit’s
sewer use ordinance.
         b.   The local unit’s sewer use ordinance shall expressly require and
provide: that all costs and expenses incidental to the installation, connection
and maintenance, including inspections, of sewer stubs and building leads shall
be at no cost to the city; and that the owner of any premises connected to a
collection system which discharges to the wastewater treatment system must
agree to, and shall be liable to, indemnify the city and hold the city harmless
from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the
installation, connection and maintenance of a sewer stub and building lead,
including, but not limited to, loss or damage from sewer backups not caused by
the city, or any other loss or damage not caused by the city resulting from the
premise’s discharges to the wastewater treatment system, consistent with
applicable laws and regulations.
         c.   The only other deviations and differences permitted between this
chapter and the local unit’s sewer use ordinance shall be those that reflect
the fact that the local unit’s sewer use ordinance is being adopted as an
ordinance by the local unit, and any other deviations or differences that are
approved in advance by the city.
         d.   At the city’s request, the local unit shall terminate service to
any user or premises that fails to comply with the local unit’s sewer use
ordinance.
         e.   If a local unit’s service district is extended as provided by § 
35-144A.1., both the local unit and any other local unit being served pursuant
to the extended service district shall adopt a local sewer use ordinance as
provided by this subdivision; or there shall be a valid, enforceable agreement
under Public Act 425 of 1984 between all of the local units being served as
determined adequate by the city to enable the city to fully meet it’s
obligations under applicable laws and regulations regarding the city’s POTW and
the city’s NPDES permit.
         f.   The local unit shall adopt an ordinance as required by this
section (or make any amendments to revise the ordinance consistent with
revisions to this division as made by the city from time to time) no later than
90 days after written notice from the city.
   B.   It shall be a violation of this chapter for a local unit that
discharges to the POTW (or a user located within the local unit) to fail or
refuse to comply with any provision of this chapter, any provision of the local
unit’s sewer use ordinance, any notice, order, permit, decision or
determination promulgated, issued or made by the POTW Superintendent under this
chapter or the local unit’s sewer use ordinance. Further, it shall be a
violation of this chapter for a local unit to discharge to the POTW except in
full compliance with the terms and requirements of the local unit’s WTSA.
   C.   Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter or other city ordinance
to the contrary, it shall be a violation of this chapter for a local unit, or
any user located within the local unit, to discharge (or continue to discharge)
to the POTW if:
      1.   The discharge is not solely from within the local unit’s service
district as authorized by the local unit’s WTSA; or
      2.   The discharge is from any portion of a collection system owned and/
or operated by or on behalf of a local unit that does not meet the standards
and specifications as required by the local unit’s WTSA or by other applicable
city laws and regulations; or
      3.   The local unit has failed or refused to adopt a local sewer use
ordinance (or subsequently amend such ordinance to conform with subsequent
amendments made by the city to this division), as provided by § 
35-144A.2.; or
      4.   The local unit or user has failed or refused to pay all or any
portion of charges, costs, expenses, penalties, fees, reimbursement, or other
amounts due and payable to the city under this chapter, under the local unit’s
sewer use ordinance, under any notice, order, permit, decision or determination
promulgated, issued or made by the POTW Superintendent under this chapter or
the local unit’s sewer use ordinance, or under the local unit’s WTSA.    
   D.   In addition to any other legal or equitable remedies available to the
city under this chapter or other applicable laws or regulations, the city may
refuse to accept and/or may terminate any discharge from a local unit’s service
district (or from any portion thereof or any user or premises located within
the local unit) to the POTW that does not comply with all of the terms,
conditions, and requirements of this chapter and/or the local unit’s WTSA, as
determined by the POTW.

day of the month following the month of the provision of the water service and
shall be due and payable at the offices of the City Billing Clerk on or before
the fifteenth day (if a weekend or holiday, then the next business day) of the
month in which the billing statement was rendered. If the full balance of the
billing statement is not paid by the fifteenth day (if a weekend or holiday,
then the next business day) of the month in which it became due and payable: a
late payment service charge of 10% of the balance due shall be added to the
amount owed, with said late payment service charge due immediately and the City
Billing Clerk shall issue a notice of delinquency and intent to discontinue
service. Failure by a customer to receive the notice of delinquency and intent
to discontinue service shall not waive payment of any disconnect charges,
reconnect charges, or other fees or charges.
   B.   If the full balance due and payable including any late payment charges
or other fees or charges for the provision of water service remain unpaid as of
the first Tuesday of the month following when said balance becomes due and
payable, the water service for the lot, parcel of land, or the premises
affected is eligible to be disconnected, and if disconnected, shall not be
turned on again until all sums then due and owing, including penalties and
reconnection fees or charges, are paid. Any disconnection or reconnection fees
shall be in amounts as determined by resolution of the City Council. If water

determined by resolution of the City Council. Where the water service to any
premises is turned on at the request of the customer there shall be a water
turn-on charge in an amount to be determined by resolution of the City Council.
When the city is requested to provide turn-on or shut-off services at times
other than the regular business hours of the City Department of Public Works,
there will be imposed an additional charge for time and materials in an amount
to be determined by resolution of the City Council.
   D.   The user fees and charges for water service which are, under the
provisions of Public Act No. 94 of 1933 (MCL 141.101 et seq.), made a lien on
all premises served thereby, are hereby recognized to constitute such lien and
whenever any such charge against any piece of property shall be delinquent for
a period of six months, the City Council shall certify on or before April 1 of
each year to the city tax assessing officer the fact of such delinquency,
whereupon such delinquent charge shall be entered upon the next tax roll as a
charge against such premises and the lien thereof enforced in the same manner
as general city taxes against such premises are collected and the lien thereof
enforced.
   E.   In the event of a declaration of a state of emergency as authorized by

Sec. 38-1. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   A.   The city has determined that certain groundwater underlying areas
including the City of Plainwell currently are, or may be in the future, the
sole source of the city’s drinking water supply. Groundwater aquifers are
integrally connected with the surface water, lakes and streams that constitute
significant public health, recreational and economic resources of the city and
surrounding area. Spills and discharges of hazardous substances threaten the
quality of the groundwater supplies and other water related resources, posing
potential public health and safety hazards and threatening economic losses.
   B.   This chapter protects existing and potential groundwater supplies,
aquifers, and groundwater recharge areas of the city.

Sec. 38-7. PROFESSIONAL REVIEW OF PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT.
   Fees in escrow for professional reviews. Any application for site plan
approval under this chapter may require the deposit of fees to be held in
escrow in the name of the applicant. An escrow fee shall be required by the
Building Official unless waived by the Building Official or City Council.
Waiver shall be based on a written conclusion that there is no substantial
information or analysis benefit to accrue as a result of the application of
this section. An escrow fee may be requested to obtain a professional review of
any other project which may, at the discretion of the Building Official create
an identifiable and potentially negative impact on public infrastructure or
services, or on adjacent properties and because of which, professional input is
desired before a decision to approve, deny or approve with conditions is made.
   A.   The escrow shall be used to pay professional review expenses of
engineers, community planners, and any other professionals whose expertise the
city values to review the proposed application and/or site plan of an
applicant. Professional review will result in a report to the City indicating
the extent of conformance or nonconformance with this chapter and to identify
any problems that may create a threat to public health, safety or the general
welfare. Mitigation measures or alterations to a proposed design may be
identified where they would serve to lessen or eliminate identified impacts.
The applicant will receive a copy of any professional review hired by the city
and a copy of the statement of expenses for the professional services rendered.
   B.   No application for approval for which an escrow fee is requested will
be processed until the escrow fee is deposited with the City Clerk. The amount
of the escrow fee shall be established based on an estimate of the cost of the
services to be rendered by the professionals contacted by the Building
Official. The applicant is entitled to a refund of any unused escrow fees at
the time a permit is either issued or denied in response to the applicant’s
request.
   C.   If actual professional review costs exceed the amount of an escrow, the
applicant shall pay the balance due prior to receipt of any land use or other
permit issued by the city in response to the applicant’s request.
   D.   Disputes on the costs of professional reviews may be resolved by an
arbitrator mutually satisfactory to both parties.

   A.   The city has determined that an open loop geothermal system that
penetrates and/or draws water from an aquifer can deplete or pollute
groundwater. Additionally, an improperly constructed or maintained closed loop
geothermal system can pollute groundwater.
   B.   This chapter protects the public health, safety, and general welfare
including existing and potential groundwater supplies, aquifers, and
groundwater recharge areas of the city from pollution or depletion resulting
from construction, reconstruction, repair, or abandonment of geothermal heat
pump systems.
(Ord. 368, adopted 10-27-2014)
Sec. 39-2. SUPPLEMENTARY DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ANNULAR SPACE. The space between the casing or well screen and the wall of
the borehole, or between drilling pipe and casing, or between two separate
strings of casing.
   AQUIFER. A geological formation, group of formations, or part of a formation
capable of storing and yielding a significant amount of groundwater to wells
and springs.
   AS-BUILT PLAN. A legible hand-sketch or computer generated illustration.
   BENTONITE GROUT. A slurry that consists of sodium montmorillonite bentonite
and water and that has a solids concentration of not less than 20%. A slurry of
drilling fluid bentonite and water or drilled cuttings, either singularly or in
combination, is not BENTONITE GROUT.
   BOREHOLE. A hole drilled or bored into the earth, usually into which casing,
screen, piping and other materials may be installed to construct a well or
geothermal heat pump system.
   CASING. An impervious, durable pipe placed in a borehole to prevent the
walls of the borehole from caving, and to seal off surface drainage or
undesirable water, gas, or other fluids and prevent entrance into a well.
   CLOSED LOOP SYSTEM. A geothermal heat pump system that generally consists of
underground loops of piping; heat transfer fluid; a heat pump, and an air
distribution system. An opening is made in the earth. One or more pipes are
installed into the opening and connected to a heat exchange system in the
building. The pipes form a “closed loop” and are filled with a heat transfer
fluid. The fluid is circulated through the piping from the opening into the
heat exchanger and back. The system functions in the same manner as the open
loop system except there is no pumping of groundwater.
   DEPARTMENT. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality or its
predecessor.
   DRINKING WATER. Water which is intended for human consumption and other
domestic uses, and is considered to be free of harmful chemicals and disease-
causing microorganisms.
   GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP SYSTEM. A mechanical system for space heating or
cooling that relies on the transfer of thermal energy between the earth and a
heat transfer fluid and consists of heat pump, a well to exchange heat and a
heat distribution network.
   GROUNDWATER. Water beneath the earth’s surface that is located between
saturated soil and rock that supplies wells and springs.
   GROUT. A low permeability material that is emplaced in the space between the
wall of the borehole and the casing of a well end, or placed in the annular
space of the borehole. The emplacement of GROUT is to prevent the migration of
water or fluid contaminants into and through the borehole. GROUT shall consist
of neat cement or high solids bentonite slurry.
   HEAT TRANSFER FLUID. Any liquid used especially for the purpose of
transferring thermal energy from the heat source to another location.
   ISOLATION DISTANCES. The distance of a source of contamination from a
surface drinking water source, a groundwater source supply well, or any type of
borehole.
   NEAT CEMENT GROUT. A mixture of one bag of Portland cement (94 pounds) and
not more than six gallons of fresh water. Drilling fluid bentonite that is not
more than 5% by weight of cement and additional water that is not more than 0.6
gallons for each 1% of bentonite may be added to neat cement grout.
   OPEN LOOP SYSTEM. A geothermal heat pump system in which groundwater is
drawn from a well into a heat exchanger that is often located in a surface
building. The water drawn from the earth is then pumped back into the aquifer
through a different well or in some cases the same well. Alternatively, the
groundwater could be discharged to a surface water body. In the heating mode,
cooler water is returned to the earth, while in the cooling mode, warmer water
is returned to the surface water body.
   PERMEABILITY. The propensity of a material to allow fluid to move through
its pores or interstices. PERMEABILITY is an important soil parameter when flow
of water through soil or rock is a matter of concern.
   PERMIT. For the purpose of
Chapter 39, PERMIT means a city permit issued to construct, install, modify,
replace or repair a geothermal heat pump system; or dig, bore, drill, replace,
modify, repair, or destroy a well that is intended to be or was part of a
geothermal heat pump system.
   PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY WELL. Water supply well used or made available to two or
more consumers.
      1.   TYPE I. Community water supply providing year-round service to not
less than 25 residents or not less than 15 living units.
      2.   TYPE IIb. Non-community water supply providing year-round service to
not less than 25 residents or not less than 15 living units.
      3.   TYPE III. Anything not considered Type I or Type II water supply;
serves less than 25 people and less than 15 connections, or operates for less
than 60 days per year.
   WASTE WATER SYSTEM. Any system for the collection, storage, treatment,
neutralization or stabilization of sewage that occurs on a property.
      1.   SEPTIC SYSTEM. Type of waste water system consisting of a septic
tank that collects all of the sewage. The sewage separates into solid (sludge)
that settles to the bottom and liquid effluent that then flows into a leach
field for final treatment by the soil.
      2.   MUNICIPAL SYSTEM. Type of waste water system whereby sewage flows
into a sanitary sewer system and is carried to a waste water treatment plant
for chemical and/or biological treatment.
   WATER SUPPLY WELL. A well used to provide potable water for drinking or
domestic purposes.
   WELL. As defined in the Michigan Water Well Construction and Pump
Installation Code, Part 127, Act 368 of the Public Acts of 1978, as amended,
and rules; or a permanent or temporary opening in the surface of the earth for
the purpose of removing water, testing water quality, measuring water
characteristics, measuring liquid levels, oil and gas exploration or

(Ord. 308, adopted 2-17-2000)
Sec. 52-13. NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   A.   Intent. It is the intent of this section to encourage the eventual
elimination of signs that, as a result of the adoption of this chapter, became
legal nonconforming and to administer this chapter to realize the removal of
illegal nonconforming signs and to avoid any unreasonable invasion of
established private property rights.
      1.   No person shall be required to remove a sign which was erected in
compliance with previous regulations of this chapter if the sign becomes
nonconforming due to a change occurring after adoption of this chapter or in
the location of buildings, streets or other signs, which change, is beyond the
control of the owner of the sign and the premises on which it is located.
      2.   If the owner of a nonconforming sign changes the location of a
building, property line or sign or changes the use of a building so that any
sign on the premises is rendered nonconforming, the sign must be removed or
made to conform to this chapter.
   B.   Lawful existing signs. Any sign lawfully existing at the time of this
chapter which does not fully comply with all provisions shall be considered a
nonconforming sign and may be permitted to remain as long as the sign is
properly maintained and not detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of
the community, but it shall not be:
      1.   Expanded or altered so as to increase the degree of nonconformity of
the sign;
      2.   Re-established after is discontinuance for 90 days; or
      3.   Re-established after damage or destruction, ordinary wear or
obsolescence, if the estimated cost of the reconstruction or renovation exceeds
50% of the replacement sign cost without review by the Planning Commission.
   C.   Erection of additional signs where legal nonconforming signs exist. On
lots where an existing sign exceeds the sign area, sign height or encroaches
into the minimum required setback area allowed by this chapter and in that
respect is a legal nonconforming sign, no new sign, either freestanding or
attached to a building, shall be erected until the existing legal nonconforming
sign is brought into compliance with this chapter.
(Ord. 308, adopted 2-17-2000)
Sec. 52-14. REPAIRS OR REMOVAL; NOTICE.
   A.   If the Zoning Administrator finds that any permanent sign is maintained

(s) entitled to possession of the sign or to the owner(s) of the property where
the sign is located.
   B.   If the person fails to alter or remove the sign so as to comply with
this chapter after receipt of the notice and within the time given in that
notice, the Zoning Administrator may alter or remove the sign at the expense of
the owner or person entitled to possession of the property or sign.
(Ord. 308, adopted 2-17-2000)
Sec. 52-15. APPEALS.

Administrator may make an appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   B.   The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant a variance as provided for in the

(Ord. 308, adopted 2-17-2000)
Sec. 52-16. VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
   A.   Any person (including, but not limited to, any owner, agent-in-charge,
occupant, architect, contractor or builder) who violates, disobeys, omits,
neglects or refuses to comply with any provision of this chapter or any
condition or requirement of any permit, certificate, plan, agreement, variance
or other approval or authorization granted under this chapter is responsible

less than $500, plus costs and other sanctions, for each violation. Repeat
offenses shall be subject to increased fines as provided by the code.
   B.   Any sign, sign structure or device erected, moved, altered, razed or
converted subsequent to the effective date of this chapter or its amendment,
that is in violation of any provision of this chapter or any condition or
requirement of any permit, certificate, plan, agreement, variance or other
approval or authorization granted under this chapter, is declared to be a
nuisance per se and shall be abated by any court of competent jurisdiction.

Sec. 53-31. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   The Service Business District is designed to accommodate various types of
office uses performing administrative, professional and personal services.
These are typically small office or limited commercial facilities which have
the appearance of residential structures and which can serve as transitional
uses between more intensive uses of land such as that along M-89 and less
intensive uses of land such as single-family residential development. The
district is intended to promote alternatives to residential development along
major thoroughfares while protecting the integrity of the abutting residential
development. This district is specifically intended to prohibit commercial
establishments which have extended hours, high rates of customer turnover and
require short-term parking.

         f.   All mining operations shall be located on or near a primary road,
as defined by the Allegan County Road Commission, for ingress and egress
thereto; and on a road which if used as the access to the proposed operation
will not result in significant increase in truck traffic through an area
developed primarily for residential purposes. Where necessary as determined by
the Planning Commission, the Planning Commission may require the applicant to
construct and/or improve a road to accommodate the truck traffic created by the
operations as a condition of the permit, and for the purpose of routing traffic
around residential areas and preventing the breaking up of existing roads, that
may not be constructed to accommodate a large volume of heavy vehicles. The
operation shall be managed and controlled so that truck and heavy equipment
traffic generated by the use is controlled by the permit holder and haul routes
to and from the site shall be approved by the Planning Commission.

operation shall not last for over two years unless extended by the Planning
Commission. When the Zoning Administrator determines a mining or fill operation
or portion thereof to be abandoned, he/she shall give the landowner written
notice of the intention to declare the mining of fill operation or portion
thereof abandoned. Within 30 days following receipt of said notice, the
landowner shall have the opportunity to rebut the Zoning Administrator's
evidence and submit other relevant evidence to the contrary. If the Zoning
Administrator finds the operator's evidence of continued use satisfactory, he/
she shall not declare abandonment.
      6.   Financial guarantees. A monetary performance guarantee shall be
filed with the City Treasurer. The performance guarantee shall be in the form
of a letter of credit, cash or surety bond acceptable to the city and with the
city named as the beneficiary. The security shall be returned when all
conditions stipulated in the special approval use permit have been met and the
special approval use permit deemed ended prior to the security's release. There
shall be no partial release of the security. The city shall determine the
amount of the monetary security guarantee.
      7.   Inspection and amendments. Permits granted for a period exceeding
one year shall be inspected a minimum of once a year by the Zoning
Administrator to ensure compliance with the permit and ordinance. Special
approval use permits for mining or fill operations may be amended by the
Planning Commission in accordance with the following procedures:
         a.   A request for amendment of a special approval use permit must be
made at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the existing permit.
         b.   The written request shall provide information concerning the
mining or fill operation/activities conducted during the current year and also

analyzer shall be used to measure the intensity and frequency of the sound or
noise levels encountered. Sounds of very short duration, which cannot be
measured accurately with the sound level meter, shall be measured by an impact
noise analyzer; and the measurements so obtained may be permitted to exceed the
maximum levels as set forth in
Table 12A. by no more than six decibels in each octave band. For purposes of
this chapter, impact noises shall be considered to be those noises whose peak
values are more than six decibels higher than the values indicated on the sound
level meter. In addition, sounds of an intermittent nature or characterized by
high frequencies, which the Building Inspector deems to be objectionable in
adjacent districts, shall be controlled so as not to generate a nuisance in
adjacent districts, even if the decibel measurement does not exceed that
specified in the table.

      3.   Determination of the total net rate of emission of particulate
matter within the boundaries of any lot shall be made as follows:
         a.   Determine the maximum emission in pounds per hour from each
source of emission and divide this figure by the number of acres of lot area,
thereby obtaining the gross hourly rate of emission in pounds per acre.
         b.   From each gross hourly rate of emission derived in division 13.3
.a. above, deduct the correction factor (interpolating as required) for height
of emission set forth in the table, thereby obtaining the net rate of emission
in pounds per acre per hour from each source of emission.
         c.   Add together the individual net rates of emission derived in
division 13.3.b. above, to obtain the total net rate of emission from all
sources of emission within the boundaries of the lot. The total shall not
exceed one pound per acre of lot area during any one-hour period.
   C.   Vibration.
      1.   In the I District, no activity or operation shall cause or create
earth borne vibrations in excess of the displacement values set forth in Table

provide the content of the “Flood Hazards” section of Table R301.2(1) of the
Michigan Residential Code.
   C.   Disputes. Where there are disputes as to the location of a flood hazard
area zone boundary, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall resolve the dispute in
accord with this code.
   D.   Compliance required. In addition to other requirements of this chapter
applicable to development in the underlying zoning districts, compliance with
the requirements of this section shall be necessary for all development
occurring within the flood hazard area zone. Land uses permitted in the flood
hazard overlay zone outlined in this chapter may only be permitted if such land
use is permitted in the underlying zoning district, or if the land use is
accessory to a permitted principal use within the underlying zone. Conflicts
between the requirements of this section and other requirements of this chapter
or any other chapter shall be resolved in favor of this section, except where
the conflicting requirement is more stringent and would further the objectives
of this section to a greater extent than the requirements of this section. In
these cases, the more stringent requirement shall be applied.

Sec. 53-130. SPECIAL APPROVAL USE PROCEDURE, SPECIAL APPROVAL USE PERMITS.
   In order that this chapter be flexible and reasonable, special approval uses
are provided for in various zoning districts and require special approval use
permits granted by the City Council after the body has received a written
recommendation from the City Planning Commission. Conformance to special
approval use standards is required in addition to all other requirements of
this chapter. All uses are declared to possess characteristics of the unique
and distinct form that each specific use shall be considered on an individual
case. The granting of a special use permit does not negate the requirements for
any other required permit(s).
   A.   Standards for the consideration of special approval uses. The review of
a special approval use shall consider the following:
      1.   The general safety, health and welfare of the community-at-large;
this shall include:
         a.   Accessibility of the property in question to fire and police
protection;
         b.   Traffic conditions, creating or adding to a hazardous situation;
         c.   Transportation design requirements, if any, which will be needed
to accommodate any traffic impact for the use intended; and
         d.   Appropriateness of the location, nature and height of the
proposed use to the size, type and kind of buildings, uses and structures in
the vicinity and adjacent properties, including the safety and convenience of
people therefrom.
      2.   Any potential decrease in the market value of adjacent buildings,
uses and structures which are permitted by right under current zoning, if the
proposed use is granted;
      3.   Harmony with the Land Use Planning Program of the city. This
considers whether the location and size of the proposed use, the nature and
intensity of the activities involved, the size of the site with respect to
existing and future streets (giving access to it), parks and drainage systems
will be in harmony with the Land Use Plan of the city and the character of land
use which is intended by the Land Use Plan for the area or district in
question;
      4.   Impact from the applicant’s proposed use, its location and intensity
and the height of its buildings, walls, fences and other structures upon the
appropriate character of development intended for the area as deemed desirable
by the city’s Land Use Plan;
      5.   Any hazards arising from storage and use of inflammable fluids; and/
or
      6.   The operations in connection with any special approval use shall not
be environmentally objectionable to nearby properties by reason of noise,
fumes, pollution, vibration or lights to an extent which is more than would be
the operations of any use permitted by right for that district wherein the
special use is proposed.
   B.   Conditional approval.
      1.   As a condition of granting a special approval use permit, the City
Council may require that certain development precautions and remedies be taken
by the applicant in order to satisfy the special approval use review standards
and the site plan review standards set forth in this chapter; and which
essentially are designed to protect the general health, safety and welfare, as
well as to promote environmental preservation and nuisance abatement. Site
development guidelines are provided in this chapter. They include, but are not
limited to, drainage, soil erosion, planning and design of site, fencing,
screening, buffer strips, landscaping, on-site lighting, signing and off-street
parking. The measures must be incorporated by the applicant onto the site plan
and maintained at all times.
      2.   Compliance with performance standards for certain uses enumerated in
this chapter is required.
   C.   Site plan approval required. Site plan approval is required by the City
Council for all special approval use permits after the Council receives a
recommendation from the Planning Commission.
   D.   Time constraints. A special approval use permit shall be deemed to
authorize only one particular special approval use and shall expire if the
special approval use shall cease for more than 12 months for any reasons.
Initial development must begin within the one-year extension granted by City
Council. More stringent requirements may be imposed, if, in the judgment of the
City Council, a 12-month discontinuance may have a negative impact on adjacent
land uses.
   E.   Existing violations. No permit shall be issued for a special approval
use for a property where there is an existing violation of this chapter (an
unlawful nonconformity).
   F.   Decisions in writing. It is further provided that in granting or
denying a special approval use permit, the City Council shall specify in the
written decision the particular reason relied upon and its relation to the
proposed use.
   G.   Appeals. Any and all appeals regarding a decision or condition imposed
upon a special approval use application may be made to the Zoning Board of
Appeals within 30 days from the date of decision or imposed condition.
   H.   Application procedures for special approval permits by the City
Council. Prior to construction or physical development of a proposed special
approval use, as specified by this chapter, an application for a special
approval use permit must be obtained. An application for a special approval use
permit must be made to the City Clerk.

(Ord. 361, adopted 9-12-2011)
Sec. 53-132C. SIMILAR USES.
   A.   Intent. Since every potential land use cannot be addressed in the
Zoning Ordinance, each district may accommodate similar uses, as referenced in
this section.
   B.   Decision. All applications for a use not specifically addressed in a
zoning district, or inquiries concerning a use, shall be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator for review and a decision.
      1.   Factors. The Zoning Administrator shall base their determination on
the following factors:
         a.   The proposed use is not listed as a permitted or special land use
in any other zoning district.
         b.   The use is consistent with the district purpose.
         c.   The use is similar to other allowed uses relative to its
character, scale, and overall compatibility.
         d.   The use is not expected to create objectionable impacts to public
health, safety, and welfare if it were established in the applicable zoning
district.
         e.   The use would not be more appropriate within a different zoning
district.
      2.   Zoning Board of Appeals. The Zoning Administrator may, in their sole
discretion, submit a proposed use to the Zoning Board of Appeals for a similar
use determination if consideration of the review factors does not lead to a
clear conclusion.
   C.   Compliance. If a proposed use is determined to be similar to a use
listed within the district, the proposed use shall comply with all the
standards or requirements associated with the listed use. If the named use is a
special land use within the applicable zoning district, the use shall be
reviewed and approved per the applicable requirements within the Zoning
Ordinance.
   D.   Determination. The determination of whether a proposed use is similar
to another listed use shall be considered as an interpretation of the use
regulations and is not determined to be a use variance. Once a use has been
determined to be similar, it shall be specifically determined to be the named
use with which it shares similarities.
   E.   Prohibited use. If a use is not specifically listed anywhere in this
ordinance and is not determined to be similar to any other specifically listed
uses, the use-is prohibited .
   F.   Notification. In the event the Zoning Administrator has made a
determination in accordance with this provision, the Zoning Administrator shall
notify the Planning Commission during the subsequent regularly-scheduled
meeting.
(Ord. 379, passed 4-9-2018)
Sec. 53-132D. KEEPING OF BACKYARD CHICKENS.
   A.   Intent. The intent of this section is to allow the raising of backyard
chickens in single-family neighborhoods while protecting the urban character of
the community. The keeping of backyard chickens is distinct from the keeping of
other types of livestock or animals of a similar nature as chickens do not
graze and require a small, contained area that more appropriately fits within
the existing built environment and lot sizes in the City of Plainwell.
   B.   No person shall keep chickens unless they comply with the following
requirements:
      1.   Prior to keeping any chickens, a backyard chicken permit shall be
obtained, along with any fee required by the City Council. A backyard chicken
permit shall be valid indefinitely or until the property is sold or transferred
to another owner unless the permit is suspended or revoked
      2.   The keeping of chickens is permitted only on lots where the
principal use is a single-family dwelling in the R-1A and R-1B zoning
districts. The single-family dwelling shall be owner- occupied. The keeping of
chickens in all other zoning districts is prohibited.
      3.   The maximum number of chickens permitted per property shall be
three. Roosters are prohibited.
      4.   Chickens shall be provided, and maintained within, a fully enclosed,
roofed structure at all times.
      5.   All areas accessible to the chickens, including the structure and
run, shall be contained in a single enclosure not to exceed 60 square feet in
footprint and six feet in height measured from the immediate surrounding grade.
      6.   The enclosure shall be constructed of durable, conventional
residential building materials suitable for the purpose intended, and in a
manner which serves to enhance the aesthetic appearance of the neighborhood or
surrounding area. The use of tarps, scrap materials, plastic sheeting, and
similar non-rigid or poor-quality coverings is prohibited.
      7.   The enclosure shall have chicken wire or similar material embedded
12 inches into the ground around the enclosure to deter predators from digging
under the enclosure wall. The enclosure may alternatively be raised or contain
a durable, hard surface bottom to accomplish the same.
      8.   The enclosure shall be located in the rear yard and at least 20 feet
from the side and rear property lines.
      9.   The enclosure shall be maintained in a clean and orderly fashion.
      10.   Chicken feed shall be kept in a vermin-proof sealed container.
      11.   Slaughtering of chickens is not permitted.
      12.   Eggs shall not be sold on the property at retail.

ARTICLE XVII. PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
Sec. 53-133. OBJECTIVES FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   A.   It shall be the policy of the city to promote progressive development
of land and construction thereon by encouraging planned unit developments to
achieve:
      1.   A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of
housing and building types and permitting an increased density per acre and a
reduction in lot dimensions, yards, building setbacks and area requirements;
      2.   A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas and, if
permitted as part of the project, more convenience in the location of accessory
commercial uses and services;
      3.   A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural
topography and geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation and
prevents the disruption of natural drainage patterns;
      4.   A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through
conventional development resulting in substantial savings through shorter
utilities and streets; and
      5.   A development pattern in harmony with land use density,
transportation facilities and community facilities objectives of the city’s
Land Use Plan.
   B.   The city is also prepared to accept a greater population density in
undeveloped areas than that reflected by present zoning provided the developer
can demonstrate that any increment of public cost clearly attributable to
increased densities will be compensated for by the private amenities and public
benefits to be achieved by the plan of development.
(Ord. 188, eff. 2-25-1981)

for which the certificate is requested has been constructed or altered for the
existing use or any other use without full compliance with the Building Code or
this chapter in effect at the time of construction or alteration, he or she
shall not issue the certificate of occupancy, but shall declare the use to be
in violation of this chapter.

ARTICLE XIX. OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS
Sec. 53-175. REQUIRED OFF-STREET PARKING, GENERAL.
   A.   Off-street parking in conjunction with all land and building uses shall
be provided as herein prescribed.
      1.   For the purpose of this article, 300 square feet of lot area shall
be deemed a parking space for one vehicle, including access aisle; except that,
the standard shall be 325 square feet where parking is perpendicular to the
access aisle; and, except that, 180 square feet open area which has a direct
means of ingress and egress from an alley or street may also be deemed a
parking space.
      2.   When units or measurements determining number of required parking
spaces result in requirement of a fractional space, any fraction up to and
including one-half shall be disregarded and fractions over one-half shall
require one parking space.
      3.   The minimum number of off-street parking spaces shall be determined
in accordance with the following table in § 
53-176. For uses not specifically mentioned therein, off-street parking
requirements shall be interpreted by the Board of Zoning Appeals from
requirements for similar uses.
      4.   Any area once designated as required off-street parking shall never
be changed to any other use unless and until equally required facilities are
provided elsewhere. Off-street parking existing at the effective date of this
chapter in connection with the operation of an existing building or use shall
not be reduced to an amount less than would hereinafter be required for the
building or use.
      5.   Off-street parking may be provided either by individual action or by
a parking program carried out through public action, whether by a special
assessment district or otherwise.
      6.   Required off-street parking shall be for the use of occupants,
employees, visitors and patrons and shall be limited in use to motor vehicles.
The storage of merchandise, motor vehicles for sale or the repair of vehicles
is prohibited. All off-street parking, whether public or private, for
nonresidential uses shall be either on the same lot or within 300 feet of the
building it is intended to serve, measured from the nearest point of the
building to the nearest point of the off-street parking lot, except in the
Central Business District.
      7.   Residential off-street parking space shall consist of a parking
strip, garage or a combination thereof and shall be located on the premises it
is intended to serve and not closer than three feet from any street lot line.
      8.   Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent collective
provision of off-street parking facilities for two or more buildings or uses;
provided, the facilities collectively shall not be less than the sum of the
requirements for the various individual uses computed separately in accordance
with the table.
      9.   In stadiums, sports arenas, churches and other places of assembly in
which patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews or other similar seating
facilities, each 24 inches of the seating facilities shall be counted as one
seat for the purpose of determining requirements for off-street parking
facilities under this article.
   B.   The City Council may, upon recommendation of the City Planning
Commission, vary or modify the parking space requirements set forth in this
article as follows. In a case where existing off-street parking facilities have
unused parking capacity and where the facilities are open to the use of the
public free of charge or at reasonable rates, the City Council may reduce the
parking space requirement for any use within 300 feet from the facility or
facilities; provided that, the total number of stalls in the reduction shall be
not greater than the total number of stalls of excess capacity.
(Ord. 188, eff. 2-25-1981)

Inspector or by any other official in administering or enforcing the provisions
of this chapter.

interpretation is consistent with the intent and purpose of this chapter and
the article in which the language in question is contained;
         b.   Determine the precise location of the boundary lines between
zoning districts when there is dissatisfaction with a decision made by the
Building Inspector;

permitted or prohibited use, in accordance with the purpose and intent of each
district; and

specifically mentioned either by classifying it with one of the groups listed
by an analysis of the specific needs or developing a requirement based on
evaluation of documented need.

authorize specific variances from site development requirements such as lot
area and width regulations, building height and bulk regulations, yard width
and depth regulations, off-street parking and loading space requirements, of
this chapter; provided that, all the required findings listed below are met:
         a.   There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships which
prevent carrying out the strict letter of this chapter. Where hardships or
difficulties shall not be deemed economic, but shall be evaluated in terms of
the use of a particular parcel of land;
         b.   A genuine hardship exists because of unique circumstances or
physical condition such as narrowness, shallowness, shape or topography of the
property involved or to the intended use of the property, that do not generally
apply to other property uses in the same zoning district and shall not be
recurrent in nature;
         c.   The hardship or special conditions or circumstances do not result
from actions of the applicant;
         d.   The variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and
intent of this chapter and will not cause a substantial adverse effect upon
surrounding property, property values and the use and enjoyment of property in
the neighborhood or district;
         e.   Granting the variance will not confer on the applicant any
special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands, structures or
buildings in the same district;
         f.   The variance requested is the minimum amount necessary to
overcome the inequality inherent in the particular property or mitigate the
hardship; and/or
         g.   The variance shall not permit the establishment, within a
district, of any use which is not permitted by right within the zoning district
or any use for which a special use permit or a temporary use permit is
required.
   B.   In granting the variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.
Violations of the conditions and safeguards, when made part of the terms under
which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and
shall automatically invalidate the permit.
   C.   Each variance granted under the provisions of this chapter shall become
null and void unless:
      1.   The construction authorized by the variance or permit has commenced
within six months of granting of the variance; and/or

one year after the granting of the variance.

part, by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be resubmitted for a period of one
year from the date of the last denial, except on the ground of newly discovered
evidence or proof of changed conditions found upon inspection by the Board to
be valid.

deposit, certified check, irrevocable bank letter of credit or surety bond
acceptable to the city covering the estimated cost of improvements associated
with a project for which zoning approval is sought, be deposited with the City
Clerk to insure faithful completion of the improvements. The performance
guarantee shall be deposited at the time of the issuance of the permit
authorizing then activity or project. The Board may not require the deposit of
the performance guarantee before the date on which the permit is to be issued.
The Board shall establish procedures under which a rebate of any cash deposits
in reasonable proportions to that ratio of work completed on the required
improvements will be made as work progresses.

Sec. 55-1. PURPOSE.
   A.   Under the Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act, video service
providers may obtain a franchise to provide video services in municipality
using a standardized, uniform form of franchise agreement established by the
MPSC. This form includes the right to use the public right-of-way to provide
the service, but does not contain right-of-way management and related
provisions.
   B.   Telecommunications providers who obtain a standardized, uniform form of
franchise agreement generally will have previously obtained from the
municipality a permit under the Metro Act to construct and maintain their
telecommunications facilities in the public right-of-way. The Metro Act permits
set forth the terms and conditions for the right-of-way usage, standard forms
of the permits were agreed to in a collaborative process between municipalities
and providers that was initiated by the MPSC and the standard forms have since
been approved by the legislature and the MPSC.
   C.   Because telecommunications providers typically provide video services
over combined video and telecommunications facilities, the Metro Act permits
generally provide adequate public right-of-way related protections for
municipality and the public when the providers are providing video services.
   D.   Other video service providers, in particular new providers or existing
cable companies, may not have a Metro Act permit issued by the municipality.
   E.   The Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act and the standardized,
uniform franchise agreement require video service providers to comply with all
valid and enforceable local regulations regarding the use and occupation of the
public right-of-way in the delivery of video services, including the police
powers of the franchising entity and makes the right-of-way usage subject to
the laws of the state and the police powers of the franchising entity.
   F.   The Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act and the standardized,
uniform franchise agreement state that franchising entities shall provide video
service providers with open, comparable, nondiscriminatory and competitively
neutral access to the public right-of-way and may not discriminate against a
video service provider for the authorization or placement of a video service or
communications network in the public right-of-way.
   G.   The State Constitution reserves reasonable control of their highways,
streets, alleys and public places to local units of government.
   H.   The purpose of this chapter is to promote and protect the public
health, safety and welfare and exercise reasonable control over the public
right-of-way by regulating the use and occupation of the rights-of-way by video
service providers who have a standardized, uniform franchise but who lack a
Metro Act permit from municipality. This chapter does so by setting forth terms
and conditions for such usage and occupation from the forms of Metro Act permit
approved by the MPSC and approved by the legislature in § 6(1) of the Metro
Act, thus providing open, comparable, nondiscriminatory and competitively
neutral access to the public right-of-way and not discriminating against a
video service provider for the authorization or placement of a video service or
communications network in public right-of-way.
(Ord. 345, adopted 12-26-2007)
Sec. 55-2. CONSISTENT INTERPRETATION.
   This chapter shall be interpreted and applied so as to be consistent with
the Metro Act and corresponding provisions of the forms of Metro Act permit
approved by the MPSC, including applicable MPSC, Metro Authority and court
decisions and determinations relating to same.
(Ord. 345, adopted 12-26-2007)

shall inform the municipality as soon as reasonably possible of any changes
from previously supplied maps, records or plans and shall mark up maps provided
by municipality so as to show the location of the facilities.
(Ord. 345, adopted 12-26-2007)
Sec. 55-6. USE OF PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   A.   Overlashing. The permittee shall not allow the wires or any other
facilities of a third party to be overlashed to the permittee’s facilities
without the municipality’s prior written consent. The municipality’s right to
withhold written consent is subject to the authority of the MPSC under § 361 of
the State Telecommunications Act (M.C.L.A. § 484.2361).
   B.   No burden on public right-of-way. The permittee, its contractors,
subcontractors and the facilities shall not unduly burden or interfere with the
present or future use of any of the public right-of-way. The permittee’s aerial
cables and wires shall be suspended so as to not endanger or injure persons or
property in or about the public right-of-way. If the municipality reasonably
determines that any portion of the facilities constitutes an undue burden or
interference, due to changed circumstances, the permittee, at its sole expense,
shall modify the facilities or take other actions as the municipality may
determine is in the public interest to remove or alleviate the burden and the
permittee shall do so within a reasonable time period. The municipality shall
attempt to require all occupants of a pole or conduit whose facilities are a
burden to remove or alleviate the burden concurrently.
   C.   No priority. This chapter does not establish any priority of use of the
public right-of-way by the permittee over any present or future permittees or
parties having agreements with the municipality or franchises for the use. In
the event of any dispute as to the priority of use of the public right-of-way,
the first priority shall be to the public generally, the second priority to the
municipality, the third priority to the state and its political subdivisions in
the performance of their various functions and thereafter as between other
permit, agreement or franchise holders, as determined (except as otherwise
provided by law) by municipality in the exercise of its powers, including the
police power and other powers reserved to and conferred on it by the state.
   D.   Restoration of property. The permittee, its contractors and
subcontractors shall immediately (subject to seasonal work restrictions)
restore, at the permittee’s sole expense, in a manner approved by the
municipality, any portion of the public right-of-way that is in any way
disturbed, damaged or injured by the construction, installation, operation,
maintenance or removal of the facilities to a reasonably equivalent (or, at the
permittee’s option, better) condition as that which existed prior to the
disturbance. In the event that the permittee, its contractors or subcontractors
fail to make the repair within a reasonable time, the municipality may make the
repair and the permittee shall pay the costs the municipality incurred for the
repair.
   E.   Marking.
      1.   The permittee shall mark its facilities installed after the
effective date of this chapter as follows: aerial portions of the facilities
shall be marked with a marker on the permittee’s lines on alternate poles which
shall state the permittee’s name and provide a toll-free number to call for
assistance. Direct buried underground portions of the facilities shall have:
         a.   A conducting wire placed in the ground at least several inches
above the permittee’s cable (if the cable is nonconductive);
         b.   At least several inches above that, a continuous colored tape
with a statement to the effect that there is buried cable beneath; and
         c.   Stakes or other appropriate above ground markers with the
permittee’s name and a toll-free number indicating that there is buried cable
below.
      2.   Bored underground portions of the facilities shall have a conducting
wire at the same depth as the cable and shall not be required to provide the
continuous colored tape. Portions of the facilities located in conduit,
including conduit of others used by the permittee, shall be marked at its
entrance into and exit from each manhole and handhole with permittee’s name and
a toll-free telephone number.
   F.   Tree trimming. The permittee may trim trees upon and overhanging the
public right-of-way so as to prevent the branches of the trees from coming into
contact with the facilities, consistent with any standards adopted by
municipality. The permittee shall dispose of all trimmed materials. The
permittee shall minimize the trimming of trees to that essential to maintain
the integrity of the facilities. Except in emergencies, all trimming of trees
in the public right-of-way shall have the advance approval of the manager.
   G.   Installation and maintenance. The construction and installation of the
facilities shall be performed pursuant to plans approved by municipality. The
open cut of any public right-of-way shall be coordinated with the manager or
manager’s designee. The permittee shall install and maintain the facilities in
a reasonably safe condition. If the existing poles in the public right-of-way
are overburdened or unavailable for the permittee’s use or the facilities of
all users of the poles are required to go underground then the permittee shall,
at its expense, place the portion of its facilities underground, unless
municipality approves an alternate location. The permittee may perform
maintenance on the facilities without prior approval of municipality; provided
that, the permittee shall obtain any and all permits required by municipality
in the event that any maintenance will disturb or block vehicular traffic or
are otherwise required by the municipality.
   H.   Pavement cut coordination. The permittee shall coordinate its
construction and all other work in the public right-of-way with the
municipality’s program for street construction and rebuilding (collectively
“street construction”) and its program for street repaving and resurfacing
(except seal coating and patching) (collectively, “street resurfacing”). The
goals of the coordination shall be to encourage the permittee to conduct all
work in the public right-of-way in conjunction with or immediately prior to any
street construction or street resurfacing planned by municipality.
   I.   Compliance with laws. The permittee shall comply with all valid and
enforceable federal and state statutes and regulations; and all valid and
enforceable local regulations regarding the use and occupation of the public
right-of-way, including the police powers of municipality; regarding the
construction, installation and maintenance of its facilities, now in force or
which hereafter may be promulgated. Before any installation is commenced, the
permittee shall secure all necessary permits, licenses and approvals from
municipality or other governmental entity as may be required by law, including,
without limitation, all utility line permits and highway permits. The
municipality shall not unreasonably delay or deny issuance of any permits,
licenses or approvals. The permittee shall comply in all respects with
applicable codes and industry standards, including, but not limited to, the
National Electrical Safety Code (latest edition adopted by State Public Service
Commission) and the National Electric Code (latest edition). The permittee
shall comply with all zoning and land use ordinances and historic preservation
ordinances as may exist or may hereafter be amended. This section does not
constitute a waiver of the permittee’s right to challenge laws, statutes,
ordinances, rules or regulations now in force or established in the future.
   J.   Street vacation. If the municipality vacates or consents to the
vacation of public right-of-way within its jurisdiction and the vacation
necessitates the removal and relocation of the permittee’s facilities in the
vacated public right-of-way, the permittee shall consent to the vacation and
remove its facilities, at its sole cost and expense, when ordered to do so by
municipality or a court of competent jurisdiction. The permittee shall relocate
its facilities to the alternate route as municipality and the permittee
mutually agree, applying reasonable engineering standards.
   K.   Relocation. If the municipality requests the permittee to relocate,
protect, support, disconnect or remove its facilities because of street or
utility work or other public projects, the permittee shall relocate, protect,
support, disconnect or remove its facilities, at its sole cost and expense,
including where necessary to the alternate route as the municipality and the
permittee mutually agree, applying reasonable engineering standards. The work
shall be completed within a reasonable time period.
   L.   Public emergency. The municipality shall have the right to sever,
disrupt, dig-up or otherwise destroy facilities of the permittee if the action
is necessary because of a public emergency. If reasonable to do so under the
circumstances, the municipality shall attempt to provide notice to the
permittee. Public emergency shall be any condition which poses an immediate
threat to life, health or property caused by any natural or human-made
disaster, including, but not limited to, storms, floods, fire, accidents,
explosions, water main breaks, hazardous material spills, etc. The permittee
shall be responsible for repair, at its sole cost and expense, of any of its
facilities damaged pursuant to any action taken by the municipality.
   M.   Miss dig. If eligible to join, the permittee shall subscribe to and be
a member of “MISS DIG”, the association of utilities formed pursuant to Public
Act 53 of 1974, as amended, (M.C.L.A. §§ 460.701 et seq.) and shall conduct its
business in conformance with the statutory provisions and regulations
promulgated thereunder.
   N.   Underground relocation. If the permittee has its facilities on poles of
Consumers Energy, Detroit Edison or another electric or telecommunications
provider and Consumers Energy, Detroit Edison or another electric or
telecommunications provider relocates its system underground, then the
permittee shall relocate its facilities underground in the same location at the
permittee’s sole cost and expense.
   O.   Identification. All personnel of the permittee and its contractors or
subcontractors who have as part of their normal duties contact with the general
public shall wear on their clothing a clearly visible identification card
bearing the permittee’s name, their name and photograph. The permittee shall
account for all identification cards at all times. Every service vehicle of the
permittee and its contractors or subcontractors shall be clearly identified as
such to the public, such as by a magnetic sign with the permittee’s name and
telephone number.
(Ord. 345, adopted 12-26-2007)
Sec. 55-7. INDEMNIFICATION.
   A.   Indemnity. The permittee shall defend, indemnify, protect and hold
harmless the municipality, its officers, agents, employees, elected and
appointed officials, departments, boards and commissions from any and all
claims, losses, liabilities, causes of action, demands, judgments, decrees,
proceedings and expenses of any nature (collectively “claims”) (including,
without limitation, attorneys’ fees) arising out of or resulting from the acts
or omissions of permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors,
successors or assigns, but only to the extent the acts or omissions are related
to the permittee’s use of or installation of facilities in the public right-of-
way and only to the extent of the fault or responsibility of the permittee, its
officers, agents, employees, contractors, successors and assigns.
   B.   Notice, cooperation. The municipality shall notify the permittee
promptly in writing of any claims and the method and means proposed by the
municipality for defending or satisfying any claims. The municipality shall
cooperate with the permittee in every reasonable way to facilitate the defense
of any claims. The municipality shall consult with the permittee respecting the
defense and satisfaction of claims, including the selection and direction of
legal counsel.
   C.   Settlement. The municipality shall not settle any claim subject to
indemnification under the preceding two divisions A. and B. without the advance
written consent of the permittee, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The permittee shall have the right to defend or settle, at its own
expense, any claim against the municipality for which the permittee is
responsible hereunder.
(Ord. 345, adopted 12-26-2007)
Sec. 55-8. INSURANCE.
   A.   Coverage required. Prior to beginning any construction in or
installation of the permittee’s facilities in the public right-of-way, the
permittee shall obtain insurance as set forth below and file certificates
evidencing same with the municipality. The insurance shall be maintained in
full force and effect until the end of the term of the franchise agreement. In
the alternative, the permittee may satisfy this requirement through a program
of self-insurance, acceptable to the municipality, by providing reasonable
evidence of its financial resources to the municipality. The municipality’s
acceptance of the self-insurance shall not be unreasonably withheld:
      1.   Commercial general liability insurance, including completed
operations liability, independent contractors liability, contractual liability
coverage, railroad protective coverage and coverage for property damage from
perils of explosion, collapse or damage to underground utilities, commonly
known as XCU coverage, in an amount not less than $5,000,000;
      2.   Liability insurance for sudden and accidental environmental
contamination with minimum limits of $500,000 and providing coverage for claims
discovered within three years after the term of the policy. Pursuant to the
2006 MPSC decision in Case U-14720, the permittee need not comply with the
preceding sentence until the time after the effective date of this chapter that

program as an opportunity to improve public streets and the transportation
network for all users, and shall work in coordination with other departments,
agencies, and jurisdictions to achieve complete streets.
   B.   Every street project on public streets shall incorporate Complete
Streets infrastructure sufficient to enable reasonably safe travel along and
across the right-of-way for each category of users; provided, however, that
such infrastructure may be excluded, upon written approval by the City Manager,
where documentation and data indicate that:
      1.   Use by non-motorized users is prohibited by law;
      2.   The cost would be excessively disproportionate to the need or
probable future use over the long term;
      3.   There is an absence of current or future need; or
      4.   Inclusion of such infrastructure would be unreasonable or
inappropriate in light of the scope of the project.
   C.   As feasible, the city shall incorporate Complete Streets infrastructure
into existing public streets to improve the safety and convenience of users and
construct and enhance the transportation network for each category of users.
   D.   If the safety and convenience of users can be improved within the scope
of pavement resurfacing, restriping, or signalization operations on public
streets, such projects shall implement Complete Streets infrastructure to
increase safety for users.
   E.   At the planning stage, the city shall work with local residents,
business operators, neighboring jurisdictions, school districts, students,
property owners, and other stakeholders who will be directly affected by a
Complete Streets project.
   F.   The city shall review and either revise or develop proposed revisions
to all appropriate plans, laws, procedures, rules, regulations, guidelines,
programs, templates, and design manuals to integrate, accommodate, and balance
the needs of all users in all street projects on public streets.
   G.   The city shall rely upon the current editions of street design
standards and guidelines that promote and support Complete Streets.
   H.   Training in how to integrate, accommodate, and balance the needs of
each category of users shall be provided for planners, civil and traffic
engineers, project managers, plan reviewers, inspectors, and other personnel
responsible for the design and construction of streets, as available.
   I.   The City of Plainwell shall create a Complete Streets project map that
shall guide community investment in Complete Streets infrastructure and include
suggested cross section details. This infrastructure shall be determined
through a public involvement process and determine planned or proposed projects
including, but not limited to, the following: proposed sidewalks, proposed bike
lane connectors, proposed sharrows, and proposed non-motorized paths. In lieu
of a Complete Streets project map, the non-motorized plan located in the
Plainwell Master Plan may be utilized as a substitute.

authorizes any city agency to impose any duties or obligations in conflict with
limitations on municipal authority established by federal or state law at the
time such agency action is taken.
   B.    In the event that a court or agency of competent jurisdiction holds
that a federal or state law, rule, or regulation invalidates any clause,
