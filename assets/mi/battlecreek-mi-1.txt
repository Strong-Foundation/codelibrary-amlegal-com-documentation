   EDITOR’S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is consistent with
the best accepted practice for codification. Each section is self-identifying
as to code, chapter and section number. For example, 238.02 indicates that the
code number is 2, the chapter number is 238 (or the 38th chapter within code
2), and the section number is .02. The code and chapter numbers appear left of
the decimal, with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the
decimal, and the chapter number being the first two digits left of the decimal.
The section number appears to the right of the decimal. As another example,
408.01 indicates that the code number is 4, the chapter number is 408 (or the
8th chapter within code 4), and the section number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99. Newly created sections subsequent to the original
codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event
the law properly belongs between consecutively numbered sections. For example,
newly created 660.041, 660.042 and 660.043 follow 660.04 and precede 660.05 to
be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words “Adopting Ordinance” at the end thereof are or
contain new matter which was ordained by the ordinance adopting these Codified
Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

municipal corporation under the laws of the State of Michigan, and shall be
known by the name of "City of Battle Creek."
Section 1.2. Boundaries. 
The City shall embrace the territory constituting the City of Battle Creek, on
the effective date of this Charter as described in Exhibit A attached hereto

Upon annexation or detachment of territory, the boundaries shall be deemed
thereby changed without amendment of this section.
Section 1.3. Powers.
The City of Battle Creek is hereby vested with and may exercise any and all
powers which cities are now, or may hereafter be, required or permitted to
exercise or to provide for in their charters as fully and completely as though
said powers were specifically enumerated herein, except for such limitations
and restrictions as are provided in this Charter, and no enumeration of
particular powers in this Charter shall be held to be exclusive.
CHAPTER 2: COMMISSION
Section 2.1. Powers.
There is hereby created a City Commission which shall have full authority,
except as otherwise provided herein or by general law, to exercise all of the
powers conferred upon the City, to adopt all ordinances, resolutions or other
measures relating to its Municipal concerns, and to otherwise govern its
affairs.
Section 2.2. Composition.
The City Commission shall consist of nine (9) members comprised of a Mayor and
three (3) Commissioners elected At-Large, and five (5) Commissioners elected
from Wards, except as hereinafter provided in Section 2.5. Unless the context
indicates differently, when this Charter uses the term “City Commissioner,”
“Commissioner,” “member” or its plural, it shall include the Mayor.
(Amended August 7, 1984; March 10, 2020)
Section 2.3. Qualifications.
No person shall be eligible to be elected or appointed to the office of Mayor
or At-Large City Commissioner unless that person is a registered elector in the
City or any annexed area. No person shall be eligible to be elected or
appointed to the office of Ward City Commissioner unless that person is a

which that person is a candidate. The office of Ward City Commissioner shall be
deemed vacant if the Ward City Commissioner removes their residence from the
ward during their term of office.
(Amended April 1, 1985; March 10, 2020)

On the first Monday of April in each year, there shall be an election of City

(Amended August 7, 1984; March 10, 2020)

City Commission for a period of not less than three nor more than four years as
provided in this section. Said additional member shall have all of the rights,
powers and duties of a duly elected City Commissioner and shall receive the
same compensation. Said population shall be determined by the existing City
Commission on a basis of such evidence as may be available including the last
previous Federal census, school censuses, tax records, election records, or a
special census conducted for the purpose, and its decision shall be final. A
special election in the annexed area shall be called and conducted by the City
Commission as soon as it is reasonably practicable after the effective date of
the annexation. At this election prior registration records may be used if
available. Subject to the provisions of this section, the election chapter of
this Charter and the State election laws shall be followed. The annexed area
representative to be elected shall have been a resident of the area for at
least two (2) years prior to the date of election and nominations shall be made
by petition as provided in the election chapter hereof for City Commissioners.
If only one person is nominated within the time limited, the City Commission

cancel the election. Said additional member shall hold office from the Tuesday
following the canvass of the election of the declaration above provided to the

   (e)   Municipal Ordinance Violations Bureau.
      (1)   Establishment. The City hereby establishes a Municipal Ordinance
Violations Bureau, as authorized under Section 8396 of the Act, to accept
admissions of responsibility for Municipal civil infractions in response to
Municipal ordinance violation notices issued and served by authorized City
officials, and to collect and retain civil fines and costs as prescribed by
these Codified Ordinances or any ordinance.
      (2)   Location; supervision; rules and regulations; employees. The Bureau
shall be located at City Hall and shall be under the supervision and control of
the City Treasurer. The City Treasurer, subject to the approval of the City
Commission, shall adopt rules and regulations for the operation of the Bureau
and appoint any necessary qualified City employees to administer the Bureau.
      (3)   Disposition of violations. The Bureau may dispose only of Municipal
civil infraction violations for which a fine has been scheduled and for which a
Municipal ordinance violation notice has been issued. The fact that a fine has
been scheduled for a particular violation shall not entitle any person to
dispose of the violation at the Bureau. Nothing in this section shall prevent
or restrict the City from issuing a Municipal civil infraction citation for any
violation or from prosecuting any violation in a court of competent
jurisdiction. No person shall be required to dispose of a Municipal civil
infraction violation at the Bureau and may have the violation processed before
a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The unwillingness of any person to dispose
of any violation at the Bureau shall not prejudice the person or in any way
diminish the person's rights, privileges and protection accorded by law.
      (4)   Scope of authority. The scope of the Bureau's authority shall be
limited to accepting admissions of responsibility for Municipal civil
infractions and collecting and retaining civil fines and costs as a result of
those admissions. The Bureau shall not accept payment of a fine from any person
who denies having committed the offense or who admits responsibility only with
explanation, and in no event shall the Bureau determine, or attempt to
determine, the truth or falsity of any fact or matter relating to an alleged
violation.
   (f)   Issuance and Service of Municipal Ordinance Violation Notices.
      (1)   Contents. Municipal ordinance violation notices shall be issued and
served by authorized City officials under the same circumstances and upon the
same persons as are provided for Municipal civil infraction citations in
paragraph (c)(7) hereof. In addition to any other information required by these
Codified Ordinances or any other ordinance, the violation notice shall indicate
the time by which the alleged violator must appear at the Bureau, the methods
by which an appearance may be made, the address and telephone number of the
Bureau, the hours during which the Bureau is open, the amount of the fine
scheduled for the alleged violation and the consequences for failure to appear
and pay the required fine within the required time.
      (2)   Appearances; payment of fines and costs. An alleged violator
receiving a Municipal ordinance violation notice shall appear at the Bureau and
pay the specified fine and costs at or by the time specified for appearance in
the Municipal ordinance violation notice. An appearance may be made by mail, in
person or by representation.
      (3)   Procedure where admission of responsibility is not made or fine is
not paid. If an authorized City official issues and serves a Municipal
ordinance violation notice and if an admission of responsibility is not made
and the civil fine and cost, if any, prescribed by the schedule of fines for
the violation are not paid at the Bureau, a Municipal civil infraction citation
may be filed with the district court and a copy of the citation may be served
by first class mail upon the alleged violator at the alleged violator's last
known address. The citation filed with the court does not need to comply in all
particulars with the requirements for citations as provided by Sections 8705
and 8709 of the Act, but shall consist of a sworn complaint containing the
allegations stated in the Municipal ordinance violation notice and shall fairly
inform the alleged violator how to respond to the citation.

proposal of best value, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.
   (b)   Exceptions. Contracts for professional services; emergency repairs or
replacements; routine and operational services; sole-source contracts; and when

published at least once in the most appropriate medium or media, as determined
by the Purchasing Agent, at least seven days before the last day set for
receiving proposals or bids by the City. This seven-day time period may be
reduced if a written determination is made by the Purchasing Agent that the
acquisition is urgent and sufficient vendors have been notified directly. The
notice shall include a general description of the articles or services to be
acquired and shall state where the complete solicitation package may be
secured. The notice shall also include the time and place for submitting and
opening bids.
   (b)   Vendor List. The Purchasing Agent shall also solicit responsible
prospective vendors who have requested their names to be added to a vendor
list, by sending to such prospective vendors, in a timely manner, such notice
as will acquaint them with the proposed acquisition of goods or services. In
any case, invitations sent to the prospective suppliers on the vendor list
shall be limited to commodities or services that are similar in character and
ordinarily handled by the trade groups to which the invitations for bids or
proposals are sent.

invitations for bid and requests for proposals by posting a notice on the

will result in the greatest number of responses from responsible vendors.
(Ord. 17-00. Passed 7-11-00; Ord. 03-07. Passed 4-17-07.)

212.01 GENERAL FUNCTIONS AND POWERS; APPOINTMENT OF MANAGER AND ATTORNEY.
   In accordance with the City Charter, the City Commission is the elected
legislative and policy making body of the City. The City Commission shall
appoint the City Manager and a City Attorney, who shall serve at the pleasure
of a majority of the membership of the City Commission. Neither the City
Commission nor any of its members shall dictate the appointment of any person
to office or employment by the City Manager, or in any manner interfere with
the City Manager’s control over the administrative service. Except for the
purpose of inquiry, the City Commission and its members shall deal with the
administrative service solely through the City Manager and neither the
Commission nor any member thereof shall give orders to any subordinate of the
City Manager. The City Commission shall have full authority to exercise all of
the powers conferred upon the City, to adopt all ordinances, resolutions or
other measures relating to its Municipal concerns and to otherwise govern its
affairs, unless otherwise provided for in the City Charter or by general law.
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78; Ord. 08-2020. Passed 10-20-20.)
212.02 RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COMMISSION.
   Rules of Procedure of the City Commission are hereby established as follows:
   I.
   Regular meetings of the City Commission shall be held at the City Commission
Chambers, City Hall, at 7:00 p.m., on the first and third Tuesday of each
month. However, the Commission may, by resolution, establish such other days
and times for regular meetings of the Commission; reschedule any regular
meeting; or amend its schedule of meetings. Should a regular meeting fall on a
legal holiday, such meeting shall be held at a date and time as may be
determined by the Commission. All meetings, except as provided for in Rule XVI,
shall be open to the public and shall be held at a place available to the
general public.
   The Mayor or any three Commissioners in the absence of the Mayor, after
consultation with the City Manager, may cancel a meeting due to a demonstrable
emergency, which shall be defined as an unforeseen combination of circumstances
that calls for immediate action. The notice of cancellation of the meeting
shall include the date and time for the rescheduled meeting unless not
reasonably practical to do at that time, in which case the date of the
rescheduled meeting must be issued within three days after the cancellation.
   II.
   A.   Special meetings of the Commission may be called by the Mayor, Manager
or any three Commissioners in accordance with the procedure set forth herein.
The person or persons calling such special meeting shall execute and file with
the City Clerk a written request for such special meeting, setting forth the
date and time and the business to be brought before such special meeting. Upon
receipt of such request, the City Clerk or Deputy Clerk shall prepare and sign
a written notice of special meeting, setting forth the time and date of such
meeting and the business to be considered at such meeting. The Clerk shall
cause a copy of such notice to be delivered personally to each member of the
City Commission, left at their place of residence, or delivered by electronic
mail at least eighteen hours before the time of such meeting. The Clerk shall
execute or cause to be executed and shall file an affidavit setting forth the
time and place that notice was given to each member of the Commission, and a
copy of the notice that was given shall be attached to the affidavit, which
affidavit shall be a part of the proceedings of all special meetings. Any
special meeting of the Commission shall be a legal meeting regardless of the
requirements set forth herein as to notice, when all members of the Commission
are present, and any business may be transacted at such special meeting where
all members are present. Members of the Commission may waive the notice of
special meeting required herein by signing and filing with the Clerk such
waiver, which may be in the form of a telegram, at any time within five days,
either before or after the date of such special meeting, and such waivers shall
be a part of the proceedings of any special meeting. Unless waivers of a
special meeting are filed in accordance with this rule or all members of the
Commission are present at such special meeting, no business shall be transacted
at any special meeting of the Commission unless the nature of the same has been
specifically stated in the notice of special meeting and notice of such meeting
has been given as herein required.
   B.   City Commission “workshops” or “work sessions” are intended to provide
opportunities for commissioners and staff to study difficult issues, gather and
analyze information, and clarify problems. Workshops focus on a single topic
while work sessions cover more than one topic. Although no votes for official
actions take place at workshops or work sessions, and they are not a "public
meeting" subject to the Open Meetings Act (OMA), public notice of the meetings
must be made in accordance with the OMA and an opportunity for public comment
must be afforded, consistent with the OMA. Because they are not a "public
meeting," they may be held virtually so long as they are also live streamed on
one of the City’s social media websites. Except for the biennial ethics
workshop provided for in below Section
212.05(b)(16)(A), workshops and work sessions may only be set by the Mayor or
the City Manager and may only be cancelled by the person setting the particular
workshop or work session. A workshop or work session shall not be considered a
“special meeting” as is used in the City Charter or ordinances.
   III.
   A.   Every Commissioner present, including the Mayor, when a question is
stated or vote is called for on any resolution, motion, question or ordinance
shall vote "Yes" or "No" thereon, unless excused by the unanimous consent of
the remaining Commissioners, or unless the member is pecuniarily interested, in
which latter case the member shall not vote. The vote on all matters shall be
taken and entered upon the record of the proceedings of the Commission. A roll
call vote shall be taken on any resolution, ordinance or amendment thereto
before the City Commission on a rotating basis.
   B.   Roll call votes shall be conducted by the Clerk in such sequence so as
to rotate the requirement of voting first to each Commissioner, including the
Mayor, alphabetically around the Commission table.
   C.   As an alternative to paragraph B. hereof, roll call votes may be
conducted by the Clerk using a machine system of voting which permits each
Commissioner to vote "Yes" or "No" and not have their vote displayed to other
Commissioners or the public until all votes by Commissioners have been cast, at
which time the Clerk shall publicly reveal the vote.
   D.   The following definition and procedures shall apply to accommodate the
absence from a public meeting, workshop and/or work session (hereafter
“meeting”) of a member of the public body due to military duty:
      (1)   "Military Duty" means (a) training and service performed by an
inductee, enlistee or reservist or any entrant into a temporary component of
the armed forces of the United States, and (b) time spent in reporting for and
returning from such training and service, or if rejection occurs, from the
place of reporting, pursuant to a lawful order.
      (2)   The member of the public body who will be absent from a meeting due
to military duty shall notify the City Manager of the intended absence and
affected dates sufficiently in advance of the public meeting to allow the
public to provide input on any business that will come before the public body,
along with an email address and telephone number where that member can be
reached during the absence from the meeting for military duty.
      (3)   Upon notification by the City Manager to the City Clerk of the
absence under this subsection, the City Clerk shall post a notice of the
affected public meeting, which shall include a notification to the public of
the name of the member who will be absent due to military duty and a
notification that the member may be contacted through the City of Battle Creek
website portal or with a written message submitted to the City Manager's
office.
      (4)   The member of the public body who will be absent from a public
meeting due to military duty shall be permitted to participate in, and vote on,
business before the public body in a manner determined by the City I.T.
Director, or their designee, to ensure two-way communication wherever feasible,
ideally utilizing a form of teleconferencing whenever possible.
      (5)   The member of the public body who will be absent from a meeting due
to military duty shall be considered to be present at the public meeting for
purposes of this chapter when that member has participated in that meeting
pursuant to subsection (4).
   IV.
   The Mayor shall preside at all meetings of the Commission and maintain
order. In the Mayor’s absence, the Vice-Mayor shall preside. The Mayor may
speak on all points and shall decide questions of order, subject to an appeal.
The Mayor shall vote on all questions, subject to Rule III. The Mayor shall put
all questions for a vote of the Commission. If both the Mayor and the Vice-
Mayor are absent, then the remaining Commissioners may, by majority vote, elect
one of their members to preside at any meeting where both the Mayor and Vice-
Mayor are absent.
   V.
   The City Clerk, or someone designated by the City Manager, shall attend all
meetings of the Commission, record attendance and cause to be kept correct
minutes of the proceedings. The Clerk shall cause such minutes to be printed,
with copies thereof to be placed in the files of the Mayor and the
Commissioners, and upon approval of the minutes by the Commission, one copy,
certified by the Mayor and the Clerk, shall be kept by the Clerk as and for the
official record of the proceedings of the Commission.
   VI.
   It shall be the duty of the Clerk to publish and/or post all ordinances or
notices in accordance with the requirements of the statutes of the State and
the Charter of the City and as directed by the Commission. The City Clerk is
hereby designated as a person to post notices of all meetings of the City
Commission.
   VII.
   It shall be the duty of the City Manager to prepare an agenda for each
Commissioner, setting forth the order of business for the meeting and the
matters to come before the meeting, together with a copy of each
resolution, ordinance and communication to be considered by the Commission at
that meeting. This agenda shall be available and delivered to each Commissioner
not later than 5:00 p.m. on the Thursday prior to the regular meeting.
   VIII.
   All ordinances shall be in writing and shall be introduced in the following
manner:
   Any member of the Commission may, at the time provided for the introduction
of ordinances in the regular order of business, or at any time agreed to by the
rest of the Commission, request the Clerk to read the title of the proposed
ordinance. After the Clerk has read the title of the proposed ordinance, any
member may move that the ordinance be introduced. If this motion is seconded, a
vote shall be taken on the question of whether the ordinance may be introduced.
If a majority of the members elect of the Commission approve the introduction
of the ordinance, it shall thereafter be regarded as having been introduced.
Ordinances may be referred to by reference to the entire title of the ordinance
or by a short title.
   No ordinance shall be adopted unless it has been introduced within sixty
days of the date it is to be adopted. Unless otherwise provided by law, an
ordinance shall be adopted when approved by a majority vote of the elected
members of the City Commission after it has been moved and seconded that the
ordinance, in its entirety and as amended, be adopted, and it can be referred
to in such motion by its short title.
   All resolutions considered by the City Commission shall be in writing with a
summary included and the resolution or the summary thereof shall be read by the
Clerk before a vote is taken. Resolutions shall be moved and seconded by
Commissioners selected by the Mayor, on a rotating basis, at each meeting, for
that purpose. Resolutions, motions and questions shall require a second before
a vote is taken and shall require an affirmative vote of a majority of the
members elect office Commission for adoption or passage, unless otherwise
provided by law.
   IX.
   The Mayor or any Commissioner may request that an ordinance or resolution be
prepared by either the City Manager or the City Attorney and that it be placed
on the agenda for consideration by the Commission in accordance with these
Rules; provided, however, that any such request must be in writing, in a format
prescribed by the City Attorney, and be co-sponsored in writing by two
additional members of the City Commission, including basic detail of the
proposed resolution or ordinance and demonstrating the informed support thereof
of the two additional members, to best ensure the judicious use of staff time
and efforts. Upon receipt of such a request, it shall be the duty of the City
Manager or the City Attorney to prepare such ordinance or resolution and file
it with the City Clerk to be placed on the agenda for the meeting at which it
is to be considered in accordance with such request.
   X.
   The order of business at meetings of the Commission shall be as follows,
except when otherwise agreed to by the Commissioners:
   (1)   Invocation;
   (2)   Pledge of Allegiance;
   (3)   Proclamations and awards;
   (4)   Chair notes any added or deleted resolutions;

   (4)   To postpone to a certain day;
   (5)   To commit;
   (6)   To amend;
   (7)   To postpone indefinitely.
   XII.
   Insofar as Robert's Rules of Order are not inconsistent with the statutes of
the State, the Charter of the City or these Rules of Procedure, such Robert's
Rules of Order shall govern the proceedings of the Commission when applicable.
   XIII.
   These Rules may be amended from time to time by a majority vote of the
Commission.
   XIV.
   These Rules or any of them may be temporarily suspended only after an
affirmative vote by a majority of the elected members of the Commission.
   XV.
   At the first meeting of each new City Commission referred to in Section
2.9 of the City Charter, the City Clerk shall call the meeting to order and
immediately proceed to administer the oath of office to the newly elected Mayor
and Commissioners, who shall thereupon assume their duties and places as Mayor
and Commissioners.
   The Commission shall then proceed to the election of the Vice-Mayor. The
Vice-Mayor shall be elected by a majority vote of the elected qualified members
of the City Commission, including the Mayor, at the foregoing meeting in such
manner as the City Commission may in its discretion determine. After the
election, the Vice-Mayor shall immediately assume the duties of that office.
   XVI.
   Closed meetings of the City Commission shall only be held for the purposes
and in accordance with the provisions of Act 267 of the Public Acts of the
State for 1976, the same being the so-called "Open Meetings Act."
   XVII.
   It is the desire of the City Commission to encourage public expression in
the course of its meetings. Such expression can be integral to the decision-
making process of the City Commission. It is the intention of the City
Commission to respect the rights of persons addressing the Commission. Public
comment periods are a time for citizens to make comments; they are not intended
as a forum for debate or to engage in question-answer dialogues with the
Commission or staff. Commissioners are encouraged not to directly respond to
speakers during public comment periods. At the conclusion of the speaker’s
remarks, the Mayor or individual Commissioners may refer a question to City
staff, if appropriate. Also, individual Commissioners may choose to respond to
speakers during the “Commission Comment” period.
   It is with these aims in mind, so as to promote decorum and civility and an
orderly process for conducting its public business meetings, that the following
rules concerning public comments, consistent with applicable law, are adopted
by the City Commission.
   (1)   Persons attending a regular or special Commission Meeting shall be
permitted to address the City Commission in conformity with this rule. The
opportunity to address the Commission shall be limited to the following:
      (a)   Persons desiring to address the City Commission are encouraged, but
shall not be required, to fill out and turn in to either the City Clerk, Mayor,
or presiding Commissioner, prior to the meeting, a comment card disclosing the
following information: The person's name, address, and telephone number; the
specific issue, topic or resolution the individual wishes to address.
      (b)   During public hearings when scheduled, but only when the law
requires a separate period of public comment, speakers may present facts and
opinions on the specific matter being heard by the Commission. A three-minute
time limit is imposed per speaker. In the discretion of the Mayor or presiding
officer, the time limit for individual speakers may be lengthened or shortened
when appropriate.
      (c)   During the public comment period on any specific agenda item,
whether it be a public hearing, an ordinance introduction or adoption, a
consent agenda item, or a resolution not on the consent agenda, each speaker
may address the Commission once, regarding anything on the meeting agenda, for
a total not to exceed four minutes regardless of how many agenda items the
speaker is addressing, which time period may be lengthened or shortened by the
Mayor or presiding officer when appropriate.
      (d)   During the General Public Comment portion of the meeting, speakers
may address the City Commission on any matter within the control and
jurisdiction of the City of Battle Creek. A speaker shall be permitted to
address the City Commission once, for up to three minutes, during this portion
of the meeting.
      (e)   Applicants or Appellants, as defined below, or an attorney retained
to represent them, are not bound by the specific time limitations set out above
but may have the amount of time deemed reasonably necessary by the Mayor or
presiding official to present their case to the City Commission without
violating the rules set out below in subsection 4(a) through (g), with which
they are obligated to comply.
         (i)   Applicant is defined an individual or business entity seeking a
City Commission final decision on a matter for which the individual has made
application to the City based upon a specific provision in a City Ordinance or
state statute for permission to take a specific action;
         (ii)   Appellant is an individual appealing a decision of a City
official or an inferior body based upon a specific provision in City ordinances
entitling the individual to appeal the decision to the City Commission.
   (2)   An individual wishing to address the City Commission shall wait to be
recognized by the Mayor or presiding Commissioner before speaking. An
individual who has not filled out a card requesting to address the City
Commission shall raise their hand and wait to be recognized by the Mayor or
presiding Commissioner before speaking and shall identify themselves by name
and address and, if appropriate, group affiliation for the record.
   (3)   Speakers shall address all remarks to the Mayor, or the presiding
Commissioner or official, and not to individual Commissioners or staff members.
Speakers shall not address their remarks to members of the public in attendance
at the meeting.
   (4)   A speaker will be ruled out-of-order by the Mayor or presiding
Commissioner and the Commission will continue with its business, and the
speaker may be required to leave the meeting after having been ruled out-of-
order for a breach of the peace committed at the meeting as permitted by the
OMA, when the speaker violates above sub-section 3 or the following:
      (a)   Becomes repetitive or speaks longer than the allotted time;
      (b)   Attempts to yield any unused portion of time to other speakers;
      (c)   Engages in a personal attack upon a city employee, administrator or
Commissioner only if the personal attack is totally unrelated to the manner in
which the employee, administrator or Commissioner carries out their public
duties or office;
      (d)   Uses obscene or profane language;
      (e)   Engages in slanderous or defamatory speech;
      (f)   Uses derogatory racial, sexual or ethnic slurs or epithets relating
to any individual or category of persons; or
      (g)   Engages in conduct that interrupts or disrupts the meeting.
   (5)   Individuals attending City Commission meetings or workshops, excluding
City staff, shall not pass the commission chambers bar upon which the podium is
affixed (and which divides the audience section from the well of the chambers)
without having been invited to do so by the Mayor or official presiding over
the meeting, or after requesting and explicitly being granted permission to do
so. Any individual violating this subsection will be ruled out-of-order by the
Mayor or presiding official and the individual may be required to leave the
meeting for a breach of the peace committed at the meeting as permitted by the
OMA.
   XVIII.
   Whenever any board, committee, authority, council, agency or organization
requests or recommends that the Commission take action with respect to any
matter, whether it be by motion, resolution or ordinance, such request shall
include satisfactory evidence showing that such request or recommendation has
been approved by such board, committee, authority or the governing board of
such agency or organization.
   XIX.
   The Mayor and City Commissioners shall be entitled to reimbursement for
travel and other expenses while on City business subject to the same terms and
conditions as are in effect for City employees.
   XX.
   The Mayor may appoint committees of Commissioners or Commissioners and
others to study and make recommendations to the Commission. At no time shall
any single committee have a majority of the City Commission as members.
   XXI.
   In the preparation of the agenda, the City Manager may, when having
determined that receipt of a report, petition or communication, or the approval
of a request from a group or individual, or a resolution of the City
Commission, is of a routine nature, place those reports, petitions,
communications, requests or resolutions on a consent agenda as set forth in
Rule X of these Rules for the consideration of the Commission at one time.
   The numbering of ordinances placed on the agenda shall be consecutive and
based upon the calendar year in which an ordinance or amendment is first
introduced, regardless of the year in which it was adopted. At the first
meeting of the City Commission each year, ordinance numbering shall begin at
the number one, followed by the year, e.g., the first ordinance introduction
for the year 2022 shall be in the following format: Ordinance #01-2022. In
January of the following year, ordinance numbering shall begin again at “01”
again, followed by the year.
   The numbering of resolutions placed on the agenda shall be consecutive based
upon the two- year cycle of each new City Commission referred to in
Section 2.9 of the City Charter. The numbering of resolutions shall begin again
at “Resolution #1” at the first meeting following the biennial Organizational
Meeting in November of every even year.
   At the meeting, at the time on the agenda for the consideration of the
consent agenda, a Commissioner shall move and a second Commissioner shall
support adoption of the consent agenda. There will be no discussion of this
motion except that any Commissioner, the City Manager or the City Attorney may
request that a specific item be removed from the consent agenda and it shall
stand removed without further action necessary. The consent agenda may then be
adopted by voice vote.
   The matter so removed shall be considered at its appropriate time during the
meeting according to the order of business of Rule X. When a matter which has
been removed from the consent agenda comes up in the regular course of
business, the normal rules of discussion shall apply.
   The City Manager is hereby authorized to include the following items on a
consent agenda:
   CITY COMMISSION AGENDA CONSENT ITEMS
MINUTES, PETITIONS, COMMUNICATIONS, REPORTS:
    1.   Approval of minutes;
    2.   City Manager's report;

212.05 CODE OF ETHICS FOR CITY COMMISSIONERS.
   (a)   Preamble.
      (1)   The citizens of Battle Creek are entitled to have fair, ethical and
accountable local government that has earned the public's full confidence for
integrity.
      (2)   Furthermore, the effective functioning of democratic government
requires that public officials, both elected and appointed, comply with both
the letter and spirit of the laws and policies affecting the operations of
government; public officials be independent, impartial and fair in their
judgment and actions; public office be used for the public good, not for
personal gain; and public deliberations and processes be conducted openly,
unless legally confidential, in an atmosphere of respect and civility.
      (3)   To this end, the Battle Creek Commissions adopts this Code of
Ethics for Battle Creek City Commissioners to assure public confidence in the
integrity of local government and its effective and fair operation.
   (b)   Code of Ethics.
      (1)   Acts in the public interest. Recognizing that stewardship of the
public interest must be their primary concern, City Commissioners will work for
the common good of the people of Battle Creek and not for any private or
personal interest, and they will assure fair and equal treatment of all
persons, claims, and transactions coming before the Battle Creek City
Commission. City Commissioners shall also abide by the model of excellence
provided for in below
212.05 (c).
      (2)   Compliance with law. City Commissioners shall comply with the laws
of the nation, the State of Michigan, and the City of Battle Creek in the
performance of their public duties. These laws include, but are not limited to:
the United States and Michigan constitutions; the Battle Creek City Charter;
laws pertaining to conflicts of interest, contracts with public entities,
election campaigns, financial disclosures, employer responsibilities, and open
processes of government; and City ordinances and policies.
      (3)   Respect for process. City Commissioners shall perform their duties
in accordance with the processes and rules of order established by the City
Commission governing the deliberation of public policy issues, meaningful
involvement of the public, and implementation of policy decisions of the City
Commission by City staff.
      (4)   Conduct of public meetings. City Commissioners shall prepare
themselves for public issues, listen courteously and attentively to all public
discussions before the body, and focus on the business at hand. They shall
refrain from interrupting other speakers, making comments not germane to the
business of the body, or otherwise interfering with the orderly conduct of
meetings. They shall not post or comment on social media, send or respond to
emails, or send or respond to text messages, during a public meeting so as to
avoid an Open Meetings Act violation or the appearance of one; this prohibition
shall not include sending or responding to emails or text messages with staff
regarding procedural matters related to the meeting, or any communications with
the City Attorney, or the attorney designee, on legal matters, which are
privileged.
      (5)   Communication. City Commissioners shall publicly share substantive
information that is relevant to a matter under consideration by the City
Commission, which they may have received from sources outside of the public
decision-making process.
      (6)   Full disclosure.
         A.   A City Commissioner in the performance of their public duties
shall not act upon any matter in which they have a material financial interest,
or where they have a legal or fiduciary duty to another organization or entity
or personal relationship that may give the appearance of a conflict of
interest, without disclosing the full nature and extent of the interest to the
other members of the City Commission on the official record. Such disclosure
must be made before the time to perform their duty or concurrently with the
performance of the duty.
         B.   The disclosure required by this subsection shall not supplant,
but instead shall supplement, any disclosure of a personal, contractual,
financial, business, employment or pecuniary interest required by state
statute.
      (7)   Gifts, favors, and loans.
         A.   A City Commissioner shall refrain from financial and business
dealings that would tend to reflect adversely on the Commissioner impartiality,
interfere with the performance of their public duties or exploit their official
position. A City Commissioner should not take any special advantage of
services, goods or opportunity for personal gain that is not available to the
public in general.
         B.   A City Commissioner and any family member claimed as a dependent
of the Commissioner shall refrain from soliciting or accepting any gifts, loans
or favors except that a Commission and a family member claimed as a dependent
of the Commissioner may:
            1.   Accept a gift or honorarium, not exceeding a value of one
hundred dollars ($100.00), for services rendered in the performance of their
public duties or other activity devoted to the improvement of cities,
communities and the lives of citizens.
            2.   Accept ordinary social hospitality; a gift, bequest, favor or
loan from a relative; a wedding or engagement gift; a loan in the regular
course of business from a lending institution on the same terms as generally
available to the public; and a scholarship, grant or fellowship awarded on the
same terms as applied to other applicants.
            3.   Accept any other gift, favor or loan only if the donor is not
a person or entity whose interests have come or are likely to come before the
City Commission.
            4.   Solicit and accept campaign contributions.
      (8)   Confidential information. City Commissioners shall respect the
confidentiality of information concerning the property, personnel or affairs of
the City. They shall neither disclose nor divulge to an unauthorized person
confidential information acquired in the course of their duties in advance of
the time prescribed for its authorized release to the public without proper
legal authorization, nor use such information to advance their personal,
financial or other private interests.
      (9)   Use of public resources. Public resources, including City staff
time, equipment, supplies, and facilities, not available to the public in
general shall only be used for the benefit of the public and not for a City
Commissioner's personal or private use.
      (10)   Representation of private interests. In keeping with their role as
stewards of the public interest, a City Commissioner shall not appear on behalf
of the private interests of third parties, including their spouses and family
members within the third degree of consanguinity to the City Commissioner or
their spouse, before the City Commission or any board, committee, commission or
proceeding of the City.
      (11)   Advocacy. City Commissioners shall represent the official policies
or positions of the City Commission to the best of their ability when
designated as delegates for this purpose. When presenting their individual
opinions and positions, City Commissioners shall neither state nor imply that
they represent the opinions or positions of the City Commission or the City of
Battle Creek.
      (12)   Policy role of members.
         A.   City Commissioners shall respect and adhere to the Commission-
manager structure of Battle Creek City government as outlined by the Battle
Creek City Charter. In this structure, the City Commission determines the
policies of the City with the advice, information, and analysis provided by the
public, subordinate boards, committees and commissions, and City staff.
         B.   City Commissioners therefore shall not interfere with the
administrative functions of the City or the professional duties of City staff;
nor shall they impair the ability of staff to implement City Commission policy
decisions.
      (13)   Independence of boards and commissions. Because of the value of
the independent advice of subordinate boards, committees, and commissions to
the public decision-making process, members of the City Commission shall,
except when the Commissioner is a member of the public body, limit their
participation in the proceedings of such subordinate public bodies to the
communication of requested information and providing factual information
relevant to the discussion at hand and shall not otherwise attempt to unduly
influence the deliberations or outcomes of the proceedings.
      (14)   Positive workplace environment.
         A.   City Commissioners shall support the maintenance of a positive
and constructive workplace environment for City employees and for citizens and
businesses dealing with the City. City Commissioners shall recognize their
special role in dealings with City employees so as to in no way create the
perception of inappropriate direction to staff nor, except for the purpose of
inquiry, give specific orders to subordinates of the City Manager or City
Attorney.
         B.   Because City Commissioner actions and comments contribute to the
environment in which all City employees must work, in order to create and
promote a positive work environment under no circumstances shall a City
Commissioner, either in public or private, intimidate, humiliate, or otherwise
abuse a City employee.
      (15)   Compliance and enforcement.
         A.   1.   This Code of Ethics for Battle Creek City Commissioners
expresses standards of ethical conduct expected for members of the Battle Creek
City Commission. City Commissioners themselves have the primary responsibility
to assure that they understand and meet the ethical standards expressed in this
code of ethics and that the public can continue to have full confidence in the
integrity of government.
            2.   As provided in Robert’s Rules of Order, 11th Ed., “Formal
disciplinary procedures should generally be regarded as a drastic step reserved
for serious situations or those potentially so. When it appears that such
measures may become necessary, proper and tactful handling of the case is of
prime importance. It is usually in the best interests of the organization first
to make every effort to obtain a satisfactory resolution of the matter quietly
and informally.
         B.   All City Commissioners shall have a responsibility to intervene
when they learn of actions of another City Commissioner that appear to be in
violation of the Code of Ethics. Upon acquiring reasonable suspicion of a
violation of the Code of Ethics, Commissioners may meet this responsibility by:
            1.   Requesting that the Mayor, and/or Vice Mayor, personally meet
with the Commissioner and notify that person of the suspected violation, and/
or;
            2.   Consistent with Charter Section
2.9, any three Commissioners requiring the setting of a public hearing at a
regular or special meeting of the City Commission to determine whether a
violation of the Code of Ethics occurred and, if so, what sanctions shall be
imposed for the violation. Such public hearing may only be cancelled with the
approval of the majority of the persons who initiated the hearing being set.
         C.   Hearing process. If it has been determined that it is appropriate
to set a public hearing as provided in subsection B.2. above, then within
thirty days of the alleged violation, or within thirty days of reasonably
acquiring knowledge of the alleged violation, a date for a public hearing shall
be set. This time limitation shall not prohibit the introduction of evidence of
a prior perceived violation that occurred more than thirty days before setting
a date in order to demonstrate a continuing pattern of conduct if it is an
alleged violation of the same rule prompting the setting of a hearing. The
following process shall be followed when it is determined that a public hearing
should be set to determine whether a violation has occurred and what sanctions,
if any, shall be imposed:
            1.   All Commissioners, including the one accused of a violation,
shall be provided a written summary of the facts giving rise to the charge(s)
against the Commissioner believed to have violated the Code of Ethics at least
ten days prior to the date set for the public hearing;
            2.   The Mayor, or the Vice Mayor if the Mayor is either the
subject of the alleged violation or is unavailable, shall preside over the
public hearing. If both the Mayor and the Vice Mayor are subjects of the
perceived violation, then the most tenured Commissioner shall preside over the
public hearing(s). If there is a question as to which Commissioner is most
tenured, then a majority vote of the remaining Commissioners shall determine
who between them shall preside. The individual presiding over the hearing shall
have the right to determine whether the evidence presented against the
Commissioner, or in defense of the Commissioner, is germane to the charge(s)
against the Commissioner and preclude its consideration if determined not to be
germane;
            3.   The hearing shall be conducted informally. Without usurping
the power granted to the City Commission as a body by Charter Section
12.10, the City Commission is discouraged from issuing any subpoenas to compel
witnesses to testify at an ethics hearing as provided for in this ordinance
section. Witnesses shall be sworn by the City Clerk ortheir designated
representative at that meeting so long as the designee is a notary public and/
or authorized to administer oaths. The City Commission, as a body, and the
Commissioner accused of an Ethics Code violation shall each be entitled to have
their own attorney present at the special meeting and the ethics hearing
portion of the meeting for consultation; however, there shall be no right for
attorneys to make an opening statement, question witnesses, present evidence,
argue whether testimony or evidence is admissible, or make a closing argument
on behalf of their respective client. Neither the federal, nor the Michigan,
Rules of Evidence or of Civil Procedure shall apply. Any Commissioner(s) shall
have a right to ask questions of witnesses, except as later provided in this
rule.
               a.   The Commissioner who is the subject of the hearing shall
have a right to present witnesses in their defense after the presiding official
has presented all evidence supporting a violation. The Commissioner who is the
subject of the hearing shall not have a right to cross-examine witnesses;
however, they may have ten minutes to present closing comments at the
conclusion of evidence to respond to the evidence presented against them. The
Commissioner who is the subject of the hearing may request and be granted not
more than one additional ten-minute period for closing comments (not to exceed
twenty minutes total) if a motion is made, supported, and approved by majority
vote of the remaining Commissioners.
               b.   At the conclusion of the presentation of evidence or the
closing comments of the Commissioner accused of a violation, whichever shall
occur later, Commissioners (except the Commissioner who is the subject of the
hearing) shall vote to determine whether or not they believe a violation(s) of
the Code of Ethics has occurred, with a simple majority vote of Commissioners
present being required to make the determination.
         D.   The City Commission may impose sanctions on City Commissioners
whose conduct does not comply with the City’s ethical standards. After a
majority vote finding a violation of the Code of Ethics, a second vote shall
take place to determine, based upon a simple majority, what sanctions, if any,
shall be imposed. Sanctions may include reprimand, formal censure, loss of
committee assignment, restrictions on budget or travel, and removal from office
by the governor in the manner and for the causes provided by law. Sanctions
shall be determined based upon the perceived severity level (one, two, or
three) of the violation, with the following guidance:
            1.   Level One. For a level one violation, the penalty options
shall include a verbal reprimand during a conversation with the Mayor or Vice
Mayor, or an additional and/or greater sanction as may be determined
appropriate by the majority of the Commission voting. A violation of
212.05 (b)(3), (4), (5), (7)A., (7)B., (9), (10), (11), (12)A., (12)B., (13)
and/or (14)A., B. shall minimally result in a Level One sanction.
            2.   Level Two. For a level two violation, the penalty options
shall include censure, which shall be defined as a formal resolution of the
City Commission for specified conduct and/or a greater sanction as may be
determined appropriate by the majority of the Commission voting. A second Level
One violation within six months of a prior violation found by the Commission,
or a first violation of
212.05 (b)(1), (6)A., (6)B., or (8) shall minimally result in a Level Two
sanction. Depending upon the severity of the violation, a first violation of
212.05 (b)(7) may result in a Level Two sanction.
            3.   Level Three. For a level three violation, the penalty options
shall include censure and/or a petition to the Governor for removal. A third
Level One violation, or a second Level Two violation within six months of a
prior violation found by the Commission, or a first violation of
212.05 (b)(2) may result in a Level Three sanction.
         E.   A violation of this Code of Ethics shall not be considered a
basis for challenging the validity of a City Commission decision.
      (16)   Implementation.
         A.   As an expression of the standards of conduct for City
Commissioners expected by the public, this Code of Ethics is intended to be
self-enforcing. It therefore becomes most effective when City Commissioners are
thoroughly familiar with it and embrace its provisions. In order to help ensure
this familiarity, a biennial workshop shall be held after the general election
in every even-numbered year, but not later than 60 days after the general
election, for training to be provided by Michigan Municipal League (MML) and
the City Attorney regarding the role and duties of a City Commissioner and the
obligations set out in this Ethics Code and Model of Excellence. All
Commissioners shall be obligated to attend this workshop, or a make-up session
as soon as can be practicably scheduled if they are unable to attend the
scheduled workshop. In addition, any Commissioners appointed to complete the
vacated term of a previously elected Commissioner pursuant to Charter Section
2.6 shall also be obligated to attend a make-up session of the biennial
workshop as provided for in this subsection within 60 days of their
appointment.
         B.   Every organizational meeting during which the Mayor and
Commissioners are sworn into office and elect the Vice Mayor, each City
Commissioner shall sign a statement affirming that they have read and
understand the Code of Ethics for Battle Creek City Commissioners. The
statement signed by each Commissioner shall be collected and retained by the
City Attorney Office.
         C.   The Ethics Policy and Rules of Procedure Review Committee shall
meet as necessary, but in any case at least once during the two-year cycle of
each new City Commission referred to in Section
2.9  of the City Charter to review the Meeting Rules and Code of Ethics for
Battle Creek City Commissioners. It shall provide any amendment recommendations
to the City Commission for consideration as an Ordinance amendment.
   (c)   Commissioner Statement of Acknowledgment.

214.01 INTENT, PURPOSE AND CONSTRUCTION.
   (a)   It is the intent of the City of Battle Creek that no person be denied
the equal protection of the laws; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment
of his or her civil rights or be discriminated against because of his or her

216.01 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as "The Special Assessment
Ordinance."
(1975 Code Sec. 1.91)
216.02 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Improvement" means any public improvement, the whole or any part of
the cost of which is to be assessed against one or more lots or parcels of land
to be especially benefited thereby, in proportion to the benefit to be derived
therefrom.
   (b)   "Cost," when referring to the cost of any improvement, includes the
cost of surveys, plans, land, rights of way, spreading of rolls, notices,
advertising, financing and construction and all other costs incident to the
making of such improvement, the special assessments therefor and the financing
thereof.
(1975 Code Sec. 1.92)
216.03 AUTHORITY OF CITY COMMISSION.
   The City Commission has the power to determine that the whole or any part of
the cost of any improvement shall be defrayed by special assessments upon the
property specially benefited. However, such determination shall not be made
until the preliminary proceedings provided for in Section
216.05 are completed.
(1975 Code Sec. 1.93)
216.04 PETITIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS.
   The City Commission, in order to ascertain whether or not a reasonable
number of property owners to be assessed desires any particular improvement to
be made, may request and receive a petition therefor, or may receive such a
petition voluntarily presented. However, in either event, such petition shall
be advisory only and shall not be jurisdictional, except in cases where such a
petition is specifically made jurisdictional by State statutes. Such petition
shall be submitted on forms approved by the City Manager and shall be furnished
by the City. The City is not required to construct any improvement petitioned
for and may proceed to construct an improvement without a petition having been
filed.
(1975 Code Sec. 1.94)
216.05 PRELIMINARY PROCEEDINGS.
   Before determining to make any improvement, any part of the cost of which is
to be defrayed by special assessment, the City Commission shall, by resolution,
require the City Manager to prepare, or cause to be prepared, plans and
specifications therefor and an estimate of the cost thereof, and to file the
same with the City Clerk, together with his recommendation as to what portion
of the cost should be paid by special assessment and what part, if any, should
be a general obligation of the City, the number of installments in which
assessments may be paid and the land which should be included in the special
assessment district. After the report is filed with the Clerk, it shall be
presented to the Commission and such report shall be available for public
examination.
   Whenever any land which should be included in the special assessment
district is not assessed because it is owned by a public agency, a written
agreement may be reached providing for the payment of such agency's benefiting
share of the cost of the improvement. This agreement, or advice that such
agreement cannot be reached, shall be presented to the Commission prior to the
adoption by the Commission of the resolution provided for in Section
216.06.
   Whenever any property is acquired by condemnation or otherwise for the
purpose of any improvement, the cost thereof and of the proceedings required to
acquire such property may be added to the cost of such improvement.
(1975 Code Sec. 1.95)
216.06 DETERMINATIONS OF CITY COMMISSION; SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ROLL.
   After the report is presented to the City Commission, the Commission may, by
resolution, approve the plans, specifications and estimate of cost and
determine to make the improvement and to defray the whole or any part of the
cost of the improvement by special assessment upon the property especially
benefited in proportion to the benefits thereto. By such resolution the
Commission shall approve the plans and specifications for the improvement;
determine the estimated cost thereof; determine the estimated life of such
improvement; determine what portion of the cost shall be paid by special
assessment upon the property especially benefited and what part, if any, shall
be a general obiligation of the City; determine the number of installments in
which assessments may be paid and the rate of interest to be charged on unpaid
assessments and installments; designate the district or land and premises upon
which special assessments shall be levied; and direct the City Assessor to
prepare a special assessment roll in accordance with the Comnission's
determination.
   Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the Commission may, at its
discretion, delay the preparation of a special assessment roll until after the
completion of the improvement, in which case the actual cost thereof shall be
reported to the Commission and a special assessment roll shall then be made,
based upon such actual cost, in accordance with the procedure set forth in this
chapter.
(1975 Code Sec. 1.96)
216.07 PREPARATION OF ROLL.
   The City Assessor shall thereupon prepare a special assessment roll,
including all lots and parcels of land within the special assessment district
designated by the City Commission, and shall assess to each such lot or parcel
of land such relative portion of the whole sum to be levied against all the
lands in the special assessment district as the benefit to such lot or parcel
of land bears to the total benefit to all lands in such district. There shall
also be entered upon such roll the amount which has been assessed to the City
at large, if any.
(1975 Code Sec. 1.97)
216.08 FILING OF ROLL.
   When the City Assessor has completed such assessment roll the Assessor shall
attach thereto or endorse thereon a certificate, certifying that such roll has
been made pursuant to a resolution of the City Commission, giving the date of
the adoption of such resolution and stating that in making the assessments
therein the Assessor has, using the Assessor’s best judgment, conformed in all
respects to the directions contained in such resolution, the City Charter and
the provisions of this chapter. The Assessor shall then file in the office of
the City Clerk a copy of such certificate, certifying that such special
assessment roll is on file in the Assessor’s office and is available for public
inspection.
(1975 Code Sec. 1.98; Ord. 02-2022. Passed 2-15-22.)
216.09 PUBLIC HEARING; NOTICE.
   Upon receipt of such certificate the City Commission shall fix a time and
place when it will meet and review the assessment roll, as well as hear all
persons who desire to be heard concerning the necessity of making the
improvement, and shall direct the City Clerk to give notice of such hearing.
Such notice shall specify the time and place of such hearing and shall be
published once in a daily newspaper circulated in the City not less than ten
days prior to the date of such hearing. A ten-day notice shall also be sent by
the City Assessor to each owner of property subject to assessment, as indicated
by the records of the City Assessor's office. However, failure to send such
notice to any such owner of property, or the failure of such owner to receive
such notice, shall not invalidate the proceedings or any assessment. The
hearing required by this section may be adjourned from time to time and may be
held at any regular, adjourned or special meeting of the City Commission. At
such hearing all interested persons or parties shall be given an opportunity to
be heard. The City Assessor, with the assessment roll, and the City Manager,
shall be present at such hearing.
(1975 Code Sec. 1.99)
216.10 OBJECTIONS TO ROLL.
   Any person who feels aggrieved by a special assessment roll or the
determination of the necessity of making the proposed improvement shall file
their objections thereto in writing with the City Clerk prior to the close of
such hearing or any adjournment thereof. Such written objections shall specify
in detail the reasons such person is aggrieved.
(1975 Code Sec. 1.100; Ord. 02-2022. Passed 2-15-22.)
216.11 CONFIRMATION.
   The City Commission shall meet and review the special assessment roll at the
time and place appointed, as provided in Section
216.09, or at an adjourned date therefor, and shall consider any written
objection thereto as well as all objections concerning the necessity of making
the proposed improvement. The Commission may correct such roll as to any
assessment or description of any lot or parcel of land or any other error
appearing therein. Any change made in such roll shall be noted in the
Commission's minutes. After such hearing and review, the Commission may confirm
such special assessment roll with such corrections as it may have made, if any,
or may refer it back to the City Assessor for revision, or may annul it and any
proceedings in connection therewith. Upon confirmation of any special
assessment roll, the Commission shall determine the number of installments in
which the assessment may be paid, which shall in no case exceed fifteen in
number, and shall determine the rate of interest to be charged on unpaid
assessments and installments, which shall in no case exceed an interest rate
prohibited by law. The Clerk shall endorse the date of confirmation upon each
special assessment roll.
216.12 ATTACHMENT OF LIENS.
   All special assessments contained in any special assessment roll, including
any part thereof deferred as to payment, shall, from the date of confirmation
of such roll, constitute a lien upon the respective lots or parcels of land
assessed and until paid shall be a charge against the respective owners of the
lots or parcels of land. Such lien shall be of the same character and effect as
the lien created for City taxes and shall include accrued interest and
penalties. No judgment or decree, nor any act of the City Commission vacating a
special assessment, shall destroy or impair the lien of the City upon the
premises assessed for such amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged
against the same, or as by a regular mode of proceeding might be lawfully
assessed thereon.
(1975 Code Sec. 1.102)
216.13 SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS FOR LEGALLY RENDERED CITY SERVICES.

single premises, which expense is chargeable against such premises and the
owner thereof under the provisions of the City Charter or any provision of
these Codified Ordinances or the law of the State, and is not of that class
required to be prorated among several lots and parcels of land in a special
assessment district, an account of the labor, materials or services for which
such expense was incurred, verified by the City Manager, with a description of
the lot and the name of the owner, if known, shall be reported to the City
Treasurer, who shall immediately bill the owner, if known. Such bill shall be
sent by first class mail to the owner of the property to be assessed.
   (c)   The expense of the legally rendered City services and associated
administrative fees shall become a debt owed to the City from the occupant or
owner of such property and shall be collected as any other debt to the City,
and if not paid within thirty days after billing, shall become a lien in favor
of the City against the said benefitted property. The lien shall be assessed
the same as real property taxes are assessed and levied.
(Ord. 02-2022. Passed 2-15-22.)
216.14 GENERAL PROCEDURE INAPPLICABLE. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section 216.14 was repealed by Ordinance 24-85, passed
September 3, 1985.)
216.15 HANDLING OF ASSESSMENT ROLL.
   The assessment roll shall be transmitted by the City Assessor to the City
Treasurer for collection immediately after its confirmation. The Treasurer
shall divide the assessments into installments when so ordered by the City
Commission. However, if such a division operates to make any installment less
than ten dollars ($10.00), then the Treasurer shall reduce the number of
installments so that each installment is above but as near to ten dollars
($10.00) as possible. The Treasurer shall mail statements of the several
assessments to the respective owners, as indicated by the records of the
Treasurer, of the lots and parcels of land assessed, stating the amount of the
assessment and the manner in which it may be paid. However, failure to mail any
such statement shall not invalidate the assessment or entitle the owner to an
extension of time within which to pay the assessment.
(1975 Code Sec. 1.105)
216.16 PAYMENT.
   Unless otherwise provided in the resolution confirming the assessment roll,
the assessment, or the first installment thereof, if divided into installments,
shall be due and payable upon confirmation of the roll. The whole or any part
of any special assessment may be paid at any time within sixty days immediately
following the date of confirmation of a special assessment without interest or
penalty being charged. Upon the expiration of such sixty-day period, the City
Treasurer shall transmit the special assessment roll, with all payments upon
such assessments noted thereon, to the City Assessor. The Assessor shall spread
such assessments, or the first installment thereof, if divided into
installments, upon either the first or second annual City tax roll which is
prepared subsequent to the date of confirmation of such assessment, as is
provided for in the resolution of the City Commission confirming such
assessment. Thereafter, one installment of each special assessment which has
been divided into installments shall be spread upon each annual City tax roll
until the full amount of the special assessment has been paid. After the
expiration of the sixty-day period provided herein, any assessment or
installment may be discharged by paying the face amount thereof, plus interest
to the date of such payment. However, the Commission may, in the resolution
confirming any special assessment, provide for a collection fee to be charged
which shall not exceed five percent of the amount of any special assessment or,
when divided into installments, which shall not exceed five percent of the
amount of each installment, which collection fee shall be collected by the City
Treasurer. The Commission shall provide, in the resolution confirming all
special assessments, the rate of interest to be charged, which may be in any
amount permitted by law, but at least the same rate set by the bond sale for
that project, on such assessment or each installment thereof when divided into
installments. The City Treasurer shall collect all interest and penalties
provided for in this chapter or in any resolution confirming a special
assessment and shall have the same rights and remedies with respect to the
collection of special assessments, together with the interest thereon and the
collection fees, as provided in the City Charter and State statutes for the
collection of City taxes. Should any installment of a special assessment be
unpaid at the time the tax roll of which it is a part is returnable to the
County Treasurer for collection, all remaining deferred installments of such
special assessment against that parcel of real estate shall become forthwith
due and payable and the entire remaining balance of such special assessment,
together with interest and penalties thereon, shall be returned to the County
Treasurer for collection.
(Ord. 28-81. Passed 12-15-81.)
216.17 DETERMINING COST OF IMPROVEMENT.
   Upon the completion of the improvement and payment of the cost thereof, the
City Manager shall certify the total cost of such improvement to the City
Commission, together with the amount of the original assessment roll for such
improvement.
(1975 Code Sec. 1.107)
216.18 DEFICIENCY ASSESSMENTS; REFUNDS.
   Should the assessments in any special assessment roll, including the amount
assessed to the City at large, prove insufficient for any reason to pay the
cost of the improvement for which they were made, then the City Commission may
make additional assessments against the City and the several lots and parcels
of land within the special assessment district, in the same ratio as the
original assessments, to supply the deficiency, or the Commission may determine
that such deficiency shall be paid by the City, but the total amount assessed
against any lot or parcel of land shall not exceed the value of the benefits
received from the improvement. Should the assessments levied prove to be more
than necessary to defray the cost of the improvement, then the Commission may,
by resolution, order the excess to be applied to the unpaid installments of
such special assessment against each lot or parcel of land, in the inverse
order in which they are payable. Any amount of such excess, as to any lot or
parcel of land which cannot be applied as aforesaid, may be refunded in cash.
(1975 Code Sec. 1.108)
216.19 REASSESSMENT IN EVENT OF ILLEGALITY.
   Whenever any special assessment is, in the opinion of the City Commission,
invalid, by reason of irregularity or informality in the proceedings, or if any
court of competent jurisdiction adjudges such assessment to be illegal, the
Commission shall, whether the improvement has been made or not or whether any
part of the assessment has been paid or not, have the power to cause a new
assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was
made. All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall
be conducted in the same manner as provided for in the original assessment, and
whenever the assessment, or any part thereof, levied upon any premises has been
so set aside, if the same is paid and not refunded, the payment so made shall
be applied upon the reassessment and the reassessment shall, to that extent, be
deemed satisfied.
(1975 Code Sec. 1.109)
216.20 COLLECTION BY COURT ACTION.
   In addition to any other remedy and without impairing the lien therefor, any
delinquent special assessment, together with interest and penalties, may be
collected in an action in assumpsit in the name of the City against the person
assessed, in any court having jurisdiction of the amount. If in any such action
it appears that by reason of any irregularity or informality the assessment has
not been properly made against the defendant or upon the premises sought to be
charged, the court may, nevertheless, on satisfactory proof that expense has
been incurred by the City, which is a proper charge against the defendant or
the premises in question, render judgment for the amount properly chargeable
against such defendant or upon such premises.
(1975 Code Sec. 1.110)
216.21 GENERAL POLICIES.
   The following assessment policies are hereby established to provide for the
guidance of the administrative staff in preparing special assessment
improvement programs:
   (a)   New Construction.
      (1)   New roadway construction, including, but not limited to, pavement,
curb and gutter work, sidewalks, drive approaches, signage, storm sewers and
appurtenances, earthwork and turf establishment, shall be assessed to the
benefiting property owner and/or developer at seventy-five percent of the
estimated project cost, including all related project administration costs,
with the City charged the remaining twenty-five percent.
      (2)   Special assessment rolls will be adjusted to reflect actual project
costs as defined in Section
216.18.
      (3)   The owner/developer shall provide a deposit in an amount as
required by the following schedule before the project commences. The City will
provide the remainder of the initial project funding. Payment of the remaining
special assessment amount, minus the deposit, shall be the same as all other
projects, as outlined under Section
216.16.
 
Estimated Project Cost Minimum Deposit Required (percentage)
Up to $100,000         25
$100, 001 - $500, 000  20
$500,001 or more       15
 
   (b)   Replacement Construction. The installation of pavement over a
previously unpaved street, or the resurfacing of existing pavement, including
any curb and gutter construction and driveway approaches associated with
reconstruction, shall be assessed as follows:
      (1)   The benefiting property owner on each side of the street shall pay
not more than one-third of the cost of a standard thirty-two foot residential
street with curb and gutter and driveway approaches, and the City shall pay the
remaining cost.
      (2)   The curb and gutter and driveway approaches to be installed or
replaced in conjunction with the street improvement program shall be considered
as a portion of the pavement program and shall not be listed as a separate
cost.
   (c)   Sidewalks.
      (1)   The cost for the installation of sidewalks, or the repair or
replacement of existing sidewalk located on an existing major street within a
Tax Increment Finance Authority (TIFA) District, or on the basis of any other
criteria as determined by the City Commission, may be paid 100 percent by the
City upon approval by the City Commission.
      (2)   The cost for the installation or replacement of existing sidewalks
not meeting a requirement of the preceding paragraph, but approved by the City
Commission for inclusion in the street improvement programs governed by this
section, except new construction which shall be governed by subsection (a)
hereof, shall be assessed fifty percent to the benefiting property owner and
fifty percent shall be paid by the City.
   (d)   Underground Construction.
      (1)   New water main construction up to eight inches in diameter and
appurtenances, including service mains up to one inch, shall be totally
assessed to the benefiting property owner and/or developer in an amount
specified by a resolution of the City Commission setting uniform assessment
rates. If mains and services larger than those specified in this paragraph are
required by the City, construction costs above the standard size, as such costs
are determined by the City Engineer, shall be paid from the Water Fund of the
City. However, excess construction costs for mains and services that are larger
than those required by the City shall be assessed totally to the benefiting
property owner/developer.
      (2)   Sewer main construction up to eight inches in diameter and
appurtenances shall be totally assessed to the benefiting property owner and/or
developer according to Section
1042.121 of the Streets, Utilities and Public Services Code.
      (3)   Storm sewer construction shall be assessed as follows:
         A.   Existing developments. The City's portion shall be 100 percent.
         B.   New subdivisions. The benefiting property owner and/or developer
within the development shall be assessed the total cost of such storm sewers as
are required to drain the development.
   (e)   Single Lot Projects.
      (1)   The installation or replacement of a sidewalk that is not a part of
a street improvement program shall be assessed fifty percent to the benefiting
property owner and fifty percent to the City according to Section
216.13. Assessments will be based on the actual construction cost, plus related
administration costs.
      (2)   The replacement of existing drive approaches and/or a curb and
gutter that are not a part of a street improvement program shall be assessed
100 percent to the benefiting property owner according to Section
216.13. Assessments will be based on the actual construction cost, plus related
administration costs.
      (3)   The connection of a water service to an existing water main shall
be assessed 100 percent to the benefiting property owner according to Section
216.13. Assessments shall be based upon the most current City Commission
resolution setting uniform assessment rates.
   (f)   Developer Requested Replacement Reconstruction. When a Developer has
requested the installation of pavement over a previously unpaved street, or the
resurfacing of existing pavement, and other necessary normal street
improvements in conjunction with the project, the following policies are
established, and it shall be assessed as follows:
      (1)   The proposed project shall be limited to residential developments.
      (2)   All of the vacant parcels of land located within the residential
development that are owned by the requesting Developer and which lots will be
benefitted by the reconstruction, shall be assessed 100% of the cost, which
shall be presumed to enhance the prospect of the sale of the lots and further
residential construction within the benefitted development.
      (3)   Special assessment rolls will be adjusted to reflect actual project
costs as defined in Section
216.18.
      (4)   The City is not required to approve a special assessment to
construct the improvement petitioned for by the Developer.
   (g)   Procedural Policy.

receive a letter explaining procedures to be followed in establishing rates for
the project, methods of payment and an outline of work to be performed.
      (2)   Special assessment rates shall be predetermined, presented and
levied on a unit cost basis. To determine the appropriate unit cost of a
specific special assessment project, the average construction and other related
costs for comparable work as experienced in the preceding year or years, and/or
the best available estimates, including construction cost index adjustments, as
determined by the City, shall be utilized.
      (3)   Adjustments to special assessment rates for side lot lines,
intersections and other than normal lot frontages shall be determined by the
City Engineer in consultation with the City Assessor.
      (4)   The project cost to be borne by the benefiting property owner shall
be based upon the current estimate of construction costs and limited to a
reasonable proportionality between the amount assessed and the value of the
benefits accruing to the land.
(Ord. 6-88. Passed 6-21-88; Ord. 13-2018. Passed 11-13-18.)
216.22 ABROGATION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS FOR STREET AND SIDEWALK IMPROVEMENTS.
   It is hereby declared to be the policy of the City of Battle Creek,
effective the beginning of the calendar year 1996, to cease collecting special
assessments to assist in paying for street improvements in the City, except
where specifically requested by a Developer as provided for in above Section
216.21(f).
   All special assessment street resolutions adopted since January 1, 1995, are
hereby modified by limiting the maximum special assessment for any one parcel
to 100 front feet for residential property only, except where specifically
requested by a Developer as provided in above Section
216.21(f).
   All sums paid in excess of the sums due under this section to the City in
discharge of special assessments levied since January 1, 1995, for street
improvements are hereby ordered refunded, with any interest actually earned by
the City since the assessment was paid.
   Except in instances where street reconstruction is specifically requested by
a Developer as provided in above Section
216.21(f), it shall be the policy of the City of Battle Creek to replace the
not less than four hundred thirty thousand dollars ($430,000) raised on an
annual basis by special assessments as follows: one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000) or more from the General Fund and the balance by increasing the
millage currently dedicated for street improvements from 1.5 mills to a millage
sufficient to totally replace the revenue, but not to exceed an additional one-
half mill. The City Administration is hereby directed, when preparing budgets,
to dedicate one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more to special
assessment replacement revenues for street improvements and to recommend to the
City Commission the level of millage, if any, necessary to achieve full
replacement revenues.
   It is further declared to be the policy of the City to not use special
assessments for sidewalk improvements. The local sidewalk program for
individual lot-by-lot replacement based on a fifty/fifty shared basis will be
continued and shall operate on the level established from time to time by
moneys appropriated by the City Commission for that purpose.
(Res. 46. Passed 12-19-95; Ord. 13-2018. Passed 11-13-18.)
216.23 BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Upon the establishment of a business improvement district within the
City, or in combination with a contiguous city, as authorized by Act 49 of the
Public Acts of 1999, as amended, the cost of the whole or any part of a
business improvement district project may be financed by the levying of special
assessments against land or interest in land, or both.
   (b)   Before the City levies a special assessment benefitting property
within a business improvement district, the City will approve the marketing and
development plan developed by the business improvement district board, which
shall detail all of the following:
      (1)   The scope, nature and duration of the business improvement district
project; and
      (2)   The different classes of property owners who are going to be
assessed and the projected amount of the special assessment on the different
classes.
   (c)   If the City elects to levy special assessments to defray all or part
of the cost of a business improvement district project, then the special
assessments shall be levied in accordance with Section
9.1 of the City Charter and this chapter. In the event of any conflict between
this section and the remainder of this chapter, this section shall control. The
total amount assessed for business improvement district purposes may be made
payable in not more than twenty annual installments as determined by the City
Commission, the first installment to be payable not more than eighteen months
after the date of confirmation of the special assessment roll.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any language in this chapter to the contrary, it is
the policy of the City that the cost of any business improvement district
project involving the installation, repair, replacement, reconstruction or
reconfiguration of any street, sidewalk or public or private underground or
above-ground utilities may be completely defrayed by special assessments.
   (e)   Under this section, any special assessment shall be levied against a
parcel of land on the basis of the special benefits to that parcel from the
total project. To the extent that a parcel is used for residential purposes,
such parcel shall not be considered to be benefitted by a project for which
special assessments are levied pursuant to this section. There is a rebuttable
presumption that a business improvement district project specially benefits all
nonresidential properties located within the district.
   (f)   Nothing in this chapter or this section shall be construed to require
that any special assessment or benefit be determined on the basis of street
front footage of a benefitted parcel of land. Instead, it is the policy and
intent of the City to permit the use of any reasonable basis to determine the
benefit to and special assessment against each parcel or class of parcel in the
business improvement district.
   (g)   A business improvement district project financed by special
assessments shall be reviewed by the City Commission every five years, unless
special assessment bonds are outstanding.

218.01 PURPOSE.
   The City finds that police time spent on contacts with individuals who drive
under the influence of alcohol and/or with the presence of a controlled
substance in their systems greatly surpasses that of other traffic stops. In
addition, such individuals cause more accidents with an increased likelihood of
personal injury and property damage. Therefore, the City seeks recovery from
those responsible for the greater operational and financial burden associated
with law enforcement and other City emergency responses to those incidents.
(Ord. 13-90. Passed 5-15-90; Ord. 03-04. Passed 2-17-04.)
218.02 DEFINITIONS.

      (1)   The dispatch, provision or utilization of police, fire-fighting,
emergency medical or rescue services by the City to or at accidents involving a
motor vehicle where one or more of the drivers were operating a motor vehicle
in violation of M.C.L.A. 257.625; or
      (2)   An arrest by a police officer of the driver of a motor vehicle for
operating in violation of M.C.L.A. 257.625.
(Ord. 11-98. Passed 7-7-58; Ord. 03-04. Passed 2-17-04.).
   (b)   "Expense of an emergency response" means the direct and reasonable
costs incurred by the City associated with the occurrence of an emergency
response, including, but not limited to, the costs of providing police, fire-
fighting and rescue services.
(Ord. 13-90. Passed 5-15-90.)
218.03 PRESUMPTIONS. (REPEALED)

218.04 LIABILITY FOR COSTS.
   (a)   Any person who operates a motor vehicle so as to cause an emergency
response shall be responsible and liable for the expenses of the emergency
response, if that person was charged with any violation of M.C.L.A. 257.625.
(Ord. 11-98. Passed 7-7-98; Ord. 03-04. Passed 2-17-04.)
   (b)   The City Commission shall, by resolution, adopt a schedule of the
costs included within the expense of an emergency response. This schedule shall
be available to the public from either the City Clerk or the Police Department.
   (c)   The Chief of Police or the designee thereof, within fifteen days of an
emergency response, shall prepare a bill of itemized costs incurred by the City
for an emergency response. The bill for these costs shall be submitted, by
personal service or first class mail, to the person responsible and liable for
such expenses as enumerated under this chapter. Full payment by the responsible
and liable person shall be made within thirty days from the date of service of
the itemized costs.
   (d)   Any failure by the responsible person to pay the itemized costs within
thirty days of service shall be considered in default. In case of default, the
City may commence civil suit to recover the unpaid expenses of an emergency
response and any costs allowed by law.
(Ord. 13-90. Passed 5-15-90.)
218.05 CIVIL NATURE OF LIABILITY.
   This chapter shall be construed to be a responsibility and liability of a
civil nature on the part of the responsible person. It shall not be construed
to conflict, contravene, enlarge or reduce any criminal liability or
responsibility, including fines and/or costs which may be imposed by a judge
under the Michigan Vehicle Code on a driver for operating a motor vehicle in
violation of M.C.L.A. 257.625.

220.01 AUTHORITY.
   The provisions of this Administration Code are based upon Sections
5.5 and
5.6 of the City Charter, adopted September 27, 1960, which states that "The
City Manager shall be the Personnel Director, with authority to delegate the
duties of such office. All City employment shall be based upon fair and
impartial principles with fitness, ability, training and experience the major
considerations. There shall be no discrimination on account of race, national
origin, sex, handicap, age, color, politics or religion. No City official or
employee may solicit political contributions from Municipal employees and they
shall not engage in Municipal political activities on City property or on City
time. The Administration Code shall be based on the best general accepted
provisions of personnel programs in business, industry and government and shall
include the following subjects: classification of City employees' pay scales,
probationary period, order of layoffs, procedure for suspension or removal,
employment procedures, hours of work, vacation, sick leave and any other
pertinent data relating to employees. A Personnel Advisory Board may be
appointed by the City Manager with the approval of the City Commission to make
investigations and recommendations to the City Manager. Decisions of the City
Manager on these matters, however, shall be deemed final."
220.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Administration Code is to establish formal procedures to
serve as a guide for administrative action concerning the various personnel
activities of the City.
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78.)
220.03 SCOPE OF CODE; CONFLICTS.
   This Administration Code shall apply to all officers and employees in the
City service, unless an exception is made by the City Charter. In the case of a
conflict between this Administration Code and the specific terms of the
Charter, the Charter shall govern. In the case of a conflict between this
Administration Code and the specific terms of a collective bargaining
agreement, the collective bargaining agreement shall govern. Furthermore, the
provisions of this Administration Code do not apply to the Personnel of the
Fire Department insofar as they conflict with specific provisions of the Fire
and Police Civil Service Act (Act 78 of the Public Acts of 1935, as amended).
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78.)
220.04 AMENDMENTS.
   The City Manager shall recommend to the City Commission the adoption of any
modification or amendment to this Administration Code when, in his opinion,
such modification or amendment is needed.
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78.)

(Res. 293. Passed 5-18-93; Ord. 2-01. Passed 2-20-01.)
220.08 RENAMING STREETS.
   (a)   Policy and Intent. The renaming of a developed street involves
considerable inconvenience and expense for property owners, emergency service
providers and public utilities as well as the City, due to the necessity of
changing records, maps, and signs. It also affects preservation of the City's
historic past. It is best reserved to eliminate duplicative or similar names,
reflect changes in street patterns, or similar circumstances. The following
procedures are to be followed so as to identify and address any problems that a
street name change may produce when requests are made to the City Commission to
adopt a street name change.
   (b)   Required conditions. Requests for street name changes shall meet the
following required conditions prior to being considered for approval:
      (1)   If honoring an individual, the person must be widely recognized as
having national, state, or local community significance for community or public
service so as to merit remembrance and so as to override the memory of the
present street name.
      (2)   If the proposed street name is that of a person, such individual
must be deceased and well-known to citizens of all walks of life for a specific
contribution or sacrifice.
      (3)   The proposed name should be acknowledged by other national, state
or local community organizations that have similar policies and a capacity to
objectively evaluate contributions of the honored individual to be deemed to
have lasting significance.
   (c)   Other considerations. In reviewing a request to rename a developed
street, the following additional considerations shall be addressed and
evaluated:
      (1)   The historic significance of the current street name;
      (2)   Whether the proposed name is duplicative or similar to a current
street name in the Battle Creek area;
      (3)   Whether the proposed name will eliminate confusion;
      (4)   The economic impact of a street name change considering the costs,
effort and inconvenience to persons residing on the street, the city, public
utilities and common carriers.
   (d)   Review of Request. Any request to change a street name shall be
directed to the Planning and Zoning Division, which shall refer requests to the
following City departments and other affected community agencies and
organizations for review and comment:
      (1)   Traffic Engineering Manager;
      (2)   City Clerk;
      (3)   City Assessor;
      (4)   Geographic Information Systems Department;
      (5)   Code Compliance Division;
      (6)   Building Inspection Division;
      (7)   Calhoun County Consolidated Dispatch Authority;
      (8)   Battle Creek Historic District Commission;
      (9)   Historic Society of Battle Creek or other local historic societies;
      (10)   Local utility service providers;
      (11)   Local telecommunications service providers;
      (12)   Local offices of mail, package or parcel delivery service
companies such as the United States Postal Service, Federal Express, and United
Postal Service;
      (13)   Battle Creek Unlimited.
   (e)   Report. Within sixty days after receipt of a request to rename a
street, the Planning and Zoning Division shall prepare a report to the City
Manager. This report shall:
      (1)   Apply and evaluate whether the request meets the required
conditions of this section.
      (2)   Evaluate the impact any name change would have pursuant to the
requirements of this section.
      (3)   Summarize the comments and concerns received from City departments,
community agencies and organizations.
   (f)   Public Hearing. After receipt and review by the City Manager, the
report of the Planning and Zoning Division shall be forwarded to the City
Commission for consideration. A public hearing shall be scheduled on the
requested street name change. All property owners, according to the records of
the City Assessor, directly abutting the affected street shall be informed at
least ten days before the public hearing by regular mail.
   (g)   City Commission Action. Within thirty days of the public hearing, the
City Commission shall act to approve or deny the request for a street name
change. In lieu of approving a street name change, the City Commission may
commemoratively designate the current street or portion of a current street.
Upon approval of a street name change by the City Commission or a commemorative
designation of a street by the City Commission, the Engineering Department
shall notify all state and county agencies and affected property owners of such
change. Notice shall also be sent to all City departments and all affected
agencies and community organizations that provide service based upon street
names filed. The cost of producing, installing, maintaining and replacing City
Street signs with the new name shall be paid for by the person or organization
requesting the street name change prior to such work being undertaken by the
City.
   (h)   Heritage Streets. The following streets are recognized and
commemoratively designated as Heritage Streets as being in existence when
Battle Creek was incorporated as a City and remain in existence under their
original name at the time of adoption of this section: Bartlett, Battle Creek,
Bennett, Brook, Calhoun, Caroline, Cass, Champion, Cherry, Clay, Cliff,
College, Division, Fountain, Frelinghuysen, Fremont, Goguac, Green, Jackson,
Jay, Kendall, Main, Manchester, Mary, McCamly, Mott, North Avenue, Penn,

known as the Community Oversight Board.
(Res. 41. Passed 4-29-80; Ord. 06-2024. Passed 5-14-24.)
286.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Community Oversight Board (COB) is to provide input, in
an advisory capacity, to the City Manager or their designee in reconsidering
the Police Chief’s determination following a Community Relations Complaint
(CRC) investigation filed pursuant to the Battle Creek Police Department (BCPD)
Policy. The COB will outline reasoning for reconsideration based on an
objective review of the facts and circumstances. The COB may also request that
the City Manager or their designee inquire into any conduct of a Police Officer
in the absence of a complaint. This process is not intended to take the place
of any other remedy or action available to a complainant. Furthermore, the COB
will take a proactive approach in identifying potential problems, building
partnerships with law enforcement, and creating bridges between and among law
enforcement and the community.
(Res. 41. Passed 4-29-80; Ord. 06-2024. Passed 5-14-24.)
286.03 FUNCTIONS.
   The COB is authorized to execute the following duties:
   (a)   Generally.
      (1)   Build more credibility, community trust, and confidence by
participating in a process that responds appropriately to misconduct
allegations by BCPD personnel, as well as to recognize/commend BCPD personnel
for outstanding conduct/performance;
      (2)   Respond to the City Manager’s (or their designee) requests on the
disposition of inquiries and complaints, as well as the complaint process;
      (3)   Serve in an advisory role to the City Manager or their designee
regarding potential policy and procedure improvements in the complaint process,
or which may be implicated in the complaint process; and
      (4)   Work with BCPD to improve communication and outreach with community
members, emphasizing community education.
   (b)   Reconsideration of certain CRC Investigation Determinations.
      (1)   The COB will have the authority to reconsider any CRC investigative
finding where the Police Chief has determined a finding of: exoneration;
unfounded; misconduct not based on complaint; or, not sustained; and to
recommend to the City Manager or their designee that the Police Chief’s
determination be changed to sustained under BCPD policy.
      (2)   The COB will not have the authority to reconsider a determination
when the Police Chief has sustained the complaint.
      (3)   The COB’s scope of authority when reconsidering a determination as
set out in above subsection (b)(1) shall be limited to the facts,
circumstances, and evidence gleaned by the Office of Professional Standards
(OPS) investigation, or their designee, known at the time the Police Chief’s
decision was made.
      (4)   The COB does not have the authority to issue subpoenas, conduct
independent investigations, interview witnesses or officers.

recommended by the Boards and Commissions Review Committee, and appointed by
the Mayor with the approval of the City Commission. The COB members, as nearly
as possible, shall reflect a range of the city’s demographics in regard to
racial and gender identities, ages, skills and lived experiences. Preference
will be given to community members representing marginalized communities. For
the purposes of this Chapter, “marginalized communities” means groups of people
who experience social, economic, and/or political exclusion or discrimination

      (2)   Up to one resident of any municipality other than the City of
Battle Creek may be appointed, provided that resident’s municipality of
residence has a current police services contract with the City. The term of
this non-City resident shall end immediately upon the termination of the police
services contract, the member relocating outside of a qualifying municipality,
or upon the stated end of term at the time of appointment, whichever event
occurs first, thereby creating a vacancy to be filled as set out above;
      (3)   Two residents of the City of Battle Creek, designated as alternates
and who shall fit the desired characteristics set out in above subsection (a).
Alternate members act in the absence of a regular member, have all the rights,
responsibilities and obligations as members when serving in that capacity, and
are expected to attend all COB meetings;
      (4)   At least four COB members shall be actively serving marginalized
communities in the City of Battle Creek, and/or have expertise in the cultural
nuances, language barriers, or disabilities of specific populations that may
impact interactions with law enforcement;
      (5)   Three members shall be appointed, with one representing each of the
below three community-based organizations that actively serve and advocate for
marginalized communities in Battle Creek:

         C.   One representing The Burma Center.
         Applications for the three COB members of this subsection should
include a cover letter from the above organization of which that person is a
member, setting out the organization’s nomination and support of the applicant,
addressed to the City Manager. If an organization declines to submit an
applicant for recommended membership, then the Boards and Commissions’ Review
Committee shall select a candidate(s) to recommend to the Mayor and City
Commission that is a member of one of the above three community-based
organizations which is not already represented or who fits the desired
characteristics set out in above subsection (a).
   (b)   Two additional non-voting, ex-officio members shall be appointed by
the Mayor and the City Commission: The City of Battle Creek Human Resources
(HR) Director and the City’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Officer,
whose terms shall coincide with their employment with the City in the stated
positions.
   (c)   The following individuals shall be ineligible to serve as a member of
the COB:
      (1)   Current City of Battle Creek employees (with the exception of the
HR Director and DEI Officer as ex-officio members as noted above);

288.02 PURPOSE OF CLASSIFICATION PLAN.
   The Classification Plan provides the basic structure for dealing with
personnel matters, permits the consideration of a pay policy based on duties,
responsibilities and work requirements and serves as a basis for recruiting and
selecting employees, developing training programs and establishing uniform
fiscal and personnel records. The Classification Plan enables the City Manager
and his staff to more equitably administer personnel transactions. The
Classification Plan also helps to systematize and facilitate the preparation
and administration of personnel policies and transactions.
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78.)
288.03 COMPOSITION OF CLASSIFICATION PLAN.
   The Classification Plan shall be composed of job classifications and job
descriptions. The descriptions are not meant to be inclusive but to provide the
employee and the employer with an understanding of the general nature of the
job, including the kind and responsibility of the work performed. A job
description should be read and understood in its entirety. No part should be
considered alone but in relation to the complete description.
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78.)
288.04 REVIEW AND MAINTENANCE OF CLASSIFICATION PLAN.
   The individual positions, the job descriptions and the Classification Plan
should be reviewed continually to adapt them to changing conditions resulting
from new services or programs, transfers of duties, organizational changes,
changes in methods of procedures or other changes affecting the duties and
responsibilities of employees. As a minimum, when a vacancy occurs, the need to
fill the position, its pay level on the Compensation Plan and the job
description should be carefully reviewed before the position is filled. A
comprehensive review of the entire Classification Plan should be conducted at
least every five years.
   (a)   New Positions. When requested by a department head or the City
Manager, the Director of Employee Relations shall study the duties and
responsibilities of each new position as it is created and, on the basis of
that study, shall place the position in the appropriate job classification in
the Classification Plan. If a suitable job classification does not exist, the
Director of Employee Relations shall recommend the establishment of a new job
classification to the City Manager. Upon the direction of the City Manager, the
Director of Employee Relations shall then prepare a job description to be
incorporated into the Classification Plan and make recommendations concerning
the appropriate pay level on the Compensation Plan. The job classification will
be added to the Classification Plan after approval by the City Commission. The
pay level will be added to the Compensation Plan after approval by the City
Commission.
   (b)   Periodic Review. The City Manager may periodically require department
heads and/or other employees to submit descriptions of departmental job duties
for the purpose of determining if there has been a change in duties or
responsibilities which necessitates a change in the job description or the
reclassifying of a position under a different job description.
   (c)   Department Head; Generated Chance. When a department head feels that a
particular job in his department has changed sufficiently in scope to require
reclassification, he shall so report to the Director of Employee Relations,
along with a written statement of the reasons for the requested change. The
Director of Employee Relations shall study any job position when so requested
by the department head, present the findings to the department head and, with
his concurrence, reclassify the position with the approval of the City Manager
and the City Commission.
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78.)
288.05 REPOSITORY FOR CLASSIFICATION PLAN.
   The official current copy of the Classification Plan and job descriptions
shall be kept in the office of Employee Relations and be available for public
review. Copies, which shall be periodically updated, are to be provided to all
department and division heads.
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78.)

290.01 PURPOSE.
   The Compensation Plan is designed to provide equal pay for equal work,
provide a means for adjusting the Plan to meet changes in conditions which
require adjustments in pay levels and establish salary and wage rates which
compare satisfactorily with those of public and private employers in the area,
thus enabling the City to attract, employ and retain well qualified employees.
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78.)
290.02 COMPOSITION OF COMPENSATION PLAN.
   (a)   For nonrepresented employees, the Compensation Plan consists of a
schedule of pay ranges for each job classification included in the
Classification Plan.
   (b)   Employees who are members of an employee organization shall be
compensated according to the contract agreement in effect.
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78.)
290.03 APPOINTMENT RATE.
   (a)   Original appointment to any position shall normally be made at the
minimum rate and advancement from the minimum rate shall be by successive
steps.
   (b)   Upon recommendation from a department head and/or the Director of
Employee Relations, the City Manager may approve initial compensation for a
position at a rate higher than the minimum rate. Such exception shall be based
on:
      (1)   The outstanding and unusual nature of the employee's experience and
ability;
      (2)   Conditions of extreme difficulty in recruiting at the entrance
rate; or
      (3)   Promotion to the position from another position where an
approximate two and one-half percent increase would not result in placement at
the entry level.
   (c)   Each employee shall be officially advised by the Director of Employee
Relations at the time of appointment or promotion of his or her pay rate and
the pay range to which his or her job classification is assigned. When an
employee reaches the maximum rate in his or her job classification, he or she
should not expect further pay increases unless:
      (1)   His or her position is reclassified;
      (2)   He or she is promoted to a higher classification; or
      (3)   A general increase is granted to all employees.
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78.)
290.04 SALARY INCREASES.
   Employee pay increases to the next higher step shall be based on meritorious
performance at the present step, made in accordance with the compensation
schedule, and be made effective at the beginning of the pay period nearest the
employee's anniversary date of promotion to the new job classification.
Progression through the pay range shall be accomplished by a review of employee
performance by the immediate supervisor with approval of the department head.
This performance evaluation shall be conducted before the completion of the
employee's probationary period (normally six months), immediately before the
employee's first anniversary date and yearly before the employee's anniversary
date thereafter. Each employee shall have the opportunity to discuss his or her
employee performance report with the reviewing officer assigned to evaluate the
individual's work effort. Both the employee and the employee's supervisor shall
sign the performance report which will then be forwarded to the office of
Employee Relations for inclusion in the employee's personnel file. If a pay
increase is withheld, the employee shall be informed of the next evaluation
date, which shall not be more than six months later, and the nature of the
improvement in job performance that will be required for the step increase to
be granted at the next evaluation. If the employee disagrees with the
evaluation or the basis upon which a pay increase is denied, he or she may seek
redress under Section
296.12. In all instances, money shall be available and appropriated in the
budget before any pay increase is granted.
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78.)
290.05 PAY RATE ADJUSTMENTS.
   If an employee is transferred, promoted or demoted, the rate of pay for the
new position shall be determined as follows:
   (a)   Transfer. When an employee is transferred to another job
classification with the same maximum salary rate, the salary rate of the
employee shall remain unchanged, unless the employee's current compensation
rate is below the minimum pay rate established for the job classification to
which the employee is transferring.
   (b)   Promotion. When an employee is promoted from one job classification to
another job classification having a higher maximum salary rate, the salary rate
of the promoted employee shall be increased to the new minimum or to that step
within the new pay range next above the rate of pay prior to promotion.
Promotion shall normally entail at least an approximate two and one-half
percent salary increase, but shall not exceed the maximum rate for the
classification.
   (c)   Demotion. When an employee is demoted from a position in one job
classification to a position in another job classification having a lower
maximum pay rate, the rate of the affected employee shall be reduced, as
necessary, to place it at the same pay step of the lower job classification.
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78.)
290.06 REVIEW AND MAINTENANCE OF COMPENSATION PLAN.
    Comparative salary surveys shall be conducted annually by the Director of
Employee Relations prior to submission of the annual budget. Such studies shall
consider factors affecting the level of salaries of employees, including cost-
of-living increases, changes in the rates paid for comparable types of work by
competing employers, labor market conditions and past recruitment experience.
On the basis of such studies, adjustments in pay ranges shall be recommended to
the City Commission by the City Manager.
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78.)
290.07 LONGEVITY PLAN.

   (d)   The longevity payment shall be one thousand, two hundred dollars

since their anniversary date of employment.
   (e)   The longevity payment shall be made on the first pay period following
December 1 to employees who are employed as of December 1 of each year. The
payment to employees who have not actually worked or been on paid vacation for
at least seventy-five percent of the available work days during the twelve-
month period preceding December 1 of each year shall be on a pro-rata basis.
The payment shall be based on the number of days actually worked or on vacation
over the number of available work days.
   (f)   Any employee who terminates his or her employment for any reason after
his or her employment anniversary date in any year shall receive, along with
his or her final check, that amount of longevity to which he or she became
entitled as of his or her employment anniversary date.
   (g)   Employees who have qualified for longevity pay shall, upon retirement,
receive a pro-rata share of their annual longevity as of the effective date of

shall be payable on the last paycheck to the employee.
   (h)   Payment to the beneficiary of a deceased qualified employee of his or
her longevity pay for the year in which the death occurred shall be made on the

292.01 TYPES OF POSITIONS.
   (a)   Permanent Positions. A permanent position is one which is established
in the budget and designated to be continuous in nature. The employee in a
permanent position holds title to that position, accrues appropriate fringe
benefits and is paid out of City funds. Employees who are assigned to a
permanent position after having served in a temporary or seasonal position
shall be treated as new employees as of the date of assignment to the permanent
position. Federally funded positions shall be treated as new employees unless
otherwise dictated by the Federal program.
   (b)   Temporary Positions. A temporary appointment is one lasting six months
or less and created for fill-in work. Temporary appointments shall not accrue
fringe benefits except for F.I.C.A. and Worker's Compensation. An employee in a
temporary position does not hold title to the position. Insofar as possible,
temporary employees shall be residents of the City.
   (c)   Federally Funded Positions. Positions in programs funded primarily or
in part by the Federal Government may be of longer duration than six months but
may still be regarded as temporary. The employee shall accrue such benefits as
are dictated by the Federal program. The positions shall cease to exist when
the Federal funding expires and the employee covered by the funding shall be
paid off, enrolled in another Federally funded position or placed in a regular
City position.
   (d)   Seasonal Positions. Positions of a seasonal nature may last more than
six months and may reoccur yearly as determined by the City. The seasonal
employee does not hold title to a position and shall not accrue fringe benefits
except for F.I.C.A. and Worker's Compensation. Insofar as possible, seasonal
employees shall be residents of the City.
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78.)
292.02 RECRUITMENT.
   (a)   In hiring new City employees, consideration shall be given only to the
good of the public service, the ability of the appointee to discharge the
duties of the position to which he or she is appointed and the applicant's
willingness to conform to the City's residency policy. The City shall strive to
hire the best qualified individual available for each opening or newly created
position. It is the policy of the City to afford equal employment opportunity
to all applicants pursuant to Section
292.04 and all applicable State and Federal laws.
   (b)   No person shall be placed on the payroll of the City unless there is
an authorized personnel vacancy and such vacancy is filled in accordance with
the procedures established.
   (c)   Unsuccessful candidates qualified for employment with the City may be
entered on an eligible-for-employment list established and maintained by the
office of Employee Relations to serve as an employment pool for future
openings. Unsuccessful candidates shall be notified by letter of the City's
decision. The letter shall inform them, if applicable, of their placement on
the employment list. An applicant's name shall be removed from the employment
list after six months unless the applicant files a new job application with the
City.
   (d)   The Director of Employee Relations shall post job openings, as they
occur, at conspicuous locations throughout City buildings in order to provide
for open competition among City employees seeking a transfer or a promotion to
the vacant position, and shall also advertise in the local newspaper and/or
appropriate publications and notify appropriate employment agencies in an
effort to seek the best qualified applicants available for the position.
   (e)   Pre-employment interviews shall be conducted by the office of Employee
Relations and references, qualifications and credentials shall be checked by
that office. Qualified candidates shall be certified and a list sent to the
department head for further interviews and selection.
   (f)   If examinations are required for positions, the examinations shall be
related to the performance of the job.
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78.)
292.03 PERSONS PROHIBITED FROM EMPLOYMENT.

the City.
   (b)   No two members of an immediate family, as defined in Section
288.01(17), may be employed in the same department of the City. Exceptions to
this provision may be made on a case-by-case basis by the City Manager in
special circumstances where lack of other qualified candidates may warrant such
exceptions. This provision shall not apply to any immediate family member who
may have been employed in the same department of the City prior to the
enactment of this provision. In no case shall a member of an immediate family
be supervised by another member of his family.
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78.)

292.06 PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS.
    Prior to commencing employment, prospective employees shall be required to
have a physical examination with a medical doctor selected by the City. The
doctor shall certify that the prospective employee is physically able to
perform the duties of the job for which the employee is to be hired. Any
employee may be required to undergo a periodic physical examination as deemed
necessary for the health and safety of himself or other employees. The City
shall pay the cost of all examinations ordered by the Director of Employee
Relations.
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78.)
292.07 PROBATIONARY PERIOD.
   (a)    The probationary period shall begin immediately upon appointment to a
permanent position and shall continue for a period of six consecutive months of
work, unless specifically stated otherwise in an applicable union contract. The
City shall retain the right to extend the probationary period for an additional
six months, unless specifically stated otherwise in an applicable union
contract, provided that written notice is given to the affected employee. The
probationary period shall be regarded as an integral part of the examination
process and shall provide an opportunity for the City to determine whether the
probationary employee has the ability, work habits and other attributes to
qualify him for regular employment status. An employee shall be retained beyond
the probationary period and granted nonprobationary status only if the
department head affirms that the services of the employee have been found
satisfactory and recommends to the Director of Employee Relations that the
employee be given nonprobationary status. At any time during the probationary
period, the department head may dismiss a probationary employee if, in his
opinion, the working test indicates that the employee is unable or unwilling to
perform the duties of the position satisfactorily or that his habits and
dependability do not merit continuance in the City service.
   (b)   When an employee is promoted or transferred to another job
classification, he shall be on probation in the new job classification for six
months. During the probationary period, the employee may be removed therefrom
at any time if the employee demonstrates that he is unable to satisfactorily
perform the requirements of the job as determined by supervisory personnel. If
the employee is not performing at an acceptable level, the department head may
recommend removal to the Director of Employee Relations, with final approval
resting with the City Manager. If removed from the new job classification, the
employee may be returned to his former position or any open position in the job
classification the employee occupied prior to his promotion or transfer. A
final decision on such assignment shall be made by the City Manager.
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78.)
292.08 TEMPORARY TRANSFERS.
   (a)   Employees may be temporarily transferred from one job classification
to another at the discretion of the department head, the Director of Employee
Relations or the City Manager. Such transfers shall include, but not be limited
to, working for other employees who are absent from work due to illness,
accident, vacation, school, training or leave of absence for the period of such
absence. Temporary transfers made to fill temporary jobs or to take care of
unusual circumstances shall not exceed ninety calendar days. If the period of
such a transfer exceeds five consecutive working days, employees transferred
for the convenience of the City shall receive the rate of pay applicable as if
permanently assigned to the position or their regular rate, whichever is
greater. In those cases where an employee is temporarily transferred due to the
absence of another employee, the transferred employee shall not receive the
higher rate of pay if filling in for the absent employee is a part of the
employee's job description or is implied therein.
   (b)   Employees temporarily transferred in accordance with the provisions of
this section shall not acquire any permanent title or right to the job to which
they are temporarily transferred but shall retain the right to return to their
regular job classification and position.

   (a)   The management of the City is sincerely concerned with the safety and
welfare of its employees and the public it serves. It acknowledges an
obligation as an employer to provide the safest possible working conditions for
employees and a safe environment for the public.
   (b)   The safety program is based on the recognition that:
      (1)   Accidents produce economic and social loss and impair productivity.
      (2)   Every employee is entitled to a safe and healthful place in which
to work.
      (3)   Accident prevention is good business, i.e. the cost of accidents is
usually greater than the cost of prevention.
      (4)   Accidents can be controlled by careful planning and training and
accurate operations control measures.
      (5)   An extension of safety awareness to off-the-job activities is in
the City's best interest since employees normally suffer more accidents away
from work than they do on the job.
   (c)   The City shall be responsible for establishing safe and healthful
working conditions and employees shall be expected to follow safe working
practices, obey safety rules and regulations and work in a manner that will
maintain high safety standards.
   Violations of this provision shall be handled in accordance with the
disciplinary provisions of Section
296.02.
   (d)   The City Manager shall appoint a Safety Coordinator and a Safety
Committee. The Safety Coordinator shall be trained to coordinate and guide the
overall City safety program. He shall arrange for training sessions in safety
for supervisory and managerial personnel. The Safety Committee shall be
composed of a member of the Police Department, a member of the Fire Department,
a union representative as determined contractually and representatives of the
operational departments, and may include persons not employed by the City.
   The Safety Committee and the Safety Coordinator, who shall serve as
executive secretary of the Committee, shall formulate such rules and
regulations as may be necessary to carry out the intent of this section.
(Ord. 14-78. Passed 11-28-78.)
294.17 ACCIDENT REVIEW POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this accident review policy to establish
uniform procedures for reviewing all motor vehicle accidents involving City
equipment and/or personnel.
   (b)   Composition of Accident Review Committee. An Accident Review Committee
is hereby established, to be composed of seven members, with the Chairman
appointed by the City Manager, as follows:
      (1)   The Safety Coordinator;
      (2)   One police officer designated by the Police Chief;
      (3)   One officer designated by the Fire Chief;
      (4)   One division head from the Department of Public Works designated by
the Director of Public Works;
      (5)   One administrative officer designated by the City Manager;
      (6)   One Transit Division head designated by the Assistant City Manager-
Community Development; and
      (7)   One "at-large" employee designated by the City Manager.
   (c)   Functions of Committee. The Committee shall be responsible for
reviewing the circumstances surrounding each motor vehicle and equipment
accident involving City equipment and/or personnel and to determine whether the
accident is either "preventable" or "nonpreventable," as outlined below. The
Committee shall formulate its own rules for the conduct of its meetings. All
meetings of the Committee, except executive sessions, shall be public and open
to any interested party. All actions of the Committee shall be by a majority
vote of the members in attendance and voting. However, a minority opinion may
be attached to any Committee recommendation.
   (d)   Scope of Committee Responsibility. The Committee shall review all
motor vehicle accidents involving City equipment or personnel to determine
whether or not the person responsible for the City equipment was at fault or
contributed to, or was blameless in, the particular incident. The Committee
shall not interfere or influence any law enforcement department in pursuant of
criminal sanctions against any individual. If the Committee finds that the City
employee did not contribute to the accident due to his own actions, then the
Committee shall find that the accident was nonpreventable and no disciplinary
action shall be taken. If the Committee investigation reveals that the City
employee did contribute to the accident due to his own action or inaction, then
the Committee shall find that the accident was preventable and recommend
appropriate disciplinary action. All findings of the Committee shall be
reported promptly to the department head, the Director of Employee Relations
and the employee. Appeals may be made to the Accident Review Board at the next
regular meeting.
   (e)   Preventable and Nonpreventable Accidents Defined.
      (1)   A preventable accident is an accident resulting from the failure of
the operator of the equipment to:
         A.   Obey all traffic laws;
         B.   Recognize the rights of others; or
         C.   Use due care in the operation of his equipment.
      (2)   A nonpreventable accident is an accident resulting from causes
other than those of the employee's causation and in which the employee
exercised either defensive driving and/or due care.
   (f)   Reporting of Accidents. It is the duty and responsibility of each City
employee to report all motor vehicle accidents in which City equipment and/or
employees are involved. Failure to report such accidents shall be considered a
serious offense and appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken. An accident
is defined as any incident involving a City employee and/or equipment in which
any property damage or injury results, regardless of how slight. Accidents that
involve City equipment and/or personnel shall be reported immediately to the
Police Department. Accidents occurring outside the City limits shall be
reported in the same manner to the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction,
then reported to the Battle Creek Police Department. The Battle Creek Police
Department shall be notified of such out-of-City accidents as soon as possible
and shall obtain copies of all reports pertaining thereto. Police reports of
all accidents involving City employees and equipment shall be made available to
Committee members by the Committee Secretary.
   (g)   Procedure for Reviewing Accidents. All accidents shall be reviewed by
the Accident Review Committee to determine whether or not the accident was
preventable. The employee involved in an accident may attend, upon request, any
session in which his particular accident is discussed, except executive
sessions. Executive sessions shall be called for the sole purpose of voting on
whether or not any particular accident was preventable. If an accident is found
to have been preventable, the Committee shall so report to the Police
Department and the employee along with the Committee's disciplinary
recommendation.
   (h)   Penalties for Preventable Accidents. Disciplinary action recommended
by the Accident Review Committee shall be as prescribed in this Administration
Code and shall be imposed in accordance with the circumstances of the case. In
no case shall the penalty be greater than that prescribed in this
Administration Code. All penalties for preventable accidents shall be
considered as a matter of record for a period of one year from the date
thereof, and any disciplinary action imposed for preventable accidents
occurring within the one-year period shall be based, in part, upon the prior
offense and the disciplinary action imposed. Recommended disciplinary action
for preventable accidents is as follows:
      (1)   First accident: verbal or written reprimand and attendance at a
National Safety Council Defense Driving Course (DDC);
      (2)   Second accident: suspension;
      (3)   Third accident: suspension, demotion or discharge.
   More severe penalties may be recommended at any step if warranted by the
circumstances.

420.01 ESTABLISHMENT; ADMINISTRATION.
   Pursuant to the authority vested in the City by virtue of Section 8395 of
1961 Public Act 236, as amended, a Parking Violations Bureau is hereby
established for the purposes of accepting civil infraction admissions in
parking violation cases and collecting and retaining civil fines and costs
prescribed in this Traffic Code. The Bureau may also accept pleas of guilty, in
parking violation cases, if the violation occurred before August 1, 1979, and
may collect and retain fines and costs as prescribed by ordinance at the time
the violation occurred. The Bureau shall be administered and operated in the
manner and form as herein set forth, with the Bureau under the supervision and
control of the City Manager who may delegate the responsibility for operating
the Bureau in such a manner as he deems appropriate. The Manager shall
establish a convenient place for the location of the Bureau and appoint
qualified employees to administer it. The Manager is hereby authorized to adopt
rules and regulations for the operation thereof.
(Ord. 7-79. Passed 7-31-79.)
420.02 JURISDICTION.
   No parking violation not scheduled in Section
420.99 shall be disposed of by the Parking Violations Bureau. No person,
however, shall be required to dispose of a parking violation at the Bureau. A
person shall be entitled to have such a violation processed before a court
having jurisdiction thereof if he or she so desires. Any person having
knowledge of the facts may make a sworn complaint before the court having
jurisdiction of the offense, as provided by law. Likewise, the fact that a
particular violation is included on the schedule set forth in Section
420.99 does not entitle the alleged violator to disposition of the violation at
the Bureau. The person in charge of the Bureau, at his discretion, may refuse
to dispose of such violation, in which case such violation shall be disposed of
in court as provided by law.
(1975 Code Sec. 1.202)
420.03 VIOLATIONS; FINES.
   To be administered by the Parking Violations Bureau, a violation must be set
forth on the schedule in Section
420.99. The penalties and fines for violations thereof shall be levied as set
forth on the schedule, provided that the person in charge of the Bureau or
those persons designated by the person in charge of the Bureau may, upon good
cause shown, reduce the fine on a parking ticket to the next lowest category in
such schedule for the particular parking violation, and shall waive the fine
found in the schedule when a waiver is required by the schedule or when an
administrative or legal defect exists in the issuance of the parking violation
notice.
(Ord. 15-88. Passed 8-2-88.)
420.04 ISSUANCE OF PARKING VIOLATION NOTICES.
   The Police Department shall provide authorized personnel from such
Department with parking violation notices, also known as parking tickets. The
issuance of a parking violation notice by a police officer or other designated
and authorized personnel of the Department shall be deemed an allegation of a
parking violation. Such notice shall state the date and location where such
violation occurred, the time of the violation, the state and license number of
the vehicle involved in such violation, the type of vehicle and other facts
which plainly state the nature of the violation. A copy of the parking notice
shall be attached or fastened to the vehicle in a conspicuous place, which
notice is deemed to be notification to the owner or operator that such vehicle
was parked in violation of this Traffic Code. Such notice shall instruct the
owner or operator that such violation can be fully settled and satisfied by the
payment of the penalty scheduled for the violation for which such notice was
issued. The parking violation notice shall also indicate the mailing and
business address of the Parking Violations Bureau and the amount of the penalty
scheduled for the violation and shall advise that a civil infraction citation,
as allowed by law, will be sought if the owner or operator fails to respond
within specified time limits.

control over a vehicle may re-park that vehicle on either side of the same
street in order to extend the vehicle's parking time beyond the time limits

continually under such supervision and control as may be required by the Police
Department or an ACO, or upon the direction of a police officer or ACO, shall
turn the animal over to the Police Department or ACO for seizure and
impoundment pursuant to Section
608.13. An animal that has bitten shall be kept in the owner’s home or a secure
structure authorized by a person enforcing this chapter that would not allow
any other person or animal to come in contact with it except for family
members. At the owner’s expense, animals may be quarantined at a veterinarian’s
office or, at the discretion of an ACO, at the facility with whom the City
contracts to provide animal shelter services.

608.14 IMPOUNDMENTS; PROCEDURES; TIME PERIODS; NOTIFICATION; DISPOSITION OF
ANIMAL; COSTS.
   (a)   Search Warrants. Whenever an animal is found on private property, a

agent may go onto the private property and remove the animal. Provided,
however, that under the following circumstances, an animal may be removed from
private property without first obtaining a search warrant:

notification to the owner shall be made in writing and the animal shall be kept
for not less than seven days from the date of the notification as provided for
in subsection (c) of this section.
         B.   Any animal impounded pursuant to Section

conclusion of court proceedings, or until the owner or other responsible person
releases ownership of the animal.
         C.   Any animal impounded pursuant to Section

disposed of in accordance with any order entered by the court in the matter.
         D.   Any animal impounded pursuant to Section
608.13(d) shall be held until an ACO or the County Health Department determines
that it is safe to release the animal; or, if an animal impounded pursuant to
Section
608.13(d) is also the subject of a complaint made before a court having
jurisdiction of such cases, whereby an order that such animal be killed or
confined is sought pursuant to Section
608.23, then the animal shall be held until the case is finally disposed of, or
until otherwise ordered by the court.
      (2)   Any animal which, in the opinion of the licensed veterinarian, is
in a condition of health that is not likely to benefit from any reasonable
treatment, and which has no evidence of ownership or whose owner, after
reasonable efforts, has been unreachable, may be humanely destroyed before the
time established in this section.
   (c)   Notification of Impoundment. Written notification of impoundment shall
be given to every owner of an animal impounded pursuant to Section
608.13  if the animal has evidence of ownership or ownership is actually
otherwise ascertained. Such written notification shall either be personally
served upon the owner or shall be posted on the premises of the animal's owner
and sent by first class mail to the owner's last known address and shall
contain all of the following:
      (1)   A description of the animal;
      (2)   The date the animal was first impounded;
      (3)   The reason for impoundment;
      (4)   The name, address, and telephone number of the place of
impoundment;
      (5)   The maximum time that the animal will be held before release or
being disposed of;
      (6)   The requirement that the owner provide proof of current license and
vaccinations, where required by ordinance or other law;
      (7)   The name of the impounding police officer or ACO;
      (8)   Date that the notice was personally served or posted and mailed,
and a notation of which type of service was used.
   (d)   Requirements to Redeem Animal From Impound. In addition to any other
requirement set forth in this chapter or by court order, in order to redeem an
animal from impound, all of the following requirements must be met:
      (1)   Microchip. Unless an animal already has one, a microchip shall be
implanted prior to the animal being redeemed, unless a licensed veterinarian
signs an affidavit stating that such implantation would jeopardize the health
of the animal;
      (2)   Unaltered animals.
         A.   Sterilization. Upon a third or subsequent time an animal is
impounded, any animal six months of age or older shall be sterilized prior to
the animal being redeemed from impound, unless a licensed veterinarian signs an
affidavit stating that such sterilization would jeopardize the health of the
animal;
         B.   Unaltered Fee. When an animal is impounded for the second or
subsequent time, the owner or other person responsible for that animal must pay
an unaltered animal fee as prescribed in Section
802.24  , in order to redeem the animal. The unaltered fee is in addition to
all other fees, fines, and costs provided for otherwise under these ordinances.
         C.   Voucher. The person paying the unaltered animal fee will receive
a voucher, on a form prepared by the City in the amount of the unaltered fee
paid, which will be redeemable as follows:
            1.   Second Impound of Animal. The voucher may be applied up to the
full amount toward spaying or neutering the animal redeemed if the spay or
neuter is done within 30 days of redemption. If the spay or neuter is done
before redemption any difference between the cost of the spay or neuter and the
voucher amount will be refunded to the voucher owner upon request. There is no
refund of any unused voucher amount if the spay or neuter is not done before
redemption.
            2.   Third or Subsequent Impound. The voucher may be applied up to
the full amount of the spaying or neutering of the animal. The spay or neuter
must be done before redemption. There is no refund of any unused portion of the
voucher.
         D.   Unaltered Fee Not Redeemed. The portion of an unaltered fee not
redeemed as set forth above, is to be placed in the Police Department Animal
Control budget for use for any animal control purpose.
         E.   City Not Responsible for Cost of Altering. Nothing herein makes
the City responsible for any costs of spaying or neutering an animal. This
provision only allows the unaltered fee to be redeemed for the cost of spay or
neuter, up to the amount of the unaltered fee paid, in accordance with these
provisions.
         F.   Circumstances for Warning on First Impound. If an animal is being
redeemed from impound for the first time, the owner or other responsible party
will receive a warning, instead of the Class C ticket for a violation of
Section
608.11 (a), Allowing an animal to stray, if the animal is voluntarily spayed or
neutered prior to redemption. The person may still be cited for any other
violation provided for under these ordinances.
      (3)   Payment of Costs. Payment in full of all costs while impounded,
including but not limited to, microchip implantation, sterilization and for the
entire cost of care for the animal while the animal was impounded;
      (4)   Proof of Ownership. Proof of ownership may be accomplished by a
current valid license, veterinary records, or proof of purchase or adoption,
which reasonably identifies the animal; and
      (5)   Proof of License; Immunization. Proof of current valid license and
immunizations, if required by local or State law must be provided.
   (e)   If an owner does not complete all of the above requirements listed in
subsection (d) hereof within seven days, the animal will be deemed abandoned
and forfeited.
   (f)   Action For Forfeiture. If an animal is impounded under this chapter
and is being held pending the outcome of a criminal action charging a violation
of Section
608.09 , before final disposition of the criminal charge:
      (1)   The City Attorney may file a civil action in the court that has
jurisdiction of the criminal action, requesting that the court issue an order
forfeiting the animal to the City or its designee before final disposition of
the criminal charge.
      (2)   The City Attorney shall serve a copy of the summons and complaint
upon the defendant and upon a person with a known ownership interest or known
security interest in the animal or a person who has filed a lien with the
Secretary of State in an animal involved in the pending action. The forfeiture
of an animal under this section encumbered by a securing interest is subject to
the interest of the holder of the security interest who did not have prior
knowledge of, or consent to the commission of the crime.
      (3)   Upon the filing of the civil action, the court shall set a hearing
on the complaint. The hearing shall be conducted within fourteen (14) days of
the filing of the civil action, or as soon as practicable. The hearing shall be
before a judge without a jury. At the hearing, the City Attorney has the burden
of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation of Section
608.09 has occurred.
      (4)   If the court finds that the City Attorney has met this burden, the
court shall order immediate forfeiture of the animal to the City or its
designee unless the defendant, within 72 hours of the hearing, submits to the
Court Clerk cash or other form of security in an amount determined by the court
to be sufficient to repay all reasonable costs incurred, and anticipated to be
incurred, by the City or its designee in caring for the animal from the date of
initial impoundment to the date of trial. If cash or other security has been
submitted, and the trial in the action is continued at a later date, any order
of continuance shall require the defendant to submit additional reasonable
costs anticipated to be incurred by the City or its designee in caring for the
animal until the new date of trial.
      (5)   If the defendant submits cash or other security to the court under
this subsection the court may enter an order authorizing the use of that money
or other security before final disposition of the criminal charges to pay the
reasonable costs incurred by the City or its designee in caring for the animal
from the date of initial impoundment to the date of final disposition of the
criminal charges.
      (6)   The testimony of a person at a hearing held under this subsection
is not admissible against him or her in any criminal proceeding except in a
criminal prosecution for perjury. The testimony of a person at a hearing held
under this subsection does not waive the person's constitutional right against
self-incrimination.
      (7)   An animal seized under this chapter is not subject to any other
subsequent civil action by the City related to the animal pending the final
judgment of the forfeiture action under this subsection.

15-05; Ord. 12-8. Passed 11-13-12; Ord. 04-2017. Passed 5-16-17.)
608.15 KEEPING STRAY ANIMALS; FAILURE TO SURRENDER STRAY ANIMAL.
   It shall be unlawful for any person in the City to knowingly and
intentionally harbor or keep in possession by confinement or otherwise any
animal that does not belong to such person without permission of the owner.
Within twenty-four (24) hours from the time such animal came into his or her
possession must surrender the animal to a facility with whom the City contracts
to provide animal shelter service or to an ACO. Upon receiving said animal, an
ACO shall take such animal and place it in a facility with whom the City
contracts to provide animal shelter service for a required legal stray hold
period of seven (7) days. If such animal is not reclaimed after seven (7) days,
the person who possessed and surrendered the animal may apply through normal
process and fees to become the adoptive owner of the animal. The expense of
sheltering fees, license fee and rabies inoculation must be assumed by the
owner if the animal is reclaimed prior to the end of the five (5) days. No
person harboring such an animal shall refuse to relinquish such animal to its
legal owner prior to the expiration of said seven (7) days.
(Ord. 04-2017. Passed 5-16-17.)
608.16 LICENSING; INTERPRETATION.
   It being necessary to promote the effective enforcement of licensing and
control of dogs and cats within the City, so that the public health, safety and
welfare may be protected, it is the intent of the City Commission that the
following sections relating to pet licensing be liberally construed, provided
that the provisions are not in conflict with any other law of the City or other
appropriate governmental unit.
(Ord. 16-99. Passed 10-5-99; Ord. 04-2017. Passed 5-16-17.)
608.17 LICENSE REQUIREMENT; FEES; TERM.
   (a)   No person shall own, harbor or keep a dog or cat over the age of six
months within the City, without first obtaining a license from the City
Treasurer or the authorized agent of the City Treasurer. No person shall own,
harbor or keep any other animal required by this chapter to be licensed without
first obtaining a license within the time required by this chapter from the
City Treasurer or authorized agent of the City Treasurer. The application for
such license shall state the breed, sex, age, color and markings of such animal
to be licensed, whether the animal is spayed or neutered, or whether the animal
has a microchip, and the name, address, and telephone numbers of the owner, and
any applicable alternate contact information. The application for a license
under this section shall be accompanied by a valid authentic certificate of
vaccination for rabies, where required, stating the name of the veterinarian
who administered the inoculation to the animal, the date it was given, and the
length of time during which such inoculation is effective.
      (1)   Exception. No dog or cat shall be exempt from the rabies
vaccination requirement set forth in this chapter, unless:
         A.   There is a valid medical reason supplied in writing by a licensed
veterinarian; or
         B.   A titre test is performed on the dog or cat that proves the
animal’s titre is sufficient to adequately protect against the rabies virus.
The veterinarian performing the titre test must put into writing the results of
the test, which will be accompanied by a copy of the titre test results. The
titre test must be done each year on the exempt dog or cat before a current
license will be issued. If the exempt dog or cat’s titre is not sufficient to
protect the dog or cat from the rabies virus the dog or cat will be required to
have a rabies vaccination or be euthanized. All cost incurred under this
section will be paid by the owner of the dog or cat.
   (b)   The license fee shall be as prescribed in the schedule provided for in
Section
802.24 of the Business Regulation and Taxation Code and in conformance with
this section. An application for an animal license, if for a dog or cat, is
accompanied by written proof that dog or cat has been neutered or spayed shall
result in a reduced license fee as prescribed in the above-mentioned schedule
of fees. However, any waiver or reduction of the license fee as permitted by
the schedule of fees or by this chapter shall not remove or abrogate the
obligation of an owner to obtain a license for an animal in conformity with
this chapter. Within seven days of an animal becoming six months of age the
owner shall apply for a license.
   (c)   The license year for animals shall commence on the day a license is
issued and expire upon whichever occurs first: (i) after 365 days for a one-
year license, (ii) after 1095 days for a three-year license or (iii) upon the
expiration of the rabies certificate of vaccination. License fees are not
refundable. Applications for licenses shall be made within thirty days of
acquiring a licensable animal. Applications to renew licenses shall be made not
later than the license expiration date. Licenses issued under this Chapter are
not transferable.
   (d)   There shall be no license fee for a dog used as a service animal as
provided for pursuant to the ADA provided that the owner has completed the
affidavit available at the Treasurer’s office affirming the dog to be exempted
is a service animal as provided in Act 82 of 1981. There shall be no license
fee for a dog being trained under contract as an ADA service animal upon
presentation to the City Treasurer of such contract with a qualified
organization recognized by the Michigan Department of Labor and presentation of
the record of the dog's health and vaccination history, together with the
application described in subsection (a) hereof.
   (e)   None of the provisions of this Section shall be construed as requiring
the licensing of any dog imported into the City from outside the State of
Michigan for a period not to exceed 30 days for show, trial, breeding or
hunting purposes.
   (f)   A person who owns, harbors or keeps an animal shall produce a valid
animal license upon the request of any person who is authorized to enforce this
chapter.
   (g)   If a person has received a citation for a violation of this Section,
the court shall waive fines, costs, and assessments upon receipt of
certification by a City of Battle Creek ACO or Police Officer that a license
was obtained before the appearance date on the citation.
(Ord. 16-99. Passed 10-5-99; Ord. 04-2017. Passed 5-16-17; Ord. 10-2018. Passed
10-2-18.)
608.18 LICENSE TAGS.
   Upon receipt of the rabies certificate and payment of any fee or penalty
specified in Section
608.17, the City Treasurer or an authorized agent of the City Treasurer shall
issue a tag made of metal or other suitable material bearing the name of the
City, and the profile number. The tag shall be attached to the collar of the
licensed dog or cat. Dogs and cats shall wear collars affixed with their City
license tags at all times when off the premises of their owners, except as
otherwise permitted by this chapter or unless the dog is engaged in lawful
sport hunting and is accompanied by its owner. No person other than the owner,
an ACO, or a Police Officer, in the line of duty shall remove a license tag
from a dog or cat. If a license tag is lost, it shall be replaced by the City
Treasurer or authorized agent of the City Treasurer upon application by the
owner of the dog or cat. The cost of replacement of a tag shall be determined
from time to time by the City Commission as set out in Section
802.24.
(Ord. 16-99. Passed 10-5-99; Ord. 04-2017. Passed 5-16-17; Ord. 10-2018. Passed
10-2-18.)
608.19 LIMITATION UPON NUMBER OF DOGS AND CATS; KENNEL LICENSES.
   (a)   No person shall suffer, allow or permit to remain on the same or
adjacent premises controlled by him or her, within the City, more than three
dogs or five cats, unless he or she obtains a kennel license as may be allowed
by City zoning ordinances.
   (b)   The limitation set forth in subsection (a) hereof shall not apply to
the owner of a female dog which has given birth to puppies, which owner may
keep such female and such puppies for a period not to exceed three months from
the date of birth of the litter. Neither shall such limitation apply to a
properly licensed store engaged in the display and sale of dogs.
   (c)   The limitation set forth in subsection (a) hereof shall not apply to
the owner of a female cat which has given birth to kittens, which owner may
keep such female and such kittens for a period not to exceed three months from
the date of birth of the litter. Neither shall such limitation apply to a
properly licensed store engaged in the display and sale of cats.
   (d)   A kennel shall be construed as an establishment wherein or whereon
four or more dogs or six or more cats are confined. Any person who keeps or
operates an annual kennel shall, in lieu of individual licenses required under
this chapter, apply to the City Treasurer for an annual kennel license
entitling him or her to keep or operate a kennel. Proof of vaccination of the
dogs against rabies is not required with the application. The license shall be
issued by the City Treasurer annually on a form prepared and supplied by the
City Treasurer and shall entitle the licensee to keep any number of dogs and/or
cats aged six months old or older, but not at any time exceeding a certain
number to be specified in the license. The annual fee to be paid for a kennel
license shall be as prescribed in the schedule provided for in Section
802.24 of the Business Regulation and Taxation Code. A fee of double the
original license fee shall be charged for each previously licensed kennel whose
kennel license is applied for after June 1 and all animals upon the premises of
the kennel will be considered unlicensed. With each kennel license, the City
Treasurer shall issue a number of metal tags equal to the number of dogs
authorized to be kept in the kennel. All the tags shall bear the name of the
City and the number of the kennel license and shall be readily distinguishable
from the individual license tags for the same year.
   (e)   The City Treasurer shall not issue a kennel license for a new kennel,
or renewal, under the provisions of this chapter, unless the applicant
furnishes an inspection certificate signed by the Animal Control Department,
and has been provided proof that the applicant has paid the annual inspection
fee as prescribed in the schedule provided for in Section
802.24, dated within 30 days of the filing of the application for a kennel
license, stating that the kennel to be covered by the license complies with the
reasonable sanitary requirements of the Michigan Department of Agriculture &
Rural Development (MDARD) and that the animals are properly fed and protected
from exposure commensurate with the breed of the animals.
   (f)   Any animal kept in a kennel that is six months or older must possess a
valid rabies vaccination before a new or renewal license shall be issued.
   (g)   The licensee of a kennel shall, at all times, keep one tag attached to
a collar on each dog six months old or older kept by him or her under a kennel
license. No dog bearing a kennel tag shall be permitted to stray or be taken
anywhere outside the limits of the kennel. This section does not prohibit the
taking of dogs having a kennel license outside the limits of the kennel
temporarily and in leash, nor does it prohibit the taking of such dogs out of
the kennel temporarily for the purpose of hunting, breeding, trial or show.
   (h)   All licensed kennels shall be required to have double fencing and
secured flooring. The fence on the outer perimeter shall be constructed in such
a manner as to prevent stray animals and people from making direct contact with
kennel animals. The flooring shall be constructed in such a manner as to
prevent animals digging out of the enclosure. Double fencing is not required if
the fence is a solid fence or where animals are kept inside the kennel
building.
   (i)   Any kennel shall be of such construction as will adequately and
comfortably house any animals kept therein during any season of the year. The
buildings, including walls and floor, shall be of such construction as to be
readily cleaned and kennels and yards connected therewith used to confine
kennel animals shall be kept clean and free from accumulation of filth and
debris.
   (j)   All animals kept or maintained in connection with such kennels shall
be furnished with a clean, fresh water supply and adequate and proper food to
maintain such animals in a state of good health.
   (k)   Animal Control Officers shall have the right to inspect any kennel in
the City in order to determine whether said kennel is in compliance with this
chapter and the State statute. If the kennel has been issued a license, it
shall be the duty of the ACO to suspend said license if, in the Officer's
opinion, conditions exist which are unhealthy or inhumane to the animals kept
therein pending correction of such conditions, and further shall have the duty
to revoke said license if such conditions are not corrected within a designated
reasonable time.
   (l)   Nothing in this section shall authorize the existence of a kennel in
violation of zoning or health requirements of State law or of other provisions
of these Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 45-83. Passed 10-25-83; Ord. 04-2017. Passed 5-16-17.)
608.20 ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.
   (a)   The City shall maintain at least one full-time Animal Control Officer
(ACO) who shall be under the control of the Chief of Police or his or her
delegate.
   (b)   It shall be a violation of this chapter to:
      (1)   Interfere with, hinder, oppose, obstruct, or molest an ACO in the
performance of his or her duties.
      (2)   Remove a collar or tag from any animal without the permission of
the owner.
      (3)   Decoy or entice an animal out of an enclosure or off the property
of the owner.

or while on the property of its owner.
      (5)   Refuse to identify or provide ones name to an ACO or Police
Officer, or to give a false name in connection with the issuance of a citation
under this chapter or State statute.
(Ord. 45-83. Passed 10-25-83; Ord. 04-2017. Passed 5-16-17.)
608.21 MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.
   The minimum standards for Animal Control Officers shall be:
   (a)   The same as for a police officer as to the requirements for physical,
educational, mental and moral fitness; and
   (b)   A minimum course of study of not less than 100 instructional hours, as
described by the Department of Agriculture, unless the ACO is a police officer
or has at least three years experience as an ACO.

608.23 ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE; KILLING OR CONFINING ANIMALS; COURT ORDERS TO
PROTECT PUBLIC.
   (a)   A District Court judge or magistrate shall issue a summons to the
owner of an animal to show cause why an animal should not be destroyed, upon a
sworn complaint that any of the following exists:
      (1)   A dog is engaged in lawful hunting but is not under the reasonable
control of its owner and does not have a license tag attached to its collar.

   (b)   Upon the filing of a sworn complaint as provided in this section the
judge or magistrate shall order the owner of the animal in question to
immediately turn the animal over to a registered animal control shelter, a
registered animal protection shelter, a licensed veterinarian, or a boarding
kennel properly licensed in the City of Battle Creek, at the owner's option.
The animal shall be retained by such authority until a hearing is held and a
decision is made for the disposition of the animal, including any appeal
period. The owner shall notify the person(s) who retain the animal under this
section of the complaint and order. The expense of the boarding and retention
of the animal is to be borne by the owner. The animal shall not be returned to
the owner in any case until it has a current rabies vaccination and a license
as required by law.
   (c)   After a hearing, the court shall order one of the following
dispositions:
      (1)   If the animal has been found to have violated Section

608.29 CLASSIFICATION OF ANIMALS.
   (a)   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to establish a procedure
whereby animals that pose a significant threat of causing serious injury to
humans, other animals or property are identified and subjected to precautionary
restrictions before any such serious injury occurs.
   (b)   Classification of Levels of Dangerousness: An animal shall be
classified as potentially dangerous or dangerous based upon specific behaviors
exhibited by the animal. An animal will be considered a potentially dangerous
animal if it exhibits behavior described in subsection's (1) and/or (2) of this
section. An animal will be considered a dangerous animal if it exhibits
behavior described in subsections (3), (4), and/or (5).
      (1)   Level 1 behavior is established if an animal at-large is found to
menace, chase, display threatening or aggressive behavior, or otherwise
threaten or endanger the safety of any domestic animal.
      (2)   Level 2 behavior is established if an animal at-large is found to
menace, chase, display threatening or aggressive behavior, or otherwise
threaten or endanger the safety of any person.
      (3)   Level 3 behavior is established if an animal, while confined due to
posing a significant threat as determined by an ACO or Police Officer,
aggressively bites or causes physical injury less than serious injury to any
person.
      (4)   Level 4 behavior is established if an animal, while at-large,
aggressively bites or causes physical injury less than serious injury to any
person or domestic animal.
      (5)   Level 5 behavior is established if:
         A.   An animal, whether or not confined, causes the serious injury or
death of any person; or
         B.   An animal, while at-large, kills or causes serious injury to any
domestic animal; or
         C.   An animal engages in or is found to have been trained to engage
in exhibitions of fighting; or
         D.   An animal that has been classified as a Level 3 or 4 dangerous
animal repeats the behavior described in subsection (3) and (4) of this section
after the owner receives notice of the classification level.
      (6)   Notwithstanding subsection (1) through (5) of this section, the ACO
or a Police Officer shall have discretionary authority to refrain from
classifying an animal as potentially dangerous or dangerous even if the animal
has engaged in the behaviors specific in subsections (1) through (5) of this
section, if the ACO or Police Officer determines that the behavior was the
result of:
         A.   A person trespassing on the property of the animal's owner;
         B.   A person provoking or tormenting the animal;
         C.   The animal responding in a manner that an ordinary and reasonable
person would conclude was designed to protect a person if that person is
engaged in a lawful activity or is the subject of an assault; or
         D.   An injury to the animal.
   (c)   Identification of Potentially Dangerous, Animals; Appeals;
Restrictions Pending Appeal.
      (1)   The ACO or a Police Officer shall have authority to determine the
classification of any animal. This determination shall be based upon an
investigation that includes a person's observation of, and testimony regarding,
the animal's behavior, including the animal's upbringing and control of the
animal. These observations and testimony can be provided by ACO’s or by other
witnesses who personally observed the behavior. The witness(es) shall sign a
written statement attesting to the observed behavior and agree to provide
testimony, if necessary, regarding the animal's behavior.
      (2)   The ACO shall notify the owner or agent in control by certified
mail or personal service of the animal's behavior and classification as a
potentially dangerous or dangerous animal and of the additional restrictions
applicable to that animal by reason of its classification. If the owner denies
that the behavior in question occurred, proceedings may begin pursuant to Act
426 of the Pubic Acts of 1988, as amended, being Sections 287.321 - 287.323 of
the Michigan Compiled Laws (MSA 12.545(1) - 12.545(3)).
      (3)   Once the owner has received notice of the animal's classification
as a Level 1, 2, 3 or 4 animal pursuant to Section
608.28(b), the owner shall comply with the restrictions specified in the
notice.
      (4)   If the ACO finds that an animal has engaged in Level 5 behavior, he
shall order the owner to immediately turn the animal over to the facility with
whom the City contracts to provide animal shelter services, an incorporated
humane society, or a licensed veterinarian, at the owner’s option, to be
retained until a hearing regarding the disposition of the animal. The owner
shall notify the person who retains the animal of the pending hearing and shall
notify the ACO as to where the animal is to be held. The expense of the
boarding, veterinary care, testing for rabies, and retention of the animal is
the obligation of the animal’s owner.
      (5)   The imposition of regulations pursuant to this section shall not
prevent an ACO from also filing a complaint with the District Court.
   (d)   Regulation of Potentially Dangerous Animals: In addition to the other
requirements of this chapter, the owner of a potentially dangerous animal shall
comply with the following regulations:
      (1)   If the animal has engaged in Level 1 behavior, the animal shall be
restrained by a physical device or structure that prevents the animal from
reaching any public sidewalk or adjoining property whenever that animal is
outside the owner's home and not on a leash. The Chief of Police may adopt
administrative rules establishing specifications for the required device or
structure.
      (2)   If the animal has engaged in Level 2 behavior, the owner shall
confine the animal within a secure enclosure whenever the animal is not held on
a leash or inside the home of the owner. The secure enclosure must be located
so as not to interfere with the public's legal access to the owner’s property.
      (3)   If the animal has engaged in Level 3 behavior, the owner shall meet
the requirements of subsection (2) of this section, and shall also post warning
signs on the property in conformance with administrative rules to be adopted by
the Chief of Police.
      (4)   If the animal has engaged in Level 4 behavior, the owner shall meet
the requirements of subsection (2) and (3) of this section and shall not permit
the animal to be off the owner's property unless the animal is muzzled and
restrained by an adequate leash and under the control of the owner or agent in
control, or is within a securely fastened enclosed structure.
      (5)   Any animal that has been found to have engaged in Level 5 behavior
as described in Section
608.28(b), may be euthanized upon a court order sought by Animal Control. After
a show cause hearing the court shall order the destruction of the animal, at
the expense of the owner if the animal is found to be a dangerous animal that
caused serious injury or death to a person or an animal.
      (6)   The court may order the destruction of the animal, at the expense
of the owner, if the court finds that the animal is a dangerous animal that did
not cause serious injury or death to a person but is likely in the future to
cause serious injury or death to a person or in the past has been adjudicated a
dangerous animal.
      (7)   To insure correct identification, all animals that have been
classified as dangerous shall have a microchip placed in the animal, at the
owner’s expense, by or under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian and the
microchip number shall be provided to Animal Control in writing within seven
days of placement. The microchip shall be placed in the area recommended by the
veterinarian in conjunction with the type of animal being micro chipped.
   (e)   Reporting of Potentially Dangerous or Dangerous Animal: Any person who
observes or has evidence of dangerous animal behavior shall forthwith notify
the Animal Control Division.

652.01 NUISANCE DEFINED AND PROHIBITED.
   As used in this chapter, "nuisance" means anything that annoys, injures or
endangers the safety, health, comfort or repose of the public; offends public
decency; interferes with, obstructs or renders dangerous any street, highway,
navigable lake or stream; or in any way renders the public insecure in life or
property. Public nuisances include, but are not limited to, whatever is
prohibited by any provision of this chapter. No person shall commit, create or
maintain any nuisance.
(1975 Code Sec. 9.1)
652.02 ABATEMENT.
   Where no other procedure is made specifically applicable by another
provision of this chapter, any structure, condition or activity prohibited by
this chapter may be abated by the City Manager or his or her authorized
representative in accordance with the following procedure. For purposes of this
chapter, "City Manager" means the City Manager or his or her authorized
representative. The City Manager shall first investigate the existence of the
alleged nuisance to determine whether or not a nuisance, as defined in Section
652.01, exists and to further determine the person who has created or is
committing or maintaining such nuisance. He shall then give written notice to
the person responsible for the creation, commission or maintenance of such
nuisance, specifying in particular the nature thereof, the corrective action to
be taken to abate the same and the time limit for abatement of such nuisance,
which shall be a reasonable time, but not to exceed fifteen days from the time
the notice is served. Such notice shall be served in accordance with Section
202.04 of the Administration Code. If, at the expiration of the time limit in
such notice, the person responsible for the commission, creation or maintenance
of the nuisance has not complied with the requirements thereof, the City
Manager shall carry out the requirements of such notice. The cost of such
abatement shall be a debt owed the City by the person responsible for the
commission, creation or maintenance of such nuisance, and if the nuisance is
attributable to the use, occupancy or ownership of any land or premises within
the City, shall be charged against such premises in accordance with the
provisions of
Chapter 216 of the Administration Code.
(Ord. 17-82. Passed 9-7-82.)
652.03 LEGAL AND EQUITABLE REMEDIES.
   Any action taken by the City to abate a nuisance under Section
652.02 or any other provision of this chapter shall not affect the right of the
City to institute proceedings against the person committing, creating or
maintaining the nuisance in violation of this chapter nor affect the imposition
of the penalty prescribed for such violation. As an additional remedy, upon
application by the City to any court of competent jurisdiction, the court may
order the nuisance to be abated and/or the violation or threatened violation to
be restrained and enjoined.

652.04 VEHICULAR NUISANCES.
   (a)   Findings. The Battle Creek City Commission finds that reckless driving
and racing within the City of Battle Creek poses an immediate threat to the
health and safety of the public, damages public and private infrastructure such
as roadways and parking lots, interferes with pedestrian and vehicular traffic,
creates a nuisance as defined in Section 652.01, and interferes with the right
of residents to peacefully enjoy their property. The City of Battle Creek finds
it necessary and appropriate to abate these public nuisances through legal
action, including the impoundment and forfeiture of the vehicles involved.

vehicle without due caution and in willful or wanton disregard of the rights or
safety of persons or property, or in a manner so as to endanger or be likely to
endanger any person or property. Examples of reckless driving or driving
recklessly include, but are not limited to, drifting, sliding, donuts
(involving the loss of traction and/or repeated ly driving in circles or figure
eights or in a sideways motion in circles or figure eights), and burnouts (also
known as peel out or power brake, practice of keeping a vehicle stationary or
relatively stationary and spinning its wheels, with the resultant friction
causing the tires to heat up and smoke), and failing to stop after being
directed to do so by a law enforcement officer after having performed any other
action that constitutes reckless driving, driving recklessly, or racing.
      (6)   “Vehicle” means, but is not limited to, any device in, upon, or by
which any person or property is or may be transported on public streets,

used, for reckless driving or racing in the City of Battle Creek.
      (2)   Any violation of this section is a nuisance if the reckless driving
or racing threatens health, safety, and/or property, and/or impedes the
progress of traffic on a public street, excluding any activities conducted
pursuant to an authorized permit.
      (3)   The vehicle involved in the nuisance and its contents, including
any other vehicle, tractor, or trailer used to transport the vehicle to and

driving, are also declared a nuisance.
   (d)   Enforcement.
      (1)   On probable cause that a vehicle constitutes a nuisance pursuant to
this section, police officers may seize the nuisance pending the commencement
of a nuisance abatement action. Upon seizure, the Police Department shall
provide a notice of seizure and intent to forfeit to the person who had custody
or control of the nuisance prior to seizure, on a form promulgated by the City
Attorney.
      (2)   Within 60 days of the last known occurrence of the nuisance, the
Battle Creek City Attorney may commence a civil action in the Calhoun County
Circuit Court to abate the public nuisance. Any person with a claim to the

general reputation of the owner or operator of the vehicle; the vehicle; or of
the place, area or building in which the nuisance activity took place is
admissible to establish the existence of the public nuisance. Proof of
knowledge of the existence of the public nuisance on the part of the owner, or
his or her agent or employee, is not required.
      (5)   Upon finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that a public
nuisance exists, the Calhoun County Circuit Court may enter an order of
abatement that may include: perpetually enjoining a person, his or her agent or
employee from using or allowing a vehicle to be used for the purposes declared
a nuisance in this section; providing for the seizure, impoundment, continued
impoundment, sale, or forfeiture to the seizing agency of a vehicle or its
contents, including a vehicle, tractor, or trailer used to transport the
vehicle to and from the racing or reckless driving site, or allied maintenance
or transportation equipment or tools at the reckless driving or racing site, or
any racing or reckless driving proceeds; or any other order within the Court's
authority to abate the nuisance. If forfeited to the seizing agency, the
vehicle and/or its contents may be sold at auction and proceeds shall be
disposed of in the following order of priority:
         A.   To pay the costs of keeping the property and the expenses of the
sale.

662.02 FINDINGS.
   The City Commission determines that whenever the repeated use, sale,
furnishing, giving or possession of controlled substances or drug paraphernalia
occurs on any property, or whenever property is repeatedly used for a violation
of controlled substance or drug paraphernalia laws, for purposes of committing
acts of prostitution, for illegal gambling or for the unlawful sale or
furnishing of alcoholic beverages, increased criminal activity occurs in the
neighborhood surrounding the property, increased pedestrian and vehicular
traffic occurs in the neighborhood surrounding the property and the peace and
quiet of residents living in the neighborhood surrounding the property are
disturbed, thereby creating a public nuisance.
(Ord. 20-97. Passed 10-21-97.)
662.03 DECLARATION OF PUBLIC NUISANCE; NOTICE AND PUBLIC HEARING REQUIRED PRIOR
TO ABATEMENT.
   (a)   Whenever the repeated illegal use, sale, furnishing, giving or
possession of controlled substances or drug paraphernalia, repeated violations
of controlled substance or drug paraphernalia laws, or repeated acts of
prostitution, illegal gambling or unlawful sale or furnishing of alcoholic
beverages, occurs on any property, the City Commission may declare, by
resolution, that the property is a public nuisance and order that the nuisance
be abated as provided in this chapter. Such declaration may occur only after
there has been notice given to the owner of the property, and the owner has had
an opportunity to be heard at a public hearing before the City Commission.
   (b)   Notice of the public hearing shall be given to the owner and shall
consist of either personal service or the mailing of two letters, one sent by
first class mail with sufficient postage affixed, and the other by certified
mail, return receipt requested, to the owner of record as indicated by the City
Assessor's records, records of the Register of Deeds of Calhoun County or
records of the City's Building Inspection Department, and posting a notice of
the hearing at the property affected. Compliance with this section shall be
deemed notice to the owner. The notice shall state the nature of the alleged
nuisance and the time, date and location of the hearing. Such notice to an
owner shall occur at least fourteen calendar days prior to the date of the
public hearing.
   (c)   The City Commission, acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, shall make a
determination as to whether a public nuisance exists under the standards
established by this chapter. The City Commission shall make this determination
based solely upon the evidence presented at a public hearing. In conducting the
public hearing, the City Commission shall afford the owner and others an
opportunity to present relevant and material evidence and to make arguments as
to factual or legal issues. Cross-examination of opposing witnesses shall be
permitted. The owner may appear in person or be represented by an attorney. Lay
representation is not permitted. In conducting its public hearing, the City
Commission shall not be bound by the rules of evidence, but may admit and give
weight to probative evidence of a nature that is commonly relied upon by a
reasonably prudent individual in the conduct of his or her affairs. Irrelevant,
incompetent and immaterial evidence and unduly repetitious evidence shall be
excluded. Effect shall be given to the rules of privilege recognized by law.
Objections to offers of evidence may be made and noted on the record. Evidence
may be comprised of sworn testimony, exhibits and affidavits that comply with
the requirements of the Michigan Court Rules.
(Ord. 20-97. Passed 10-21-97.)
662.04 ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE; COSTS.
   (a)   If the City Commission determines by a preponderance of the evidence
that a property is a public nuisance, it may, by resolution, in addition to any
other remedies available to the City at law or in equity, order abatement of
the nuisance as follows:
      (1)   Order all or that portion of the property determined to be a public
nuisance vacated, declare that occupancy of all or such proportion of the
property is prohibited and authorize the City Manager, or his or her designee,
to prohibit the occupancy of such property by padlocking, boarding-up or
otherwise securing all or that portion of the property determined to be a
public nuisance for a period of up to one year, as the City Commission shall
determine based upon the evidence before it.
      (2)   Determine that the owner shall be liable for the full cost of any
material and personnel, including City employees or contractors, involved in
the padlocking, boarding-up or securing of the property in the first instance,
and the full cost of any personnel and material involved in any subsequent or
remedial padlocking, boarding-up or securing of the property.
      (3)   Determine that the costs incurred, as provided in paragraph (a)(2)
hereof, shall be a personal debt of the owner or assess those costs against the
property as a lien as provided for in Section
216.13 of the Administration Code.
   (b)   Where only a specific and limited area under the control of a person
or persons other than the owner is involved in the illegal activity, the City
Commission shall not order that any portion of the property, other than the
portion used for the illegal activity, be vacated. It is the intent of this
subsection to protect those truly and completely innocent of any participation
in the act and those not having any notice of, or direct or imputed knowledge
of, the illegal acts, from being deprived of the use of their property. By way
of example and not limitation, if only a single apartment in a multiple-unit
dwelling is used for illegal purposes, as provided in this chapter, the City
Commission may vacate only the apartment unit used for the illegal purposes and
shall not vacate the entire building.
(Ord. 20-97. Passed 10-21-97.)
662.05 DETERMINATION OF PROPERTY AS A SITE OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE OR DRUG

      (3)   Either the same property is lawfully searched by a law enforcement
agency again within 182 days from the date of the first search, and illegal
controlled substances or illegal drug paraphernalia are found by the law
enforcement agency, or a subsequent violation of the Michigan Controlled
Substance Law, the Michigan Drug Paraphernalia Law or
Chapter 620 of this General Offenses Code occurs within 182 days.
   (b)   The notice to the owner required by this section shall contain a
report of the nature of the violation of the law found, the nature of the drugs
or drug paraphernalia seized, the individuals involved, and, with reasonable

prostitution at the location, an act of illegal gambling as proven by the
conviction of an individual for engaging in an act of illegal gambling at the
location, or the unlawful sale, furnishing or receipt of alcoholic beverages as
proven by the conviction of an individual for engaging in the unlawful sale,
furnishing or receipt of alcoholic beverages at the location;
      (2)   A written notice, informing the owner that an act of prostitution,
an act of illegal gambling, or the unlawful sale, furnishing or receipt of
alcoholic beverages, has occurred on the property, and of the potential
consequences under this chapter if further similar activity as described in
this section occurs at the property, has been personally served upon the owner,
has been sent by first class mail, with sufficient postage affixed, to the
owner, and has not been returned as undeliverable, or has been sent by
certified mail to the owner and a return receipt card has been received by the
City; and
      (3)   The same property is again proven to be the location of an act of
prostitution, an act of illegal gambling, or the unlawful sale, furnishing or
receipt of alcoholic beverages, within 182 days of the date of another offense

Court within fourteen days from the date of service by first class mail upon
the owner, or by publication in a local newspaper of general circulation,
whichever is later, of the City Commission's decision.
   (b)   The Circuit Court shall be limited in its review of the City
Commission's decision to determine whether an error of law, fraud or abuse of
discretion exists and whether the decision is supported by competent,
substantial and material evidence on the record as a whole. The Circuit Court's
review shall be made upon the record made before the City Commission. The
burden of proof shall be on the appealing party.
(Ord. 20-97. Passed 10-21-97.)
662.08 POSTING NOTICE OF VACATION AND PROHIBITED OCCUPANCY; LISTING OF PUBLIC
NUISANCES.

803.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   When a fire detection system, burglar alarm, or other alarm device is
activated, the City's Fire Department or Police Department respond to protect
the lives and property of the citizens and businesses of the City of Battle
Creek. This response often requires the Fire or Police Department to place
numerous emergency vehicles on the streets, which inherently increases the
dangers to members of the Fire and Police Departments, and to the residents and
visitors of the City. Although the City supports and encourages the use of
alarm systems to alert to fires and detect intruders, malfunctions of alarm
systems result in increased dangers, and unnecessary expense.
   The purpose of this chapter is to require alarm users throughout the City to
maintain operational reliability and to properly use alarm systems connected to
an alarm monitoring company in a manner which will reduce false alarm responses
required by Fire Department or Police Department personnel, thereby reducing
and preventing the misuse of fire and police resources at taxpayer expense.
Communities throughout the nation have found that the use of a regulatory
ordinance designed to first encourage remedial measures, with progressively
increased penalties imposed for failure to implement such measures, reduces the
overall number of false alarms by significant percentages. Therefore, in order
to further public safety and welfare, and to reduce the undue burden incurred
by taxpayers for false alarm responses, the City Commission hereby amends this
Chapter 803, which shall be known as "The City of Battle Creek Alarm Systems
Ordinance."
(Ord. 06-2023. Passed 6-6-23.)

maintenance;
      (4)   Triggered by an animal; or
      (5)   Triggered by testing without prior written notice to the City.
         “False alarm” does not include an alarm caused by meteorological or
geological conditions, activation of the system by disruption or disturbance of

(Ord. 13-85. Passed 7-16-85; Ord. 06-2023. Passed 6-6-23.)
803.05 ALARM USER PERMITS.
   (a)   Before the operation of an alarm system, or within thirty days after
the effective date of this amended chapter (Ordinance 06-2023, passed June 6,
2023) for alarm systems in operation on such date, every alarm user in the City
shall obtain an alarm user permit annually for each alarm system operated
within the City from the Police Department or the Fire Department. This section
does not require an alarm system agent or an alarm system contractor to obtain
a permit when it leases or provides services to alarm users. However, if an
alarm system agent or alarm system contractor uses an alarm system to protect
its own premises, it shall obtain a permit. Alarm users shall also comply with
the following:
      (1)   Alarm user permits are not transferrable. A new tenant, property
owner, or any other new user must apply for a new permit.
      (2)   If an alarm user operates both a burglar alarm and a fire alarm
from the same electrical panel, only one permit fee is required for the entire
system.
      (3)   Any person or business that uses an alarm system without having a
valid user permit shall be responsible for a civil infraction and subject to
civil fines and penalties of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) per alarm
use. If the Police Department or Fire Department responds to a call for
assistance from a user’s alarm system for which no permit has been obtained,
the responding department shall instruct the user to obtain the necessary
permit for the alarm system at the premises. The user shall be provided written
notice to apply for the necessary alarm permit within fourteen days. If an
alarm user permit application is not received within fourteen days, then no
later than twenty-one days after the first written notice, the user shall be
provided a second written notice to apply for the necessary alarm permit within
fourteen days. The Police Department shall send written notices for burglar
alarm systems. The Fire Department shall send written notices for fire alarm
systems. If an alarm user operates both a burglar alarm and a fire alarm from
the same electrical panel, then the notices may be sent by either the Police
Department or the Fire Department, but not both. If an alarm user has not
obtained a permit to use the alarm system after having been sent two written
notices informing the user to obtain a permit and notifying the user that the
Police Department or Fire Department will not respond to calls from non-
permitted alarm systems, then the Police Department or Fire Department may
refuse to respond to any further alarm calls from the user’s premises until an
alarm user permit is obtained and any applicable connection fee is paid.
(Ord 14-87. Passed 10-13-87.)
   (b)   Burglar alarms shall be registered with the Police Department. An
alarm user applying for a permit shall pay a registration and inspection fee as
provided in Section
802.24  and complete a permit application form annually containing the
following information:
      (1)   Alarm user’s name, and, if applicable, the name of any other person
responsible for the alarm system;
      (2)   The address of the residence or business in or upon which the alarm
system has been or will be installed;
      (3)   Alarm user’s home, business, and cellular telephone numbers, and
email address;
      (4)   The name of the alarm system agent or alarm system contractor
selling, installing, monitoring, inspecting, responding to and/or maintaining
the alarm system;
      (5)   The location of the annunciation panel; and
      (6)   The names and telephone numbers of at least three persons who can
be reached at any time, who are authorized to promptly respond to an alarm
system, who can open the premises in which the system is installed and who live
fifteen miles or less from the premises. The inability of the Police Department
to contact an individual named in this paragraph, or the failure of such
individual to promptly respond to a police inquiry, shall relieve the Police
Department of any obligation to follow up with checking the premises.
   (c)   Fire alarms shall be registered with the Fire Department. An alarm
user applying for a permit under this subsection shall pay a registration and
inspection fee as provided in Section
802.24 , and shall complete a permit application annually with the following
information:
      (1)   Alarm user’s name, and, if applicable, the name of any other person
responsible for the alarm system;
      (2)   The address of the residence or business in or upon which the alarm
system has been or will be installed;
      (3)   Alarm user’s home, business, and cellular telephone number(s), and
email address;
      (4)   The name of the alarm system agent or alarm system contractor
selling, installing, monitoring, inspecting, responding to and/or maintaining
the alarm system;
      (5)   The location of the annunciation panel; and
      (6)   The names and telephone numbers of at least three persons who can
be reached at any time who are authorized to promptly respond to an alarm
system, who can open the premises in which the system is installed and who live
fifteen miles or less from the premises. The inability of the Fire Department
to contact an individual named in this paragraph, or the failure of such
individual to promptly respond to a fire inquiry, shall relieve the Fire
Department of any obligation for the safekeeping of property and premises.
   (d)   Any change in the information required by subsection (b) or (c) hereof
shall be reported in writing to the Police Department or the Fire Department,
whichever is appropriate, within forty-eight hours of the change.
(Ord. 13-85. Passed 7-16-85; Ord. 06-2023. Passed 6-6-23.)
803.06 FALSE ALARMS; ALARM SAFETY BOARD; REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (a)   The following applies to false alarm fees and when an alarm user must
pay a false alarm fee to the City:
      (1)   No fee shall be charged for a first or second false alarm in a
calendar year. Fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be charged by the City and paid by
the alarm user for the third false alarm in a calendar year and the same for
each additional false alarm in a calendar year.
      (2)   Each calendar year shall run from 12:00 a.m. January 1 until 11:59
p.m. of the following December 31. The failure to pay such false alarm fees
shall be cause for revocation of the alarm user permit and unpaid fees may be
assessed against the real property tax for the premises and become a lien
thereon.
(Ord. 12-93. Passed 7-27-93; Ord. 11-2015. Passed 1-5-16.)
   (b)   Alarm conditions caused by the following extenuating circumstances
shall not constitute a false alarm and no false alarm fee shall be charged by
the City under such circumstances:
      (1)   Alarm system malfunctions, if occurring within thirty days from the
effective date of this amended chapter (Ordinance 06-2023, passed June 6, 2023)
for all alarm systems currently in use, or within thirty days after the
installation of an alarm system, whichever is later, if made for the purpose of
evaluating the alarm system and making necessary adjustments to eliminate false
alarms, and if corrective measures have been instituted. “Corrective measures”
means the alarm user has had the system inspected by an alarm system contractor
who shall cause a written report containing the results of the inspection, the
probable cause for the false alarm, the nature of any repairs undertaken or
performed to remedy the malfunction, and the contractor's recommendation for
limiting false alarms, which written report shall be filed with the Police
Department or the Fire Department, whichever is appropriate, within five days
of the inspection.
      (2)   Meteorological or geological conditions when a large number of
alarms or a large area of the City is affected, as determined by the City of
Battle Creek;
      (3)   Alarms activated by the disruption or disturbance of telephone or
other communication systems, by motor vehicle-utility pole accidents, or by
mechanical or electrical failure of the system or by industrial or commercial
accidents to the system; or
      (4)   Alarm conditions being activated by persons working on the alarm
system with prior written notification to the Police Department, or, in the
case of fire alarm systems, to the Fire Department:
   (c)   A system that malfunctions due to mechanical or electrical failure
will be put out of service until it is inspected and repaired by a licensed
alarm system contractor and until the system has been declared fit for service,
in writing, by the contractor. Appearance before the Alarm Safety Board
pursuant to this subsection is not required.
   (d)   Except for the circumstances set forth in above paragraph (b)(4),
which circumstances require prior written notification, the alarm user shall
provide notice of the extenuating circumstances set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)
or (b)(3) to the Police Department, or in the case of fire alarm systems, the
Fire Department, by filling out an alarm notification card and returning it to
the Police Department or the Fire Department, whichever is appropriate, within
five business days of the extenuating circumstances event. The timely
submission of an alarm notification card which indicates that the cause of the
false alarm was one of the reasons enumerated in this subsection shall result
in no false alarm fee notice being charged to the alarm user. Failure to notify
the Police Department or the Fire Department in the time set out in this
section will result in an automatic charge to the user. (Ord. 14-87. Passed 10-
13-87.)
   (e)   Within five business days following the response of a police officer
to an alarm call, a representative of the Police Chief, or within five business
days following the response of fire fighters to an alarm call, a representative
of the Fire Chief, shall mail a false alarm notification card to the alarm user
as named on the permit in Section 803.05. If the alarm user has provided
written authorization for email notification, alarm notification cards shall be
emailed to the alarm user.
   (f)   Within ten business days of the date of mailing, or emailing if
previously authorized by the alarm user as an acceptable method of contact, of
the false alarm notification card, the alarm user shall return the completed
card to the Police Department or the Fire Department, whichever is appropriate.
With the third, or each additional false alarm in a calendar year failure by
the alarm user to return the completed card shall cause an automatic charge of
the false alarm fee being sent to the alarm user.
   (g)   If, upon receiving a false alarm fee charge notice, the alarm user
wishes to request a waiver due to extenuating circumstances, the person may do
so, in writing, within ten business days of the assessment date. The waiver
request to the Police Department or the Fire Department, whichever is
appropriate, shall contain documentation of the extenuating circumstances
involved. Within thirty calendar days of the receipt of the waiver request by
the Police Department or the Fire Department, the Police Chief, the Fire Chief
or a designated representative shall make a determination on the waiver request
and shall notify the alarm user of the decision. (Ord. 13-85. Passed 7-16-85.)
   (h)   If the alarm user is not satisfied with the decision rendered by the
Police Chief or the Fire Chief, or a designated representative, an additional
request for a waiver may be filed within five business days of such decision by
appealing to the Alarm Safety Board. At its next regularly scheduled meeting
after receipt of the waiver request and documentation of extenuating
circumstances, the Board shall review the request, make a determination on the
waiver and notify the alarm user of the decision.
   (i)   There is hereby established an Alarm Safety Board. The Board shall
consist of five members. The Board shall include the Fire Chief, or the Fire
Chief’s designated representative, the Police Chief, or the Police Chief’s
designated representative, one Battle Creek City Commissioner, and two
residents of the City of Battle Creek who shall serve as members at large. The
members at large and their initial terms of office shall be recommended by the
Police Chief and Fire Chief, and confirmed by the City Commission. The City
Commission member shall be made by the Mayor, and confirmed by the City
Commission. The terms shall be three years (initial terms may be shorter) and
the members shall receive no compensation. A quorum shall consist of three
members of the Board. A member shall not pass on any question in which they
have an actual conflict of interest. The Board members shall make decisions
based upon the stated intent of this ordinance and its various provisions.
   (j)   An alarm system charged with more than six false alarm fee notices in
a calendar year is deemed defective and, upon written notice to the alarm user
by the Police or Fire Department, at the address listed in the registration of
the alarm system, the alarm user may be requested to appear before the Board to
show cause why the alarm user permit should not be revoked. The alarm user
shall have up to ten minutes to make an oral presentation and the Police Chief,
the Fire Chief, or a designated representative thereof shall have up to ten
minutes in rebuttal. At such hearing the Board may order the owner or lessee of
the alarm system to correct the system or may order the revocation of the alarm
user permit. The decision of the Board shall be final.
(Ord. 14-87. Passed 10-13-87.)
   (k)   Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this chapter, alarm
systems which malfunction, three times for fire alarms or six times for burglar
alarms within a calendar year, are deemed defective and may be put out of
service resulting in no response by the Police Department or Fire Department,
whichever is appropriate, upon written notice to the alarm user, at the address
listed in the registration of the alarm system. Before an alarm system is put
back in service, the alarm user shall file a written report to the Police Chief
or the Fire Chief, whichever is appropriate depending on which type of alarm
system was deemed defective, documenting the causes of malfunction and the
corrective actions taken. Upon receipt of the report, the Police Chief or Fire
Chief, whichever is appropriate, shall, within ten business days, notify the
alarm user whether the alarm system may be put back in service, or give written
notice that the alarm user may appear before the Board to show cause why the
alarm user permit should not be revoked pursuant to the procedures set forth in
subsection (h) hereof.
   (l)   Alarm verification calls required. All residential or commercial
burglar alarms that have central monitoring, must have a central monitoring
verification call made to the premises generating the alarm signal, prior to
central monitoring personnel contacting the Dispatch Center. This does not
apply to panic or holdup type alarms. Alarm monitoring companies will make
available to the Police Department or Fire Department, upon request, records
providing proof that the monitoring company made the verification call.
   (m)   Right to discontinue response:
      (1)   The Police Chief, or the Police Chief’s designated representative,
may discontinue alarm response by the Police Department to any location that is
responsible for six false burglar alarms within a calendar year, or to a
business location that uses an alarm system installed or operated by a business
that is not licensed with the State of Michigan, or to a premises where the
alarm user has failed to obtain a permit after being notified to do so.
      (2)   The Fire Chief, or the Fire Chief’s designated representative, may
discontinue alarm response by the Fire Department to any location that is
responsible for three false fire alarms within a calendar year, or to a
business location that uses an alarm system installed or operated by a business
that is not licensed with the State of Michigan, or to a premises where the
alarm user has failed to obtain a permit after being notified to do so.
      (3)   Written notification that the Police Department or Fire Department
will no longer respond to alarm calls from a particular location will be sent
to the alarm user and, if there is one, the alarm monitoring company contact
person of record.
   (n)   Request for Reinstatement of Alarm Responses. A request for
reinstatement of alarm responses shall require submission of proof that the
user or alarm system contractor responsible for the alarm has corrected the
reason for the false alarms to the satisfaction of the Police Department or
Fire Department depending upon which type of alarm response was suspended, the
payment of all fees and penalties charged as a result of false alarms, and
proof that the alarm user has obtained a valid alarm permit. Such request shall
be submitted to the Fire Department or the Police Department, depending upon
which type of alarm response was suspended.
   (o)   Failure to comply with any provision or order in this section shall
result, after due notice, in the revocation of the registration or permit
provided for in this chapter.
(Ord. 13-85. Passed 7-16-85; Ord. 06-2023. Passed 6-6-23.)
803.07   INSPECTIONS.

804.01 PURPOSE.
   The transportation of sick or injured persons by public or private
ambulances is a matter closely affecting the public health, safety and welfare.
It is recognized that only by requiring all ambulance operations to meet the
same standards of care can the practice of ambulance companies operating
without full advanced mobile emergency care service, concentrating on answering
nonemergency calls or cutting back on equipment and training to the economic
detriment of companies with full emergency capacity and to the general
detriment of persons in need of emergency care, be prevented. The State permits
municipalities to regulate ambulance and life support emergency care service.
Therefore, it is the intention of this chapter to require ambulances and the
mobile emergency care providers operating within the City, unless otherwise
exempted, to provide advanced mobile emergency care service as a prerequisite
to licensure.

to prescribe procedures to provide a reasonable opportunity for consideration
of the views of interested parties in connection with basic cable service rate
regulation by the City.
   (b)   This chapter shall be implemented and interpreted consistent with the
Act and FCC rules. In connection with the regulation of rates for basic cable
service and associated equipment, the City adopts by reference and shall follow
all FCC rules, as set forth in Subpart N (Cable Rate Regulation) of Part 76

(Ord. 11-94. Passed 8-16-94.)

   (a)   A cable operator shall submit its schedule of rates for the basic
service tier and associated equipment or a proposed increase in such rates in
accordance with the Act and FCC rules. The cable operator shall include as part
of its submission such information as is necessary to show that its schedule of
rates or its proposed increase in rates complies with the Act and FCC rules.
The cable operator shall file ten copies of the schedule or proposed increase
with the City Clerk. For purposes of this chapter, the filing of the cable
operator shall be deemed to have been made when at least ten copies have been
received by the Clerk. The City Commission may, by resolution or otherwise,

evidence upon the record, that its schedule of rates for the basic service tier

Act and FCC rules, including, without limitation, 47 USC 543 and 47 CFR 76.922
and 76.923.
(Ord. 11-94. Passed 8-16-94.)
810.05 PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.
   (a)   If this chapter, any rules or regulations adopted by the City pursuant
to this chapter, or any request for information pursuant to Section
810.04, requires the production of proprietary information, the cable operator
shall produce the information. However, at the time the allegedly proprietary
information is submitted, a cable operator may request that specific,
identified portions of its response be treated as confidential and withheld
from public disclosure. The request must state the reason why the information
should be treated as proprietary and the facts that support those reasons. The
request for confidentiality will be granted if the City determines that
nondisclosure is consistent with the provisions of the Federal Freedom of
Information Act, 5 USC 552 et seq., as amended. The City shall place any
decision that results in information being withheld in a file for public
inspection. If the cable operator requests confidentiality and the request is
denied, where the cable operator is proposing a rate increase, the proposal may
be withdrawn, in which case the allegedly proprietary information will be
returned to the cable operator or the cable operator may seek review within
seven working days of the denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the
information will be stayed pending review.
   (b)   Any interested person may file a request to inspect material withheld
as proprietary with the City. The City shall weigh the policy considerations
favoring nondisclosure against the reasons cited for permitting inspection in
light of the facts of the particular case. The City will then promptly notify
the requesting person and the cable operator that submitted the information as
to the disposition of the request. The City may grant, deny or condition a
request. The requesting person or the cable operator may seek review of the
decision by filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Disclosure will be
stayed pending resolution of any appeal.
   (c)   The procedures set forth in this section shall be construed as
analogous to and consistent with the rules of the FCC regarding requests for
confidentiality, including, without limitation, 47 CFR 0.459.

(Ord. 04-2020. Passed 10-6-20.)
818.08   INSPECTIONS; PERIODIC INSPECTIONS; INVESTIGATION OF COMPLAINTS.
   (a)   Permit Application Inspection. Upon the filing of a completed permit
application form, whether initial or renewal, the proposed accommodations and
structure shall be inspected by City code and fire officials for compliance
with the requirements of local and state codes by consent or upon the issuance
of an administrative search warrant.
   (b)   An All Trades Inspection. An all trades inspection may be scheduled
and made when, during the course of an inspection provided for under this
chapter, a code official concludes that there are violations, which considering
the nature and/or severity of the violation, either poses a hazard to the
health, safety or welfare of the occupants or that an all trades inspection is
needed either to properly determine the extent of the violations or the
corrective action required to comply with the Property Maintenance Code.
    (c)   Additional Inspections. Additional inspections may be scheduled and
conducted on one or more of the following basis:
      (1)   Due to recurrent violations, a combined three or more substantiated
recurrent or uncorrected violations for a particular structure and/or
accommodations and/or unit(s) within a structure, within a twelve-month period
from the date of the most recent violation.
      (2)   Whenever reasonable cause exists to believe that there is a
violation of the Property Maintenance Code on any premises, or other condition
(s) which make the structure or premises unsafe, dangerous, hazardous or a
nuisance.
      (3)   For the purpose of auditing compliance with conditions on a permit.
      (4)   For the purpose of reinspection to ensure the correction of any
violations in existence at a previous inspection.
      (5)   For all other purposes set forth in Section
1462.01 .
   (d)   Inspection of Multiple Units. For properties having more than fifty
units, a minimum of 25% of the units contained in those properties shall be
inspected. The units to be inspected shall be randomly selected by the code
official. The number of units inspected may be increased at the discretion of
the code official should significant code violations be found or should the
inspector have reasonable cause to believe other violations exist in the
uninspected units.
     (e)   Notification and Presence of Owner at Inspection. Subject to below
subsection (f), the owner(s), or the owner's legal agent if any, shall be
notified of any initial or renewal inspections for the purposes of permitting.
The failure of the owner(s) or owner's legal agent to appear for the inspection
after notification does not preclude the inspection if access to the structure
or unit can otherwise be lawfully obtained.
    (f)   Entry for Inspection. Except as otherwise provided by law, authorized
inspections inside a unit will be made during reasonable hours with the consent
of an owner, legal agent, or occupant. Entry without the consent of an owner,
legal agent, or occupant, will be made only after obtaining an administrative
or criminal search warrant for the premises, a court order allowing entry of
the premises for inspection, or otherwise as provided by law.
    (g)   Failure to Allow Inspection During Permit Application Process. The
refusal of an owner or the owner's legal agent to allow an inspection of the
unit shall not provide a basis, in whole or in part, to deny the issuance of a
permit under this chapter. The owner or the owner's agent retain the right to
decline to consent to inspections under this chapter. The City, however, may
issue permits absent an inspection on a conditional basis, subject to
inspection of the proposed structure, accommodations, or unit pursuant to
either an administrative subpoena, an administrative search warrant, or any
other order by a court having jurisdiction. A conditional permit under this
section will automatically become a regular permit, subject to all other
provisions of this chapter, after an inspection showing that the structure
satisfies the requirements of the Property Maintenance Code or within ninety
days after the conditional permit was issued, whichever occurs first, unless
uncorrected cited violations remain outstanding.
    (h)   Inspection Reports. If there are any violations noted on an
inspection, within ten business days after an inspection has been conducted,
the owner(s) or the owner's legal agent shall be given written notice of the
results. The notice of the inspection results shall be given personally or by
first class mail at the most recent address provided to the City Community
Services Department Code Compliance Division.

829.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Chauffeur" means a person who is employed for the principal purpose
of operating a motor vehicle and any person who drives a motor vehicle while in
use as a contract motor carrier of passengers. A person shall be deemed to be
employed for the principal purpose of operating a motor vehicle when the
person's employment customarily involves the necessary use of a motor vehicle
for hire or the transporting of passengers and their baggage for hire.
   (b)   "Limousine" means any motor vehicle for hire which is engaged in the
transportation of persons upon the public streets, other than as a common
carrier by contract on an hourly basis, the rated capacity of which is more
than six but less than ten persons. "Limousine" may also mean a motor vehicle
for hire which is engaged in the transportation of persons upon the public
streets, other than a common carrier by contract on an hourly basis, with a
rated capacity of six persons and which operates in such a fashion that all of
its trips originate or terminate outside the City.
   (c)   "Street" means every publicly maintained way open to the use of the
public for purposes of vehicular traffic.
(Ord 23-83. Passed 7-12-83; Ord. 7-90. Passed 2-27-90.)
829.02 CHAUFFEUR'S LICENSE AND PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person, either as principal, agent or employee, shall operate a limousine
on the streets of the City without having first obtained a chauffeur's license
from the Secretary of State and a permit under this chapter.
(Ord. 23-83. Passed 7-12-83.)
829.03 PERMIT APPLICATION; INVESTIGATION; ISSUANCE.
   (a)   A person desiring a permit to operate a limousine shall file with the
City Clerk an application therefor stating:
      (1)   The name, age and residence of the person applying for the permit;
      (2)   Whether or not the applicant himself or herself is to drive such
limousine and whether or not a driver is to be hired; and
      (3)   The type of motor vehicle to be used, the vehicle identification
number, the State license number and the seating capacity of any such vehicle
according to its trade rating.
   (b)   The City Clerk shall refer the application to the Chief of Police who
shall cause an investigation to be made of the fitness of the applicant as to
his or her character and ability and who shall transmit the application, with
his or her recommendation, to the City Commission. If, in the opinion of the
City Commission, the person making the application is a proper person, both as
to his or her experience and character, the City Commission may authorize,
through resolution, the granting of a permit upon the payment of the permit fee
and upon the filing of a policy of insurance as provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 23-83. Passed 7-12-83.)
829.04 REASONS FOR REFUSAL OF PERMIT.
   The City Commission may refuse to issue a permit to operate a limousine
when, in its opinion, there are a sufficient number of limousines operating
under permit to adequately serve the public, there are reasonably sufficient
existing operating transportation facilities to serve the public demand, or the
use of the streets by additional limousines would interfere with the public use
of the streets, cause traffic to become congested or endanger the person or
property of pedestrians or others using the streets.
(Ord. 23-83. Passed 7-12-83.)
829.05 PERMIT FEES.
   Before any permit is issued to operate a limousine, the applicant shall pay
to the City Clerk a permit fee, as specified in the schedule provided for in
Section
802.24, for each limousine to be operated under such permit by authority of the
City Commission. No applicant shall operate, nor shall the City Clerk issue a
permit for, more limousines than the City Commission, by resolution, authorizes
for such applicant. The City Clerk shall record the vehicle identification
number and license number for each limousine and shall deliver a permit for
each motor vehicle to be used. Such permit shall be kept in the limousine, but
need not be openly displayed. If a vehicle under this section is sold or
disposed of by the operator, then the permit shall be surrendered to the City
Clerk, and upon payment of a fee the City Clerk may issue another permit for
the remainder of the license year for the vehicle replacing the one sold or
disposed of.
(Ord. 23-83. Passed 7-12-83.)
829.06 REQUIREMENTS FOR DRIVERS.
   No person who is authorized to operate a limousine shall employ a driver
unless such driver has obtained a chauffeur's license from the Secretary of
State. Every person employed as a driver of a limousine shall be registered
with the Police Department of the City. Each registrant shall state his or her
full name, date of birth, residence and driver's license number. Such
information shall be kept current. Failure to keep such information current or
failure to register with the Police Department shall be deemed good cause for
the revocation of a limousine permit.
(Ord. 23-83. Passed 7-12-83.)
829.07 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (a)   No person shall:
      (1)   While operating a limousine, violate any section of the Michigan
Vehicle Code, being Act 300 of the Public Acts of 1949, as amended, or the
Uniform Traffic Code as adopted by the City in
Chapter 410 of these Codified Ordinances;
      (2)   Allow any limousine to be used for immoral purposes or in the
procurement of any person for immoral purposes;
      (3)   Operate any limousine upon any street unless the owner files with
the City Clerk proof of insurance issued by an insurance company licensed to do
business in the State and approved by the City Commission, providing insurance
coverage for each limousine operated by the applicant with a maximum liability
as set forth in the schedule provided for in Section
802.24;
      (4)   Fail to notify the Police Department within eight hours after any
accident, giving the time and the location of the accident, the name of any
person injured, the character of injuries, so far as known, and, in the case of
property damage, the estimated amount of damage; or
      (5)   While on duty, solicit passengers for the limousine.
   (b)   The operator and owner of every limousine under a permit issued
pursuant to this chapter shall be responsible for maintaining such limousine,
at all times, in a neat and clean condition, both inside and outside, and in a
safe and proper operating condition. No limousine shall be operated that is in
need of repair, is unsightly or is in a dilapidated condition. This section
shall be enforced by the Police Department and the Department is authorized to
inspect all limousines from time to time, at reasonable times and places. The
Department shall notify, in writing, the owner or operator of any limousine
that fails to comply with any provision of this chapter of the specific reason
why such limousine fails to comply and order such owner or operator to correct
such condition. Failure of the owner or operator to correct the condition of
such vehicle within five days from the date of such notice, and continuance of
the use of such vehicle as a limousine, are hereby declared to be a violation
of this chapter. Persistent and habitual violation of this chapter shall be
grounds for revocation of the limousine permit with respect to the vehicle in
question, as well as grounds for revocation of the applicant's permit for
operating a limousine in the City.
(Ord. 23-83. Passed 7-12-83.)
   (c)   Whoever violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of a misdemeanor and
shall be subject to the penalty provided in Section
202.99.
(Ord. 16-95. Passed 6-20-95.)
829.08 SEATING REQUIREMENTS.
   No driver shall permit any person to sit in a limousine who is not a
passenger for hire or an official or employee of a person holding a permit
under which the limousine is operating. No person shall be carried in the front
seat of any limousine unless such person is an official or employee of a person
holding a permit under which the limousine is operating or is a passenger for
hire, and then only if the passenger compartment is fully occupied by
passengers.
(Ord. 23-83. Passed 7-12-83.)
829.09 OPEN INTOXICANTS.
   A person may transport or possess alcoholic liquor which is open or uncapped
or upon which the seal is broken within the passenger compartment of a
limousine being operated upon the streets of the City, provided that all Liquor
Control Commission rules and regulations are complied with, and provided,
further, that such passenger is at least twenty-one years of age and that the
front seat area is physically separated from the passenger compartment of the
limousine by a partition. No person shall transport or possess alcoholic liquor
which is open or uncapped or upon which the seal is broken within the front
seat area of a limousine.
(Ord. 23-83. Passed 7-12-83.)
829.10 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (a)   A violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, of the Traffic
Code or of the Michigan Vehicle Code shall be sufficient grounds for the
revocation of any permit issued under this chapter, and shall be considered
sufficient grounds for the refusal to grant a permit in the first instance.
   (b)   Any permit issued under this chapter may be revoked or suspended by
the Chief of Police for a definite period for misrepresentation of any material
fact in the application for permit or for failure or neglect to comply with any
of the provisions of this chapter.
   (c)   In addition to the basis for revocation and/or suspension in
subsections (a) and (b) above, the City Commission may revoke a permit for
cause in accordance with Section
802.17.
   (d)   Any person whose permit is denied, revoked or suspended shall be
entitled to a hearing in accordance with Section
802.16.

829.11 PERIODIC INSPECTIONS.
   At least once a year, the Chief of Police shall cause an inspection to be
made of each limousine for which a permit is issued under this chapter to see
that the limousine complies with this chapter and is safe for use. The owner or
operator of each such limousine is required to have such limousine presented at
police headquarters of the City for such inspection at such time as the Police
Department may require.
(Ord. 23-83. Passed 7-12-83.)
829.12 AIRPORT LIMOUSINE SERVICE.
   This chapter shall not apply to any person operating a regularly scheduled
limousine service to and from the Terminal Building at W.K. Kellogg Regional
Airport for the transportation of persons or baggage pursuant to a contract
with the City. No person or limousine service shall transport passengers for
hire from the Terminal Building at W.K. Kellogg Regional Airport, nor shall any
person advertise, solicit, sell or offer for sale the service of transporting
passengers for hire from the Terminal Building at W.K. Kellogg Regional
Airport, on a regularly scheduled basis, unless the same is done pursuant to a
contract with the City.
(Ord. 23-83. Passed 7-12-83.)

if any of the following circumstances exist regarding the Applicant or an
Applicant's Affiliate (as defined by the MMFLA):
         (A)   Conviction of or release from incarceration for a felony under
the laws of this state, any other state, or the United States within the past

convicted of a crime which, if it had occurred prior to submittal of the
application, could have been cause for denial of the permit application.
         (D)   The Applicant has knowingly submitted an application for a

         (H)   The Applicant fails to meet other criteria established by State-

or designee from imposing other penalties authorized by the City of Battle
Creek ordinances or other ordinance of the city, including filing a public
nuisance action or any other legal action in a court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 02-2018. Passed 2-6-18.)

   The City intends to issue permits for certain adult use recreational
marihuana establishments, and to regulate the same, to the extent they are
permitted under the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act. The City
does not intend that permitting and regulation under this chapter should be
construed as a finding that such establishments comply with any law. By
requiring a City Adult Use Marihuana Establishment (AUME) Permit and compliance
with the requirements of this chapter, the City intends to protect the public
health, safety and welfare by:
   (a)   Promoting the safe, regulated manufacturing, production, and sale by
state-licensed establishments of adult use recreational marihuana to adults age
twenty-one and over, and to ensure the safe access to recreational marihuana to
the City's residents of requisite age;
   (b)   Discouraging the sale of unsafe and unlicensed adult use recreational
marihuana products;
   (c)   Specifically prohibiting the granting of special licenses within the
City;
   (d)   Preserving and protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the
residents of the City and the general public by minimizing unsafe and
unregulated adult use recreational marihuana production and sale; and
   (e)   Establishing standards and procedures by which the siting, operating,
and maintaining of an adult recreational marihuana establishment shall be
governed.

835.11 GROUNDS FOR DENIAL, SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF AUME PERMIT; AUME PERMIT
FORFEITURE; HEARING.
   (a)   Grounds for Denial.
      (1)   The City Cannabis Coordinator shall reject any application that
does not meet the requirements of the MRTMA or this chapter. The City Cannabis
Coordinator shall reject any application that contains any misrepresentation or
omission of any material fact (materiality as determined by the City), or false
or misleading information, or the applicant has provided the City with any
other false or misleading information related to the marihuana establishment.
      (2)   An applicant is ineligible to receive a permit under this chapter
if any of the following circumstances exist regarding the applicant or an
applicant's affiliate (as defined by the MRTMA):
         A.   Prior conviction under the laws of this state, any other state,
or the United States that involved distribution of a controlled substance to a
minor.
         B.   Any person required to be named on the permit application is
convicted of a crime which, if it had occurred prior to submittal of the
application, could have been cause for denial of the permit application.
         C.   The applicant has knowingly submitted an application for a permit
that contains false, misleading or fraudulent information, or who has
intentionally omitted pertinent information on the application for a license.
         D.   Is an employee, advisor, or consultant of the agency involved in
the implementation, administration, or enforcement of the Act or the Rules.
         E.   The applicant fails to provide and maintain adequate premises
liability and casualty insurance for its proposed marihuana establishment.

another state, or the federal government; is a member of or employed by a
regulatory body of a governmental unit in this state, another state, or the

subdivision does not apply to an elected officer of or employee of a federally
recognized Indian tribe or to an elected precinct delegate.
         G.   The applicant fails to meet other criteria established by state-
issued rule.
      (3)   In determining whether to grant an AUME permit to an applicant, the
City may also consider all of the following:
         A.   Whether the applicant or anyone who will have ownership in the
marihuana establishment has a pattern of convictions involving dishonesty,
theft, or fraud that indicate the proposed marihuana establishment is unlikely
to be operated with honesty and integrity.
         B.   Whether the applicant has a history of noncompliance with any

charges, or government investigations, whether initiated, pending, or

applicable to the state license category and standards, requirements in this
chapter, as well as compliance with other applicable city ordinances.

does not commence operations within one year of issuance of a City AUME permit,
the AUME permit shall be deemed forfeited; the business may not commence
operations and the permit is not eligible for renewal.

chapter is a revocable privilege granted by the City and is not a property

other property interest. Each AUME permit is exclusive to the permittee, and a
permittee or any other person must apply for and receive the City's approval
before a permit is transferred, sold, or purchased. An AUME permittee or any
other person shall not lease, pledge, or borrow or loan money against an AUME
permit. The attempted transfer, sale or other conveyance of an interest in a
license without prior agency approval is grounds for suspension or revocation
of the AUME permit or for other sanction considered appropriate by the City.

requirements, conditions or provisions of this chapter or with any applicable

issuance of the license and those imposed as a result of any disciplinary
proceedings held subsequent to the date of issuance of the permit;
         C.   The City, the County, or any other governmental entity with
jurisdiction, has closed the marihuana establishment temporarily or permanently
or has issued any sanction for failure to comply with the health and safety

public health and safety;
         D.   The marihuana establishment is determined by the City to have
become a public nuisance pursuant to Chapter 662 Public Nuisance Abatement of
these City Ordinances or other applicable state nuisance law;

suspended or revoked; or

without limitation, a continuing pattern of conduct, a continuing pattern or
drug-related criminal conduct within the premises of the marihuana commercial
entity or in the immediate area surrounding such business, a continuing pattern
of criminal conduct directly related to or arising from the operation of the
marihuana commercial entity, or an ongoing nuisance condition emanating from or
caused by the marihuana commercial entity. Criminal conduct considered shall be
limited to the violation of a state law or regulation or City ordinance.

subsection (d)(1) above, the City Manager may revoke a permit for cause in

835.12 REVOCATION NOT EXCLUSIVE PENALTY.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prohibit the City administration
or designee from imposing other penalties authorized by the City of Battle
Creek ordinances or other ordinance of the city, including filing a public
nuisance action or any other legal action in a court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 14-2019. Passed 10-15-19; Ord. 11-2022. Passed 11-1-22.)
835.99 PENALTY.
   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a person who violates or fails
to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter is responsible for a Class
F Municipal civil infraction and shall be subject to the civil fines provided
in Section
202.98 and any other relief that may be imposed by the court.

an application initiated for the same property is deemed a new application
requiring compliance with all initial permit application provisions, including
any application fee.
   (f)   Renewal of rental permit. An application for the renewal of the rental
permit shall be made as follows:

application form. The permittee must provide all changes in information from

(Ord. 03-2011. Passed 4-19-11; Ord. 12-17. Passed 12-5-17.)
842.08 INSPECTION OF RENTAL UNITS.
   (a)   Permit application inspection. Upon the filing of a completed rental
permit application form, whether initial or renewal, the proposed rental
dwelling shall be inspected by a code official for compliance with the
requirements of the Property Maintenance Code by consent or upon the issuance
of an administrative search warrant.
   (b)   An all trades inspection. An all trades inspection can be scheduled
and made when, during the course of an inspection provided for under this
chapter, a code official concludes that there are violations, which considering
the nature and/or severity of the violation, either poses a hazard to the
health, safety or welfare of the occupants or that a trade inspection is needed
either to properly determine the extent of the violations or the corrective
action required to comply with the Property Maintenance Code.
   (c)   Additional inspections. Additional inspections may be scheduled and
conducted on one or more of the following bases:
      (1)   Due to recurrent violations, such that any rental dwelling or the
owner of any rental dwelling has been found to have a combined three or more
substantiated recurrent or uncorrected violations for a particular rental
dwelling and/or rental unit(s) within a rental dwelling, within a twelve-month
period from the date of the most recent violation.
      (2)    Whenever reasonable cause exists to believe that there is a
violation of the Property Maintenance Code on any premises, or other condition
(s) which make the structure or premises unsafe, dangerous, hazardous or a
nuisance.
      (3)   For the purpose of auditing compliance with conditions on a permit.
      (4)   For the purpose of reinspection to ensure the correction of any
violations in existence at a previous inspection.
      (5)   For all other purposes set forth in Section
1462.01.
   (d)   Inspection of certain multiple dwellings. For multiple rental
dwellings having more than twenty rental units, a minimum of twenty percent of
the units contained in those properties shall be inspected prior to renewal of
a rental permit with a minimum of four units inspected per structure. The units
to be inspected shall be randomly selected by the code official. The number of
units inspected may be increased at the discretion of the code official should
significant code violations be found or should the inspector have reasonable
cause to believe other violations exist in the uninspected units.
   (e)   Notification and presence of owner at inspection. Except as provided
in subsection (f), the owner, or the owner's legal agent if any, shall be
notified of any initial or renewal inspections for the purposes of permitting.
The failure of the owner or owner's legal agent to appear for the inspection
after notification does not preclude the inspection if access to the rental
dwelling or rental unit can otherwise be lawfully obtained.
   (f)   Entry for inspection. Except as otherwise provided by law, authorized
inspections inside a dwelling will be made during reasonable hours with the
consent of an owner, legal agent, tenant, or occupant. Entry without the
consent of an owner, legal agent, tenant, or occupant, will be made only after
obtaining an administrative or criminal search warrant for the premises, a
court order allowing entry of the premises for inspection, or otherwise as
provided by law.
   (g)   Failure to allow inspection during permit application process. The
refusal of an owner or the owner’s legal agent to allow an inspection of the
rental unit shall not provide a basis, in whole or in part, to deny the
issuance of a rental permit under this chapter. The owner or the owner’s agent
retain the right to decline to consent to inspections under this chapter. The
City, however, may issue rental permits absent an inspection on a conditional
basis, subject to inspection of the proposed rental dwelling pursuant to either
an administrative subpoena, an administrative search warrant, or any other
order by a court having jurisdiction. A conditional permit under this section
will automatically become a regular rental permit, subject to all other
provisions of this chapter, after an inspection showing that the dwelling
satisfies the requirements of the Property Maintenance Code or within ninety-
days after the conditional permit was issued unless uncorrected cited
violations remain outstanding, whichever occurs first.
   (h)   Inspection reports . If there are any violations noted on an
inspection, within ten business days after an inspection has been conducted,
the owner or the owner's legal agent shall be given written notice of the
results. The notice of the inspection results shall be given personally or by
first class mail at the most recent address provided to the City Clerk.

outstanding Property Maintenance Code violation at the time of the requested
transfer, an inspection is not required;

   (d)   Standard of review. In determining whether to issue or deny a rental

      (1)   The property is currently in compliance with the Property
Maintenance Code.

Maintenance Code, the nature of the violations, including whether the
outstanding violations constitute a hazard to the health, safety, or welfare of
the occupants of the property or the public.

rental property in the past where the rental permit has been suspended or
revoked or has had entered against them court judgments for rental property
violations.

an application, in attachments to the application, or otherwise to a City
employee in the course of their duties under the Property Maintenance Code or

either, has owned or managed rental property within the three preceding years
and have, on two or more occasions, had a rental permit suspended or revoked or
had entered against them court judgments for rental property violations.
         C.   The owner or owner's legal agent has failed to allow, or arrange
for, an inspection that is required under the Property Maintenance Code.
         D.   False material information has been provided on an application,
in attachments to the application, or otherwise to a City employee in the
course of their duties under the Property Maintenance Code or other City
ordinance in relation to the subject rental dwelling.

notified in writing, by first class mail sent to the address on the

shall be included in the notice.
   (g)   Suspension or revocation. Suspension or revocation of a rental permit

area occupied by the sidewalk cafe, designed to allow safe and efficient
adequate pedestrian movement adjacent to the sidewalk cafe and street. Sidewalk

create a hazard, a sight distance obstruction for motor vehicle operators, nor
unduly impede pedestrian traffic. The sidewalk cafe area shall be separated
from pedestrian traffic and vehicular traffic by an approved, fixed barrier.
Wrought iron or decorative ironwork will serve as an acceptable barrier.
   (b)   Where on-street parking exists in front of a proposed sidewalk cafe
establishment, the area of the public right-of-way dedicated for this off-
street parking in front of the establishment may be used to construct a
platform that may be used to divert pedestrian traffic around a sidewalk cafe.
The prescribed area in which the platform exists, and the design of the
platform, must be approved by the City.
   (c)   Any such platform shall:

No objects that are part of a sidewalk cafe, except lighting fixtures, railing,
awnings, or other non-permanent covers, may be attached, even in a temporary
manner, to any building or structure that the sidewalk cafe abuts. When the

850.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter, unless it appears from the context that a different
meaning is intended:
      i.   "Street" means any street, alley, avenue, court, lane or public
place in the City.
      ii.   "Taxicab" means any motor vehicle used in the business of carrying
persons for hire and carrying six passengers or less, provided that automobiles
used exclusively as hearses, ambulances, hotel buses or sightseeing buses shall
not be construed to be taxicabs.
(1975 Code Sec. 7.151)
850.02 LICENSE REQUIRED.
   No person, either as principal, agent or employee, shall operate a taxicab
on the streets of the City without having first obtained a license therefor.
(1975 Code Sec. 7.152)
850.03 LICENSE APPLICATION.
   a.   A person desiring a license to operate a taxicab shall file with the
City Clerk an application therefor stating:
      (1)   The name, age and residence of the person applying for the license
and what, if any, previous experience he has had in such business;
      (2)   Whether the applicant himself is to drive such a taxicab or whether
a driver or drivers are to be hired or paid a commission; and
      (3)   The type of motor vehicle to be used, the horsepower, the factory
number, the State license number, the number of years the car has been driven
and the seating capacity of any such car according to its trade rating. No
license shall be issued to operate any taxicab in the City which has less than
four doors.
   b.   If a licensee is also to be a driver, he must obtain a permit as
provided in Section
850.07.
(1975 Code Sec. 7.153)
850.04 INVESTIGATION OF APPLICANT; LICENSE ISSUANCE.
   The City Clerk shall refer the application to the Chief of Police who shall
cause an investigation to be made of the fitness of the applicant as to his
character and ability and who shall transmit the application with his
recommendation to the City Commission. If, in the opinion of the City
Commission, the person making the application is proper person, both as to his
experience and character, the City Commission may authorize the granting of a
license upon payment of the license fee and filing of a policy of insurance as
herein provided.
(1975 Code Sec. 7.154)
850.05 REASONS FOR REFUSAL OF LICENSES.
   The City Commission may refuse a license when, in its opinion, there are a
sufficient number of taxicabs licensed to adequately serve the public, or when,
in the judgment of the City Commission, existing operating transportation
facilities are reasonably sufficient to serve the public demand, or when the
use of the streets by additional taxicabs would interfere with the public use
of the streets, congest traffic or endanger the person or property of
pedestrians or others using the streets.
(1975 Code Sec. 7.155)
850.06 AUTHORIZED TAXICABS; LICENSE FEES AND STICKERS.
   Before any license is issued to operate a taxicab, the applicant shall pay
to the City Clerk a license fee as specified in the schedule provided for in
Section
802.24 for each taxicab to be operated under such license by authority of the
City Commission. No licensee shall operate, nor shall the City Clerk issue a
license for, more taxicabs than the City Commission, by resolution, authorizes
for such licensee. The City Clerk shall record the motor number, license number
and complete identification for each taxicab and shall deliver and assign for
each a license sticker to be affixed in the lower left corner of the front
windshield of the taxicab to which it is assigned. Each sticker shall bear a
taxicab license number and the design or color of the sticker shall be changed
annually. If the sticker is lost or destroyed, then the Clerk may, upon payment
of a fee as set forth in the schedule provided for in Section
802.24, issue another for such vehicle for the remainder of the license year.
If a licensed vehicle is sold or disposed of by the operator, then upon payment
of a fee, and upon surrender of the license sticker, the City Clerk may issue
another license sticker for the remainder of the license year for the vehicle,
replacing the one sold or disposed of.
(Ord. 8-84. Passed 3-13-84.)
850.07 DRIVER'S PERMITS; APPLICATION AND EXAMINATION.
   (a)   A person authorized and licensed to operate a taxicab under this
chapter shall not permit, hire or employ any individual to drive a taxicab
under his or her control unless such individual has obtained a driver's permit
as provided by this chapter.
   (b)   No person shall drive or physically operate a taxicab upon City
streets without obtaining a permit to do so as provided by this chapter,
provided, however, any person licensed to operate or permitted to operate or
drive a taxicab in any other municipality may carry passengers from such
municipality to any place or point within the City and may enter and
temporarily travel upon the streets and thoroughfares of the City for that
purpose without the need to procure a license under this chapter, but such
operator or driver shall not solicit business on the streets of this City or
otherwise do business within the City without a license from the City.
   (c)   An application for a permit to operate or drive a taxicab upon the
streets of the City shall be made to the Police Department of the City upon
blanks furnished by the City Clerk. Each applicant shall state his or her name,
age, residence and length of residence in the City, how long he or she has been
engaged in driving an automobile and whether or not he or she has ever been
convicted of or pled guilty to a violation of any ordinance or statute and, if
so, giving the nature of the offense. Each applicant shall be of good character
and shall give as references to his or her character the names and addresses of
three residents of the City.
   (d)   The Police Department shall make an examination as to whether such
applicant is worthy, capable, of good moral character and properly qualified by
experience to operate and drive a taxicab and shall, as soon as the examination
required by this section has been concluded, return such application with its
report to the City Clerk.
   (e)   The examination required by this section shall be based on the
knowledge of the provisions of the Michigan Vehicle Code, as amended, the
Uniform Traffic Code as adopted by the City, and the rules and regulations
provided in this chapter. In addition, the applicant shall be tested as to his
or her ability to operate a taxicab vehicle. If an applicant fails to pass the
examination, no permit shall be granted to him or her. However, he or she shall
be given an opportunity for re-examination within three months from the date of
the first examination if he or she requests the same in writing.
(Ord. 16-95. Passed 6-20-95; Ord. 7-01. Passed 6-19-01.)
850.08 DRIVERS' PERMITS; PHOTOGRAPHS, FEE AND DISPLAY.
   Each applicant for a driver's permit shall file with the City Clerk two
recent photographs of himself of a size that will permit its attachment to the
permit as provided in this chapter. After approval of the application and
payment of the fee set forth in the schedule provided for in Section
802.24, the City Clerk shall issue the permit in the form of an identification
card which shall contain a description of the holder, giving his name,
residence, height, age, weight, color of hair, color of eyes and race. No
person shall drive a taxicab unless his permit with his photograph attached is
conspicuously displayed in the passenger compartment of his taxicab in a manner
clearly visible to the occupants thereof.
850.09 AGE OF DRIVERS.
   No permit to drive or operate any taxicab shall be granted to any person
under the age of eighteen years. The City Clerk may require a birth certificate
as proof of the age of the applicant.
850.10 TRANSFER OF DRIVERS' PERMITS.
   No person having registered and procured a driver's permit under this
chapter shall voluntarily allow any other person to use such permit, nor shall
any person, while operating or in charge of any taxicab used in transporting
any passenger for hire, use the permit of another person so registered.
(1975 Code Sec. 7.165)
850.11 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (a)   No person shall:
      (1)   Operate any taxicab while under the influence of alcoholic liquor
or controlled substance;
      (2)   Procure or transport or aid or abet in the procuring or
transporting of any intoxicating liquor, unless the intoxicating liquor is the
property of and in the custody of a passenger;
      (3)   Allow any taxicab to be used for immoral purposes or procure or aid
in procuring any woman for immoral purposes;
      (4)   Charge other than in accordance with the rates herein fixed;
      (5)   Fail, neglect or refuse to turn in to the Police Department of the
City, within twenty-four hours, all lost articles found in the taxicab;
(1975 Code Sec. 7.158) (Ord. 02-04. Passed 1-20-04.)
      (6)   Drive or operate any taxicab upon any street unless the owner files
with the City Clerk an insurance policy issued by an insurance company licensed
to do business in the State and approved by the City Commission, providing
insurance coverage for each and every taxicab owned, operated or leased by the
applicant with a maximum liability as set forth in the schedule provided for in
Section
802.24;
(Adopting Ordinance)
      (7)   Use any portion of the public streets or alleys as a taxicab stand
or permit a taxicab in his or her charge to stand upon any portion of the
public streets or alleys, except for such time as is necessary to load or
unload passengers, except in such portions of the public streets or alleys as
have been set apart as taxicab stands. However, all licensed taxicab operators
shall have a right to stand cars in such portions of the public streets or
alleys as have been set apart as taxicab stands, except in such taxicab stands
as may be in front of the headquarters of another company or person operating
the taxicabs, in which only taxicab operators using the premises adjacent to
the stand in question as their headquarters may park. Also, no person shall
have more than one taxicab owned, operated and/or leased by him at any one time
in any taxicab stand, unless such taxicab stand is in front of such person's
headquarters. The Chief of Police may, by regulation, modify this paragraph and
assign one or more spaces or stands to various companies as the facilities and
volume of business of such companies may require.
      (8)   Fail to notify the Police Department of the City within fifteen
hours after any accident, giving the time and the location of the accident, the
name of the person injured, the character of injuries, so far as is known, and,
in case of property damage, the estimated amount of such damage; or
      (9)   If he or she is a taxicab driver on duty, solicit passengers for
his or her taxicab except while remaining within his or her taxicab.
   (b)   The operator and owner of every taxicab licensed pursuant to this
chapter shall be responsible for maintaining such taxicab at all times in a
neat, clean and presentable condition, both inside and outside, and all
taxicabs shall at all times be maintained in a safe and proper operating
condition. No taxicab shall be operated that is in need of repairs, is
unsightly or is in a dilapidated condition. This chapter shall be enforced by
the Police Department and the Department is hereby authorized to inspect all
taxicabs from time to time, at reasonable times and places. The Department
shall notify in writing the owner of any taxicab that fails to comply with any
provision of this chapter of the specific reasons why such taxicab fails to
comply. Failure of the owner or operator to rectify the condition of such
vehicle within five days from the date of such notice and continuance of the
use of such vehicle for taxicab purposes are hereby deemed to be a violation of
this chapter. If the Department determines that the condition of a taxicab is
an immediate threat to the health, safety and welfare of patrons, the public or
other vehicles on the streets by reason of disrepair and that such taxicab is
in an unsafe operating condition, the Department may order the owner and
operator of such taxicab to cease forthwith the use of such taxicab until its
condition is in conformity with this chapter. Failure of the owner and operator
to comply with such order is hereby determined to be a violation of this
chapter. Persistent and habitual violation of the provisions of this chapter
shall be grounds for revocation of the taxicab license with respect to such
vehicle as well as grounds for revocation of the operator's permit for
operating a taxicab in the City.
(1975 Code Sec. 7.158)
   (c)   Whoever violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of a misdemeanor and
shall be subject to the penalty provided in Section
202.99.
(Ord. 16-95. Passed 6-20-95.)
850.12 SEATING REQUIREMENTS.
   No driver shall permit any person to sit in a taxicab who is not a passenger
for hire or an official or employee of a person holding a license under which
the taxicab is operated. A person may be carried in the front seat of a taxicab
if such person is a passenger for hire.
(Ord. 8-84. Passed 3-13-84.)
850.13 REVOCATION OF LICENSES AND PERMITS.
   (a)   A violation of any provision of this chapter or of the Traffic Code or
of the statutes of the State shall be sufficient grounds for the revocation of
any license or permit issued under this chapter and shall be considered
sufficient grounds for the refusal to grant a license or permit in the first
instance.
(1975 Code Sec. 7.160)
   (b)   Any permit or license issued under this chapter may be revoked or
suspended by the Chief of Police for a definite period for misrepresentation of
any material fact in the application for permit or license or for failure to
neglect to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter.
   (c)   In addition to the basis for revocation and/or suspension in
subsections (a) and (b) above, the City Commission may revoke a permit or
license for cause in accordance with Section
802.17.
   (d)   Any person whose permit or license is denied, revoked or suspended
shall be entitled to a hearing in accordance with Section

   All taxicabs shall have affixed thereto a taximeter which shall conform to
and comply with the specifications, tolerances and regulations of the Police
Department, as determined by tests conducted by such Department. Errors in such
taximeter shall not exceed plus or minus five percent to be considered
acceptable. No person shall operate or permit the operation of any taxicab
unless the meter has been inspected, tested and approved by the Police
Department as conforming to the provisions of this chapter and unless the seal
affixed by the Department is not broken. Taximeters shall be examined and
tested at least once every six months by the Department and the Department
shall keep a record of all such inspections, approvals and disapprovals. When a
passenger is being transported, the flag shall be in such a position and the
meter so set that it records mileage only, except when a taxicab is stopped and
waiting.
   Every taximeter shall be so affixed to the vehicle that the amount of fare
determined by such meter shall be plainly visible to the passenger thereof.
After sundown, the meters shall be illuminated by a suitable light.
850.15 CONVEYING PASSENGERS.
   A taxicab operator not already engaged shall not refuse or neglect to convey
any person applying for service to any place within the City. The person first
applying for service shall have the immediate and exclusive use of such taxicab
to his destination, unless the passenger is requested and consents to the
carrying of additional passengers. A passenger shall be driven by the most
direct and safe route to his or her destination. This section shall not be
construed to require any taxicab driver to take as a passenger any person under
the influence of liquor or narcotic drugs, or justify his assenting to the
carrying of liquor in violation of any law or ordinance, or to the use of his
taxicab for immoral or illegal purposes or contrary to any provision of this
chapter.
850.16 FARES.
   Owners or drivers of taxicabs licensed under this chapter shall transport
passengers with or without baggage from any point within or outside the limits
of the City to any other point within or outside the limits of the City and

on the inside of such taxicab pursuant to this chapter. No person owning,
operating or controlling any motor vehicle permitted to be used as a taxicab
within the City shall operate, hire or let such vehicle without first filing a
schedule of rates and fees for transportation and other services offered with
the City Clerk. Such rates and fees to be charged shall be filed with the City
Clerk semi-annually, by December 31st and June 30th of each year, which shall
be the rates for each subsequent six month period. The established rates of
fare shall be applicable so long as the trip either originates or terminates in
the City.

(1975 Code Sec. 7.169)
850.19 PRORATING OF LICENSE FEES.

for the balance of the license year. A fractional part of a month shall be

   At least every six months, the Chief of Police shall cause an inspection to

882.01 TAXATION EXEMPTION OF CERTAIN HOUSING PROJECTS.
   (a)   Exemptions of Housing Projects from Taxation. In accordance with the
authority vested in the City Commission pursuant to subparagraph 7 of Section
15a of Public Act 346 of 1966, as amended, the tax exemption established in
subsection (1) of Section 15a of such Act 346 shall not apply to any housing
projects within the City limits which might otherwise be entitled to tax
exemption by virtue of such Section 15a(1) of such Act. However, this chapter
shall not apply to housing projects designed for and used specifically and
exclusively by low income individuals, or families and elderly persons as
defined by such Act 346, which projects are financed by a mortgage loan from
the Michigan State Housing Development Authority and funded pursuant to Section
236 of the National Housing Act or which are funded by a Federally insured
mortgage by the Federal Housing Administration pursuant to Section 8 of the
National Housing Act. No exemption, however, shall be effective with respect to
any such project under Section 15a(1)(a) until the amount of the service charge
or other sum to be paid in lieu of taxes for such project has been established
by ordinance duly adopted by the City Commission.
   (b)   Workforce Housing PILOT.
      (1)   Title. This Ordinance shall be known and cited as the “The City of
Battle Creek Workforce Housing PILOT Ordinance.”
      (2)   Preamble. It is a proper public purpose for the City of Battle
Creek to encourage the development or rehabilitation of workforce housing for
persons and families whose household income is not greater than 120% of area
median income by exempting such housing from all ad valorem property taxes
imposed by any taxing jurisdiction and providing for payment of an annual
service charge for public services in lieu of all such taxes. A PILOT, or
service charge payment in lieu of taxes, is an effective means of incentivizing
the construction of workforce housing. A stable and predictable service charge
paid in lieu of all ad valorem property taxes for a fixed period is essential
to the determination of the economic feasibility of workforce housing projects
developed or rehabilitated in reliance on such tax exemption. The City of
Battle Creek is authorized by subdivision (3)(b) of section 15a of Public Act
346 of 1966, as amended, MCL 125.1415a, and specifically under this ordinance,
to establish, or change by any amount it chooses, the service charge to be paid
in lieu of all ad valorem taxes in accordance with section 15a with respect to
new or rehabilitated workforce housing, but not an amount that exceeds the
taxes that would be paid but for this authorization or the other limitations
imposed by that section. Because workforce housing for individuals and families
whose household income is not greater than 120% of area median income is a
public necessity, and because the City will be benefited and improved by such
housing, encouraging the same through an ad valorem property tax exemption is a
valid public purpose.
      (3)   Definitions.
         A.   “Additional Amount” means an amount equal to the difference
between the following:
            1.   the millage rate levied for operating purposes by the County

            2.   The amount of the annual service charge paid in lieu of ad
valorem property taxes by the housing project under subsection (4)C. hereof
that is distributed to the County pursuant to MCL 125.1415a(5).
         B.   “Annual Shelter Rent” means the total collections during an
agreed annual period from or paid on behalf of the occupants of a housing
project representing rent or occupancy charges, exclusive of charges for gas,
electricity, heat, or other utilities furnished to the occupants and paid for
by the housing project.
         C.   “Sponsor” means any person or entity applying for a workforce
housing exemption under this Ordinance, and includes any person or entity who
subsequently owns the housing project.
         D.   “Authority” means the Michigan State Housing Development

and the City running with the land that restricts the use of the housing
project to workforce housing, as defined in this Ordinance, for a period not to
exceed 15 years, or such greater or lesser period of time as may be authorized
by state law and as may be required by the PILOT Resolution.
         F.   “County” means the County of Calhoun.

the City Commission that approves a housing project for exemption under this
Ordinance.

         A.   The class of housing projects to which the tax exemption shall
apply and for which a service charge may be paid in lieu of all ad valorem
property taxes are housing projects being developed or rehabilitated for
workforce housing.
         B.   Subject to the recording of a Restrictive Covenant, workforce
housing and the property on which such housing is or will be located shall be
exempt from all ad valorem property taxes as of December 31 of the year in
which construction or rehabilitation commences. Construction must start within
one year of the date of the Authority’s notification of exemption or such
longer period of time as may be provided by the PILOT Resolution.
         C.   The City of Battle Creek will accept payment of an annual service
charge in lieu of all ad valorem property taxes for public services from the
owner of a housing project for which the City has received a certified
notification of exemption from the Authority in accordance with the following:
            1.   Subject to subsections (b)(4)D., E. and F. hereof, for a new
construction project, an amount that is the greater of the tax on the property
on which the project is located for the tax year proceeding the date on which
the construction is commenced or 10% of the Annual Shelter Rent obtained from
the project.
            2.   Subject to subsections (b)(4)D., E. and F. hereof, for a
rehabilitation project, an amount that is the lesser of the tax on the property
on which the project is located for the tax year proceeding the date on which
rehabilitation is commenced or 10% of the Annual Shelter Rent obtained from the
project.
            3.   The service charge paid in lieu of taxes shall not exceed the
amount in ad valorem taxes that the Sponsor would have otherwise paid if the
workforce housing project were not tax exempt.
         D.   Notwithstanding the provisions of MCL 125.1415a(3)(b) and
125.1415a(7) to the contrary, upon the adoption of a PILOT Resolution and
receipt of a certified notification of exemption from the Authority, a contract
shall be deemed effected between the City of Battle Creek and the Sponsor, to
provide a tax exemption and accept service charge payments in lieu of taxes as
previously described by this section.
         E.   Notwithstanding subsection (b)(4)C. hereof, the service charge
paid each year in lieu of taxes for that part of a workforce housing project
that is tax exempt under this Ordinance but not used for workforce housing must
be equal to the full amount of the taxes that would be paid on that portion of
the project as if the project were not tax exempt. The owner of the project
shall allocate the benefits of any tax exemption granted pursuant to this
Ordinance exclusively to workforce housing or to the maintenance and
preservation of the housing project as a safe, decent, and sanitary workforce
housing.
         F.   The annual service charge under subsection (b)(4)C. hereof for a
workforce housing project for which a PILOT Resolution has been adopted must be
increased by the Additional Amount if both of the following requirements are
met:
            1.   Not later than 45 days after the county treasurer’s receipt of
the certified notification of exemption, the County Board of Commissioners
passes a resolution, by majority vote, that provides that the Additional Amount
must be paid.
            2.   The approval of the resolution described in subparagraph (b)
(4)F.1. hereof is in accordance with an ordinance or resolution adopted by the
County Board of Commissioners establishing the factors to be considered when
assessing whether the Additional Amount must be paid.
      (5)   Workforce Housing Exemption Application, Review and Approval
Process.
         A.   The Sponsor of a workforce housing project must own the property
that is the subject of the application or must be the purchaser under a
purchase or option agreement or otherwise demonstrate to the City
administration’s satisfaction that is has control over the property. The
property that is the subject of the application must be zoned for the intended
use at the time of application.
         B.   Prior to applying for a workforce housing exemption, the Sponsor
is encouraged to meet with the Assistant City Manager or their designee, the
Treasurer, the Assessor and any other person as may be designated by the
Assistant City Manager and present the proposed workforce housing project,
including all information requested on the form provided by the City, including
but not limited to a description of the Sponsor’s organizational structure, a
narrative describing the scope of the workforce housing project, including
location, number and type of units, typical floor plans and exterior
elevations, the targeted median income and proposed rent limits, a schedule
with projected milestones, a development income and expense pro forma
(including the estimated Annual Shelter Rents), and a ten-year cash flow
projection.
         C.   When reviewing an application for a workforce housing exemption,
the decision to approve or deny the request shall be guided by the City
Commission’s consideration of the following factors:
            1.   Whether the workforce housing project will increase the number
of available workforce housing units in the City.
            2.   Whether the workforce housing project will reduce the
functional obsolescence of an existing building or housing unit(s).
            3.   Whether the workforce housing project is likely to encourage
expansion of the City’s population.
            4.   Whether the location of the workforce housing project is
consistent with the goals and objectives of the City’s Master Plan.
            5.   Whether the development or rehabilitation of the workforce
housing project requires zoning variances or results in the continuation of a
nonconforming use.
            6.   Whether the workforce housing project will include a level of
amenities desired by or appropriate for the community.
            7.   Whether the workforce housing project incorporates green
technologies or energy-efficient components.
         D.   Approval of an exemption for a workforce housing project requires
passage of a PILOT Resolution by a majority vote of the City Commission that
includes the findings with respect to the standards of subsection (b)(5)C.
above.
         E.   If the workforce housing exemption application is approved, the
city clerk will deliver to the Sponsor a certified copy of the resolution
approving the application.
         F.   To defray the administrative cost of processing an application
for a workforce housing exemption, the City Commission shall include a
workforce housing application fee in its Fee, Bond, and Insurance Schedule, as
set out in Ordinance 802.24.
      (6)   Authority Affidavit and Assessor Notification.
         A.   Following adoption of the PILOT Resolution, the Sponsor must
submit an affidavit to the Authority in the form required by the Authority for
certification by the Authority that the project is eligible for the workforce
housing exemption.
         B.   Upon receipt of notification from the Authority that the project
is eligible for a workforce housing exemption, the Sponsor or the Authority
must file the certified notification of exemption with the city assessor before
November 1 of the year preceding the tax year in which the exemption is to

         C.   Not later than 5 business days after receipt of the certified
notification of exemption, the assessor shall provide a copy of the certified
notification of exemption to the County treasurer.
      (7)   Payment of PILOT.
         A.   No later than June 1, or such other date provided for in the
PILOT Resolution, Sponsor shall submit to the city treasurer, Sponsor’s budget
for Annual Shelter Rent for the current calendar year and a copy of Sponsor’s
audited financial statements for the preceding calendar year, prepared in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards or, if Sponsor is not
subject to an audit requirement, Sponsor’s compiled financial statements for
the preceding calendar year prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and certified by Sponsor. Within 30 days of receipt of
the foregoing documents, the treasurer shall issue an invoice showing the PILOT
payment due for the current year, which payment shall be due no later than
September 14.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in this section and section 4, any
payments for public services under this Ordinance shall be distributed to the
governmental units levying the general property tax in the same proportion as
prevailed with the general property tax in the previous calendar year. The
distribution to those governmental units shall be made as if the number of
mills levied for local school district operating purposes were equal to the
number of mills levied for the purposes in 1993 minus the number of mills
levied under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906,
for the year for which the distribution is calculated. The amount of payments
in lieu of taxes to be distributed to a local school district for operating
purposes under this subsection must not be distributed to the local school
district but instead must be paid to the state treasury and credited to the
state school aid fund established by section 11 of article IX of the state
constitution of 1963.
         C.   Any PILOT payment or portion of PILOT payment remaining unpaid as
of the due date shall bear interest at 1% per month, in addition to a required
payment of a 3% penalty fee. The collection of past due PILOT payments shall
otherwise be in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 211 of the General
Property Tax Act, Act 206 of 1893, as amended; MCL 211.44 et seq.
      (8)   Duration and Recorded Restrictive Covenant.
         A.   A workforce housing project approved for an exemption by a PILOT
Resolution shall be encumbered by a Restrictive Covenant recorded in the office
of the register of deeds for the County.
         B.   The Restrictive Covenant shall acknowledge (i) that the economic
feasibility of the workforce housing project depends on the approval and
continuing effect of the payment in lieu of all ad valorem taxes as approved by
the PILOT resolution; (ii) the City agreement to accept payment of an annual
service charge in lieu of all ad valorem taxes in consideration of the
Sponsor’s offer to construct or rehabilitate workforce housing; and (iii) the
amount of the annual service charge to be paid for each operating year.
         C.   The Restrictive Covenant shall provide (a) for the reporting and
monitoring of the Sponsor's compliance with the Restrictive Covenant, this
Ordinance and the PILOT Resolution; (b) that the Restrictive Covenant is
enforceable by City of Battle Creek and any Tenants to be benefitted at law or
in equity; (c) shall provide other remedies available to the City of Battle
Creek for non-compliance, including termination of the exemption and repayment
of all prior years’ tax savings under the workforce housing exemption after
notice and hearing; and (d) that the Restrictive Covenant cannot be modified or
terminated except in a written instrument executed by the Sponsor or then
current owner and the City.
      (9)   Severability. The provisions of this Ordinance shall be deemed to
be severable, and should any provision be declared by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid, the same shall not affect the
validity of this Ordinance as a whole or provision of this Ordinance, other
than the provision so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
      (10)   Inconsistent Ordinances. All ordinances or parts of ordinances
inconsistent or in conflict with the provisions of this Ordinance are repealed
to the extent necessary to give this ordinance full force and effect.

valorem property taxes as provided in below subsection (d)(2) from and after
tax year 2024 until this section terminates pursuant to its terms. The City
acknowledges that the Sponsor and the Authority have established the economic

Sponsor with the Authority as third party beneficiary under the contract, to

However, nothing contained in this section shall constitute a waiver of any
rights the City may possess or exercise under the provisions of Section 15(a)
(2) of the Act, provided the exercise of such rights does not, in the opinion
of the Authority, impair the economic feasibility of the Housing Development or
the Mortgage Loan. Notwithstanding the contractual effect of this section, the
service charge to be paid each year in lieu of taxes for the part of the
Housing Development that is tax exempt, but which is occupied by other than Low
Income Persons or Families shall be equal to the full amount of the taxes which
would be paid on that portion of the Housing Development if the Housing
Development were not tax exempt; and
   (f)   Payment of Service Charge. The annual service charge in lieu of ad
valorem property taxes as determined under subsection (d)(2) is payable to the
City on or before February 14 of the year following the year for which payment
is due. Failure to pay the service charge on or before February 14 of each year

per month until paid. If any amount of the annual service charge or accrued
interest shall remain unpaid as of December 31 of each year, then the amount
unpaid shall be a lien upon the real property constituting Westbrook Place
Housing Development upon the City Treasurer filing a certificate of non-payment
of the service charge, together with an affidavit of proof of service of the

with the tax year which is forty-five (45) years later, this section shall

the following requirements are in existence and continue to be met:

      In addition to the foregoing, the Sponsor shall make all annual reports

preceding annual period by February 14 of each year, and failure to do so shall
result in a late fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) per month, which amount shall
accrue one percent (1%) interest per month until paid.
   (h)   Benefits. The Sponsor shall allocate the benefits of the tax exemption
granted pursuant to this section exclusively to the Low-Income Persons and
Families of the Housing Development in the form of reduced rent. Such benefits
shall not be allocated to market rate persons or families. The Sponsor shall
submit to the City its annual report documentation to verify Sponsor's
compliance with this requirement.
   (i)   Audit and Inspection of Records. Subject to any limitations imposed by

charges received and the occupancy of units in the Housing Development as will

acknowledges that the sponsor and the authority have established the economic
feasibility of the housing development in reliance upon the enactment and
continuing effect of this section and the qualification of the housing
development for exemption from all ad valorem property taxes and a payment in

sponsor with the authority as third party beneficiary under the contract, to
provide tax exemption, accept payment in lieu of taxes, as previously
described, is effectuated by the enactment of this section. However, nothing
contained in this section shall constitute a waiver of any rights the City of
Battle Creek may possess or exercise under the provisions of Section 15(a)(2)
of the Act, provided the exercise of such rights does not, in the opinion of
the authority, impair the economic feasibility of the housing development or
the mortgage loan. Notwithstanding the contractual effect of this section, this
section:
      (1)   Shall be null and void if transfer of ownership and refinance of
the mortgage as set out in above subsection (d)(1) of the housing development
has not been completed by June 30, 2021;
      (2)   The service charge to be paid each year in lieu of taxes for the
part of the housing development that is tax exempt but which is occupied by
other than low income persons or families shall be equal to the full amount of
the taxes which would be paid on that portion of the housing development if the
housing development were not tax exempt; and
   (f)   Payment of Service Charge. The annual service charge in lieu of taxes
as determined under subsection (d)(2) is payable to the City on or before
February 14th of the year following the year for which payment is due. Failure
to pay the service charge on or before February 14th of each year shall result
in the service charge being subject to 1% interest per month until paid. If any
amount of the annual service charge or accrued interest shall remain unpaid as
of December 31 of each year, the amount unpaid shall be a lien upon the real
property constituting Bedford Manor Housing Development upon the City Treasurer
filing a certificate of non-payment of the service charge, together with an
affidavit of proof of service of the certificate of non-payment upon the
sponsor with the Calhoun County Register of Deeds, and proceedings may then be

upon real property.
   (g)   Duration and Conditions. Commencing in the tax year in which the
transfer of ownership and mortgage refinance of the housing development has
been completed as described in above subsection (d)(1), and ending with the tax
year 2041 this section shall remain in effect and shall not terminate from the
effective date hereof, provided that all of the following requirements are in
existence and continue to be met:
      (1)   The development remains subject to income and rent restrictions
pursuant to Section 42, the Act or by the authority in its rules; and
      (2)   That the transfer of ownership and mortgage refinance of the
development as described in above subsection (d)(1) has concluded by June 30,
2021; and
      (3)   The mortgage loan or grant from the authority is outstanding.
   In addition to the foregoing, the sponsor shall make all annual reports
supporting its claimed annual shelter rent and reduced rent allocation for the
preceding annual period by February 14 of each year, and failure to do so shall
result in a late fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) per month, which amount shall
accrue one (1 %) percent interest per month until paid.
   (h)   Benefits. The sponsor shall allocate the benefits of the tax exemption
granted pursuant to this section exclusively to the low-income persons and
families of the housing development in the form of reduced rent. Such benefits
shall not be allocated to market rate persons or families. The sponsor shall
submit to the City, in its annual report documentation to verify sponsor's
compliance with this requirement.

law, the sponsor shall provide to the City annually, with its payment in lieu
of taxes, such accounting records, audits and financial reports as will allow
the City to verify the computation of the annual service charge as provided by
this section. The sponsor shall maintain such records of rent or occupancy
charges received and the occupancy of units in the housing development as will
permit the City to verify which of the units in the housing development have

imposed by law, the books and records of the sponsor pertaining to the Housing
Development shall be available for review and audit by the City at all times.
   (j)   Lien. Annual service charges as well as any late fees payable pursuant
to this section shall be a lien on the housing development, and, if delinquent,

representations and warranties of the Sponsor, it is determined that the
Housing Development subject to this section is a housing development eligible
for tax exemption provided by Section 15a of the Act.
   (d)   Establishment of Annual Service Charges.
      (1)   The housing development to be known as the Bennett Crossing Project
and the property on which it will be located and constructed shall be exempt
from all ad valorem property taxes as provided in below subsection (d)(2) from
and after the substantial completion of construction or rehabilitation until
this section terminates pursuant to its terms. The City acknowledges that the
Sponsor and the Authority have established the economic feasibility of the
Housing Development in reliance upon the enactment and continuing effect of
this section and the qualification of the Housing Development for exemption
from all ad valorem property taxes and a payment in lieu of taxes as
established by this section. Therefore, in consideration of the Sponsor's
offer, subject to the receipt of an LIHTC Program allocation from the Authority
to assist the Sponsor to purchase, construct, own, and operate the Housing
Development, the City agrees to accept payment of an annual service charge for
public services in lieu of all ad valorem property taxes.
      (2)   Subject to receipt of a Mortgage Loan, the annual service charge to
be paid in lieu of taxes shall be equal to four percent (4.00%) of the Annual
Shelter Rents actually collected by the Housing Development during each
operating year pursuant to the terms set out in below subsection (g).
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt the Housing
Development and property on which it is constructed from any special assessment
for street or other public improvements or as a result of its location within a
business improvement district authorized by 1999 Public Act 49, as amended.
   (e)   Contractual Effect of Ordinance. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 15a(5) of the Act to the contrary, a contract between the City and
Sponsor with the Authority as third party beneficiary under the contract, to
provide tax exemption, accept payment in lieu of taxes, as previously
described, is effectuated by the enactment of this section. However, nothing
contained in this section shall constitute a waiver of any rights the City of
Battle Creek may possess or exercise under the provisions of Section 15(a)(2)
of the Act, provided the exercise of such rights does not, in the opinion of
the Authority, impair the economic feasibility of the Housing Development or
the Mortgage Loan. Notwithstanding the contractual effect of this section, this
section:
      (1)   Shall be null and void if construction of the Housing Development
has not commenced within eighteen (18) months of the date of receiving a tax
credit award from MSHDA or the Housing Development has not been issued
certificates of occupancy, whether temporary, partial, or final, for all or any
portion of the Housing Development, within twenty-four (24) months following
the commencement of construction;
      (2)   The service charge to be paid each year in lieu of taxes for the
part of the Housing Development that is tax exempt but which is occupied by
other than Low Income Persons or Families shall be equal to the full amount of
the taxes which would be paid on that portion of the Housing Development if the
Housing Development were not tax exempt; and
   (f)   Payment of Service Charge. The annual service charge in lieu of taxes
as determined under subsection (d)(2) is payable to the City on or before March
1st of the year following the year for which payment is due. Failure to pay the
service charge on or before March 1st of each year shall result in the service
charge being subject to one percent (1%) interest per month until paid. If any
amount of the annual service charge or accrued interest shall remain unpaid as
of December 31 of each year, the amount unpaid shall be a lien upon the real
property constituting Bennett Crossing Project upon the City Treasurer filing a
certificate of non-payment of the service charge, together with an affidavit of
proof of service of the certificate of non-payment upon the Sponsor with the
Calhoun County Register of Deeds, and proceedings may then be had to enforce
the lien as provided by law for the foreclosure of tax liens upon real
property.
   (g)   Duration and Conditions. Commencing in the tax year in which
construction of the Housing Development is substantially completed, and ending
with the tax year falling forty-five (45) years after substantial completion of
the Housing Development this section shall remain in effect and shall not
terminate from the effective date hereof, provided that all of the following
requirements are in existence and continue to be met:
      (1)   All residential units of the Housing Development remain subject to
income and rent restrictions pursuant to the LIHTC Program; and
      (2)   That the construction of the development has commenced within
eighteen (18) months of the date of receiving a tax credit award from MSHDA and
has been issued certificates of occupancy, whether temporary, partial, or
final, for all or any portion of the Housing Development, within twenty-four
(24) months following the commencement of construction.
      In addition to the foregoing, the Sponsor shall make all annual reports
supporting its claimed annual shelter rent and reduced rent allocation for the
preceding annual period by March 1 of each year, and failure to do so shall
result in a late fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) per month, which amount shall
accrue one percent (1%) interest per month until paid.
   (h)   Audit and Inspection of Records. Subject to any limitations imposed by
law, the Sponsor shall provide to the City annually, with its payment in lieu
of taxes, such accounting records, audits and financial reports as will allow
the City to verify the computation of the annual service charge as provided by
this section. The Sponsor shall maintain such records of rent or occupancy
charges received and the occupancy of units in the Housing Development as will
permit the City to verify which of the units in the Housing Development have
been occupied by Persons and Families. Subject to any limitations imposed by
law, the books and records of the Sponsor pertaining to the Housing Development
shall be available for review and audit by the City at all times.
   (i)   Lien. Annual service charges as well as any late fees payable pursuant
to this section shall be a lien on the Housing Development, and, if delinquent,
shall be collected and enforced in the same manner as general property taxes.

persons and families is a public necessity and that the City will be benefited
and improved by such housing, and that the encouragement of the same by
providing a certain real estate tax exemption for such housing is a valid
public purpose. It is further found that the continuance of the provisions of
this section for tax exemption and the service charge in lieu of all ad valorem

determination of economic feasibility of the housing development that is
constructed with financing extended in reliance on such tax exemption.

shall be exempt from all ad valorem property taxes as provided in below
subsection (d)(2) from and after the substantial completion of construction or

feasibility of the Housing Development in reliance upon the enactment and
continuing effect of this section and the qualification of the Housing
Development for exemption from all ad valorem property taxes and a payment in

the Sponsor's offer, subject to the receipt of an LIHTC Program allocation from

charge for public services in lieu of all ad valorem property taxes.

Section 15a(5) of the Act to the contrary, a contract between the City and
Sponsor with the Authority as third party beneficiary under the contract, to
provide tax exemption, accept payment in lieu of taxes, as previously
described, is effectuated by the enactment of this section. However, nothing
contained in this section shall constitute a waiver of any rights the City of
Battle Creek may possess or exercise under the provisions of Section 15(a)(2)

the Authority, impair the economic feasibility of the Housing Development or
the Mortgage Loan. Notwithstanding the contractual effect of this section, this

Housing Development were not tax exempt; and
   (f)   Payment of Service Charge. The annual service charge in lieu of taxes
as determined under subsection (d)(2) is payable to the City on or before
February 14th of the year following the year for which payment is due. Failure

ending with the tax year falling forty (40) years after substantial completion
of the Housing Development this section shall remain in effect and shall not

      In addition to the foregoing, the Sponsor shall make all annual reports

result in a late fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) per month, which amount shall
accrue one percent (1%) interest per month until paid.
   (h)   Audit and Inspection of Records. Subject to any limitations imposed by
law, the Sponsor shall provide to the City annually, with its payment in lieu

charges received and the occupancy of units in the Housing Development as will

been occupied by Low-Income Persons and Families. Subject to any limitations
imposed by law, the books and records of the Sponsor pertaining to the Housing
Development shall be available for review and audit by the City at all times.

1040.01 FINDINGS AND PUBLIC PURPOSES.
   (a)   Necessity for Potable Water. The City Commission has previously found,
and currently reaffirms that the businesses, industries, governmental and
charitable agencies and residents located in the City need to have potable and
otherwise usable water.
   (b)   Availability of Potable Water. The City Commission further has
previously found, and currently reaffirms, that the supply of potable water
available from private wells within the City is insufficient to assure that all
businesses, industries, governmental and charitable agencies, and residents
will have sufficient potable water available for their use and other water
necessary for industrial and fire prevention and control unless the City offers
water to all properties located within the City.
   (c)   Necessity for Sewage Disposal. The City Commission further has
previously found, and currently reaffirms that the use of septic tanks,
privies, privy vaults, cesspools, or similar private sewage disposal
facilities, is deleterious to the health safety and welfare of the businesses,
industries, governmental and charitable agencies, and residents of the City and
that the health, safety and welfare of the businesses, industries, governmental
and charitable agencies and residents is enhanced by the creation of a public
sewer system and wastewater treatment plant, with regulation by the City of
pollutants and other harmful materials according to State and Federal standards
and to provide for the equitable recovery of the cost of wastewater treatment.
   (d)   Method for Measuring Use - Water Supply System. Based on advice of its
engineers, the City Commission has previously found, and currently reaffirms,
that the most precise method, given available technology, of measuring the use
of the water supply from the System by any user is by a meter or meters
installed and controlled by the City.
   (e)   Method for Measuring Use - Sewage Disposal System. Based on advice of
its engineers, the City Commission has previously found, and currently
reaffirms, that the most practical, cost effective and accurate method, given
available technology, of measuring the use of the System's sewers by any user
is by the meter or meters used to measure water usage. The City Commission has
previously found, and currently reaffirms, that for unmetered premises, the
fixed commodity charge set forth herein reflects a reasonable estimate of the
cost of the sewage disposal and treatment services provided to average
residential users.
   (f)   Continuation of Service. The City Commission has previously found, and
further currently reaffirms that, in order to provide and continue to provide
clean potable and other usable water to all customers of the System, in
quantities necessary for all varieties of use, it is necessary from time to
time to install improvements, enlargements, extensions and repairs to the water
system. The City Commission has previously found and further currently
reaffirms that, in order to provide and continue to provide for the safe and
uninterrupted removal and treatment of sewage, pollutants and other harmful
materials, it is necessary from time to time to install improvements,
enlargements, extensions and repairs to the System.
   (g)   Purpose of Charges. The charges and fees for the use of and connection
to the System are hereby established for the purpose of recovering the cost of
construction, reconstruction, maintenance, repair, administration and operation
of the System and to comply with Federal and State legislation and related
regulations, to provide for the payment principal of and interest on any bonds
authorized to be issued as and when the same become due and payable, to create
a bond and interest redemption fund therefor, to provide a fund for reasonable
and necessary improvements to the System and to provide for such other funds as
are necessary to meet contractual obligations of the City. Such charges and
fees shall be made in accordance with the provisions hereinafter set forth and
shall be made against all users of the System.
      (1)   All premises connected directly or indirectly to the System, except
as hereinafter provided, shall be charged and shall make payments to the City
in amounts computed on the basis of this chapter.
      (2)   The charges, rates and fees for water and sewer service by the
System are established herein to adequately provide for bond requirements and
to ensure that the System does not operate at a deficit.
      (3)   The City staff or designated parties shall periodically review the
charges, rates, fees, rules and regulations of the System, which review shall
be completed not less than one time per fiscal year. Results of the review
shall be reported to the City Commission with recommendations for any
adjustments.
      (4)   The charges, rates and fees shall be set so as to recover costs
from users in reasonable proportion to the cost of serving those users.
   (h)   Proportionality, Fairness, and Benefits of Charges, Rates and Fees.
The City Commission has previously found and further currently reaffirms that
the fairest and most reasonable method of providing for the operation,
maintenance, repair, replacement and improvement of the System is to charge
each user, based in all cases on amount of use, for the costs of: (i) retiring
debt secured by the net revenues of the System issued to pay for improvements
and replacements to the System; (ii) ongoing repair, replacement and
improvement and budgeted as part of the annual costs of the System; and (iii)
operation, administration and maintenance costs of the System.
   (i)   Service Charges. The City has investigated several methods of
apportioning the costs of the water and sewer service provided by the System.
Based on its investigation and on the advice of its engineers, the City
Commission has previously found, and currently reaffirms, that to ensure the
stability and viability of the System for the benefit of its users, the fairest
and most accurate way to apportion the costs of operation, maintenance,
replacement and improvement of the System is to charge each user: (i) a
Connection Fee for water and sewer service when such user's property is first
connected to the System;
   (ii)    a monthly service charge for water and sewer service (which varies
depending on the size of the water meter) which fee reflects each user's
proportionate share of the fixed costs of the System; (iii) a commodity charge
for water usage which is based on the user's actual use of water supplied by
the System; and (iv) a commodity charge for sewage disposal service which is
based on the user's actual use of water supplied by the System. The City
Commission has previously found, and currently reaffirms that the rates and
charges set forth in this chapter accurately apportion the fixed and variable
costs of the System among the users of the System and that Connection Fee, the
monthly service charge and the commodity charges provide actual benefits to
such users in the form of ready access to water supply and sewage disposal
services that would be unavailable if such charges were not charged. The City
Commission has previously found and currently reaffirms that the charges for
water and sewer service to nonresidents represent fair and accurate charges
necessary to make such services available and that such charges are equal to
the actual benefit conferred upon such users.
   (j)   Connection Fees. In addition to the findings set forth above, the City
Commission has previously found and currently reaffirms that the Connection
Fees required prior to connection to the System, reflect the proportional
capital costs of the System, previously paid by the City and the System,
attributable to each new user and that the connection to the System provides
actual benefits to each new user equal to or greater than the amount of such
fees. The connection fee shall also reflect all costs of water and sewer
service installation.

set in a place approved by the Department of Public Works, at the expense of
the user, to measure the water used during construction. Water so used shall be
charged for at the rates set forth in the schedule provided for in Section
1040.20.
   (b)   No person shall willfully or fraudulently prevent a water meter from
duly registering the quantity of water, measured through the meter, or in any

   (c)   In all prosecutions under this section, proof that the defendant,
other than a lessor, had control of or occupied the premises where the offense
was committed, or received the benefit of the water, used or consumed, shall be
prima facie evidence of a violation of this section.
   (d)   A person who violates this section is responsible for a Class F
Municipal civil infraction if the value of the water used or wasted, as a
result of the violation is not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), and
shall be subject to the civil fines provided in Section

(Ord. 14-01. Passed 10-16-01.)
1040.19 SERVICE; LIABILITIES.
   The City shall endeavor to furnish continuous service to users, but does not
guarantee uninterrupted service and shall not be liable for any damage which a
user may sustain by reason of the failure of the service, whether caused by
accident, repair or otherwise, nor shall the City be liable for damages which
the user may sustain by reason of failure of water supply, or for damages to
persons or property arising, occurring or resulting from the supply of water or
from any apparatus or appurtenance in connection therewith.
(Ord. 14-01. Passed 10-16-01.)
1040.20 WATER RATES AND CHARGES; BILLING; TERMINATION OF SERVICE; WATER SUPPLY
SYSTEM REVENUE BONDS.
   (a)   All water service shall be charged for on the basis of water consumed
as determined by the water meter installed in or near the premises of a user
and shall include a readiness to serve charge. No free water service shall be
furnished to any person or premises.
   (b)   Charges for all water service shall be billed by the Finance
Department and collected monthly by the City Treasurer. All water meters shall
be read at least every second month and bills shall be rendered within fourteen
days following the meter readings. All bills shall be payable when rendered and
shall be deemed delinquent if not paid on or before the due date shown on the
bill. A late charge of ten percent of the unpaid bill shall be assessed on all
bills paid more than thirty days after the due date.
   (c)   The Office of the City Manager is hereby authorized to enforce the
payment of charges for water service to any premises by discontinuing the water
service to such premises and an action of assumpsit may be instituted by the
City against the customer. The charges for water service which, under the
provisions of Public Act 94 of 1933, as amended; (“Act 94”) are made a lien on
the premises to which such service is furnished, are hereby recognized to
constitute such lien. The Director of Revenue Services shall, on June 30 and
January 1, certify all unpaid charges for such service furnished to any
premises which, as of these dates, have remained unpaid for a period of six
months, to the City Assessor who shall place the same on a special assessment
roll of the City. Such charges so assessed shall be collected in the same
manner as general City taxes. If the City is properly notified, in accordance
with Act 94, that a tenant is responsible for water service charges, no such
service shall be commenced or continued to such premises until there has been
deposited with the City Treasurer a sum sufficient to cover three times the
average monthly or bimonthly bill for such premises, as estimated by the
Director of Revenue Services. Such deposit shall be prescribed in the schedule
provided for in Section
802.24 . Where the meter service to any premises is turned off to enforce the
payment of water service charges, the water service shall not be reconnected
until all delinquent charges have been paid and a deposit, as in the case of
tenants, is made. In addition, there shall be a water turn-on charge as
prescribed in the schedule provided for in Section
802.24 . In any other case where, at the discretion of the Revenue Services
Director, the collection of charges for water service may be difficult or
uncertain, the Director may require a similar deposit. Such deposits may be
applied against any delinquent water service charges and the application
thereof shall not affect the right of the City to turn off the water service to
any premises for a delinquency thereby satisfied. No such deposit shall bear
interest. Such deposits, or any remaining balance thereof, shall be returned to
the customer making the same when the water service is discontinued or, except
as to tenants as to whom notice of responsibility for such charges has been
filed with the City, when any eight successive monthly or bimonthly bills have
been paid by such customer with no delinquency.
   (d)   Nothing contained in this chapter shall be deemed to alter or repeal
any of the provisions of ordinances providing for the issuance of water supply
system revenue bonds, with respect to the obligations of the City and the
security of the bondholders thereunder. This chapter is intended to conform
with such ordinances and if there is any conflict whereby the security of the
bondholders or the obligations of such bonds are impaired, then, with respect
to such conflict, the provisions of such ordinances shall prevail, so long as
any water bonds issued under such ordinances are outstanding and unredeemed.
   (e)   The rates and charges established by the City for water service shall
be as set forth in a schedule which shall be enacted by the City Commission
from time to time by resolution.

provision of any contract between the City and a contract user, in effect on
the date of the adoption of this chapter, the provisions of such contract shall
prevail.

independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of
remaining portions of this section, it being the intent of the City that this
section shall be fully severable. The City shall promptly notify the Michigan
Department of Environmental Quality upon the occurrence of any event described

   (a)   General prohibitions. A non-domestic user shall not introduce into the
POTW any pollutant or wastewater that causes pass-through or interference. The
City shall investigate incidences of pass-through or interference and take
appropriate enforcement action and inform the responsible non-domestic user of
the impact thereof. The general application of this subsection and the specific
prohibitions at subsection (b) hereof shall apply to each nondomestic user
introducing pollutants into a POTW whether or not the non-domestic user is
subject to any other national, state or local pretreatment standards or
requirements.
   (b)   Specific prohibitions. No person shall discharge or cause to be
discharged into any public sewer, directly or indirectly, sewage containing any
of the following described substances or cause any of the following substances
to be introduced into a POTW:
      (1)   Pollutants that create a fire or explosion hazard in the POTW,
including, but not limited to, waste streams that have a closed-cup flashpoint
of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) using the test methods
specified at 40 CFR Section 261.21.
      (2)   Pollutants that will cause corrosive structural damage to the POTW.
Discharges that have a pH higher than 11 or lower than 6.0 or having any other
corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to the sewerage system
and its structures, equipment and personnel of the POTW shall not be
discharged, including, without limitation, any acid, iron pickling waste or

City’s treatment process and as approved by the Director.
      (3)   Solid or viscous substances in amounts that will cause obstruction
to the flow in the POTW resulting in interference, including any fat, wax,
grease or oil, whether emulsified or not, in excess of 100 milligrams per liter
(mg/1) or any substance that could solidify or become discernibly viscous at
temperatures between 32 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit (or 0 to 60 degrees
Celsius).
      (4)   Any pollutant, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.),
released in a discharge at a flow rate or pollutant concentration that, either
singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with
the POTW.
      (5)   Heat that will inhibit biological activity in the POTW resulting in
interference and, in no case, heat that produces a temperature at the POTW of
more than 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius).
      (6)   Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of
mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass-through.

of any government or public agency having authority to regulate the discharge
into public waters as defined above at Section
1040.02(60);
      (12)   Any radioactive waste, except in compliance with applicable
federal and state regulations, provided that such persons notify the Director
of the discharge, receive written authorization from the Director for the
discharge, and comply with all applicable rules and regulations of all other
regulatory agencies;
      (13)   Any quantity of flow or concentration of a waste component
constituting a slug;
      (14)   Wastewater imparting color that cannot be removed by the treatment
process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning

   (d)   Local limits.
      (1)   The Director is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to 40
CFR 403.5(c).
      (2)   The following local limits are established to protect against pass
through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in
excess of the following as a 24-hour average concentration:
Toxicants mg/l
Toxicants            mg/l
Ammonium Nitrogen    25.0
Arsenic              0.2

      (3)   The Director may develop BMPs by ordinance or in individual
wastewater discharge permits or general permits, to implement local limits and
the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) above.
   (e)   In place of using the domestic-strength concentrations for BOD and TSS
provided in Section 1040.02(45), the Director may allocate, as follows,
specified portions of the available total load to individual users as provided
within individual control permits.
      (1)   The following total loads are available for the following pollutant
parameters:
 
          Maximum Allowable Industrial Load
Parameter (Subtracting Non-Permitted Sources)
          (total avg. lbs./day)
BOD       89,354
TSS       54,687
 
      (2)   The Director may allocate portions of the available total load for
one or more of the parameters listed above to one or more individual users. The
amounts of the load(s) allocated to each user shall be specified in the user’s
permit, along with any conditions as determined necessary by the Director. Any
discharge by a user in excess of the loading allocated to the user in the user
permit shall constitute a violation of the user permit and this chapter.
      (3)   Before allocating any amount of the available total load as
provided by this section, the Director must determine that the proposed
allocation will not cause the average composite loading of all users
discharging to the POTW to exceed the available total loading for any pollutant
as provided by subsection (e)(1); will not interfere with the POTW’s ability to
accept and treat wastewater as required by the City’s NPDES permit and other
applicable laws and regulations; and that the allocation is otherwise
reasonable and appropriate under all of the circumstances.
      (4)   The allocation of a portion of available total load for a pollutant
to an individual user shall not affect the applicability of surcharges to the
user’s discharge of that pollutant. Notwithstanding such allocations, any
discharge of BOD or TSS in excess of normal domestic strength shall be subject
to an extra-strength surcharge (per pound in excess of normal domestic
strength), which shall be calculated using the rates applicable at the time of
the surcharge as set forth in the City of Battle Creek’s Schedule of Water and
Sewer Rates.
   (f)   The above limits in subsections (b)(16) and (d)(2) apply at the point
where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic
substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise. The Director may
impose mass limitations in addition to the concentration-based limitations
above.
   (g)   A non-domestic user shall have an affirmative defense in any action
brought against it alleging violation of the general prohibition at subsection
(a) and the specific prohibitions at subsections (b)(3), (4), (5) and (6) if
the user can demonstrate both of the following:
      (1)   It did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or
in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other sources, would cause
pass-through or interference; and
      (2)   During the pass-through or interference the user was in compliance
before and during the pass-through or interference, for each pollutant in the
user’s discharge that caused the pass-through or interference, with any local
limit designed to prevent pass-through or interference; or, if no local limit
has been developed to prevent pass-through or interference, the user’s
discharge directly before and during the pass-through or interference did not
change substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge
activity when the POTW was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit
requirements and, in the case of interference, applicable requirements for
sewage sludge use or disposal.
   (h)   No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way
attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly
authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The Director
may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition
of mass limitations is appropriate.
   (i)   A person who violates any of the provisions of this section shall be
subject to the penalty provided in Section
1040.99(a).

4-08; Ord. 03-2010. Passed 4-13-10; Ord. 01-2015. Passed 3-17-15.)
1040.50 PRETREATMENT; TREATMENT; PROTECTION AGAINST ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE.
   (a)   Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as
required to comply with this chapter, Federal pretreatment standards and permit
conditions, and shall achieve compliance with all national categorical
pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the Federal
pretreatment regulations.
   (b)   Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater shall be provided,
operated and maintained at the industrial user's expense. New sources shall
install and have in operating condition and shall "start-up" all pollution
control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before
beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed ninety
days), new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards. Detailed
plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the Director of Public Works for review and shall be approved by
the Director of Public Works before construction of the facility. The review
and approval of plans and operating procedures does not relieve the industrial
user from complying with the provisions of this chapter and permit conditions.
Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation
shall be reported to and approved by the Director of Public Works prior to the
industrial user's initiation of the changes.
   (c)   The Director of Public Works may issue an industrial user discharge
authorization (permit) for not more than five years upon application by a user
subject to Section
1040.51. Applications for industrial user discharge authorizations shall
contain such material as required to evaluate the user effluent, including, but
not limited to, information required in Section
1040.53.
   (d)   Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this chapter. In each
instance, detailed plans showing the required pretreatment facilities and
operating procedures shall be submitted to the City for review and shall be
approved by the City before construction of the facility. The review and
approval of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the
user from the responsibility of modifying the facilities as necessary to
produce an effluent complying with this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the
required pretreatment facilities or method of operating affecting the effluent
shall be reported to, and approved by, the City. The facilities shall be
available for inspection by the Director at all reasonable times. No
authorization to construct or operate the pretreatment facilities shall be
valid until all conditions herein have been satisfactorily met.
   (e)   A person who violates any of the provisions of this section shall be
subject to the penalty provided in Section
1040.99(a).

1040.53 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Baseline monitoring reports.
      (1)   Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category
determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing
categorical industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge
to the POTW shall submit to the Director a report which contains the
information listed in subsection (a)(2) below. At least ninety days prior to
commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become
categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard, shall submit to the Director a report which contains the
information listed in subsection (a)(2) below. A new source shall report the
method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical
standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and
quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
      (2)   Users described above shall submit the information set forth below.
         A.   The name and address of the facility, including the name of the
operator and owner;
         B.   A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the
facility;

(including each product produced by type, amount, processes, and rate of
production), and standard industrial classifications of the operation(s)
carried out by such user. This description should include a schematic process
diagram, which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated
processes;
         D.   Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily
flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other
streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined wastestream formula set out
in 40 CFR 403.6(e); and
         E.   Measurement of pollutants, as follows:
            1.   The user shall provide:
               a.   The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each
regulated process and any new categorically regulated processes for existing

concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported, including
documentation of BMP or pollution prevention alternatives.
            2.   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this subsection.
            3.   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed
with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste-stream
formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment
standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated
in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting
data shall be submitted to the Director;
            4.   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with
subsection (i) below (Analytical Requirements);
            5.   The Director may allow the submission of a baseline report
which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information
sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures;
            6.   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of
sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges.
         F.   Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user’s
authorized representative as defined in Section
1040.02(2) above and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,

reports must be certified in accordance with Section
1040.51(f) of this chapter and signed by an authorized representative as
defined in Section
1040.02(2) above.
   (b)   Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall
apply to the compliance schedule required by subsection (a)(2)G. above:
      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months;
      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the Director no later
than fourteen days following each date in the schedule and the final date of

increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and
      (4)   In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such
progress reports to the Director.
   (c)   Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline.
Within ninety days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject
to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the Director a
report containing the information described in subsection (a)(2)C. through (a)
(2)F. above and the following:
      (1)   Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average daily
and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process
streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined
wastestream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
      (2)   Measurement of pollutants.
         A.   Identification of the categorical pretreatment standards
applicable to each regulated process and any new categorically regulated
processes for existing sources.
         B.   The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and
concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the Director,
of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process.
         C.   Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average
concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported.
         D.   The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall
be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection (i) below.
Where the standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention
alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the Director or
the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard. All
sampling will be done in conformance with subsection (j) below.
   (d)   Periodic compliance reports.
      (1)   Except as specified in subsection (d)(3) below, all significant
industrial users must, at a frequency determined by the Director submit no less
than twice per year reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants
in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured
or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases
where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution
prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the
Director or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance
status of the user. Reports shall be submitted during the months of June and
December, unless, at the discretion of the Director and in consideration of
such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc.,
the Director may modify the months during which the above reports are to be
submitted.
         A.   For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established by the Director in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR
Part 403.6(c), the report required by this subsection must contain a reasonable
measure of the user’s long term production rate. For all other industrial users
subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of
allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of
operation), the report required by this subsection must include the user’s
actual average production rate for the reporting period.
         B.   This sampling and analysis may be performed by the POTW in lieu
of the industrial user. Where the POTW performs the required sampling and
analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the user will not be required to
submit the compliance certification required under subsections (a), (c), and
(d) of this section. In addition, where the POTW itself collects all the
information required for the report, including flow data, the industrial user
will not be required to submit the report.
      (2)   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with Section
1040.51(f).
      (3)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      (4)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the Director, using the procedures prescribed in
subsection (j) below, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the
report.
   (e)   Reports of planned and unplanned changed conditions. Each user must
notify the Director of any significant planned or anticipated changes to the
user’s operations or system that might alter the nature, quality, or volume of
its wastewater no less than thirty days before the change. Each user must
notify the Director of any significant unplanned or unanticipated changes to
the user’s operations or system that might alter the nature, quality, or volume
of its wastewater immediately upon actual knowledge of the change.
   (f)   Reports of potential problems.
      (1)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and
notify the Director of the incident. This notification shall include the
location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known,
and corrective actions taken by the user.
      (2)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in subsection (f)(1) above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees who have direct contact with or responsibility for equipment,
processes, waste streams, or handling of raw materials or chemicals that may
result in such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification
procedure.
       (3)   Significant industrial users are required to notify the Director
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug
discharge.
   (g)   Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain an
individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the
Director as the Director may require.
   (h)   Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the Director
within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall
also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat
analysis to the Director within thirty days after becoming aware of the
violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the City
performs sampling at the user’s facility at least once a month, or if the City
performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was
conducted and the time when the user or the City receives the results of this
sampling. If the City performed the initial sampling and analysis indicating a
violation in lieu of the user, the City will perform the repeat sampling and
analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to
perform the repeat sampling and analysis. See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(2).
   (i)   Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical
techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other
applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested
by the Director or other parties approved by EPA.
   (j)   Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements
must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis
performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is
representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
   (k)   Date of receipt of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have
been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed,
postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal
Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
   (l)   Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with BMPs established under Section 1040.49(d)(3)
of this chapter. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time
of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates
analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques
or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user
or the City, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the Director.
   (m)   Application to significant industrial users. The reporting
requirements set forth in this section shall also apply to significant
industrial users.

1040.71 AUTHORITY TO LEVY REGIONAL USER CHARGES ON SUBSCRIBING AGENCIES AND THE
CITY.
   Monthly user charges shall be established by the City Commission from time
to time by resolution for each subscribing agency and the City to recover
regional costs of the City. Such charges shall be assessed against each
subscribing agency and the City and shall be based upon the cost of service to
treat both quantity (volume) and quality (BOD and SS) of wastewater discharge
as determined by contribution to both average and for capital recovery, peak
system use. Such charges shall recover from each subscribing agency and the
City their proportional share of capital and operation and maintenance costs,
including replacement.
(Ord. 14-01. Passed 10-16-01.)
1040.72 METHOD OF ASSESSING REGIONAL USER CHARGES TO SUBSCRIBING AGENCIES AND
CITY.
   (a)   User charges shall be the sum of the following charges:
      (1)   Fixed charges shall be based on costs associated with regional
ground water infiltration/ inflow (I/I) and costs of operating and maintaining
monitoring stations.
      (2)   Demand charges shall be based on the peak month discharge of the
billable parameters during the fiscal year. Each subscribing agency and the
City shall submit established peak month loadings of the billable parameters
two months prior to the beginning of each fiscal year. If the estimated demand
is exceeded, the agency or City shall be billed the demand unit rate multiplied
by the new peak month discharge. This amount shall be assessed retroactively to
the beginning of the fiscal year and for each month through the remainder of
the fiscal year. If the estimated demand is not reached by the end of the
fiscal year, the subscribing agency or City shall be credited an amount equal
to the difference of the demand charges paid and the peak month discharge
multiplied by tile demand unit rate.
      (3)   Loading charges shall be based on the quantity of billing
parameters discharged during the billing period.

charges for the balance of the current fiscal year and for each subsequent
fiscal year. New connections shall not be assessed demand charges retroactively
to the beginning of the current fiscal year.
      (2)   Demand charges shall not be assessed for "act of God" accidental
discharges by the City or a subscribing agency. Accordingly, no such "act of
God" accidental discharge shall be included in the determination of peak month
flow on which flow demand charges are based.

agency to any person or to any public agency or instrumentality. Monthly
charges shall be assessed to all system users. Such charges shall be based upon
the cost of service to treat both the quantity (volume) and quality (BOD and
SS) of wastewater discharged and as to capital charges by contribution to both
average and peak system use. Charges shall be comprised of user charges and
industnial cost recovery charges where applicable.
   (b)   User charges shall be comprised of flat monthly service charges and
quantity plant to recover their proportional share of operational and
maintenance costs, including replacement.
   (c)   Capital charges shall be recovered by such flat monthly service
charges and quantity charges as to recover the proportional share of capital,
including replacement, and may include methods to reflect the necessity of
having capital available for such users who need such capital plant during only
certain portions of the year.
(Ord. 14-01. Passed 10-16-01.)
1040.74 METHOD OF ASSESSING USER SERVICE CHARGES TO USERS.
   Flat monthly service charges shall be assessed for each customer to recover

subscribing agency, but may vary between the City and subscribing agencies as a
result of local and regional cost variances.
(Ord. 14-01. Passed 10-16-01.)
1040.75 METHOD OF ASSESSING USER QUANTITY CHARGES.
   (a)   Sewer charges shall be established by resolution of the City
Commission according to water usage or sewer meter data, together with
readiness to serve charges, monitoring charges, any extra strength charges that
may be required by the cost of treatment of such extra strength effluent, and
any other charges required or permitted by this chapter, the City’s schedule of
water and sewer rates, or any other applicable federal or state law. Charges
for strength and quantity of discharges pursuant to a special discharge
authorization may be established by the City Commission resolution.
   (b)   Flat monthly user charges shall be assessed in accordance with Section
1040.33(b). Quantity user charges shall be applied to such schedule to
determine flat monthly charges for different types of users.

all bills paid more than thirty days after the due date.
   (d)   A request for a hearing by the customer must be filed with the Revenue
Services Director not later than three working days before the date of
discontinuance. In instances where the service is actually terminated and later
reinstated, the customer shall be charged thirty dollars ($30.00) to cover the
costs of reinstating the service. Where service is discontinued, the water
shall be shut off from the premises until the unpaid    bill, together with
reconnection charges, has been paid. A request for hearing form may be obtained
from the Finance Department and must be filed before the scheduled termination
date. Such hearing shall be conducted by the Revenue Services Director or their
designee, for the purpose of allowing the customer of record to present
objections to the bill. The Revenue Services Director shall have authority to
make corrections on the utility bill if an error is found.
   (e)   When water service commences or ceases, applicable charges may be
prorated. If water service is supplied to a location, the customer of which has
vacated the premises, and the City is satisfied that there has been a
termination of the need for sewer charges, then the City, on application of the
customer, may suspend liability for such charges and such charges shall be
reinstated with the next bill rendered to a customer of such premises.
   (f)   The portion of the account which remains outstanding for 180 days
shall then be collected under the procedures of a special lot assessment as set
forth in
Chapter 216 of these Codified Ordinances or in the Act 94 of the Public Acts of
1933, as amended, if applicable.

1040.83 HARDSHIP EXEMPTION.
   Any user who has been assessed connection charges under this chapter may
submit a hardship application to a committee composed of the City Manager, the
Revenue Services Director and the City Attorney, or their designees, seeking a
deferment in the partial or total payment of the charges based upon a showing
of financial hardship subject to and in accordance with the following:
   (a)   The user shall complete a hardship application provided by the Revenue
Services Director and shall file such application, together with all other
required information, with the Revenue Services Director not less than sixty
days prior to the due date of the annual installment. Any such deferment shall
be for that annual installment only. An application shall be completed and
filed by each and every legal and equitable interest holder in the premises so
assessed, except financial institutions having a security interest in the
premises.
   (b)   Hardship applications shall be reviewed by the committee, as set forth
above, and after due deliberation of such applications, the committee shall
determine, in, each case, whether or not there has been an adequate showing of
financial hardship and shall forthwith notify the applicant of such
determination.
   (c)   An applicant who is aggrieved by the determination of the committee
may request, within ten days from the mailing of the decision of the committee,
the opportunity to appear before the committee, in person, for the purpose of
showing hardship and presenting any argument or additional evidence. Denial of
hardship following such a personal appearance before the committee shall be
final and conclusive.
   (d)   If the committee makes a finding of hardship, the committee shall fix
the amount of deferment of partial or total charges so imposed and in so doing
shall require an annual filing of the financial status of each applicant. Upon
any material change of the financial status of an applicant, such applicant
shall immediately notify the Revenue Services Director so that a further review
of the matter may be made. The duration of the deferment granted shall be self-
terminating upon the occurrence of any one of the following events:
      (1)   A change of the applicant's financial status which removes the
basis for financial hardship;
      (2)   A conveyance of an interest in the premises by any applicant,
including the execution of a new security interest in the premises or an
extension thereof, or
      (3)   A death of any applicant.
   (e)   Upon receiving a determination of the committee defeming partial or
total charges imposed, the user shall, within one month, execute a recordable
security interest in the premises to the City as the secured party, payable on
or before the death of the applicant, or, in any event, upon any transfer of
the premises. Such security interest shall be in an amount necessary to cover
all fees and charges required under applicable ordinances, the consideration
for such security interest being the grant of deferment pursuant to this
section.

the facility. Achieving the greatest risk reduction to the water supply in a
practical and implementable manner will be the primary goals in the decision
process.
(Ord. 12-2. Passed 6-19-12.)
1041.10   REQUIREMENTS REGARDING RELEASE OF REGULATED SUBSTANCE.
   (a)   Upon discovery of a release, the owner and person in control of the
property on which a release is occurring or occurred, and the person
responsible for the release, shall take appropriate reasonable actions to stop
the release, mitigate the potential impact of the release on groundwater and
remediate the release. All actions involved in stopping, mitigating, and
remediating must be conducted in a timely manner and in accordance with
applicable federal, state and local law. If wastes generated during remediation
of a regulated substance release are expected to be stored, or are stored on
site or elsewhere in the WHPA for a period greater than fourteen days, within
that fourteen days the storage must be reported to, and approval obtained from,
the Director.
   (b)   In addition to any other report required by state or federal law, all
releases must be reported to the Department in writing within five business
days from the date of the release on a regulated substance release form
available from the Department. The regulated substance release form shall
include, at a minimum, the following:
      (1)   Location of the release
      (2)   Name, address, and telephone number of the owner of the property
and the person who has possession of the property if different than the owner;

location, and cause of the incident; type, concentration, and volume of
substance(s) released;
      (7)   Map showing exact release location, relevant site features (i.e.,
paved area, storm sewer catch basins/inlets, water features, etc.), scale, and
north arrow;
      (8)   All measures taken and/or intended to be taken to clean up the
release; and
      (9)   All measures proposed to be taken to reduce and prevent any future
release.
   (c)   It is the joint and several obligation of the property owner, person
in charge of the property, if other than the owner, and person who was
responsible for the release if different from the property owner and other
person in charge, to ensure that the regulated substance release form is filed
with the Director as required in this subsection. Only one form need be filed
if all of the information is accurate and complete. However, if a responsible
person knows that the form filed is inaccurate, incomplete, or the
circumstances have changed so that the information should be corrected or
updated, another form must be filed by the person(s) who have the knowledge.
   (d)   The Director shall use the regulated substance release form to
determine if any additional investigative work needs to be completed to assess
the potential impact of the release, whether any additional containment or
remediation work needs to be done, and whether the future prevention plan is
sufficient.
(Ord. 12-2. Passed 6-19-12.)
1041.11   INACTIVE OPERATIONS.
   An “inactive operation” is either (1) an unoccupied facility in which there
is one or more regulated substances; and/or, (2) a facility which had an
activity that involved a regulated substance which activity has been
discontinued for thirty consecutive days. Those who own or control such an
inactive operation shall do the following:
   (a)   Immediately upon the operation becoming inactive, take the steps
necessary to secure the site such that vandals and all other persons cannot
gain access to the regulated substance(s);
   (b)   Within ten days of becoming an inactive operation, provide to the
Director a document that identifies the site, the date it became an inactive
operation, the reason it qualifies as an inactive operation, the regulated
substances that exist on-site, and the name, address, and telephone number of
both the owner and the person in control of the site; and
   (c)   Unless otherwise approved by the Director, within thirty days of the
operation becoming an inactive operation, remove all regulated substances from
the site; this does not include those substances used for heating, cooling, or
electrical lighting of the structure if the structure can still be legally
occupied.
   (d)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the regulated substance is, in the
determination of the Director, a significant threat to the health, safety, and/
or welfare of the general public, whether based upon the characteristics of the
regulated substance itself, or the manner of containment, or the potential for
unauthorized release, or a combination of any one or more, the Director may
require the removal of the regulated substance in a lesser time, up to and
including immediately.
   (e)   The owner or other person in charge of the facility or activity may
appeal the time required to remove a regulated substance in accordance with
Section
1041.13.

threat to the health, safety, and/or welfare of the public can be ordered
abated immediately; and
      (6)   Information on how to file an appeal under Section
1041.13.
   (b)   Service of Notice of Violation. If the person to be cited is the owner
or occupant of the property upon which a violation is occurring or occurred,
the service of the notice may be given by personal service, or by mailing a
copy of the notice of violation by first class mail to the responsible person
or persons and posting a copy on the property where the activity was or is
occurring. If the person to be cited is someone who is not the owner or
occupant, the notice must be given by personal service or certified mail with
return receipt.
   (c)   Cumulative Remedies. Whether or not a notice of violation has been
issued, the Department may use all civil and/or criminal remedies available
under the law, including federal, state, or local ordinance.
(Ord. 12-2. Passed 6-19-12.)
1041.13   REGULATION VARIANCE.

variance with enough detail to allow the Director to understand the situation
and how the proposed regulation variance would provide substantially the same
protection as the current regulation.
   (b)   If the Director determines that additional information is needed, the
request for additional information shall be made to the applicant within thirty
days from the date the request for the variance was received by the Director.
   (c)   Within thirty days of the receipt of such additional information by
the Director, or, if no request for additional information is made by the
Director, within thirty days of the date the request for regulation variance
was received by the Director, the Director shall issue a written determination
to the owner.
   (d)   The determination shall grant, deny, or partially grant the regulation
variance request. A grant, whether partial or complete, may relieve the
property owner from strict compliance with one or more regulations in this
chapter if the proposed variance provides substantially the same protection as
the regulation from which relief is sought. Reasonable conditions may be
imposed as part of such a grant. The Public Works Director shall be guided by
the facts and circumstances of the particular case with primary goal of
protecting the City's well fields without creating undue hardship upon the
property owner or lessee affected. A person may appeal a partial grant or a
denial in accordance with Section
1041.14.
(Ord. 12-2. Passed 6-19-12.)

the claim. If the person billed desires to object to all or some of the amount
sought by the Department, said person may file with the Department, within the
same thirty-day period, a written objection setting forth the specific reasons
for the objection and any supporting documentation. The Director shall, within
thirty days of its receipt of the objection, provide the person objecting with
a written determination of the objection. If the Director determines that some
or the entire amount originally billed is appropriate, the person shall pay the
sum determined to be appropriate within thirty days of receipt of that
determination. If the amount due is not timely paid, the City may cause the
charges to become a special assessment against the property and shall
constitute a lien on the property and/or the City may collect the sum due
through any means provided by law.
(Ord. 12-2. Passed 6-19-12.)

containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable
water quality standards, other than storm water. Examples include overland
runoff from car wash facilities, from dumpsters, from tree nurseries, or
intentional dumping of pollutants down storm drains – such as, but not limited
to, used automobile oil, pesticides, and herbicides.
   (b)   No person shall construct, use or maintain any existing illicit
connections or non-storm sewer lines to the MS4. Additionally, this prohibition
expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past,
regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices
applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. All such connections shall
be abandoned within thirty days of the effective date of this chapter. A person
is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the person connects a line
conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue.
   (c)   Private septic systems shall operate in a manner such that any
effluent waters do not enter or infiltrate into storm sewer lines. Such
occurrences will be considered illicit discharges and the owner of the
offending system will be in violation of this chapter. Other considerations
concerning private septic systems are presented in
Chapter 1040.
(Ord. 03-08. Passed 3-18-08.)
1047.07 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS; LITTERING.
   (a)   Notwithstanding any other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response
for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release
of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or
pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or public
waters, said person shall take all necessary steps to insure the discovery,
containment and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence, the emergency dispatch services. In the event of
the release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the City in
person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications by person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the City within three business days of the phone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such an establishment shall
also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its reoccurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three
years.
   (b)   Notwithstanding any provision in this Code of Ordinances, littering
which results in the release of pollutants contaminating storm water is defined
as a "spill" under this chapter and the offending parties will be held
accountable for a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 03-08. Passed 3-18-08.)
1047.08 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES; INDUSTRIAL AND CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES.
   (a)   The City shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to
regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has securing measures in force
which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
   (b)   Facility operators shall allow the City ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying
of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by State and Federal law.
   (c)   The City shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such
devices as are necessary in the opinion of the City to conduct monitoring and/
or sampling of the facility's storm water discharge.
   (d)   The City has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure storm water flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
   (e)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the City and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
   (f)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the City access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this chapter.
A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge
storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the
person denies the City reasonable access to the permitted facility for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
   (g)   If the City has been refused access to any part of the premises from
which storm water is discharged, and he or she is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there
is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the
community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search
warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 03-08. Passed 3-18-08.)
1047.09 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Whenever the City finds that a person has violated a prohibition or
failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the City will initially request
compliance with this chapter by issuing a voluntary compliance notice. Such a
notice will contain the following information:
      (1)   A description of the discharge/connection that is in violation of
this chapter;
      (2)   A description of the appropriate action to take to correct the
violation;
      (3)   Deadline date to complete the corrective action; and
      (4)   Notice that failure to correct the violation prior to the deadline
date will result in the issuance of a notice of violation - a legally
enforceable citation compelling the offender to take action.
   (b)   If the deadline date contained in the voluntary compliance notice
passes without satisfactory abatement of the violation, then the City shall
issue a notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require
without limitation:
      (1)   The performance of monitoring, analysis, and reporting;
      (2)   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
      (3)   That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
      (4)   The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
      (5)   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs;
and
      (6)   The implementation of source control or treatment Best Management
Practices (BMPs). The technical details of such BMPs are discussed in the
Stormwater Management Technical Reference Manual (TRM).
   (c)   If abatement of a violation or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation
or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should
the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the
work will be done by the City or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be
charged to the violator.
(Ord. 03-08. Passed 3-18-08.)
1047.10 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (a)   Emergency Situations. The City may, without prior notice, suspend MS4
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons,
or to the MS4 or public waters. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the City may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or public waters, or to
minimize danger to the persons.
   (b)   Illicit Discharge Detection. Any person discharging to the MS4 in
violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such
termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The City will notify a
violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may
petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
   (c)   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the
City.
(Ord. 03-08. Passed 3-18-08.)
1047.11 NON-COMPLIANCE.
   If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation, then representatives of the City shall, in
accordance with applicable law, enter upon the subject private property and are
authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation or
restore the property, or both.
(Ord. 03-08. Passed 3-18-08.)
1047.12 COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.
   (a)   Within thirty days after the abatement of the violation, the owner of
the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including
administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting
to the amount of the assessment within fourteen days. If the amount due is not
paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the City or by the
expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a
special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the
property for the amount of the assessment.
   (b)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall
become liable to the City by reason of such violation. The liability shall be
paid in not more than twelve equal monthly payments. Interest at the rate of
eighteen percent per annum shall be assessed on the balance beginning on the
thirtieth day following discovery of the violation.
(Ord. 03-08. Passed 3-18-08.)
1047.13 PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   Any development activity commenced without compliance with this chapter or
any activity conducted contrary to the requirements of this chapter shall be
deemed a public nuisance and may be restrained by injunction or otherwise
abated in a manner provided by law or equity. The City may institute injunctive
mandamus or other appropriate action for the enforcement of this chapter and
any court of competent jurisdiction shall have the right to issue restraining

1048.01 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City finds that uncontrolled stormwater runoff from developed land
adversely affects the public health, safety, and welfare because:
   (a)   Impervious surfaces increase the quantity and velocity of surface
runoff, resulting in less percolation of water through soil and increased
erosion and flooding conditions.
   (b)   Improper collection and conveyance of stormwater adversely affects
off-site property and increases the incidence and severity of flooding, which
can endanger property and human life.
   (c)   Increased erosion leads to sedimentation in stormwater management
systems that decrease their hydraulic capacity.
   (d)   Stormwater runoff often contains nutrients, such as nitrogen and
phosphorus, which adversely affect flora and fauna by accelerating
eutrophication of receiving waters.
   (e)   The City has adopted a comprehensive land use plan that establishes
proposed land use and infrastructure service needs for undeveloped areas of the
City.
   (f)   Inadequate soil erosion and sedimentation control practices can cause
increased turbidity, the cloudiness caused by having soil particles suspended
in the water column.
(Ord. 11-01. Passed 8-21-01.)
1048.02 OBJECTIVES AND INTENT.
   It is the intent of this chapter to protect, maintain, and enhance the
health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City by:

integrity of groundwater and surface waters.
   (b)   Preventing activities that adversely affect groundwater and surface
water resources.
   (c)   Encouraging the use of stormwater management systems that approximate
natural systems.
   (d)   Ensuring that stormwater runoff peak rates, volumes, and pollutant
loadings are no greater than natural conditions.
   (e)   Maintaining and restoring groundwater levels.
   (f)   Preventing damage to wetlands and other natural resources.
   (g)   Minimizing soil erosion and sedimentation.

by a state licensed professional engineer or state licensed professional land
surveyor to lie beyond the floodplain, and to the satisfaction of the Director,
to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the effective date of
the first regulatory floodplain map denoting the site to be in a floodplain, or
for unmapped floodplains as of the effective date of the ordinance, shall not

      (5)   In the case of a site located in the regulatory floodway that is
higher than the BFE, it is subject to the regulations of this section until
such time as a letter of map revision is received from the FEMA.
   (b)   Performance Standards Applicable to all Floodplain Development.
      (1)   Modification and disturbance of natural riverine floodplains shall
be avoided to protect existing hydrologic and environmental functions. Such
disturbances shall be minimized and all negative impacts mitigated as described
in a mitigation plan.

1049.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   The Metropolitan Extension Telecommunications Rights-of-Way Oversight
Act, 2002 Public Act 48, (Metro Act) regulates the granting of permits by
municipalities to telecommunication companies seeking permission to install
lines and other facilities in the public right-of-way effective November 1,
2002.
   (b)   The Metro Act will require municipalities to use application and
permit forms approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission for new
telecommunication companies. The Metro Act also limits fees which can be
charged by municipalities to telecommunication companies for an application,
permit, construction plan review or inspection and prohibits the enforcement of
cable television franchises requiring payment of franchise fees on cable modem
high-speed internet service.
   (c)   Within six months of the effective date of the Metro Act, all
telecommunication companies including incumbent local exchange carriers will be
required to file applications and obtain permits in all municipalities where
they are using the public right-of-way. Beginning April 29, 2003, all
telecommunication companies will be required to pay an annual standardized
right-of-way maintenance fee to the Michigan Metro Authority for distribution
only to those municipalities complying with the Metro Act's limitation on fees.
   (d)   A municipality is considered to be in compliance with the Metro Act's
limitation on fees if it adopts a resolution or ordinance, as is necessary,
effective no later than December 31, 2003, modifying fees due from
telecommunication companies and provides each company with a copy of the
resolution or ordinance.
   (e)   The Metro Act specifically provides that either house of the
Legislature or the governor may request an advisory opinion from the Michigan
Supreme Court as to the constitutionality of the Act. The Michigan Supreme
Court has agreed to take briefs on several constitutional questions concerning
the Metro Act and is expected to rule on those questions before November 1,
2002.
   (f)   Pursuant to Section 27 of Article VII of the Michigan Constitution of
1963 permitting the Legislature to establish metropolitan authorities and
Section 29 of Article VII reserving to cities reasonable control of their
highways, streets, alleys and public places and requiring the consent of said
cities before a public utility may use said highways, streets, alleys or other
public places, this chapter is adopted so as to permit the City of Battle Creek
to comply with the Metro Act regarding applications, permits and right- of-way
fees for telecommunication companies seeking permission to use public rights-
of-way located with the City; that the City will comply with limitation of the
Metro Act on the payment of franchise fees on cable modem service by cable
television operators, reserving any rights the City may have to fees due for
the period ending October 31, 2002; and to otherwise come into compliance with
the Metro Act for the purpose of receiving its proportionate share of the
annual standardized right-of-way maintenance fee to be distributed by the Metro
Authority.

such service but does not contain right-of-way management and related

operator predates the Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act and has right-
of-way management and related provisions. However, that Act states that as of
January 1, 2007, "any provisions" of such an agreement "that are inconsistent
with or in addition to" the standardized, uniform form of franchise agreement
established by the MPSC "are unreasonable and unenforceable by the franchising
entity."
   (c)   Telecommunications providers who obtain a standardized, uniform form
of franchise agreement generally will have previously obtained from the
Municipality a permit under the Metro Act to construct and maintain their
telecommunications facilities in the public right-of-way. Such Metro Act
permits set forth the terms and conditions for such right-of-way usage,
standard forms of such permits were agreed to in a collaborative process
between municipalities and providers that was initiated by the MPSC, and such
standard forms have since been approved by the legislature and the MPSC.
   (d)   Because telecommunications providers typically provide video services
over combined video and telecommunications facilities, such Metro Act permits
generally provide adequate public right-of-way related protections for the
Municipality and the public when such providers are providing video services.
   (e)   Other video service providers, in particular new providers or existing
cable operators, may not have a Metro Act permit issued by the Municipality.
   (f)   The Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act and the standardized,
uniform franchise agreement require video service providers with such an
agreement to comply with all valid and enforceable local regulations regarding
the use and occupation of the public right-of-way in the delivery of video
services, including the police powers of the franchising entity, and makes such
right-of-way usage subject to the laws of the State of Michigan and the police
powers of the franchising entity.
   (g)   The Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act and the standardized,
uniform franchise agreement state that franchising entities shall provide video
service providers with open, comparable, nondiscriminatory and competitively
neutral access to the public right-of-way, and may not discriminate against a
video service provider for the authorization or placement of a video service or
communications network in the public right-of-way.
   (h)   The Michigan Constitution reserves reasonable control of their
highways, streets, alleys and public places to local units of government, which
may exercise such authority through the use of their police powers.
   (i)   The purpose of this chapter is to promote and protect the public
health, safety and welfare and exercise reasonable control over the public
right-of-way by regulating the use and occupation of such rights-of-way by
video service providers who lack a Metro Act permit from the Municipality. This
chapter does so by setting forth terms and conditions for such usage and
occupation from the forms of Metro Act permit approved by the MPSC and approved
by the legislature in Section 6(1) of the Metro Act, thus providing open,
comparable, nondiscriminatory, and competitively neutral access to the public
right-of-way and not discriminating against a video service provider for the
authorization or placement of a video service or communications network in
public right-of-way.

determines that any portion of the facilities constitutes an undue burden or
interference, due to changed circumstances, permittee, at its sole expense,
shall modify the facilities or take such other actions as the Municipality may
determine is in the public interest to remove or alleviate the burden, and
permittee shall do so within a reasonable time period. The Municipality shall
attempt to require all occupants of a pole or conduit whose facilities are a
burden to remove or alleviate the burden concurrently.
   (d)   No Priority. This chapter does not establish any priority of use of
the public right-of-way by permittee over any present or future permittees or
parties having agreements with the Municipality or franchises for such use. In
the event of any dispute as to the priority of use of the public right-of-way,
the first priority shall be to the public generally, the second priority to the

subdivisions in the performance of their various functions, and thereafter as
between other permit, agreement or franchise holders, as determined (except as
otherwise provided by law) by the Municipality in the exercise of its powers,
including the police power and other powers reserved to and conferred on it by
the State of Michigan.
   (e)   Restoration of Property. Permittee, its contractors and subcontractors
shall immediately (subject to seasonal work restrictions) restore, at
permittee's sole expense, in a manner approved by the Municipality, any portion
of the public right-of-way that is in any way disturbed, damaged, or injured by
the construction, installation, operation, maintenance or removal of the
facilities to a reasonably equivalent (or, at permittee's option, better)
condition as that which existed prior to the disturbance. In the event that
permittee, its contractors or subcontractors fail to make such repair within a
reasonable time, the Municipality may make the repair and permittee shall pay
the costs the Municipality incurred for such repair.

continuous colored tape with a statement to the effect that there is buried
cable beneath; and stakes or other appropriate above ground markers with
permittee's name and a toll-free number indicating that there is buried cable
below. Bored underground portions of the facilities shall have a conducting
wire at the same depth as the cable and shall not be required to provide the
continuous colored tape. Portions of the facilities located in conduit,
including conduit of others used by permittee, shall be marked at its entrance
into and exit from each manhole and handhole with permittee's name and a toll-
free telephone number.

facilities shall be performed pursuant to plans approved by the Municipality.
The open cut of any public right-of-way shall be coordinated with the Manager
or Manager's designee. Permittee shall install and maintain the facilities in a
reasonably safe condition. If the existing poles in the public right-of-way are
overburdened or unavailable for permittee's use, or the facilities of all users
of the poles are required to go underground then permittee shall, at its
expense, place such portion of its facilities underground, unless the
Municipality approves an alternate location. Permittee may perform maintenance
on the facilities without prior approval of the Municipality, provided that
permittee shall obtain any and all permits required by the Municipality in the
event that any maintenance will disturb or block vehicular traffic or are
otherwise required by the Municipality.
   (i)   Pavement Cut Coordination. Permittee shall coordinate its construction
and all other work in the public right-of-way with the Municipality's program
for street construction and rebuilding (collectively "street construction") and
its program for street repaving and resurfacing (except seal coating and
patching) (collectively, "street resurfacing"). The goals of such coordination
shall be to encourage permittee to conduct all work in the public right-of-way
in conjunction with or immediately prior to any street construction or street
resurfacing planned by the Municipality.
   (j)   Compliance with Laws. Permittee shall comply with all valid and
enforceable Federal and State statutes and regulations; and all valid and
enforceable local regulations regarding the use and occupation of the public
right-of-way, including the police powers of the Municipality; regarding the
construction, installation, and maintenance of its facilities, now in force or
which hereafter may be promulgated. Before any installation is commenced,
permittee shall secure all necessary permits, licenses and approvals from the
Municipality or other governmental entity as may be required by law, including,
without limitation, all utility line permits and highway permits. The
Municipality shall not unreasonably delay or deny issuance of any such permits,
licenses or approvals. Permittee shall comply in all respects with applicable
codes and industry standards, including but not limited to the National
Electrical Safety Code (latest edition adopted by Michigan Public Service
Commission) and the National Electric Code (latest edition). Permittee shall
comply with all zoning and land use ordinances and historic preservation
ordinances as may exist or may hereafter be amended. This section does not
constitute a waiver of permittee's right to challenge laws, statutes,
ordinances, rules or regulations now in force or established in the future.
   (k)   Street Vacation. If the Municipality vacates or consents to the
vacation of public right-of-way within its jurisdiction, and such vacation
necessitates the removal and relocation of permittee's facilities in the
vacated public right-of-way, permittee shall consent to the vacation and remove
its facilities at its sole cost and expense when ordered to do so by the
Municipality or a court of competent jurisdiction. Permittee shall relocate its
facilities to such alternate route as the Municipality and permittee mutually
agree, applying reasonable engineering standards.
   (l)   Relocation. If the Municipality requests permittee to relocate,
protect, support, disconnect, or remove its facilities because of street or
utility work, or other public projects, permittee shall relocate, protect,
support, disconnect, or remove its facilities, at its sole cost and expense,
including where necessary to such alternate route as the Municipality and
permittee mutually agree, applying reasonable engineering standards. The work
shall be completed within a reasonable time period.
   (m)   Public Emergency. The Municipality shall have the right to sever,
disrupt, dig-up or otherwise destroy facilities of permittee if such action is
necessary because of a public emergency. If reasonable to do so under the
circumstances, the Municipality shall attempt to provide notice to permittee.

business in conformance with the statutory provisions and regulations
promulgated thereunder.
   (o)   Underground Relocation. If permittee has its facilities on poles of
Consumers Energy, Detroit Edison or another electric or telecommunications
provider and Consumers Energy, Detroit Edison or such other electric or
telecommunications provider relocates its system underground, then permittee
shall relocate its facilities underground in the same location at permittee's
sole cost and expense.
   (p)   Identification. All personnel of permittee and its contractors or
subcontractors who have as part of their normal duties contact with the general

without limitation, attorneys' fees) arising out of or resulting from the acts
or omissions of permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors,
successors, or assigns, but only to the extent such acts or omissions are
related to permittee's use of or installation of facilities in the public
right-of-way and only to the extent of the fault or responsibility of
permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, successors and
assigns.
   (b)   Notice, Cooperation. Municipality shall notify permittee promptly in
writing of any such claims and the method and means proposed by the

(Ord. 14-08. Passed 8-19-08.)
1050.08 INSURANCE.
   (a)   Coverage Required. Prior to beginning any construction in or
installation of permittee's facilities in the public right-of-way, permittee
shall obtain insurance as set forth below and file certificates evidencing same
with the Municipality. Such insurance shall be maintained in full force and
effect until the end of the term of its franchise agreement or pre-existing
agreement, (whichever is then in effect). In the alternative, permittee may
satisfy this requirement through a program of self-insurance, acceptable to the
Municipality, by providing reasonable evidence of its financial resources to
the Municipality. The Municipality's acceptance of such self-insurance shall
not be unreasonably withheld.
      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance, including Completed
Operations Liability, Independent Contractors Liability, Contractual Liability
coverage, railroad protective coverage and coverage for property damage from
perils of explosion, collapse or damage to underground utilities, commonly
known as XCU coverage, in an amount not less than five million dollars
($5,000,000).
      (2)   Liability insurance for sudden and accidental environmental
contamination with minimum limits of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000)
and providing coverage for claims discovered within three years after the term
of the policy. Pursuant to the 2006 MPSC decision in Case U-14720, permittee

date of this chapter that it decides to place any new or existing facilities
underground within the public right-of-way in the Municipality.
      (3)   Automobile liability insurance in an amount not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000).
      (4)   Workers' compensation and employer's liability insurance with
statutory limits, and any applicable Federal insurance of a similar nature.
      (5)   The coverage amounts set forth above may be met by a combination of
underlying (primary) and umbrella policies so long as in combination the limits
equal or exceed those stated. If more than one insurance policy is purchased to
provide the coverage amounts set forth above, then all policies providing
coverage limits excess to the primary policy shall provide drop down coverage
to the first dollar of coverage and other contractual obligations of the
primary policy, should the primary policy carrier not be able to perform any of
its contractual obligations or not be collectible for any of its coverages for
any reason during the term of the franchise agreement or pre-existing agreement
(whichever is then in effect), or (when longer) for as long as coverage could
have been available pursuant to the terms and conditions of the primary policy.
   (b)   Additional Insured. The Municipality shall be named as an additional
insured on all policies (other than worker's compensation and employer's
liability). All insurance policies shall provide that they shall not be
canceled, modified or not renewed unless the insurance carrier provides thirty
days prior written notice to the Municipality. Permittee shall annually provide
the Municipality with a certificate of insurance evidencing such coverage. All
insurance policies (other than environmental contamination, workers'
compensation and employer's liability insurance) shall be written on an
occurrence basis and not on a claims made basis.

carriers on the Michigan Insurance Commission approved list of companies
qualified to do business in Michigan. All insurance and surplus line carriers
shall be rated A+ or better by A.M. Best Company.
   (d)   Deductibles. If the insurance policies required by this chapter are
written with retainages or deductibles in excess of fifty thousand dollars
($50,000), they shall be approved by Manager in advance in writing. Permittee
shall indemnify and save harmless the Municipality from and against the payment
of any deductible and from the payment of any premium on any insurance policy
required to be furnished hereunder.
   (e)   Contractors. Permittee's contractors and subcontractors working in the
public right-of-way shall carry in full force and effect commercial general
liability, environmental contamination liability, automobile liability and
workers' compensation and employer liability insurance which complies with all
terms of this section. In the alternative, permittee, at its expense, may
provide such coverages for any or all its contractors or subcontractors (such
as by adding them to permittee's policies).
   (f)   Insurance Primary. Permittee's insurance coverage shall be primary
insurance with respect to the Municipality, its officers, agents, employees,
elected and appointed officials, departments, boards, and commissions
(collectively "them"). Any insurance or self-insurance maintained by any of
them shall be in excess of permittee's insurance and shall not contribute to it
(where "insurance or self-insurance maintained by any of them" includes any
contract or agreement providing any type of indemnification or defense
obligation provided to, or for the benefit of them, from any source, and
includes any self-insurance program or policy, or self-insured retention or
deductible by, for or on behalf of them).
(Ord. 14-08. Passed 8-19-08.)
1050.09 PERFORMANCE BOND OR LETTER OF CREDIT.
   Municipal Requirement. The Municipality may require permittee to post a bond
(or letter of credit), in the amount provided in Section 15(3) of the Metro

1050.10 REMOVAL.
   (a)   Removal; Underground. As soon as practicable after the later of the
term of its franchise agreement or pre-existing agreement expires, permittee or
its successors and assigns shall remove any underground cable or other portions
of permittee's facilities from the public right-of-way which has been installed
in such a manner that it can be removed without trenching or other opening of
the public right-of-way. Permittee shall not remove any underground cable or
other portions of the facilities which requires trenching or other opening of
the public right-of-way except with the prior written approval of Manager. All
removals shall be at permittee's sole cost and expense. For purposes of this
subsection (a), "cable" means any wire, coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, feed
wire or pull wire.
   (b)   Removal; Above Ground. As soon as practicable after the later of the
expiration of the term of its franchise agreement or pre-existing agreement,
permittee, or its successor or assigns at its sole cost and expense, shall,
unless waived in writing by Manager, remove from the public right-of-way all
above ground elements of its facilities, including but not limited to poles,
pedestal-mounted terminal boxes, and lines attached to or suspended from poles.
   (c)   Schedule. The schedule and timing of removal shall be subject to
approval by Manager. Unless extended by Manager, removal shall be completed not
later than twelve months following the expiration of the later of the term of a
franchise agreement or pre-existing agreement. Portions of permittee's
facilities in the public right-of-way that are not removed within such time
period shall be deemed abandoned and, at the option of the Municipality
exercised by written notice to permittee at the address provided for in the
franchise agreement or pre-existing agreement (whichever was last in effect),

1050.11 OTHER ITEMS.
   (a)   Duties. Permittees shall faithfully perform all duties required by
this chapter.
   (b)   Different Terms. The Act allows local units of government and video
service providers to enter into voluntary franchise agreements that include
terms and conditions which are different from those required under the Act or
which are different from those in the standardized, uniform form of franchise
agreement established by the MPSC. The Metro Act allows municipalities and
providers to mutually agree to Metro Act permit terms differing from those in
the standard forms of Metro Act permit approved by the MPSC. Current or
prospective permittees who desire terms different from those in this chapter,
as applied to them, should request such a voluntary franchise agreement or a
mutually agreed to Metro Act permit from the Municipality.
   (c)   Interpretation and Severability. The provisions of this chapter shall
be liberally construed to protect and preserve the peace, health, safety and
welfare of the public, and should any provision or section of this chapter be
held unconstitutional, invalid, overbroad or otherwise unenforceable, such
determination/holding shall not be construed as affecting the validity of any
of the remaining conditions of this chapter. If any provision in this chapter
is found to be partially overbroad, unenforceable, or invalid, permittee and
the Municipality may nevertheless enforce such provision to the extent
permitted under applicable law.
   (d)   Violations. A permittee who violates any provision of this chapter is
responsible for a Municipal civil infraction, and shall be subject to such
civil infraction fines and costs as provided in the Municipality's ordinances
or Municipal Code. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the
remedies available to the Municipality in the event of a violation by a
permittee of this chapter.
   (e)   Authorized Officials. The Manager, which includes his or her designee,
is hereby designated as the authorized official of the Municipality to issue
Municipal civil infraction citations (directing alleged violators to appear in
court) or Municipal civil infraction violation notices (directing alleged
violators to appear at the Municipal chapter violations bureau) for violations
of this chapter, as provided by the Municipality's ordinances or Municipal
code.
(Ord. 14-08. Passed 8-19-08.)
1050.12 REPEALER.

1240.04 AG AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT.
 
(a)   Purpose
It is the purpose of this district to provide rural areas used predominantly for
general farming operations. Although urban development is occurring at a substantial
rate in the City, agriculture remains an important economic activity, and in the
proper interest of the welfare of present and future residents, it is considered
necessary to conserve an effective environment for stable, productive agricultural
operations.
The regulations of this chapter, therefore, are designed to:
   (1)   Protect and stabilize the essential characteristics of these areas;
   (2)   Minimize conflicting land uses detrimental to farm enterprises; and
   (3)   Exclude development which requires highway, drainage and other public
utilities and facilities in excess of those required by agricultural uses.

the market, or a combination thereof, require the orderly placement of business
establishments to provide the maximum use of buildings to accommodate and
respond to changes in vehicular and pedestrian traffic flow. To permit the full
potential of this district, certain uses which would interfere with the general
effectiveness of this District have been intentionally excluded, and uses
permitted herein are intended to be strictly limited in their definition.

1240.18 S SPARK DISTRICT.
 
(a)   Purpose
It is the purpose of this district to encourage and facilitate redevelopment by
implementing the following mixed-use policies:
   (1)   Mix of Land Compatible Land Uses. Permit a range of compatible land uses,
such as residential (from single-family to multi-family), public, institutional,
office, retail, personal services use, and appropriate general business uses.
   (2)   Walkability. Create a walkable, pedestrian-oriented development that does
not conflict with motorized traffic.
   (3)   Building Location and Site Design. Ensure that buildings have a strong
relationship to the street by requiring development to be human-scale through
appropriate building location and site design, including developing areas that
include civic spaces and pedestrian amenities and requiring on-street parking along
interior streets.
   (4)   Use of Buildings. Allow compatible mixed uses to be located in a single
building.

adjoins the water or right-of-way area. If the water or right-of-way area
adjoins two or more districts, the boundaries of each district shall be
construed to extend into the water or right-of-way area in a straight line
until they meet the other district.
   (d)   Annexed Land.
      (1)   Whenever any areas are annexed to the City, one of the following
conditions shall prevail:
         A.   All lots, tracts or land which may hereafter be annexed to the
City shall be classified as being in whichever district as most clearly
conforms to the zoning that existed in the annexed area. Such classifications
shall be recommended by the Planning Commission to the City Commission and the
City Commission shall approve the same by resolution.
         B.   If any lot, tract or land is not subject to zoning at the time of
annexation, it shall be classified as R-lA Single-Family whenever the land is
vacant and otherwise shall be classified into whatever district of this Zoning
Code most closely conforms to the existing use of the annexed area. Such
classification shall be approved in the same manner as described for property
that is zoned when annexed.
      (2)   In all cases, there shall be a public hearing, within a reasonable
time after annexation, on the question of a permanent zoning classification.
The hearing before the Planning Commission and the subsequent action by the
City Commission shall follow the procedure to establish amendments in
accordance with Section
1281.01(c).
   (e)   Vacation of Streets. Whenever any street, alley or other public way is
vacated by official action of the City Commission or by the courts, the zoning
district adjoining each side of such street, alley or other public way shall be
automatically extended to the center of such vacation and all area included in
the vacation shall then and henceforth be subject to all appropriate
regulations of the extended district.
   (f)   Uses Not Specifically Mentioned. The City Zoning Administrator or
their designee shall have the power to classify a use, which is not
specifically mentioned in this Zoning Code, along with a comparable permitted
or prohibited use for the purpose of the use regulations in any district. The
City Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee may refer these
appeals to the Zoning Board of Appeals.

but was a lot of record at the time of the adoption of this Zoning Code
(Ordinance 10-2020, adopted on November 24, 2020), such lot may be occupied by
any of the uses permitted in the district in which it is located. The use must
meet all of the other requirements of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   In R Districts, where required front yards exceed twenty-five feet,
only one front yard in excess of twenty-five feet shall be required, except
that south of I-94 on lots fronting on Beckley Road or Capital Avenue, S.W.,
all such front yards shall be a minimum of fifty feet.
   (c)   Thirty-five feet to dwelling only.
   (d)   The maximum residential density allowed in the MFR High Density
Multiple Family District and the T-3 Neighborhood Commercial District shall not
exceed twenty units per acre. There is no residential density limit in the T-
4 and T-5 Districts. However, all other dimensional regulations in those
districts shall apply.
   (e)   No new multifamily dwelling in the MFR High Density Multiple Family
District shall be established having a site area of less than 7,500 sq. ft.
   (f)   Provided that the front and rear yards are increased by one foot for

yards are increased over the minimum requirement by one foot for each two feet
of building height over thirty-five feet.
   (g)   No side yard shall be required, except that a side yard shall be
provided on the side of a lot or tract adjoining a residential use or district.
If an alley separates such a lot from a residential use or district, no side
yard shall be required.
   (h)   A rear yard shall be required only upon that portion of a lot or tract
abutting on a residential district or adjacent to a residential use. Where a
rear yard abuts an alley, the width of one-half of the alley may be considered
part of the required yard.
   (i)   The schedule of regulations is intended to be complementary with the
requirements of Section
1250.04, Form-Based Development Standards for the T-3, T-4, and T-5 Districts;
however, in any instance where there is apparent conflict the provisions of
Section
1250.04 shall control.

1241.05   LOT AREA AND WIDTH REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Exceptions.
      (1)   Two or more parcels, lots of record or platted lots, when
contiguous and held in common ownership, may be treated as a single lot for
purposes of the dimensional requirements of this Zoning Code, provided that
such lots are located in the same district. This does not prevent the use of
the lots as separate stand-alone parcels.
      (2)   Where a single lot of record, platted lot or parcel of land is
within two or more zoning districts, it may be treated as two or more lots for
purposes of this Zoning Code, provided that each portion has the required
frontage on a street or place and meets all of the other standards for the
district in which it is located.
      (3)   Where a lot of record on the effective date of this Zoning Code
(Ordinance 10-2020, adopted on November 24, 2020) is less than fifty feet in

CHAPTER 1250
Supplemental Zoning District Standards
1250.01   Planned unit residential developments.
1250.02   Subdivision regulations.
1250.03   Airport Approach Overlay Zoning District.
1250.04   Form-based development standards for the T-3, T-4, and T-5 districts.
1250.05   MHP-OD Mobile Home Park Overlay District.
1250.01 PLANNED UNIT RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS.
   (a)   Purpose; Intent. As used in this section, "planned unit development"
includes such terms as cluster zoning, planned development, community unit
plan, and planned residential development and other terminology denoting zoning
requirements designed to accomplish the objections of this Zoning Code through
a land development project review process based on the application of site
planning criteria to achieve integration of the proposed land development
project with the characteristics of the project area. A planned unit
residential development (PURD) is intended to provide a means by which land can
be developed or redeveloped with innovation and creativity. A PURD accommodates
the objectives of the City of Battle Creek's Comprehensive Plan, while allowing
some deviation from the strict application of use and bulk regulations which
may otherwise create hardship or complications for development. This chapter is
intended to grant such flexibility through the special use permit process of
public hearings. The objectives of PURD's are as follows:
      (1)   To stimulate creative approaches to the development of land;
      (2)   To provide for the more efficient use of land;
      (3)   To preserve natural features and resources and provide for open
spaces;
      (4)   To develop new approaches to the living environment through variety
in type, design and the layout of residential structures; and
      (5)   To accommodate diversification and variation in the relationship in
uses, structures, open spaces and structural heights in projects conceived as a
cohesive development consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
   (b)   Minimum Land Area. PURDs shall be developed having a computed area of
not less than three acres.
   (c)   Permitted Uses.
      (1)   Generally. In addition to the uses that might otherwise be
permitted in the underlying zoning district, the uses in a PURD may include,
and shall be limited to:
         A.   Dwelling units in detached, semidetached, attached or
multistoried structures, or any combination thereof; and
         B.   Recreational amenities primarily intended for use by residents of
the PURD.
      (2)   Nonresidential uses permitted. Nonresidential uses of a religious,
commercial, office or recreational character may be permitted under
requirements established in this chapter, but only according to the following:
         A.   If the PURD includes from one to fifty dwelling units, 75% of
said dwelling units must possess a certificate of occupancy prior to any
nonresidential construction.
         B.   If the PURD contains fifty-one or more dwelling units, 50% of
said dwelling units must possess a certificate of occupancy prior to any
nonresidential use construction.
         C.   In no instance may the total footprint area of any nonresidential
structure in a PURD be more than 5% of the total area of all footprints of all
structures in such development.
         D.   Except for office uses, no single establishment shall be greater
than 5,000 square feet in floor area, and all business must be conducted within
an enclosed building.
         E.   To the maximum extent possible, the design and architecture of
nonresidential uses shall conform to the character and architecture of the
surrounding area.
         F.   The only nonresidential uses permitted within a PURD are:
            1.   Assisted senior living;
            2.   Independent senior living with services;
            3.   Office;
            4.   Outdoor recreation/ public;
            5.   Personal service establishments;
            6.   Public K-12 schools;
            7.   Religious institutions;
            8.   Retail sales;
            9.   State licensed child care family home, 1-6 children.
         G.   Nonresidential uses identified as being permitted in a PURD may
be specifically and selectively authorized as to type and size only when
integrated by design as an accessory element of the project, and only when
located in an area of the total site having frontage on a major street.
         H.   Ingress and egress to the nonresidential areas of a PURD shall be
accessed from major thoroughfares and not the surrounding local residential
streets.
         I.   Nonresidential structures shall not be located closer than within
350 feet of the property line of any existing developed residential use.
         J.   Parking areas dedicated for nonresidential structures shall not
be located closer than 200 feet from the property line of any existing
developed residential use, and must be landscaped with plantings to prevent
headlight intrusion onto adjacent residential premises.
         K.   Nonresidential structures shall not be taller than thirty-five
feet in height.
         L.   One freestanding sign to identify aggregate nonresidential uses
shall be permitted, with a total maximum display area of not more than 100
square feet. The sign may not be located closer than 200 feet from the nearest
property line of any existing residentially developed property.
         M.   The general theme, plan and location of all signs within the
planned unit development shall be submitted with the preliminary site plan.
   (d)   Standards and Criteria.
      (1)   Professional design requirements. A plan submitted for
consideration as a PURD in the City must certify that the design has been
prepared by at least one of the following:
         A.   An architect licensed by the State of Michigan;
         B.   A landscape architect licensed by the State of Michigan;
         C.   A land surveyor licensed by the State of Michigan;
         D.   A professional community planner licensed by the State of
Michigan;
         E.   A planner holding membership in the American Institute of
Certified Planners; or
         F.   A civil engineer licensed by the State of Michigan.
      (2)   Conformity with general standards. A plan shall be consistent with
the following general standards for use of land, the use, type, mass, design
and location of buildings, the density and/or intensity of use, the common open
space and the public facilities of the site.
         A.   The plan may provide for variety in the design of house types,
including attached or detached residential structures.
         B.   The site coverage of buildings and structures shall not exceed
one-third of the total computed area of the PURD.
         C.   No structure shall be greater than fifty feet in height.
         D.   Any plan that does not propose to increase the number of dwelling
units per acre otherwise permitted on the property shall be prima facie
qualified for tentative approval insofar as density of use is concerned.
         E.   The housing tenure or type of a residential development shall not
be a determining factor in consideration for approval. Residential uses may
include units proposed for home ownership or condominium sale, or units
available for contract rental.
      (3)   Permitted density.
         A.   The permitted number of dwelling units shall be computed as
follows: total land area divided by the minimum lot area for the underlying
zoning district as identified in Chapter 1241 equals the number of dwelling
units permitted. The quotient of this formula shall be rounded down to the next
lower whole number.
         B.   A density bonus, or an allowable increase in overall density,
shall be as follows:
            1.   A plan may provide for a greater number of dwelling units than
would be permitted by the regulations otherwise applicable to the zone in which
the development is located, determined according to the following formula:
               a.   If more than two-thirds of the development contains
detached buildings each containing only one or two dwelling units, and/or town
house or similar one-family attached buildings, each attached cluster
containing no more than four dwelling units, the project would be entitled to a
10% density bonus;
               b.   If additional open space, beyond that required, is provided
and is to be used as a public park or playground of not less than one acre, and
which is free and open to the public with no obstructions or restrictions on
use, the project would be entitled to a 5% density bonus; or
               c.   If more than 25% of the acreage for the total site is
identified as common open space, the project would be entitled to a 5% density
bonus.
               d.   These bonuses are cumulative, and if a project meets or
exceeds all of these standards, the project would be entitled to a 20% density
bonus.
            2.   The landowner has the burden of showing that such excess will
not have an undue and adverse impact on existing public facilities and on the
reasonable enjoyment of neighboring property. The Planning Commission, in
making a determination of the reasonableness of the increase in the permitted
dwelling units per acre, shall recognize that increased density can be
compensated for by additional private amenities and by increased efficiency in
public services to be achieved by (1) the amount, location and proposed use of
common open space; and (2) the location, design and type of dwelling units. The
Planning Commission shall, in its determination, also consider the physical
characteristics of the site which may make increased densities appropriate or
inappropriate in the particular location.
      (4)   Covenants and easements. The plan may contain such proposed
covenants, easements and other provisions relating to the mass location and
density of such residential units, nonresidential uses and public facilities as
are necessary for the welfare of the PURD and are consistent with the best
interests of the entire City. Such covenants, easements and other provisions,
if part of the plan as finally approved, may be modified, enforced, removed or
released only in accordance with Section
1250.01(i).
      (5)   Phasing of development. The City Commission may, upon the
recommendation of the Planning Commission, allow divisible geographic sections
of the entire parcel to be developed in phases as a PURD, and shall in such
instances specify anticipated periods within which development of each section
will be commenced, and may permit in each section deviations from the number of
dwelling units per acre established for the entire PURD, provided that such
deviation shall be adjusted for in other sections of the development so that
the number of dwelling units per acre permitted for the entire PURD is not
affected. The period of the entire development and the commencement date for
each section thereof may be modified from time to time by the City Commission
upon the showing of good cause for such action by the landowner.
      (6)   Infrastructure, streets and utilities. The uniqueness of each
proposal for a PURD requires that the specifications for the width and
surfacing of streets, rights-of-way for public utilities, curbs, gutters,
sidewalks, street lighting, public parks and playgrounds, school grounds, storm
water drainage, water supply and distribution, sanitary sewers and sewage
collection and treatment shall be subject to modifications from the
requirements established in Section
1250.02 Subdivision Regulations. The City Commission may waive or modify any of
the requirements of this section where the City Commission finds, upon the
recommendation of the Planning Commission, that granting such waiver or
modification of any requirement is consistent with the interests of the entire
City.
      (7)   Common open space, setbacks and buffers.
         A.   At least 25% of the land area within any PURD shall be identified
as common open space.
         B.   In addition to the building setback requirements otherwise
applicable for the zone in which the tract is located, no structure or parking
area providing more than four parking spaces shall be within seventy-five feet
of the property lines of any abutting platted subdivision.
         C.   A natural state buffer of fifteen feet shall be maintained along
the property line abutting a platted subdivision unless otherwise recommended
by the Planning Commission.
      (8)   Off-street parking. All parking within a PURD shall be provided at
a rate of not less than two spaces per dwelling unit.
      (9)   Landscaping. The type, size and location of trees and shrubs shall
be indicated on the plan. Within the area developed for residential use, there
shall be at least twice as many shade or ornamental trees as there are ground
level dwelling units. Existing planting may be acceptable as required planting
to the extent that it is compatible in every respect with the landscape plan.
   (e)   Application for Tentative Approval.
      (1)   An application for tentative approval shall include the following
information:
         A.   The location and size of the area proposed to be developed.
         B.   Proof of all of the landowner's ownership interest in the land to
be developed.
         C.   The density of land use to be allocated to parts of the area to
be developed.
         D.   The location, function, ownership and method of maintenance of
common open space.
         E.   The use, height, mass and location of buildings.
         F.   General locations of all streets, sidewalks, water supply,
sanitary waste, storm water and refuse disposal.
         G.   The substance of covenants, grants of easements or other
restrictions to be imposed upon the use of land and buildings, including
proposed easements for public utilities.
         H.   The provision for parking of vehicles, the location and width of
proposed streets and public ways and the relationship of proposed streets and
other public facilities to similar public facilities in proximity to the
proposed PURD.
         I.   The required modifications in the regulations otherwise
applicable to the subject property.
         J.   In the case of plans for developments to be carried out over a
period of years, a schedule listing the time periods within which applications
for final approval of all parts of the PURD are intended to be filed.
         K.   Elevation drawings showing exterior views and describing the
building materials of the proposed structures within the development.
         L.   A PURD may provide for private streets; however, no private
street will be accepted for later dedication to the public use unless these
streets are designed and constructed to City standards as approved by the City
Engineer.
         M.   A topographic map or aerial photograph of the site.
      (2)   Every application for tentative approval shall be delivered to the
staff of the Planning Division for its review and report to the Planning
Commission. As part of the review, the staff of the Planning Division shall
carry out consultations considered necessary on said application with the Fire,
Traffic, Public Works and other City or County Departments. The Planning
Division staff report shall be forwarded to the applicant not less than five
business days before the appointed date of the public hearing.
      (3)   Along with other information required for submittal for tentative
approval, the applicant must provide a written explanation addressing each of
the criteria identified in Section 1281.05(c), upon which the Planning
Commission will base its recommendation.
      (4)   Reservation of public open spaces may be required where deemed
necessary by the Planning Commission for preservation of historic sites and
scenic areas for a particular type of development proposed in a PURD, but not
anticipated in the Comprehensive Plan.
      (5)   Creation of buffer areas may be required by the Planning Commission
in areas where they are desirable to separate and protect residential
developments from adjacent commercial developments, highways, streets,
railroads, or any other use.
      (6)   It is recommended that an applicant for a PURD consult with the
staff of the Planning Division prior to submittal of an application for
tentative approval. The applicant is strongly encouraged to meet with the
Neighborhood Planning Council for the area in which the project is located, and
all neighbors surrounding such project to seek input and resolve any potential
conflicts, prior to the public hearing before the Planning Commission.
      (7)   A report of the comments or any action taken by the Neighborhood
Planning Council will be included and made a part of the Planning Division's
staff report and analysis prepared for the Planning Commission.
   (f)   Public Hearing.
      (1)   Public hearings and notice requirements shall comply with the
provisions of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, Public 110 of 2006, as amended,
being MCL 125.3101 et seq. (Refer to Section
1281.01(c), Section
1281.02).
      (2)   Within ninety days after the submission of an application for
tentative approval, a public hearing on said application shall be held by the
Planning Commission.
   (g)   Tentative Approval.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall, within thirty days following the
conclusion of the public hearing provided for in Section
1281.01(c), Section
1281.02, recommend to the City Commission to:
         A.   Grant tentative approval of the plan as submitted;
         B.   Grant tentative approval subject to specified conditions not
included in the plan as submitted; or
         C.   Deny tentative approval of the plan.
      (2)   Failure on the part of the Planning Commission to act within the
prescribed period of time shall be deemed to be a recommendation to the City
Commission to grant tentative approval of the plan as submitted unless the
prescribed period of time is extended in writing by the landowner.
      (3)   In the event tentative approval is recommended to the City
Commission, either of the plan as submitted or with conditions, the Planning
Commission shall, as part of its recommendation, stipulate the drawings,
specifications, comments, easements and conditions and recommend the necessity
for a bond to insure completion of required public improvements, and then may
stipulate the form and amount of such bond that shall be included with the
application for final approval.
   (h)   Status of Plan After Tentative Approval.
      (1)   Within five business days after the adoption of the resolution by
the City Commission, notice of approval, together with one certified copy of
the plan, shall be mailed to the landowner or the landowner's agent by the City
Clerk.
      (2)   Tentative approval of a plan shall be valid for one year from the
date of City Commission approval.
      (3)   In the event that a plan is given tentative approval and
thereafter, but prior to final approval, the landowner elects to abandon said
plan or shall fail to submit an application or applications for final approval
within the required time period, the tentative approval shall be deemed
revoked, and such action shall be noted in the records of the City Clerk.
      (4)   For good cause shown, and upon written application, the City
Commission may extend the period of approval for a PURD for a period up to six
months. The request for an extension shall be submitted at least thirty days
prior to the expiration date of the original approval resolution.
   (i)   Application for Final Approval.
      (1)   An application for final approval may be filed for all of the land
included in a plan or for part thereof. Said application shall be filed with
the Planning Division within one year of the original approval of the tentative
plan or any extension thereof. The application shall be submitted not less than
thirty days prior to the regular monthly meeting of the Planning Commission at
which the application is to be considered. The application shall include such
drawings, construction plans, specifications, covenants, easements and
conditions and form of bond as were required in the grant of tentative
approval. In accordance with the schedule proposed in the application for
tentative approval, the landowner may elect to have final approval of only a
section or sections of the land included in the plan and may delay, within the
time authorized by the tentative approval, application for the final approval
of other sections. An application for final approval shall include a
nonrefundable fee as identified in the “Fee, Bond and Insurance Schedule,” as
adopted from time to time by the City Commission pursuant to Section
802.24 of these Codified Ordinances.
      (2)   If a plan submitted for final approval is in substantial compliance
with the plan given tentative approval, a public hearing on an application for
final approval of the plan or section thereof shall not be required.
      (3)   A plan submitted for final approval shall be considered to be in
substantial compliance with the plan given tentative approval, provided that
any modification by the landowner of the plan tentatively approved complies
with the requirements of Section
1250.01(d) and does not (1) increase the proposed gross residential density or
intensity of use more than 10%, provided that the maximum density permitted by
the prescribed formula shall not be exceeded; (2) involve a reduction of the
area allocated for common open space; (3) increase by more than 10% the floor
area proposed for nonresidential use; or (4) increase by more than 5% the total
site coverage by buildings.
      (4)   Prior to consideration of the final plan by the Planning
Commission, the Department of Public Works staff shall review the plan and the
accompanying construction plans to determine the plan's conformance to
engineering specifications and improvements proposed in the tentative plan.
Planning Division staff shall also review the final plan and determine its
conformance or nonconformance with the lot layout, street design and other
proposals contained in the plan granted tentative approval. Both Departments
shall certify in writing approval or disapproval of the final plan for
consideration by the Planning Commission.
      (5)   A public hearing need not be held to consider modification in the
location and design of streets, water supply facilities, storm water drainage
or sanitary sewers.
      (6)   Although a public hearing shall not be held on an application for
final approval of a plan when said plan as submitted for final approval is in
substantial compliance with the plan as tentatively approved, the burden shall
nevertheless be upon the landowner to show good cause for any variation between
the plan as tentatively approved and the plan as submitted for final approval.
      (7)   When a final plan is in substantial compliance with the tentative
plan previously approved by the City Commission, the Planning Commission shall
prepare a report on the recommendations to the City Commission. The Secretary
of the Planning Commission shall sign the plan indicating the Commission's
approval of the same. The signed copies and recommendations shall then be
transmitted to the City Commission. A copy of the Planning Commission report
shall be retained in the files of the Planning Commission. The City Commission
shall review the final plan and report of the Planning Commission at a City
Commission meeting held within fourteen days of receipt of the report and
recommendation from the Planning Commission, and approve or disapprove the
final plan within thirty days.
      (8)   In the event that the plan as submitted for final approval is not
in substantial compliance with the plan as given tentative approval, the staff
of the Planning Division shall, within fifteen days of the date the application
for final approval is submitted, so notify the landowner in writing, setting
out the particular ways in which the plan is not in substantial compliance with
the plan as tentatively approved.
   (j)   Fees. A tentative plan submitted for consideration by the Planning
Commission shall include a nonrefundable fee for a special use permit as
determined from time to time by the City Commission and set forth in the “Fee,
Bond and Insurance Schedule”, pursuant to Section
802.24 of these Codified Ordinances.
   (k)   Design Standards. A PURD submitted under this chapter shall comply
with the design and improvement standards and requirements identified under
Section
1250.02(f) and Section
1250.02(g) of this Planning and Zoning Code.
   (l)   Variations.
      (1)   Variances, exceptions and/or modifications of design and
improvement requirements, or dimensional or use standards, may be made by the
City Commission in specific cases where it is deemed that conditions justify
such variance.
      (2)   Applications for variances to the design requirements shall be made
in writing at the time the tentative plan is filed for consideration with the
Planning Division. The application for a variance shall state fully the grounds
for the variance and all facts relied upon by the petitioner.
   (m)   Responsibility for Plans. It shall be the responsibility of the
landowner of every proposed PURD to have prepared, by a registered engineer, a
complete set of construction plans, including profiles, contours (topography),
cross sections, specifications and other supporting data for required public
streets, utilities and other facilities, for the area covered within each phase
of the development. This requirement is not intended to require complete
engineering plans for the entire development prior to receiving final approval;
however, no new phase of the development may commence prior to detailed
engineering plans being submitted for that phase, nor prior to the Engineering
Department granting approval to those plans. All construction plans shall be
prepared in accordance with the public improvement standards or specifications
set forth in Section
1281.04 Site Plan Review.
   (n)   Contracts for Public Improvements. The City Commission, before giving
approval to the final plan, shall require that a contract with the landowner be
drawn up, approved, and signed to ensure performance of the conditions which
will lead to the completion of all required public improvements deemed to be
necessary.
   (o)   Performance Bonds and Guarantees of Completion of Improvements.
      (1)   The City Commission may, as a condition of approval of a PURD,
require a cash bond, certified check, a surety bond, an irrevocable letter of
credit, or an escrow fund covering the estimated cost of improvements for the
completion of each final approved phase of the development. If a bond is
required, it shall be in a form approved by the City Attorney, in a sum of 100%
of the estimated cost of the work for each phase, and conditioned upon the
faithful performance of the work within the time specified. If required, then
it shall be deposited at the time of the issuance of the permit authorizing the
activity or project. The City may not require the deposit of the performance
guarantee until it is prepared to issue the permit. The City shall establish
procedures by which a rebate of any cash deposits in reasonable proportion to
the ratio of work completed on the required improvements shall be made as work
progresses.
      (2)   In the case where the landowner shall fail to complete the required
public improvement work within such time period as required by the conditions
or guarantee as outlined above, the City Commission may proceed to have such
work completed and reimburse itself for the cost thereof by appropriating the
cash deposit, certified check or surety bond, or by drawing upon the letter of
credit, or escrow fund, or shall take the necessary steps to require
performance by the bonding company.
   (p)   Common Open Spaces.
      (1)   The amount and location of common open space shall be consistent
with the declared function of the common open space as set forth in the
application for a PURD and the landowner shall be responsible for the
maintenance of the common open space in a manner acceptable to the City. Not
less than 25% of the land area in any PURD shall be identified as common open
space. Vehicular or pedestrian access shall be provided to all common open
space in a manner consistent with the purpose and use of such open space.
      (2)   The common open space may not be used for buildings, public or
private rights-of-way, or required parking for residential units. The common
open space shall be designed for the benefit and enjoyment of all residents of
the PURD, as well as to protect any environmentally sensitive lands. Not more
than 50% of the common open space may consist of land that is difficult to
utilize, such as wetlands or steep slopes, defined as greater than or equal to
25% slopes.
      (3)   The City may for its own interests accept the dedication of common
open space within a PURD for public use and benefit; however, the City shall
not, as a condition of approval, require that the land proposed for open space
be set aside for public use and benefit.
      (4)   In the event that the common open space is allowed to deteriorate
or is not maintained in a condition consistent with the plan as approved by the
City, then and in such event the City shall adopt the following course of
action:
         A.   In the event that the landowner, or any successive landowner,
shall at any time after establishment of the PURD fail to maintain the common
open space in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the plan, the
City may serve written notice upon the landowner setting forth the manner in
which he or she has failed to maintain the common open space in reasonable
condition, and said notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies of
maintenance be corrected within fifteen days of notification. If just cause is
demonstrated, the City may modify the terms of the original notice as to the
deficiencies and may grant an extension of fifteen days within which they shall
be corrected. If the deficiencies set out in the original notice or in the
modifications thereof shall not be corrected within said thirty days or any
extension thereof, the City, in order to preserve the taxable values of the
properties within the PURD and to prevent the common open space from becoming a
public nuisance, may enter upon said common open space and maintain the same
for a period of one year. Said entry and maintenance shall not vest in the
public any rights to use the common open space except when the same is
voluntarily dedicated to the public by the landowner. Before the expiration of
said year, the City shall, upon its initiative or upon the request of the
organization previously responsible for the maintenance of the common open
space, call a public hearing, upon notice to such organization, or to the
residents of the PURD, to be held by the City, at which hearing such
organization or the residents of the PURD shall show cause why such maintenance
by the City shall not, at the election of the City, continue for a succeeding
year. If the City shall determine that such organization is ready and able to
maintain said common open space in reasonable condition, the City shall cease
to maintain said common open space at the end of said year. If the City shall
determine such organization is not ready and able to maintain said common open
space in a reasonable condition, the City may, at its discretion, continue to
maintain said common open space during the next succeeding year and subject to
a similar hearing and determination in ensuing years.
         B.   The cost of such maintenance by the City shall be assessed
against the properties within the PURD that have a right of enjoyment of said
common open space, and shall become a tax lien on said properties. The City, at
the time of entering upon said common open space for the purpose of
maintenance, shall file a notice in the office of the City Assessor of such
lien upon the properties affected within the PURD.
   (q)   Recording Prerequisites Planned Unit Residential Developments. No PURD
located within the City shall be received or recorded by the County Register of
Deeds until it has received final approval and been signed by the Planning
Commission and the City Commission.
   (r)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with the provisions of this
chapter is responsible for a Class C Municipal civil infraction and shall be
subject to the civil fines provided by Section
202.98.
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall preclude or abrogate the availability
to the City of any other remedy available at law or in equity to prevent or
remedy a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 10-2020. Passed 11-24-20; Ord. 12-2023. Passed 10-17-23.)
1250.02 SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS.
   (a)   General Provisions.
      (1)   Short title. This Section of these Codified Ordinances shall be
known and may be cited as the "City of Battle Creek Subdivision Control
Ordinance" or the "Subdivision Regulations."
      (2)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of these Subdivision Regulations is
to regulate and control the subdivision of land within the City in order to
promote the safety, public health and general welfare of the community. These
Regulations are intended to:
         A.   Provide for the orderly growth and harmonious development of the
community;
         B.   Ensure adequate traffic circulation through coordinated street
systems with proper relation to major thoroughfares, adjoining subdivisions and
public facilities;
         C.   Provide for individual property lots of maximum utility and
livability;
         D.   Ensure adequate provision for water, drainage and sanitary sewer
facilities and other health requirements; and
         E.   Make provision for adequate recreational areas, school sites and
other public facilities.
      (3)   Authority. These Subdivision Regulations are enacted pursuant to
the statutory authority granted by the Land Division Act, Public Act 288 of
1967, as amended, being MCL 560.101 et seq., and the Certification of City and
Village Plats Act, Public Act 222 of 1943, as amended, being MCL 125.51 et seq.
      (4)   Interpretation; Conflict of Laws. These Subdivision Regulations
shall not apply to any lot forming a part of a subdivision created and recorded
prior to the effective date of these Regulations (Ordinance 10-2020, adopted on
November 24, 2020), except for further dividing of existing lots, nor is it
intended by these Regulations to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair
or interfere with existing provisions of other laws, ordinances or regulations,
or with private restrictions placed upon property by deed, covenant or other
private agreements, or with restrictive covenants running with the land to

initiated with the Planning Commission shall be referred to it for a report
thereon before any action is taken on the proposal by the City Commission.
      (6)   Separability. Should any section, clause or provision of these
Subdivision Relations be declared by the courts to be invalid, the same shall
not affect the validity of these Subdivision Regulations as a whole or any part
thereof other than the part so declared to be invalid.
   (b)   Administration, Enforcement and Penalty.
      (1)   Authority of Planning Commission.
         A.   These Subdivision Regulations shall be administered by the

         C.   Before recommending an ordinance or rule as described in
subsection B. above, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the
proposed ordinance or rule. The Planning Commission shall give notice of the
time and place of the public hearing not less than fifteen days before the
hearing by publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the City.
      (2)   Prerequisites for recording subdivisions. The Planning Commission
shall review and make recommendations on plats before action by the City
Commission under section 112 of the Land Division Act, Public Act 288 of 1967,
as amended, being MCL 560.112. No subdivision located within the City shall be
received or recorded by the County Register of Deeds until such subdivision has
received final approval and been signed by the Planning Commission and the City
Commission.
      (3)   Penalty; equitable remedies.
         A.   A person who violates or fails to comply with any of the
provisions of these Subdivision Regulations is responsible for a Class C
Municipal civil infraction and shall be subject to the civil fines provided in
Section
202.98.
         B.   Nothing contained in these Subdivision Regulations or in Section
202.98 shall prevent the Planning Commission, the City Commission or any other
public official or private resident from taking such lawful action as is
necessary to prevent or remedy a violation of any of the provisions of these
Subdivision Regulations.
   (c)   Subdividing and Platting Requirements.
      (1)   Subdivision of land; surveys and plats.
         A.   Any division of land which results in a subdivision shall be
surveyed and a plat thereof shall be submitted, approved and recorded as
required by these Subdivision Regulations.
         B.   Plats of retracement or boundary surveys made by a department or
agency of the United States or of State owned lands made by a department or
agency of the State for the retracement and division of public lands in
accordance with the survey instructions issued by the United States Department
of the Interior, may be recorded with the Register of Deeds of the county in
which the lands represented on such plats are situated and need not comply with
the Land Division Act and this section, except that the plat size shall be as
provided in the Land Division Act.
         C.   A survey and plat shall be made when any amendment, correction
alteration or revision of a recorded plat is ordered by a Circuit Court.
         D.   Urban renewal plats authorized by the governing body of a
municipality, as provided in the Blighted Area Rehabilitation Act, Public Act
344 of 1945, as amended, being MCL 125.71 et seq., shall conform to these
Subdivision Regulations.
      (2)   Replats; vacation required; exceptions. A replat of all or any part
of a recorded subdivision plat shall not be approved or recorded unless proper
court action has been taken to vacate the original plat or the specific part
thereof, with the following exceptions:
         A.   When all the owners of lots which are to be part of the replat
agree in writing thereto and record the agreement with the Register of Deeds,
together with proof that notice has been given to the abutting property owners
by certified mail, and the governing body of the municipality in which the land
included in the recorded plat is situated has adopted a resolution or other
legislative enactment vacating all areas dedicated to public use within the
proposed replat;
         B.   When the Assessor's plats are made, approved and recorded as
provided in the Land Division Act; and
         C.   When the urban renewal plats are authorized by the governing body
of the Municipality, as provided in Act 344 of the Public Acts of 1945, as
amended. Roads, streets, alleys and other public places shall be vacated in
accordance with the provisions of law.
   (d)   Procedures for Submission of Plats.
      (1)   Pre-application contact. The purpose of the pre-application stage
is to provide the subdivider with an opportunity to avail theirself of the
advice and assistance of the Planning Division and the many agencies involved
in subdividing, before the preparation of the preliminary plat and its
submission for approval, in order to save himself time and money and to make
the most of his opportunities. Nothing in this section shall be so construed as
to require any application contact. A subdivider may elect to begin subdividing
by submitting a primary plat in accordance with Section
1250.02 (d) (2) A.
      (2)   Preliminary plat procedures. Before making or submitting a final
plat for approval, the subdivider shall make a preliminary plat and submit
copies to authorities as provided in the Land Division Act.
         A.   Copies of preliminary plat.
            1.   The subdivider shall submit four copies of the preliminary
plat and other data to the City Clerk, one of which shall be on reproducible
material.
            2.   The City Clerk shall cause the submitted copies of the plat to
be forwarded to the Planning Commission for its study and approval. The
Planning Commission shall advise the City Commission of its recommendation
concerning the preliminary plat.
            3.   The Planning Commission shall function to coordinate the
requirements of all other City departments for inclusion in the plan, by
distributing the plan to those related departments involved in providing public
services as may be deemed necessary to any given plan. The Planning Commission,
in its report to the City Commission, shall advise the City Commission of these
elements of the plan.
         B.   Abstract of title. The subdivider shall submit an abstract of
title, certified to the date of the proprietor's certificate, which establishes
the recorded ownership interest of all parties of interest and which is
accompanied by an attorney's opinion based on such abstract as to the ownership
and marketability of title to the land or, in the alternative, the subdivider
shall provide a certificate of title insurance.
         C.   Notice of hearing. The Planning Commission shall not take action
on a proposed plat without affording an opportunity for a public hearing. A
plat submitted to the Planning Commission shall contain the name and address of
the proprietor or other person to whom notice of a hearing shall be sent. Not
less than fifteen days before the date of the hearing, notice of the date,
time, and place of hearing shall be sent to that person at that address by mail
and shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of
Battle Creek. Similar notices shall be mailed to the owners of land immediately
adjoining the proposed platted land.
         D.   Approval of Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall
recommend to approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the plat within
sixty-three days after the referral thereof to it. If applicable standards
under the Land Division Act, Public Act 288 of 1967, as amended, being MCL
560.101 et seq., and this chapter or published rules governing the subdivision
of land authorized under section 105 of that act, MCL 560.105, are met, then
the Planning Commission shall recommend approval of the plat. If the Planning
Commission fails to act within the required period, then such plat shall be
deemed to have been recommended for approval, and a certificate to that effect
shall be issued by the Planning Commission upon request of the proprietor. The
proprietor, however, may waive this requirement, in writing, and consent to an
extension of such period. The grounds for any recommendation of disapproval of
a plat shall be stated in the records of the Planning Commission.
         E.   Tentative approval.
            1.   The City Commission, within thirty days from the date of the
Planning Commission action, shall tentatively approve and note its approval on
the copy of the preliminary plat to be returned to the subdivider or set forth
in writing its reasons for rejection and requirements for tentative approval.
            2.   Tentative approval, under this section, shall confer upon the
subdivider, for a period of one year from its date, approval of lot sizes, lot
orientation and street layout. Such tentative approval may be extended if
applied for by the subdivider and granted by the governing body in writing.
         F.   Preliminary approval.
            1.   After tentative approval of the preliminary plat by the City
Commission, the subdivider shall:
               a.   Submit copies of the preliminary plat to all public
agencies, as required by the Land Division Act Subdivision Control Act;
               b.   Submit a list of all such authorities to the City Clerk,
certifying that the list shows all authorities as required by the Land Division
Act; and
               c.   Submit all approved copies to the City Clerk, after all
necessary approvals are obtained.
            2.   The City Commission, after receipt of the necessary approved
copies of the preliminary plat and after a report from the Planning Commission
certifying that all conditions and requirements imposed upon the plat at the
time of tentative approval have been complied with, shall, within twenty days
of receipt of the necessary data, consider and review the preliminary plat.
         G.   Effective period of approval. The granting of preliminary
approval by the City Commission shall be for two years from the date of
approval. Failure on the part of the subdivider to proceed under the provisions
of these Subdivision Regulations, in accordance with final plat procedures
within this two-year period, shall result in the automatic withdrawal of the
preliminary approval. If any portion of a preliminary plat has been finally
platted, the same shall constitute an automatic extension for two years. In
order to reinstate the preliminary plat, the subdivider must again proceed
through the pre-application and preliminary plat preparation and submittal
states, in accordance with these Subdivision Regulations, provided, however,
that the City Commission may make exception hereto and grant an extension.
         H.   Model homes. Construction of up to four model homes in a new
subdivision is permitted, but only under the following conditions:
            1.   The model shall be constructed on proposed lots and in
accordance with all conditions or regulations which would be in effect if the
final plat were recorded.
            2.   The final plat has been submitted to the Planning Commission
for approval.
            3.   No certificates of occupancy shall be issued until such time
as the plat has been recorded and all utilities and improvements have been
installed and accepted by the City.
      (3)   Final plat; application procedures and approval. The final plat
shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved by the Planning
Commission. If desired by the subdivider, the final plat may constitute only
that portion of the approved preliminary plat which he proposes to record and
develop at the time, provided that the approved preliminary plat comprises more
than twenty-five single or two-family lots or ten acres, whichever is less, or,
in the case of a multifamily, commercial or industrial development, more than
ten acres. The final plat shall conform to the provisions of the Land Division
Act.
         A.   Submittal. Prior to filing the final plat with the City Clerk for
transmittal to the City Commission, the subdivider shall submit to the Planning
Commission a written application for approval of the plat along with five
copies of the final plat and one set of the final construction plans, drawn on
linen or mylar (if the plans are to be drawn by the developer's engineer), and
two copies of any landscaping plans as may be required. Such application shall
be submitted not less than ten days prior to the regular monthly meeting of the
Planning Commission at which the application is to be considered.
         B.   Review. Prior to consideration of the final plat by the Planning
Commission, the City Engineer shall review the plat and the accompanying
construction plans to determine their conformity to engineering specifications
and improvement plans proposed in the preliminary plat. The Planning Division
shall also review the final plat application and determine its conformity or
nonconformity with the lot layout, street design and other proposals contained
in the approved preliminary plat. The City Engineer and the Planning Division
shall certify their approval or disapproval of the plat, in writing, and submit
it to the Planning Commission for its consideration.
         C.   Approval.
            1.   If the final plat is in substantial agreement with the
preliminary plat previously approved by the Planning Commission, the Planning
Commission shall prepare a report on its recommendations to the City
Commission. The Secretary of the Planning Commission shall sign the plat
indicating the Planning Commission's approval of the plat. The signed copies
and recommendations shall then be transmitted to the City Commission. A copy of
the Planning Commission's report shall be retained in the files of the Planning
Commission.
            2.   If the final plat does not conform to the street arrangement
and other aspects of the approved preliminary plat, or to preliminary utility
and facility plans, the Planning Commission shall prepare a report to the City
Commission setting forth the points at which the plat fails to conform to the
approved preliminary plat and recommending to the City Commission that it
disapprove the plat until the Planning Commission's objections have been
overcome. The plat and the accompanying report shall be forwarded immediately
to the City Commission. A copy of the report shall be retained in the files of
the Planning Commission.
            3.   A plat approved by the City Commission and recorded under
section 172 of the Land Division Act, Public Act 288 of 1967, as amended, being
MCL 560.172, shall be considered an amendment to the master plan and a part
thereof. The approval of the final plat by the City Commission does not
constitute or effect public acceptance of any street, rights of way, easements,
or other open space shown upon the plat.
      (4)   Fees. When the preliminary plat is submitted to the City Clerk
pursuant to Section
1250.02(d)(2)F., the subdivider shall deposit a filing fee as set forth in the
fee schedule enacted from time to time by the City Commission.
      (5)   City Commission approval. The City Commission shall review the
final plat and the report the Planning Commission at a City Commission meeting
held within fourteen days of receipt and approve or disapprove the final plat
within twenty days of the filing of the plat with the City Clerk by the
Planning Commission, in accordance with Section
1250.02 (d)(3)C. If approved, the plat shall then follow the procedures set
forth in the Land Division Act.
      (6)   Performance contract for public improvements.
         A.   The City Commission, before giving approval to the final plat,
shall require that a contract with a subdivider be drawn up, approved and
signed to ensure performance of the conditions which will lead to the
completion of all required public improvements. To ensure performance of such
contract, the City Commission may require financial security as provided in
Section
1250.02(g)(8).
         B.   The subdivider may elect to install or cause to be installed,
prior to the approval of the final plat, all or part of the required public
improvements. In such case, the subdivider shall, at the time of final plat
approval, provide financial security for any remaining public improvement
obligations.
         C.   Any improvements made to the property by the subdivider shall be
inspected by the Municipality for conformity with Municipal standards. Such
inspections shall be charged against the subdivider. These charges shall be
paid in full prior to the final plat approval.
      (7)   Submission of final plats to the County Plat Board. After the final
approval of the final plat has been given by the Planning Commission and the
City Commission, the City Clerk shall forward one copy, on mylar, of the final
plat, together with the required fee, to the County Plat Board.
   (e)   Specifications for Plans and Plats.
      (1)   Minimum information required in pre-application stage.
         A.   Since the pre-application stage is established to encourage

respective agencies as required in Section
1250.02 (d)(3)A. Such final engineering plans shall accompany the final plat.
   (f)   Design Standards.
      (1)   Conformity to the master plan. The proposed subdivision and its
ultimate use shall be in conformity with the master plan, as adopted, and shall
not encroach upon any area designated in such plan for future public use.
         Where such conflict appears and the land in question is otherwise
suitable for subdividing, the City Commission, or in the case of a school site,
the Battle Creek Public Schools or the Lakeview Public Schools, in its
tentative consideration, shall decide whether or not to implement such plan. If
the City Commission or a Board of Education elects to implement such plan, it
shall declare its intent to purchase the land within ninety days and shall
accomplish the acquisition within two years.
         Land which the Planning Commission has found to be unsuitable for
subdivision development due to flooding, poor drainage, soil conditions or
other features which are likely to be harmful to the health, safety and welfare
of future residents shall not be subdivided unless satisfactory methods of
correction are formulated by the subdivider and approved by the Planning
Commission.
         A street; square, park, playground, public way, ground or other open
space; or public building or other structure shall not be constructed or
authorized for construction in an area covered by a City master plan unless the
location, character, and extent of the street, public way, open space,
structure, or utility have been submitted to the Planning Commission by the
legislative body or other body having jurisdiction over the authorization or
financing of the project and has been approved by the Planning Commission. The
Planning Commission shall submit its reasons for approval or disapproval to the
City Commission. If the Planning Commission disapproves, then the City
Commission may overrule the Planning Commission by a vote of not less than 2/
3 of its entire membership. If the Planning Commission fails to act within
thirty- five days after submission of the proposal to the Planning Commission,
then the project shall be considered to be approved by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Floodplain development.
         A.   No building shall be located on any portion of a lot lying within
the floodplain, unless approved in accordance with the rules of the State
Waterways Commission.
         B.   The natural floodplain may be altered if its original discharge
capacity is preserved and the stream flow is not revised so as to affect the
riparian rights of other owners.
         C.   Alteration of any floodplain area shall be based upon a plan
approved by the Planning Commission and the State Waterways Commission.
      (3)   Streets right-of-way.
         A.   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of
all streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned
streets, to topographic conditions, to public convenience and safety and in
their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by
such streets.
         B.   Street right-of-way widths shall be designed in conformance with
current design policy guidance and standards published by the American
Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the National
Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO), or the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA).
         C.   Street right-of-way easements may be required to ensure adequate
access, utility service, circulation and parking in subdivisions.
         D.   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing street of
inadequate right-of-way width, additional width for the existing street may be
required in conformity with the standards outlined in subsection (f)(3)B.
hereof.
         E.   If the City Commission deems that additional rights of way is
necessary, it shall enter into an agreement to purchase the land within ninety
days and shall accomplish the acquisition within two years, except for
expressways and freeways.
         F.   Dedication of expressway and freeway rights of way shall not be
required. These rights-of-way may be reserved for public acquisition in
accordance with the Certification of City and Village Plats Act, being Act 222
of the Public Acts of 1943, as amended, being MCL 125.51.
         G.   Local streets shall be so arranged as to discourage their use by
through traffic. Curvilinear street design is recommended for residential
streets to discourage excessive speeds and to provide attractive vistas.
         H.   The street arrangement in a subdivision shall provide for the
continuation of existing streets in surrounding areas and shall provide for
suitable access to adjoining unplatted areas.
         I.   Where a proposed subdivision abuts or contains a major street, or
arterial, the Planning Commission may require marginal access streets, reverse
frontage lots containing a ten-foot nonaccess reservation with screen plantings
along the rear property line or such other treatment as may be necessary for
the adequate protection of residential properties and the separation of through
and local traffic.
         J.   Intersections on major or minor arterial streets shall be located
not less than 650 feet apart, measured from centerline to centerline, unless
the approved design allows for a lesser distance.
         K.   Where a proposed subdivision abuts or contains a railroad right
of way, expressway or other limited access highway, the Planning Commission may
require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right of
way at a distance suitable for the appropriate use, with due regard for the
requirements of approach grades for future bridge or grade separations.
         L.   Street intersections with centerline offsets of less than 125
feet are prohibited, except as provided in Section
1250.02(g)(9) and Section
1250.02(g)(10).
         M.   There shall be no private streets, lanes or ways platted in any
subdivision, except under the special design considerations mentioned in
Section
1250.02(g)(9).
         N.   Half streets are prohibited, except where unusual circumstances
make it essential to the reasonable development of a tract, in conformity with
these Subdivision Regulations, and where satisfactory assurance for dedication
of the remaining part of the street is provided. Whenever a tract to be
subdivided borders on an existing half or partial street, the other part of the
street shall be dedicated within such tract.
         O.   Dead-end streets are prohibited, except those designed as
permanent cul-de-sacs or those required for future access to adjacent unplatted
property. Temporary turnaround arrangements for dead-end streets which will be
extended in the future may be required by the Planning Commission.
         P.   Cul-de-sac streets shall be no longer than 600 feet and shall
contain, at the closed end, a turn-around having an outside road pavement
diameter of not less than 100 feet and a street property line diameter of not
less than 130 feet. Special consideration shall be given to longer cul-de-sac
streets under unusual conditions.
         Q.   Centerline street grades shall not be greater than 5% or less
than 0.5%, except as provided in Section
1250.02(g)(9) and Section
1250.02(g)(10).
         R.   To ensure adequate sight distance, horizontal and vertical curves
shall conform to current design policy guidance and standards published by the
American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the
National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO), or the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA).
         S.   Streets shall intersect one another at right angles or as nearly
at right angles as conditions permit. No street shall intersect another at an
angle of less than eighty degrees.
            1.   "T" intersections of minor streets are to be encouraged.
            2.   Multiple intersections involving the junction of more than two
streets are prohibited.
            3.   No minor street intersecting with a major street or
thoroughfare shall have a tangent section of the centerline less than fifty
feet in length starting at the property line of the major street.
         T.   No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused
with the names of existing streets within the area of jurisdiction of these
Subdivision Regulations. Street and subdivision names and house numbers shall
be subject to the approval of the City Assessor.
      (4)   Alleys, crosswalk and pedestrian ways.
         A.   Dead-end alleys are prohibited.
         B.   Crosswalks, pedestrian ways or utility easements may be required
where, in the judgment of the Planning Commission, they are necessary to
provide for safe and convenient access to schools, parks, shopping centers,
other community facilities or utility extensions.
      (5)   Easements; retention of one-foot reserves.
         A.   Easements shall be provided along rear, side and front lot lines
as necessary for utility services.
         B.   Where a proposed subdivision is traversed by a watercourse,
drainage way channel or stream, a drainage easement shall be provided in
accordance with the requirements of the City Engineer. Such easement shall be
shown on the final plan.
         C.   When a subdivision provides the entire road allowance width and
has lots on only one side, the subdivider shall be permitted to retain a one-
foot reserve, which reserve shall be released to the City when the respective
abutting property owners agree to pay to the subdivider fifty percent of the
costs of the services that normally would have been required had such owners
been parties to the subdivision. Such costs shall be paid at an interest rate
equal to the real estate market rate prevailing at the time of installation of
services and the development of the road. In the event of a dispute, the City
Commission shall be the final arbitrator.
      (6)   Lot dimensions and locations; flag lots.

to the provisions of the Zoning Code for the particular district in which the
subdivision is located.
         B.   Every lot shall abut upon and have permanent access to a public
street, provided that in subdivisions designed under conditions specified in
Section
1250.02(g)(9), this requirement may be modified or waived by the Planning
Commission.
         C.   Side lot lines shall be at approximately right angles or radial
to the street right-of-way lines.
         D.   The creation of flag lots is prohibited.
      (7)   Lot divisions. Lots, outlots and other parcels of land in a
recorded plat may be divided for the purposes of sale or lease for building
development, provided that the same is approved by the Planning Commission.
         A.   Procedures. Application for lot divisions shall be submitted in
writing to the Planning Division and shall be accompanied by a sketch drawn to
scale showing the original lot, the proposed division, all pertinent dimensions
and the proposed legal description.
         B.   Conformity to minimum size. The proposed divisions shall not
create lots which would be less than the minimum size required by these
Subdivision Regulations.
         C.   Violations. Violation of this section shall be sufficient cause
for denial of an application for a building permit.
      (8)   Natural features. The Planning Commission, wherever possible, shall
require the preservation of all-natural features which add value to the
proposed subdivision and the community at large, such as large trees, groves of
trees, watercourses, vistas, historic spots and features, wildlife habitats,
ecological areas and similar irreplaceable assets. The location, nature and
extent of such features should be identified in the initial procedures stage
and shall be made a part of subsequent plats to the greatest possible extent.
The preservation of such features may be made a condition of tentative approval
of the preliminary plat.
      (9)   Uninhabitable areas. Lands subject to flooding or otherwise deemed
uninhabitable in their natural state shall not be platted for residential use,
or for any other use that might create a danger to health, safety or property,
or that might increase the flood hazard within or outside the subdivision. Such
lands shall be set aside for recreational use or shall be retained in their
natural state as open space. However, such lands maybe platted and developed if
features making the land uninhabitable can reasonably be removed without
destruction of adjacent or nearby property or desirable natural features of the
land, and if approval is obtained from all the plat approval authorities
required to review plats under the Land Division Act and these Subdivision
Regulations. Areas of land within the proposed subdivision which lie either
wholly or partly within the floodplain of a river, stream, creek or lake, or
any other areas which are subject to flooding by storm water, shall be clearly
shown on the preliminary plat and the final plat.
      (10)   Public sites and open spaces. Where a site for a park, playground,
playfield, school, library, fire station or other public use is deemed
necessary by the Planning Commission to fulfill the objectives of the Master
Plan, the Planning Commission may recommend the reservation of such areas
within the subdivision. Upon determination by the respective public agency that
space for the public facility is required, the agency involved shall, within
ninety days, enter into an agreement to purchase the site. Acquisition of the
site shall be accomplished within two years.
      (11)   Variances. Variations, exceptions and/or modifications of these
design requirements may be made by the City Commission, in specific cases,
where it is deemed that conditions justify such a variance. An application for
a variance to the design requirements outlined in this chapter shall be made in
writing at the time the preliminary plat is filed for consideration with the
City Clerk. Such application shall state fully the grounds for the variance and
all facts relied upon by the petitioner.
   (g)   Improvements.
      (1)   Preparation of construction plans. The subdivider of every proposed
subdivision shall have prepared, by a registered engineer, a complete set of

streets, railroads or other land uses. Landscape plans shall be indicated on
the subdivider's improvement plans and are subject to the approval of the
Planning Division and the City Engineer.
      (8)   Guarantee of completion of public improvements.
         A.   Financial guarantee arrangements and exceptions. As a condition
of final plat approval, if prior to the actual installation of those public
improvements which the City has determined to be the responsibility of the
subdivider, the subdivider shall, pursuant to the Land Division Act, provide
financial security. The subdivider may elect one of the following:
            1.   Performance bond. A performance or surety bond to cover the
cost of the contemplated improvements, as estimated by the City or its agents,
shall be filed with the City Clerk. Such bond shall specify the time period in
which the improvements are to be completed and shall be with an acceptable
bonding company authorized to do business in the State.
            2.   Escrow fund. Cash or a certified check sufficient in amount to
cover the cost of the contemplated improvements, as estimated by the City or

project.
         B.   Failure of subdivider to complete improvements. If the subdivider
fails to complete the required public improvements work within such time period
as is required by the conditions or guarantees as outlined above, the City
Commission may proceed to have such work completed and shall reimburse itself
for the cost thereof by appropriating the cash deposit, certified check or
surety bond or by drawing upon the letter of credit, or shall take the
necessary steps to require performance by the bonding company.
      (9)   Commercial subdivisions. Where commercial developments for retail
sales, wholesale sales, business services, offices and similar establishments
fall within the definition of subdivision as set forth in the Land Division
Act, such development shall conform to these Subdivision Regulations, except
for modifications provided in this section. The development shall conform to
all Zoning Code requirements.
         A.   Streets. Streets shall conform to Section
1250.02(f)(3). All streets in a commercial subdivision shall be paved and shall
have curbs and gutters and underground storm drainage. Streets shall be

commercial subdivision shall have access from subdivision or frontage streets
and shall not open directly onto an arterial or other heavily traveled street.
         E.   Sidewalks. Sidewalks and pedestrian ways are required in
commercial subdivisions, except where the Planning Commission determines that
such facilities are not required for the safety and convenience of pedestrians
within or around the subdivision.
         F.   Greenbelts. A greenbelt area, at least fifty feet wide and
landscaped, shall be provided along the perimeter of a commercial subdivision
where such a subdivision is adjacent to a residential area. The Commission may
require the provision of a fence, wall or screen if it determines such is
necessary to protect the adjacent areas from litter, trespass and other
nuisances. Any intended future expansion of the commercial development should
be shown on the preliminary plat submitted for tentative approval.
      (10)   Industrial Subdivisions. Where industrial developments, consisting
of, but not limited to, manufacturing establishments, trucking and warehouse
facilities and similar activities, fall within the definition of subdivision as
set forth in the Land Division Act, such development shall conform to these
Subdivision Regulations, except for modifications provided for in this section.
The development shall conform to all Zoning Code requirements.
         A.   Streets. Streets shall conform to Section

1250.03 AIRPORT APPROACH OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICT.
   (a)   Short Title. This Section may be referred to and cited as the “the
Airport Approach Overlay Zoning District Ordinance of the City of Battle Creek”
or just “the Airport Approach Overlay Zoning Ordinance.”
   (b)   Purpose. It is hereby found that an obstruction has the potential for
endangering lives and property of users of the Battle Creek Executive Airport
at Kellogg Field and the property of occupants of land in its vicinity; that an
obstruction may affect existing and future instrument approach minimums of
Battle Creek Executive Airport at Kellogg Field; and that an obstruction may
reduce the size of areas available for the landing, take-off and maneuvering of
aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of Battle Creek
Executive Airport at Kellogg Field and the public investment therein.
Accordingly, it is declared that:
      (1)   The creation or establishment of an obstruction has the potential
of being a public nuisance and may injure the region served by Battle Creek
Executive Airport at Kellogg Field.
      (2)   It is necessary in the interest of the public health, safety and
general welfare that the creation or establishment of obstructions that are a
hazard to air navigation be prevented.
      (3)   The prevention of these obstructions should be accomplished, to the
extent legally possible, by the exercise of police power, without compensation.
   (c)   Enabling legislation. This chapter is adopted in accordance with the
requirements of Public Act 23 of 1950, as amended, and in conformity with the
section 203 of the Zoning Enabling Act, Public Act 110 of 2006, as amended,
being MCL 125.3203.
   (d)   Land Use and Height Regulations. Any development of property located
in the Airport Approach Overlay District shall comply with use and height
restrictions as adopted in the Airport Approach Plan, including any subsequent
revisions, by the Michigan Department of Transportation, Aeronautics Division,
for the Airport. This plan is composed of two maps and one explanatory sheet,
including the:
      (1)   FAA Part 77 Surface Map which details the maximum allowable height
for buildings and structures in the Airport Approach Overlay Zoning District.
      (2)   MDOT Bureau of Aeronautics land use zoning map for the airport
which outlines accident safety zones on and surrounding the airport where land
use planning and regulatory measures will be applied.
      (3)   Accident safety zones, land use guidelines and planning strategies
for new development which describe specific land use characteristics, land use
guidelines and land use planning strategies for each accident safety zone.
   (e)   Nonconforming Uses. The regulations prescribed in this chapter shall
not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change or alteration
of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective
date of this chapter or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a
nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the
construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or
alteration of which was begun prior to such effective date.
   (f)   Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, permit the growth of any tree or use property not in accordance with
the regulations prescribed in this chapter may apply to the Zoning Board of
Appeals for a variance from such regulations. Such a variance shall be allowed
only when it is found that a literal application or enforcement of the
regulations will result in practical difficulty and that the relief granted
will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air
navigation, will do substantial justice and will be in accordance with the
spirit of this chapter. Additionally, no application for such a variance may be
considered by the Board unless a copy of the application has been furnished to
the Airport Director of the City for advice as to aeronautical effects of the
variance. If the Director does not respond to the application within fifteen
days after receipt, the Board may act on its own to grant or deny such
variance.
(Ord. 10-2020.Passed 11-24-20.)
1250.04   FORM-BASED DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR THE T-3, T-4, AND T-5 DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Statement of Purpose. The purpose of the form-based development
standards is to create clear and simple regulations for the design of new
development or redevelopment within existing neighborhood commercial areas and
the historic downtown. The regulations of this section require development to
have a physical form that complements the historic nature of existing
development in the downtown Battle Creek and surrounding areas included in the
T-3, Neighborhood Commercial District, T-4, Downtown Commercial District and T-
5, Core Downtown Commercial Districts. Specifically, these regulations
encourage a pedestrian friendly and walkable character, permit a mixture of
land uses; encourage streets that serve the needs of pedestrians, bicycles, and
motorized vehicle traffic equitably; encourage places for informal social
activity and recreation in the downtown area; and encourage building frontages
that define the public space of streets. With proper physical form, a building
can accommodate a wide range of uses without generating undue impact on
neighboring properties or the downtown as a whole. It is further the purpose of
the form-based development standards to:
      (1)   Create a core downtown area that maintains the traditional physical
form of a historic downtown.
      (2)   Create unique, walkable mixed-use developments including
residential, retail, entertainment, office, and other compatible uses.
      (3)   Promote the orderly development, redevelopment, and continued
maintenance of Battle Creek's central business district.
      (4)   Encourage shared parking areas throughout the downtown area rather
than requiring each individual property owner to provide physical parking space
on their property.
      (5)   Create quantitative and qualitative building design guidelines that
ensure new development is compatible with the historic character existent in
downtown.
      (6)   Ensure buildings create a solid streetwall that helps to define
streets as public spaces.
      (7)   Ensure that permitted uses complement each other in terms of
character and location, and to ensure that uses in the T-3, T-4, and T-
5 Districts do not have an adverse impact on the overall economic and social
vitality of the downtown and neighborhood commercial areas, street capacity,
public utilities or services, or the overall image and function of the
districts.
      (8)   Prevent automobile-oriented development from eroding or destroying
the character of the downtown area.
      (9)   Encourage harmonious residential infill and adaptive reuse of
noteworthy buildings to provide a mix of housing types, unit sizes, and
compatible uses within walking distance of Battle Creek's historic downtown
area.
      (10)   Encourage accessible housing options in the downtown area.
   (b)   Existing development in the T-3, T-4, and T-5 Districts.
      (1)   Expansions of developed sites.
         A.   Changes in existing condition 25% or less. Any activity on a
developed site that would increase the floor area of the existing building by
25% or less need not comply with the requirements of this section. However, any
new building area or site improvements should result in the site being more
compliant, and shall not result in the site being less compliant with the
requirement of this section. Additionally, properties located in the T-
3 District, abutting on a residential district or adjacent to a residential
use, shall maintain a setback of 20 feet.
         B.   Changes in existing condition greater than 25%. Whenever a
building expansion of greater than 25% of the floor area is proposed, the
improvement activity shall comply with the requirements of this section.
However, any new building area or site improvements should result in the site
being more compliant, and shall not result in the site being less compliant
with the requirement of this section. Additionally, properties located in the
T-3 District, abutting on a residential district or adjacent to a residential
use, shall maintain a setback of 20 feet.
         C.   Expansions measured cumulatively. For the purposes of determining
compliance with this section, expansions shall be measured cumulatively, with
the baseline being the building area and improved site area that existed at the
date of adoption of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   Redevelopment. Redevelopment of existing buildings shall comply
with the Architectural Standards established in Section
1250.04(d).
         A.   Whenever 50% or less of the existing building will be demolished
or replaced, the development activity need not comply with the requirements of
this section. However, any site layout or building design changes that may
occur as a result of the development activity should result in the site being
more compliant with the requirements of this section.
         B.   Whenever more than 50% of an existing building will be demolished
or replaced, the development activity shall comply with all of the requirements
of this section.
   (c)   Waiver of Requirements.
      (1)   Purpose and limitations. For an activity in the T-3, T-4, and T-
5 Districts, the Planning and Zoning Administrator may grant a waiver from
certain dimensional requirements contained in this section. Regulations that
may be altered through the waiver process are described in the various
subsections of this section, along with the specific parameters by which the
regulation may be altered.
            Waivers are separate and distinct from dimensional variances in
that they are limited in their bounds and are intended to permit reasonable use
of property where the strict application of the requirements of this section
would not further the public purpose, and a relaxed or altered dimensional
standard will still meet the intent and purpose of the T-3, T-4, and T-
5 Districts.
            Whenever a regulation may be altered through the waiver process,
specific bounds are listed within which the waiver must be maintained. If an
alteration to a dimensional requirement is requested that is greater than that
listed in this section, the applicant must obtain a variance following the
procedures and review standards Section
1280.03, Zoning Board of Appeals.
      (2)   Application and review procedures. The applicant shall clearly
identify all requested waivers on the application and site plan. The reviewing
authority shall evaluate the requested waivers and approve, approve with
conditions, or deny the waiver request. In evaluating a waiver request, the
reviewing authority shall take into account the following considerations:
         A.   Approval of the waiver will not result in development that is
incompatible with or will negatively impact existing or potential future
development in the vicinity of the property to be developed.
         B.   The requested waiver is consistent with the intent and purpose of
this section.
         C.   The waiver will result in a superior development when compared
with what could be achieved through the strict application of the requirements
of this section.
         D.   A lesser waiver will not accomplish the same purpose as the
requested waiver.
         E.   The waiver will not negatively impact the potential of adjacent
parcels to develop according to the requirements of this section.
      (3)   Waivers from building design standards for new construction and
adaptive reuse. The Planning and Zoning Administrator may waive the above
requirements finding all of the following standards have been met:
         A.   The architectural design of the proposed structure is consistent
with the character of the surrounding area.
         B.   The architectural design otherwise meets the building design
standards of the T-3, T-4, and T-5 Districts.
         C.   The project brings the site more into compliance with the
building design standards for new construction and purpose of the T-3, T-4, and
T-5 Districts.
   (d)   Architectural Standards for New Construction and Adaptive Reuse.
      (1)   Frontage requirements. Buildings in the T-3, T-4, and T-5 Districts
shall comply with the following requirements, in addition to any applicable
requirements of Section 1241.02, Schedule of Regulations. The requirements of
this section and Section
1241.02 are intended to be complimentary; however, in any instance where there
is an apparent conflict, the provisions of this section shall control.
         A.   Private frontage. The private frontage is the area between the
right-of-way and the principal building façade. Buildings must contain
architectural elements consistent with one of the following four private
frontages. Each frontage is designed to be consistent with some or all of the
uses permitted in the T-3, T-4, and T-5 Districts. A sidewalk shall connect
each entrance into a private building to the parking area and to the public
right-of-way sidewalk.
               Note that the following table includes specific dimensional
requirements for each of the frontages. Unless otherwise noted, the dimensional
requirements are in addition to any other dimensional requirement of this
Section.

district where they are located. The proposed use shall be in harmony with or
beneficial to the surrounding uses and it must not do any of the following:
      (1)   Promote undue concentration of traffic throughout the day or at any
specific time-period that would be uncharacteristic or disruptive to the
surrounding uses.

recognized that there are some uses which, because of their very nature, have
serious operational characteristics, particularly when concentrated or when one
or more of them are located in near proximity to residential zones, thereby
having a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas. Regulation of these uses
through location is necessary to ensure that the adverse effects of such uses
will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding
neighborhood. The provisions of this chapter are intended to prevent a
concentration of these uses within any one area and to prevent deterioration or
blighting of nearby residential neighborhoods.
   (b)   Restrictions on Location. An adult business may be located in the city

the boundaries of the Dickman Road Business Improvement District established by
City Commission Resolution 351 on September 7, 1999.
      (2)   No adult business shall be located within 1,000 feet of another
adult business; within 1,000 feet of a church, school, or public park; or
within 300 feet of a residential or agricultural zoning district.
   (c)   Miscellaneous Requirements.
      (1)   The height, yard, lot area, lot width, building coverage, sign and
parking requirements of an adult business shall conform to the requirements for
the zone in which it is located.
      (2)   The distance between an adult business and a church, school, public
park, or a residential or agricultural zoning district shall be measured in a
straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the
property line of the adult business or building containing an adult business to
the nearest property line of the protected use or residential or agricultural
district.
      (3)   No person shall reside in or permit any person to reside in the
premises of an adult business.

therapist, duly licensed by the state, or to massage therapists licensed by the
State under Part 179A of the Public Health Code, MCL. 333.17951 et seq.
   (e)   Penalty; Equitable Remedies.
      (1)   A person who violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions
of this chapter is responsible for a Class F municipal civil infraction and
shall be subject to the civil fines provided in Section
202.98.
      (2)   Notwithstanding subsection (a) hereof, the city may employ any
remedy available at law or in equity to prevent or remedy a violation of any
provision of this chapter.

   (e)   General Provisions by Zoning District and Use.
      (1)   Agricultural Districts. No restrictions are imposed to limit the
size, type or location of fences in an agricultural district when used for
agricultural purposes.
      (2)    Residential Districts and properties used for residential purposes
regardless of zoning district. No fence in a primary and required secondary
front yard shall exceed four feet in height and no fence in any rear or side
yard shall exceed six feet in height.
      (3)   Commercial Districts.
         A.   No fence in a primary and required secondary front yard shall

displays, is contiguous to the principal use, and is not more than twenty feet
tall or up to height of building, whichever the lessor.
         B.   Fences, walls, and/or plantings of complete concealment type
measuring six feet in height shall be constructed at the common side or rear
lot line between all building and parking areas whenever a commercial or office
use abuts a residential zone or residential use regardless of what yard it is
in and shall be installed concurrently with the commercial or office use of
land or building. If the proposed concealment method includes materials other
than a fence, the proposed design of such concealment method shall be submitted
to the Community Services Department with a permit application for review and
approval by the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee.

type measuring six feet in height shall be constructed at the common side or
rear lot line between all buildings and parking areas whenever an industrial
use abuts a residential zone or residential use regardless of what yard it is
in and shall be installed concurrently with the industrial use of land or
building. If the proposed concealment method includes materials other than a
fence, the proposed design of such concealment method shall be submitted to the
Community Services Department with a permit application for review and approval
by the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee.
         C.   Storage yards for motor vehicles for salvage shall be governed by
Section
1251.22.
   (f)   Construction and Maintenance.
      (1)   Any fence or hedge, under construction or completed, which, through
lack of repair, neglect, type of construction, placement or otherwise, is a
hazard or endangers any person, animal or property, is hereby deemed a
violation of this code. A fence may not interrupt traffic patterns, parking
spaces, maneuvering lanes, drainage areas, or cause visibility obstructions to
cars or pedestrians at driveways and sidewalks.
      (2)   Fence posts must be set firmly in the ground and at a depth that
will support the structure of the fence.
      (3)   Fences may be constructed from wrought iron, vinyl, wood pickets,
stone, brick, chain link, or any other generally accepted fencing material. In
no instance shall a fence be constructed from pallets, twigs, pressed board,
plywood, scrap lumber or other nontraditional fencing material without the
Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee's approval.
      (4)   The owner of any fence shall maintain a fence by painting,
treating, trimming, repairing or removal, as necessary to maintain the fence in
a safe and reasonably attractive condition. A fence that is dangerous to public

      (1)   No fence erected within the City limits shall be electrically
charged in any manner unless the fence is buried beneath the ground unless
authorized or permitted elsewhere in this chapter.
      (2)   No fence shall be constructed of barbed wire, razor wire,
concertina strands, single wire, cattle fencing, or similar materials; provided
however that a fence which includes barbed wire strands may be used to enclose
hazardous materials or land uses, or where such additional security is
appropriate for land used for commercial or industrial purposes, in the
discretion of the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee, provided
that only three strands are used, not more than a total of nine inches in
height. Above ground electric fences and barbed wire fences are permitted for
agricultural purposes in an agricultural zone.
   (h)   Exceptions.
      (1)   The height and location restrictions of this chapter shall not
apply to schools, public recreation areas, public utilities, or any other use
that the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee deems necessary to
preserve the safety and protection of the public.
      (2)   Any conflict between this section and any ordinance, statute, or
regulation regarding fences around swimming pools shall be controlled by that
ordinance, statute, or regulation regarding swimming pools.
      (3)   Fences around public property and public and private recreation
areas to enclose tennis courts, basketball courts, schools, church playgrounds,

      (3)   Light trespass limits. Exterior lighting sources shall be designed,
constructed, located, and maintained in a manner that minimizes light trespass
onto neighboring properties. The light trespass from a property shall not
exceed 0.5-foot candles at the property line, measured five feet from the
ground. The light-emitting element of a light fixture shall not be directly
visible from neighboring properties, as this is the primary cause of glare. All
outdoor lighting in all use districts shall be directed toward and confined to
the ground areas of lawns or parking lots (see illustration above).
      (4)   Up-lighting. All up-lighting used for the external illumination of
buildings must be placed and shielded so as to not interfere with the vision of
persons off the property.
      (5)   Height. The height of light fixtures shall be measured from the
finished grade to the top of the fixture. All lighting fixtures in non-
industrial districts shall not exceed twenty-five feet in height. In industrial
districts, the Planning Commission may approve lighting fixtures up to a
maximum height of thirty-five feet if the proposed lighting over twenty-five
feet in height has no adverse impacts on the surrounding land uses and on the
natural environment.
   (b)   Prohibited Lighting.
      (1)   All illumination of outdoor features of a flashing, moving, or
intermittent type are prohibited.
      (2)   No outdoor recreational facility, public or private, shall be
illuminated after 11:00 p.m., except to conclude a permitted recreational or
sporting event or other activity already in progress prior to 11:00 p.m.
      (3)   The use of laser source light or any similar intensity light for
outdoor advertising or entertainment is prohibited.
      (4)   The operation of searchlights for advertising purposes is
prohibited.
   (c)   Exempt Lighting. The following exterior lighting fixtures and systems
are exempt from the regulations of this section. The Zoning Administrator
reserves the right to enforce standards to minimize glare, reduce light
pollution, and otherwise protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.
      (1)   Light fixtures placed by a governmental agency in the right-of-way.
      (2)   Decorative holiday lighting.
      (3)   Pedestrian walkway lighting.
      (4)   Temporary festival and civic lighting.
      (5)   Temporary construction or emergency lighting.
      (6)   Instances where federal, state, or local laws, rules, or
regulations take precedence over the provisions of this section.
   (d)   Waiver Process. The Planning Commission has the ability to waive the
lighting requirements of this section upon evidence that the required lighting
would have a negative impact on neighboring properties.
(Ord. 10-2020.Passed 11-24-20.)
1260.04 CLEAR VISION TRIANGLE AREA.
   (a)   Clear Vision Triangle Area. The area formed at the corner intersection
of two road right-of-way lines, the two sides of the triangular area being
twenty-five feet in length measured along the abutting right-of-way lines, and
the third side being a line connecting these two sides. The clear vision
triangle must be free from visual obstruction. See the figure below.

CHAPTER 1261
Parking, Loading and Access Management
1261.01   Parking requirements.
1261.02   Front yard and vacant lot parking.
1261.01 PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is intended to provide efficient
and safe access management and adequate parking areas for specific uses as well
as promote the efficient use of land. It also seeks to prevent the adverse
environmental impacts of large paved areas to the City.
   (b)   General Requirements.
      (1)   In all districts, except for in the T-4 and T-5 Zoning Districts,
off-street parking spaces shall be provided at the time a building is erected,
converted in use, or where floor space is increased by more than 10%, except as
otherwise provided in this chapter or unless otherwise approved by the Zoning
Administrator or their designee.
      (2)   Off-street parking spaces shall comply with this chapter,
Chapter 1262 Landscaping and Screening, and Section
1281.04 Site Plan Review, unless otherwise approved by the Planning and Zoning
Administrator or their designee.
      (3)   Required parking may be provided off-site on non-residential zoned
property on a lot or lots where there is a written lease or shared parking
agreement to accommodate parking, provided that such arrangement is approved by
the Zoning Administrator. Any lease or shared parking agreement must include a
provision that requires notification to the Planning and Zoning Administrator
or their designee of any change in terms of the agreement or expiration of the
agreement. Prior to approving the joint use of parking spaces to meet the
minimum amount of required off-street parking for a given use in a given
district, the Planning and Zoning Administrator must verify by a preponderance
of the evidence that each of the statements are true:
         A.   Off-site parking must be within a convenient walking distance of
the building entrances, as determined by the Planning and Zoning Administrator
or their designee.
         B.   The joint use of off-street parking spaces is unlikely to have a
need for the joint parking spaces at overlapping times.
         C.   The parking spaces designated for joint use comprise less than
75% of the applicant's minimum required off-street parking spaces.
      (4)   No commercial repair work, servicing or selling of any kind shall
be conducted on any required off-street parking area unless an approved use for
that district and only when the parking lot meets all minimum standards for
parking requirements.
   (c)   Design and Construction Requirements.
      (1)   Parking areas shall be designed and marked as to provide for
orderly and safe movement and storage of vehicles.
      (2)   There shall be provided, at the time a building is erected,
sidewalks along any street rights-of-way unless grade, topography,
connectivity, or other conditions exist that prohibits the installation of said
sidewalk, at the determination of the Zoning Administrator or their designee.
      (3)   Parking areas, including drives and maneuvering lanes (excluding
single-family, and two family uses), must maintain a minimum of a ten-foot
setback from any abutting street right-of-way and a five-foot setback from all
other abutting property lines. Where multi-family, office, commercial, or
industrial uses abut a residential zoning district, a ten-foot setback must be
maintained between any parking area or maneuvering lane from any abutting
property line. Required parking setbacks must be landscaped in accordance with
Chapter 1262 and screened in accordance with Section
1260.02.
      (4)   Adequate lighting shall be provided when a parking area is in
operation. All lighting shall be so arranged as to reflect light away from
residential property adjacent to the area and all abutting rights-of-way.
      (5)   An area equivalent to 10% of the required parking area must be
provided for snow storage. The snow storage area must be landscaped and if the
parking lot is bounded by a fence, the snow storage area must be located on the
parking lot side of that fence. The snow storage area may be located in a
landscape area required in
Chapter 1262 or in a storm water management area, subject to approval by the
Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee.
      (6)   All new parking spaces abutting buildings, walkways or landscaping
beds and islands shall be constructed with a concrete/ asphalt wheel stop or
curb installed at the front of the space to prevent unintentional encroachment
or furthering movement of the parked vehicle.
      (7)   Whenever a parking area with a capacity of four or more vehicles is
built, an existing building or parking area is increased by 10% surface area,
or parking lot mill and repave projects, such parking area must be laid out and
maintained in accordance with the following standards showing by way of an
approved site plan required by Section
1281.04 Site Plan Review:
         A.   Surfaces of all parking areas and drives must be surfaced with
asphalt, concrete, or other smooth, durable hard surface approved by the
Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee, installed at no less than
the minimum industry standards for thickness and weight rating.
         B.   All parking areas must be approved for stormwater drainage by the
Department of Public Works in accordance with the Stormwater Technical Manual
and be graded/sloped at minimum of 2% and maximum of 5% unless otherwise
approved by the Department of Public Works.
         C.   In addition to any other regulations required by the Michigan
Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices, aisle lane widths, parking space
width, and parking space lengths are to be provided as shown in the Table and
Figure below, unless otherwise approved by the Planning and Zoning
Administrator or their designee. All spaces must have adequate access by means
of aisles or lanes and not directly to a street. Aisles for access to all angle
parking spaces must have one-way movement only and must be clearly marked as
such.

   (d)    Rules for Calculating Required Number of Parking Spaces. In computing
the number of such spaces required, the following rules shall apply:
      (1)    Usable floor area (UFA). Parking calculations using usable floor
area means the total floor area enclosed by exterior walls, excluding such
areas that are not accessible or fit for occupancy including but not limited to
fixed stairways, ramps, escalators or elevators, bathrooms, or areas used for
storage.
      (2)   Bench seating. In stadiums, sports arenas, religious institutions,
and other places of assembly in which those in attendance occupy benches, pews,
or other similar seating facilities, each thirty inches of such seating will be
counted as one seat. In cases where a place of assembly has both fixed and non-
fixed areas, requirements shall be computed separately for each type and added
together.
      (3)   Employee calculations. For requirements stated in term of number of
employees, the calculation will be based upon the maximum number of employees
likely to be on the premises at one time and may include overlap of employees
during shift changes.
      (4)   Bicycle parking. A minimum of four bicycle parking spaces may be
provided in lieu of not more than one required automobile parking space in a
parking area required by this chapter, with a maximum reduction of up to five
automobile parking spaces. Bicycle parking spaces and racks must be located on
a paved surface, in a visible location from the nearest ROW, and as close as
practicable to the main entrance. Bicycle parking shall consist of a bicycle
rack designed such that the bicycle frame can be locked to the rack.
      (5)   Reserve space allowed. Where at the outset of development a parking
demand can be demonstrated that is less than or more than what is required by
this chapter, the difference can be placed in landscaped open space until such
time it may needed.
      (6)   Mixed uses. In the case of mixed uses, such parking spaces shall
equal the sum of the spaces required for each separate use. However, the
Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee may reduce the total number
of spaces by up to 30% if it is determined that the operating hours of the uses
do not overlap.
      (7)   Uses not specified. The parking space requirement for a use not
specifically mentioned herein shall be the same as required for a use of a
similar nature as determined by the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their
designee. In making their determination, the Planning and Zoning Administrator
or their designee shall refer to the most recent edition of the Parking
Generation, published by the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), or other
acceptable standard applicable for that use or a similar use.
      (8)   Off-street parking space minimums and maximums. Parking space
requirements and allowances (including those spaces designated for handicap
parking usage as required by the US Department of Justice) are listed by use in
the following Table of General Off-Street Parking Space Requirements. The
Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee may allow a reduction of
the following requirements if warranted by property conditions, or when the
requested adjustment is supported by the most recent edition of the ITE Parking
Generation or a parking study from a qualified engineer. Where fractional
spaces result, such parking spaces required shall be construed to be the next
nearest whole number.

   (f)   Ingress and Egress. The purpose of this section is to establish
guidelines for the location and design of driveways that can be used for new
construction in undeveloped areas and for redevelopment of existing developed
areas within the commercial (B-1, B-2, T-3, T-4, T-5, S) and industrial (I-
1 and I-2) districts. The objectives of these requirements are to reduce the
frequency of conflicts between vehicular movements and to increase the spacing
between conflict points, thereby providing motorists with increased decision
process time, which will increase safety and assure smoother traffic flow.
Plans for development shall meet the following standards unless otherwise
approved by the City Traffic Engineer or Planning and Zoning Administrator or
their designee:
      (1)   Turn prohibitions. Left turns may be prohibited to and/or from
driveways if any of the following circumstances exist: inadequate corner
clearance; inadequate sight distance; or inadequate driveway spacing.
      (2)   Relationship to opposing driveways. To the extent reasonably
possible, driveways shall be aligned with driveways on the opposite side of the
street.
      (3)   Sight distance. Adequate sight distance shall be ensured for all
vehicles exiting from a proposed development. If certain movements cannot be
made safely, then they shall be prohibited.
      (4)   Driveway permits. Prior to granting a building permit for any
construction involving a new or expanded driveway opening to a public street, a
permit for such driveway from the appropriate governmental entity having
jurisdiction over the roadway shall be obtained.
      (5)   Driveway spacing. The minimum spacing allowed between a proposed
driveway and all other driveways and streets located on the same side of the
street shall be as follows unless otherwise approved by the City Traffic
Engineer or Zoning Administrator or their designee:
 
MINIMUM DRIVEWAY SPACING REQUIREMENTS
Posted Legal Driving Speed Limit on the Street Which Minimum Spacing in Feet*
Adjoins or Abuts the Proposed Driveway
30 mph or less                                       125'
35 mph                                               175'
40 mph                                               225'
45 mph                                               275'
50 mph                                               300'
 
         * The above spacings are based on average vehicle acceleration and
deceleration rates (Federal Highway Administration, FHWA-H1-91-0212). The
spacing is measured from centerline to centerline of the driveways.
         In the event that a particular parcel or parcels lack sufficient road
frontage to maintain adequate spacing, the landowner(s) have one of three
options:
         A.   They may seek a waiver from the Planning and Zoning Administrator
or their designee for minimum spacing unless denial of the waiver would
prohibit access to the site. In no case shall the waiver be greater than the
next lowest classification. For example, on a forty-mph road requiring 225-foot
spacing, the distance may be reduced to no less than 175 feet, which is the
standard for a thirty-five-mph road facility; or
         B.   They may establish a common driveway with an adjacent landowner
that serves the subject property and the adjacent property. A recorded access
and maintenance easement for the driveway shall be provided to the City of
Battle Creek Planning Division.
         C.   Apply to the Zoning Board of Appeals for a dimensional variance
pursuant to Section
1280.03(d).
      (6)   Number of driveways per parcel.
         A.   Under normal circumstances a maximum of one driveway opening
shall be permitted to a particular parcel from any abutting street.
         B.   The Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee may
permit one additional driveway entrance along a continuous site with frontage
in excess of 330 feet and two additional driveway entrances along a continuous
site if driveway access volumes exceed 5,000 vehicles per day and frontage
exceeds 600 feet.
         C.   A dual-service (median-divided) driveway is considered to be one
direct access driveway.
         D.   Only one pair of one-way drives may be used per 250 feet of
street frontage.
      (7)   Driveway design.
         A.   Driveway width shall be sufficient for the particular use and
anticipated traffic flows. One-way drives shall be a minimum of sixteen feet
and a maximum of nineteen feet in width. Two-way drives shall be at least
twenty-five feet wide, but no greater than sixteen feet per lane.
         B.   For uses which generate exit volumes in excess of 100 vehicles
per hour or more than 5,000 vehicles per day, two exit lanes shall be provided
and clearly marked for left and right turns. Driveways shall be designed with a
minimum twenty-five-foot radius for inbound curbs and a minimum twenty feet for
out-bound curbs.
         C.   Unless written permission is obtained from adjacent property
owners, no portion of the driveway shall extend beyond the adjacent property
lines extended to the edge of the street.
      (8)   Corner clearance. The minimum corner clearance distance between the
centerline of a proposed driveway and the edge of the right-of-way of a nearby
cross street shall be 100 feet. Traffic movements into and out of a driveway
with a centerline located less than 150 feet from the edge of the right-of-way
of a signalized intersection may be limited to right turns into and out of the
driveway.
      (9)   Traffic impact studies. The Zoning Administrator or their designee
or the City Engineer may require a traffic impact study (TIS) for all
development proposals that it reviews. The TIS shall be accordance with and
meet the standards of the City. The TIS shall be submitted by the developer or
applicant to determine the potential future traffic conditions on adjacent
roadways once a proposed development is finished. TIS shall predict the peak-
hour operational conditions at site driveways and road intersections affected
by the development. The results of the TIS shall be used in the final design of
access points and internal circulation and may identify necessary off-site road
improvements. At a minimum, the TIS shall meet standards as published by the
Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) and MDOT in the handbook
titled Evaluating Traffic Impact Studies.
      (10)   Modification of standards for special situations. During site plan
review, the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee shall have the
authority to modify the standards of this section upon consideration of the
following:
         A.   The standards of this section would prevent reasonable access to
the site.
         B.   Access via a shared driveway or service/frontage road is not
possible due to the presence of existing buildings or topographic conditions.
         C.   Roadway improvements (such as the addition of a traffic signal,
center turn lane or bypass lane) will be made to improve overall traffic
operations prior to project completion, or occupancy of the building.
         D.   The use involves the redesign of an existing development or a new
use which will generate less traffic than the previous use.
         E.   The proposed location and design are supported by the Michigan
Department of Transportation (MDOT) or the Calhoun County Road Department as an
acceptable design under the existing site conditions. The Planning and Zoning
Administrator or their designee, or the City Engineer and their designee may
also request the applicant provide a traffic impact study to support the
requested access design.
         F.   Where there is a change in use or expansion at a site that does
not comply with standards of this Ordinance, the Planning and Zoning
Administrator or their designee shall determine the amount of upgrade needed in
consideration of the existing and expected traffic pattern and the capability
to meet the standards of this Ordinance to the extent practical.
   (g)   Off-Street Loading Facilities.
      (1)   In order to prevent undue interference with the public use of
streets, alleys, and public rights-of-way, off-street loading and unloading
areas must be provided for uses which customarily receive or distribute
material or merchandise by vehicles, subject to the following standards:
         A.   Loading areas must located on the same property of the building
it serves, and located only in the side or rear yard.
         B.   Each space shall not be less than twelve feet in width, thirty
feet in length, and provide at least fourteen feet of height clearance.
         C.   Each space shall be easily accessible from a street but have
adequate room in the off-street parking area in which to maneuver. In no
instances shall a public roadway be used to maneuver into or out of a loading
area.
         D.   Each space shall be surfaced with asphalt, concrete, or other
smooth, durable hard surface approved by the Planning and Zoning Administrator
or their designee, and installed at no less than the minimum industry standards
for thickness and weight rating.
         E.   If a loading area abuts any residential property, it shall be
suitably screened or fenced from view according to the requirements of Section
1260.02.
      (2)   The Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee may modify
this requirement during site plan review, to be less than twelve feet by thirty
feet if the minimum dimensions are impractical based on the use of the site or
the site cannot reasonably accommodate a loading space of twelve feet by thirty
feet. If a smaller loading area is approved, it must be the minimum dimensions
necessary to accommodate loading on the site. Where two adjacent uses can both
utilize one loading space, a joint loading space may be approved if there is
evidence that two deliveries will not be made simultaneously.

improved driveway or turnabout.
            1.   Such vehicles may have fixed connections to electricity and
water for cleaning purposes only.
            2.   In no circumstance shall any parking occur within twenty-five
feet of a corner property line at a street intersection or interfere with
vehicle or pedestrian visibility or movements.
         B.   Recreational vehicles and/or trailers may be parked or stored in
a side yard, on an improved surface approved by the Planning and Zoning
Administrator or their designee, not less than three feet away from a side lot
line and screened from adjacent property with a six-foot tall solid fence.
         C.   Recreational vehicles and/or trailers may be parked or stored in

CHAPTER 1262
Landscaping and Screening
1262.01   Purpose and intent.
1262.02   Required landscaping.
1262.03   Tree/landscape planting protection.
1262.04   Landscape elements.
1262.05   Size requirements.
1262.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.  
   The impact of urban development on the form, function and environment of the
City is significant. The following requirements are intended to ensure a high
level of quality development, maintain compatible relationships between land
uses, and to improve the overall appearance of all locations within the City.
Furthermore, it is the intent of this Chapter to eliminate large expanses of
paved parking areas and provide on-site natural areas for storm water to
collect and infiltrate into the ground. Bio-swales and rain gardens are
strongly encouraged. To this end, a detailed landscape plan showing the names,
both common and botanical, location, spacing, plantings, size of plantings to
be installed, and the location and type of all materials proposed to be
included in the landscape treatment areas, shall be submitted as part of site
plan approval submittal process of Section

1262.02 REQUIRED LANDSCAPING.
   (a)   Whenever any yard (front, side, or rear) of a use other than single or
two-family residential, is not designated for building, off-street parking,
loading or unloading, or other purpose required by the zoning district
requirements, such yard shall be improved with either natural or living
groundcover including grass, plant material, rocks, stones, mulch, etc.
   (b)   The proposed landscape plan shall integrate existing significant
trees, tree stands, and natural vegetation to the greatest extent possible and
shall be included in the minimum landscape requirements of this chapter as
determined by the Zoning Administrator.
   (c)   All existing and future landscaping shall be maintained in a
presentable condition and shall be kept free of refuse and debris. All existing
and future plants and living materials shall be maintained in a sound, noxious
weed-free, healthy and vigorous growing condition, free of plant disease and
harmful insects.
   (d)   All new parking lots subject to site plan review and approval in
accordance with Section
1281.04 shall provide and incorporate all of the following landscaping to the
extent possible:
      (1)   Interior parking lot landscaping. Interior tree plantings areas and
side and rear yard planting strips for multifamily residential, commercial, and
industrial activities shall be provided as follows:
 
Parking Lot Size by Space Landscaping Required by Location
0-10 spaces               Front and side yard planting strips
11-20 spaces              Front, side, and rear yard planting strips
21-40 spaces              Front, side, and rear planting strips; interior
                          islands
 
      (2)   Planting strips - rear and side. One deciduous canopy tree or
coniferous tree shall be planted in any unpaved area along the side and rear
property line, external to a parking area, at a rate of one tree per eight
parking spaces or one tree per thirty lineal feet of planting strip, whichever
is greater. Ornamental trees may be provided in lieu of canopy or coniferous
trees at a rate of one tree per six parking spaces or one tree per twenty
lineal feet of planting strip, whichever is greater. In addition, six deciduous
or coniferous shrubs shall be provided for each thirty lineal feet of planting
strip.
      (3)   Where the site abuts a public road right-of-way, the following
frontage landscaping shall be provided in the front yard area adjacent to the
road right-of-way (see example of frontage landscaping below):
 
Type of Landscaping         Minimum Required Landscaping
Deciduous or Evergreen Tree 1 per 30 linear feet of road frontage or fraction
                            thereof
Shrubs                      1 per 30 linear feet of road frontage or fraction
                            thereof
 
      The depth of the frontage landscaping area shall be sufficient to contain
the required landscaping and ensure the survivability of plant material. For
the purposes of computing length of road frontage, openings for driveways and
sidewalks shall not be counted. Trees and shrubs may be planted at uniform
intervals, at random, or in groupings. However, the Zoning Administrator may
require the planting design to use massing or groupings of materials to create
a stronger visual impact from the public right-of-way.
      Example of Frontage Landscaping
      Length of Road Frontage: 250 linear feet minus 30-foot driveway = 220
feet
      Required Number of Plants
         Deciduous or evergreen trees   220 ft./30 ft. = 7 deciduous or
evergreen trees
         Shrubs             (220 ft./30 ft.) = 7 shrubs
      TOTAL                7 deciduous or evergreen trees and 7 shrubs

      (4)   Interior tree planting areas. Interior tree planting areas must be
provided at a size equal to or greater than 10% of the overall parking lot
area. Interior islands must be surrounded by or contained by at least two sides
of parking lot. Multiple interior planting areas may be grouped or combined.

(Ord. 10-2020. Passed 11-24-20; Ord. 04-2021. Passed 4-13-21.)
1262.03 TREE/LANDSCAPE PLANTING PROTECTION.
   All landscaped areas shall be protected from the encroachment of vehicles by
way of curbing or parking block stops except when used as part of an approved
storm-water management plan as outlined in the Stormwater Technical Reference
Manual.
(Ord. 10-2020.Passed 11-24-20.)
1262.04 LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS.
   (a)   Quality. Plant materials shall be of generally acceptable varieties
and species, free from harmful insects and diseases, and hardy to Calhoun
County, Michigan. The American Standard for Nursery Stock should be used as a
reference to meet this requirement.
   (b)   Composition. A mixture of plant material, such as evergreens, and
deciduous trees, and shrubs are recommended as a protective measure against
insect and disease infestation. A limited mixture of hardy species is
recommended rather than a large quantity of different species to produce a more
aesthetic, cohesive design and avoid a disorderly appearing arrangement. No
more than 50% of landscape plant materials shall consist of any one species.
This requirement may be waived by the Zoning Administrator if written
documentation is received from a professional botanist, horticulturist, or
other applicable professional outlining justification of why this requirement
should be waived for a specific property.
   (c)   Existing Trees. Where existing trees are used to satisfy the
requirements of this chapter, the following requirements shall apply:
      (1)   Paving or other site improvements shall not encroach upon the
dripline of the existing tree(s) to be preserved.
      (2)   If existing plant material is labeled “to remain” on the site plan,
protective techniques, such as, but not limited to, fencing or barriers placed
at the dripline around the perimeter of the plant material shall be installed
during construction. No materials, vehicle or other construction equipment
shall be parked or stored within the dripline of any plant material intended to
be saved. Other protective techniques may be used provided such methods are
approved by the Zoning Administrator.
      (3)   In the event that healthy trees which are used to meet the minimum
requirements of this Zoning Code or those labeled “to remain” are cut down,
destroyed, damaged, or excavated at the dripline, as determined by the Zoning
Administrator, the contractor shall replace them with trees at a one-to-one
ratio: for example, for every inch in diameter of tree that is removed, one
inch diameter of new tree shall be planted; or, if one twenty-inch diameter
tree is removed: it shall be replaced with ten two-inch diameter trees, or
replaced with five four-inch diameter trees, as approved by the Zoning
Administrator.
   (d)   Installation, Maintenance and Completion.
      (1)   All landscaping required by this chapter shall be planted before
obtaining a certificate of occupancy or the appropriate financial guarantee may
be placed in escrow in the amount of the cost of landscaping to be released
only after landscaping is completed. A temporary certificate of occupancy may
be issued for projects needing additional time planting the approved
landscaping elements based on seasonal limitations.
      (2)   All landscaping and landscape elements shall be planted in a sound
workmanlike manner in accordance with accepted planting procedures.
      (3)   The owner of property required to be landscaped by this chapter
shall maintain such landscaping in a strong and healthy condition, free from
refuse, debris, and harmful insects. All materials used to satisfy the
requirements of this chapter which becomes unhealthy, diseased, damaged, or
dead, shall be replaced within one year (or the next appropriate planting
period, whichever comes first) of the onset of the unhealthy condition,
disease, damage, or death. All landscaped areas shall be provided with a
readily available and acceptable water supply as needed.
      (4)   Any plants, trees, shrubs or vegetation identified as an invasive
species by the Michigan Natural Features Inventory list of invasive species are
prohibited.
(Ord. 10-2020.Passed 11-24-20.)
1262.05 SIZE REQUIREMENTS.
   Where landscaping is required the following schedule sets forth minimum size
requirements for representative landscape materials:
 
Tree Type                  Minimum Height (H) or Caliper (C) at time of
                           Planting

   (a)   Except as otherwise prohibited by this section, billboards are
permitted in and limited to placement along in Agriculture, B-1, I-1 and I-
2 zoning districts when placed along a limited access highway or state trunk

also contains a freestanding sign.
   (b)   Billboards are subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   Such signs shall be placed no closer than 1,500 feet from any other
billboard sign on the same side of the right-of-way.
      (2)   Such signs shall not exceed 672 square feet of area when located on
or facing a limited access highway. When all other conditions are met for
placement, the setback from a limited access highway or highway shall not
exceed 300 square feet. When located on any primary highway as used in the
subsection, terms limited access highway and primary highway shall have the
same meaning as provided for as in the Highway Advertising Act Public Act of
1972, Public Act 106 of 1972, as amended, being MCL 252.301 et seq.
      (3)   Such signs shall not exceed thirty-five feet in height.

line, twenty feet from any street right-of-way, and 100 feet from any
residential, public or quasi-public structure.
      (5)   Such signs shall be maintained free of peeling paint or paper, sun-
fading, staining, rust or other conditions which impair the legibility,
supporting structures, frames, braces, guys and anchors of such signs shall be
maintained so as not to be unsafe or in a state of disrepair.
      (6)   Such signs shall not be illuminated other than by approved
electrical devices in accordance with
Chapter 1422 “Electrical Code.” Underground wiring shall be required for any
illuminated sign permitted under this section. Such signs shall not employ
flashing, blinking or oscillating lights. Any lighting shall be directed away
from adjacent properties, passing motorists and pedestrians.
   (c)   No billboard shall be erected at any time when there are seventy-five
or more billboard faces in the City. With Administrator approval, a sign owner
choosing to remove a legally nonconforming billboard may transfer the
billboard's square footage to a new billboard in another location in accordance
with this section.
   (d)   The City reserves all rights it is granted or permitted to regulate
signs pursuant to the Highway Advertising Act of 1972, Public Act 106 of 1972,
as amended, being MCL 252.301 et seq., and nothing in this subsection shall be
interpreted or construed to in any way limit the ability of the City to
regulate, restrict or limit the number and locations of billboards within the
City pursuant to the Home Rule City Act, Public Act 279 of 1909, as amended,
being MCL 117.1 et seq., and the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act (MZEA), Public

face. External lights shall have the source so obscure and shielded that no
direct rays from it are visible from a public right-of-way or from an abutting
property.
(Ord. 10-2020.Passed 11-24-20.)
1263.12 MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   Signs and sign structures must be well maintained with no signs of
damage or wear. The sign structure and related pertinence need to be safe. If
there are any defective parts, they need to be repaired or replaced, so the
structure is not considered dangerous to public health.
   (b)   Any sign structure left open with no sign or blank panel for over
ninety days shall be considered abandoned. If the sign or blank panel is
removed and the existing structure meets the current zoning regulations, it
shall be replaced by another sign or blank panel within those ninety days, or
it shall be considered abandoned pursuant to Section
1263.04(e). Any nonconforming sign that is abandoned is the responsibility of
the owner and shall be removed by such owner. If the owner fails to comply,
after receiving due notice, the Administrator may direct the sign to be removed
and assess the costs of removal against the property owner as a special
assessment for legally rendered City services, in accordance with Section
216.13 of the Administration Code.
   (c)   Any billboard that is a nonconforming sign may be maintained and
repaired so as to continue the useful life of the sign. However, under no
circumstances may nonconforming billboards be expanded, enlarged or extended.
Any nonconforming sign or sign structures substantially destroyed by fire, wind
or other casualty shall not be restored or rebuilt.

1263.13 MANDATORY SIGN REMOVAL.
   (a)   Emergency Conditions. Should the Administrator determine that a sign
is so dangerous that it requires immediate removal, he or she shall attempt to
provide the sign owner or property owner with a notice of the danger and the
need for immediate abatement. Due to the emergency nature of the danger, if
such notice is not possible due to the lack of knowledge as to the whereabouts
of the sign owner or property owner, or should the sign or property owner not
be available or refuse to immediately abate the nuisance, the Administrator
shall abate such nuisance. The cost of the abatement, including a service fee
of ten percent of the actual costs of such correction, shall become a lien
against the property in accordance with Section
216.13  of the Administration Code.
   (b)   Nuisance Abatement. Any other sign regulated by this charter that
fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter but which does not require
emergency action, shall also constitute a nuisance. The owner of such sign and
the real estate upon which it is located shall be given written notice of
thirty days by regular mail for the abatement thereof. If such abatement is not
accomplished within the 30-day period, the Administrator shall abate the
nuisance. The cost of such abatement, including a service fee of 10% of the
actual cost of such abatement, shall become a lien against the property in
accordance with Section
216.13  of the Administration Code.
   (c)   Remedies Cumulative. The action of the Administrator to abate a
nuisance under this section shall be in addition to the penalties described
elsewhere in this Zoning Code.
   (d)   Removal by Administrator. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Zoning Code, signs which are affixed in any manner to walls, fences, trees,
posts, bridges, utility poles, street signs or traffic signs, or otherwise
located in the public right of way may be removed by the Administrator and/or
their assigns and may be destroyed without notice to the violator.
1263.14 ABATEMENT OF NONCONFORMING SIGNS; NOTICE.
   The intent of this chapter is to abate nonconforming signs, except as
otherwise specifically set forth in this chapter, as rapidly as the police
power of the City permits. After the enactment of this chapter, the
Administrator or their designated agent shall, as soon as is practical, survey
the City for signs which do not conform to the requirements of this chapter.
Upon determining that a sign is nonconforming, the Administrator shall use
reasonable efforts to notify the owner of the sign, in writing, by regular U.S.
mail.
(Ord. 10-2020.Passed 11-24-20.)
1263.15 PENALTY; EQUITABLE REMEDIES.
   (a)   Unless otherwise specified, a person who violates or fails to comply
with any of the provisions of this Zoning Code is responsible for a Class C
Municipal civil infraction and shall be subject to the civil fines provided in
Section
202.98.
   (b)   A person who violates any of the provisions of this Zoning Code that
causes an imminent threat to the public health or safety shall be subject to an
Order to Correct setting forth a deadline to abate the violation. A person who
fails, after receiving notice, to timely correct a condition that causes an
imminent threat to the public health or safety is guilty of a misdemeanor and
shall be subject to the penalty provided in Section
202.99.
   (c)   A sign which is not erected or maintained in accordance with this
chapter is deemed to be unlawful and a nuisance. Nothing in this section shall
preclude or abrogate the availability to the City of any other remedy available
at law or in equity to prevent or remedy a violation of any of the provisions
of this Zoning Code.

is occasioned thereby.

1280.01 OBJECTIVES; AUTHORITY OF CITY COMMISSION.
   The principal objective of this Zoning Code is to provide for the orderly
arrangement of compatible buildings and land uses and for the proper location
of all types of uses required for the social and economic welfare of the City.
To accomplish this objective, each type of use is classified as permitted in
one or more of the various districts established by this Zoning Code. However,
in addition to those uses specifically classified and permitted by right in
each district, there are certain additional uses which may be necessary or
desirable to allow because of their unusual characteristics or the service they
provide to the public. These special uses require particular consideration as
to their proper location in relation to adjacent established or intended uses
or to the planned development of the community. Such uses include:
   (a)   Uses either municipally operated or operated by publicly regulated
utilities or traditionally affected by public interest; and
   (b)   Uses entirely private in character which, because of their peculiar
locational needs or the nature of the service they offer to the public, may
have to be established in a district in which they cannot reasonably be allowed
as a permitted use under this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 10-2020.Passed 11-24-20.)
1280.02 PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)   Establishment; Powers and Duties. The City Planning Commission,
heretofore created in accordance with the Michigan Municipal Planning Act,
Public Act 285 of 1931, repealed and replaced by the Michigan Planning Enabling

Commission may be ex officio members. Except as provided in this subsection, an
elected officer or employee of the local unit of government is not eligible to
be a member of the Planning Commission.

shall be appointed for three-year terms or until their successor takes office.
      (4)   The membership of a Planning Commission shall be representative of
important segments of the community, such as the economic, governmental,
education, and social development of the local unit of government, in
accordance with the major interests as they exist in the local unit of
government, such as agriculture, natural resources, recreation, education,
public health, government, transportation, industry and commerce. The
membership shall also be representative of the entire geography of the local
unit of government to the extent practicable.
      (5)   Members of a Planning Commission shall be qualified electors of the
local unit, except that one Planning Commission member may be an individual who
is not a qualified elector of the City.
      (6)   Members of the Planning Commission shall serve as such without
compensation.
   (c)   Removal of Members; Conflict of Interest.
      (1)   The City Commission may remove a member of the Planning Commission
for misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office upon written charges and
after a public hearing.
      (2)   Before casting a vote on a matter on which a member may reasonably
be considered to have a conflict of interest, the member shall disclose the
potential conflict of interest to the Planning Commission. The member is
disqualified from voting on the matter if so provided by the bylaws, or a
majority vote of the remaining members of the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Failure of a member to disclose a potential conflict of interest as
required by this subsection constitutes malfeasance in office.
      (4)   The Planning Commission shall define conflict of interest in its
bylaws.

term shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as provided for

resolutions, transactions, findings and determinations, which records shall be
a public record. It shall also make an annual written report to the City
Commission concerning its operations and the status of planning activities,
including recommendations regarding actions by the City Commission related to
planning and development.

1280.03 ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS.
   (a)   Powers; Membership; Compensation.
      (1)   The Zoning Board of Appeals for the City, having been heretofore
created in accordance with Public Act 207 of 1921, repealed and replaced by the
Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, Public Act 110 of 2006, as amended, being MCL
125.3101 et seq., is hereby continued and, in addition to the general duties
and powers conferred upon it by law, may exercise such powers as are conferred
upon it by the Charter and this Zoning Code. The Board shall be organized as
provided in this chapter.
      (2)   The word “Board,” when used in this Zoning Code, shall be construed
to mean the Zoning Board of Appeals. The Board shall consist of seven members
appointed by a majority vote of the City Commission. The members shall serve
for terms as follows: Two for one year, two for two years and three for three
years, in the first instance, and thereafter all appointments shall be for
three years each, except for members serving because of their membership on the
Planning Commission and/or the City Commission, whose terms shall be limited to
the time they are members of those bodies. One regular member of the Board may
be a member of the City Planning Commission. The remaining regular members of a
Zoning Board of Appeals, and any alternate members under subsection (3) below,
shall be selected from the electors of the City of Battle Creek residing within
the City of Battle Creek. The members selected shall be representative of the
population distribution and of the various interests present in the City of
Battle Creek. One regular or alternate member of the Board may be a member of
the City Commission; however, such a member shall not serve as Chairperson of
the Board. The Chairperson of the Board shall be elected annually by the
members of the Board. Vacancies shall be filled by the City Commission for the
unexpired term. A successor shall be appointed not more than one month after
the term of the preceding member has expired. A vacancy on the Board shall be

original appointment.
      (3)   The City Commission may appoint, in accordance with procedures
specified in this Zoning Code, not more than two alternate members for the same
term as regular members of the Board. The alternate members may be called, as
specified in this Zoning Code, to sit as regular members of the Board if a
regular member is absent from or unable to attend two or more consecutive
meetings, or for a period of more than thirty consecutive days. An alternate
member may also be called to serve for the purpose of reaching a decision on a
case in which the regular member has abstained because of a conflict of
interest. The alternate member appointed shall serve in the case until a final
decision has been made. The alternate member shall have the same voting rights
as a regular member of the Board.
      (4)   An employee or contractor of the City Commission may not serve as a
member of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
      (5)   The City Commission may remove a member of the Board for
inefficiency, misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office upon written
charges and after a public hearing. A Board member shall disqualify theirself
from a vote in which the member has a conflict of interest. Failure of a member
to disqualify theirself from a vote in which the member has a conflict of
interest constitutes malfeasance in office.
      (6)   The Board shall not conduct business unless a majority of the
regular members of the Board are present.

Commission or the City Commission shall not participate in a public hearing on,
or vote on the same matter that the member voted on as a member of the Planning
Commission or the City Commission. However, the member may consider and vote on
other unrelated matters involving the same property.
   (b)   Meetings; Rules of Procedure; Records.
      (1)   Meetings of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be held at the call
of the Chairperson and at such other times as the Board in its rules of

meetings shall be open to the public. The Chairperson or, in their absence, the
acting Chairperson may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses.
      (2)   The Board shall adopt its own rules of procedure and maintain a
public record of its proceedings which shall be filed in the office of the City
Clerk.
   (c)   Appeals to Zoning Board of Appeals.
      (1)   An appeal may be taken to the Zoning Board of Appeals by a person
aggrieved or by an officer, department, board, or bureau of this state or the
City. In addition, a variance in the zoning ordinance, may be applied for and
granted under section 4 of the Uniform Condemnation Procedures Act, Public Act
87 of 1980, being MCL, 213.54, and as provided for under the Michigan Zoning
Enabling Act. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall state the grounds of any
determination made by the Board.
      (2)   Such appeal shall be taken within such time as is prescribed by the
Board by general rule, by filing with the body or officer from whom the appeal
is taken and with the Zoning Board of Appeals a notice of appeal, specifying
the grounds for the appeal. The body or officer from whom the appeal is taken
shall immediately transmit to the Board all of the papers constituting the
record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
      (3)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator or their designee certifies to
the Board, after the notice of appeal has been filed, that by reason of facts
stated in the certificate a stay would, in the Zoning Administrator's opinion,
cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the proceedings shall
not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, all of the papers
constituting the record upon which the appeal was taken.
      (4)   The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of an appeal
and notice shall be given as provided in Section
1281.01(c)(2).
      (5)   At a hearing under this section, a party may appear personally or
by attorney. The Zoning Board of Appeals may reverse or affirm, wholly or
partly, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination and may
issue or direct the issuance of a permit.
      (6)   Fees, in accordance with a schedule enacted from time to time by
the City Commission, by resolution, shall be paid to the Department at the time
the notice of appeal is filed.
   (d)   Jurisdiction, Voting Requirements for Determinations.
      (1)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the following powers:
         A.   To hear and decide questions that arise in the administration of
the zoning ordinance, including the interpretation of zoning maps;
         B.   To hear and decide on matters referred to the Board or upon which
the Board is required to pass under a zoning ordinance.
         C.   To hear and decide appeals from and review any administrative
order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative
official or body charged with enforcement of this Zoning Code; and
         D.   To grant exceptions in the following instances:
            1.   Permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of
a district divided a lot held in single ownership at the time of passage of
this Zoning Code (Ordinance 10-2020, adopted on November 24, 2020);
            2.   Interpret this Zoning Code in such a way as to carry out the
intent and purpose of the zoning district map, where the street layout existing
on the ground varies from that shown on the map;
            3.   Permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which
has been damaged by explosion, fire, act of God or the public enemy, to the
extent of more than 50% of its insurable value, where the Board finds some
compelling necessity requiring a continuance of the nonconforming use, and the
primary purpose of continuing the nonconforming use is not to continue a
monopoly; and
            4.   Waive or reduce the parking and loading requirements in the
multiple dwelling, commercial or industrial districts whenever the character or
use of the building is such as to make unnecessary the full provision of
parking or loading facilities, or where such regulations would impose an
unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lot, as contrasted with merely
granting an advantage or convenience. The Board may waive or reduce the
requirements of off-street parking whenever any property lies within a 300-foot
radius of a publicly owned parking lot.
      (2)   The Board shall have the authority to grant the following
variations:
         A.   Nonuse. If there are practical difficulties for nonuse variances
relating to the construction, structural changes, or alterations of buildings
or structures related to dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance or to
any other nonuse-related standard in the ordinance in the way of carrying out
the strict letter of the zoning ordinance, then the Board may grant a variance
so that the spirit of the zoning ordinance is observed, public safety secured,
and substantial justice is done. The Board may impose conditions as otherwise
allowed under the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act; and
         B.   Use. If there is an unnecessary hardship in the way of carrying
out the strict letter of the zoning ordinance, then the Board may grant a use
variance in accordance with this section, so that the spirit of the zoning
ordinance is observed, public safety secured, and substantial justice done. The
Board may impose conditions as otherwise allowed under the Michigan Zoning
Enabling Act.
      (3)   Variance standards. In consideration of all appeals and proposed
exceptions to or variations from this Zoning Code, the Board shall, before
making any such exceptions or variations, in a specific case, first determine
that the applicant has met all of the following conditions as set out for the
specific type of variance requested:
         A.   Nonuse (dimensional) variances.
            1.   When it can be shown that a practical difficulty would, in
fact, exist if the strict non-use requirements of this Zoning Code (e.g., lot
area, width, setbacks, building height, etc.) were applied to a specific
building project, the Board may grant a variance from these requirements. The
practical difficulty from a failure to grant the variance must include
substantially more than a mere inconvenience or a mere inability to attain a
higher financial return.
            2.   The practical difficulty must be exceptional and peculiar to
the subject parcel of land which do not generally exist throughout the City and
may not be self-imposed or the result of an earlier action by the applicant. If
the parcel of land could be reasonably built upon in conformance with the
requirements of this Zoning Code by simply relocating or redesigning the
structure(s), then a variance shall not be granted.
            3.   A variance shall not be granted when it will alter or conflict
with the intent of this Zoning Code considering the public benefits intended to
be secured by this Zoning Code and the rights of others whose property would be
affected by the allowance of the variance.
            4.   Any variance granted shall be the minimum necessary to provide
relief for the practical difficulty of the applicant.
         B.   Use Variances.
            1.   The building, structure or land cannot be reasonably used in a
manner consistent with the uses allowed in the zoning district in which the
property is located.
            2.   The condition or situation of the specific piece of property
or the intended use of the property is unique to that property and not commonly
present in the general vicinity or zoning district. Unique conditions or
situations may include exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of the
property that existed when the applicable zoning ordinance provision took
effect: exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation on
the land, building, or structure: or the use or development of the property
immediately adjoining the property in question; or any other physical situation
on the land, building or structure deemed by the Board to be extraordinary.
            3.   The proposed use, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or the intent of the master plan.
            4.   The immediate hardship cited as the cause for the variance was
not created by any affirmative action by the applicant.
   (e)   Finality of the Decision of Board; Appeal to Circuit Court.
      (1)   The decision of the Board shall be final. A party aggrieved by the
decision may appeal to the Calhoun County Circuit Court. The burden of proof
shall be on the appealing party.
      (2)   The Circuit Court shall review the record and decision to ensure
the decision meets all of the following requirements:
         A.   Complies with the constitution and laws of the state.
         B.   Is based upon proper procedure.
         C.   Is supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on
the record.
         D.   Represents the reasonable exercise of discretion granted by law
to the Board.
      (3)   If the Circuit Court finds the record inadequate to make the review
required by this section or finds that additional material evidence exists that
with good reason was not presented at the hearing before the Board, then the
Court shall order further proceedings on conditions the Court considers proper.
The Board may modify its findings and decision as a result of the new
proceedings or may affirm the original decision. The supplementary record and
decision shall be filed with the Court. The Court may affirm, reverse, or
modify the decision. The Court may make other orders as justice requires.
      (4)   An appeal from a decision of the Board shall be filed within thirty
days after the Board issues its decision in writing signed by the chairperson,
if there is a chairperson, or signed by the members of the Board if there is no
chairperson, or within twenty-one days after the Board approves the minutes of
its decision.

      (1)   Petitions for zoning ordinance amendments; or
      (2)   Conditional rezonings.
   (c)   Amendment Review Procedures. The amendment, be it a text or a map
amendment, and application materials shall be prepared in accordance with the
provisions of this section, and shall be reviewed in accordance with the
following procedure. Amendments or application materials that do not meet the

proposed amendment and application materials shall be distributed to
appropriate City departments and divisions and staff for review and comment.
The proposed amendment and application materials may also be distributed to
applicable outside agencies and designated City consultants for review.
      (2)   Public hearing. A public hearing shall be held for all proposed
amendments in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Michigan Zoning
Enabling Act, Public Act 110 of 2006, as amended, being MCL 125.3101 et seq.,
as summarized below:
         A.   On any amendment to this Zoning Code, the Planning Commission
shall hold a public hearing prior to the amendment being referred to the City
Commission for action. A record of the comments received at the public hearing
shall become a part of the Planning Commission report and recommendation to the
City Commission. The following requirements shall pertain to public hearings
held before the Planning Commission:
            1.   Not less than fifteen-day notice of the date, time and place
of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City.
            2.   Not less than fifteen-day notice of the date, time and place
of the hearing shall be given, by regular mail, to each public utility company
and to each railroad company owning or operating any public utility or railroad
within the City that registers its name and mailing address with the City Clerk

            3.   Not less than fifteen-day notice shall be given, by regular
mail, to the owners of property that is the subject of the request. Notice
shall also be given to all persons to whom real property is assessed within 300
feet of the subject property affected by the amendment, as listed in the most
current assessment roll and to the occupants of all structures with 300 feet of
the subject property regardless whether the property or structure is located in
the zoning jurisdiction. Notification need not be given to more than one
occupant of a structure, except that if a structure contains more than one
dwelling unit or spatial area owned or leased by different persons, one
occupant of each unit or spatial area shall be given notice. If a single
structure contains more than four dwelling units or other distinct spatial
areas owned or leased by different persons, then notice may be given to the
manager or owner of the structure, who shall be requested to post the notice at
the primary entrance to the structure.
            4.   The notice under subsection 3. above is considered to be given
when personally delivered or when deposited during normal business hours for
delivery with the United States postal service or other public or private
delivery service. The notice shall be given not less than fifteen days before
the date the request will be considered. If the name of the occupant is not
known, then the term “occupant” may be used for the intended recipient of the
notice. However, failure of property owners to receive such notice, shall not
invalidate the amendment.
            5.   A notice under this section shall do all of the following:
               a.   Describe the nature of the request.
               b.   Indicate the property that is the subject of the request.
The notice shall include a listing of all existing street addresses within the
property. Street addresses do not need to be created and listed if no such
addresses currently exist within the property. If there are no street
addresses, then other means of identification may be used.
               c.   State when and where the request will be considered.
               d.   Indicate when and where written comments will be received
concerning the request.
            6.   For any group of adjacent properties numbering eleven or more
that is proposed for rezoning, the requirements of above subsection iii), and
the requirement of above subsection 5.b., that street addresses be listed do
not apply to that group of adjacent properties.
      (3)   Planning Commission consideration of proposed amendment. The
Planning Commission shall review the proposed amendment, together with any
reports and recommendations from staff, consultants, other reviewing agencies,
and any public comments. The Planning Commission shall identify and evaluate
all factors relevant to the petition, including the appropriate criteria listed
in this section, and shall report its findings and recommendation to the City
Commission.
      (4)   City Commission action on proposed amendment. Upon receipt of the
report and recommendation from the Planning Commission, the City Commission may
approve or deny the proposed amendment. If determined to be necessary, the City
Commission may refer the amendment back to the Planning Commission for further
consideration. In the case of an amendment to the official zoning map, the City
Commission shall approve or deny the amendment, based upon its consideration of
the criteria contained in this Zoning Code.
         A.   The City Commission, upon receipt of the Planning Commission
study and report, shall publish a notice indicating the proposed amendment,
proposed use and affected property in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City. Such notice shall be published at least five days before the City
Commission meeting, and shall indicate the time, date and place of such
meeting.
   (d)   Standards of Review for Amendments. In considering any petition for an
amendment to the text of this Zoning Code or to the zoning map, the Planning
Commission and City Commission shall consider the following criteria that apply
to the application in making findings, recommendations, and a decision. The
Planning Commission and City Commission may also take into account other
factors or considerations that are applicable to the application but are not
listed below.
      (1)   Consistency with the goals, policies and objectives of the master
plan and any sub-area plans. If conditions have changed since the master plan
was adopted, consistency with recent development trends in the area shall be
considered.
      (2)   Consistency with the basic intent and purpose of this Zoning Code.
      (3)   The capability of the street system to safely and efficiently
accommodate the expected traffic generated by uses permitted in the requested
zoning district.
      (4)   The capacity of the City's utilities and services are sufficient to
accommodate the uses permitted in the requested district without compromising
the health, safety, and welfare of the City.
      (5)   That conditions have changed since the Zoning Code was adopted or
there was an error in the Zoning Code that justifies the amendment.
      (6)   That the amendment will not be expected to result in exclusionary
zoning or spot zoning.
      (7)   If a rezoning is requested, compatibility of the site's physical,
geological, hydrological and other environmental features with the uses
permitted in the proposed zoning district.
      (8)   If a rezoning is requested, compatibility of all the potential uses
allowed in the proposed zoning district with surrounding uses and zoning in
terms of land suitability, impacts on the environment, density, nature of use,
traffic impacts, aesthetics, infrastructure and potential influence on property
values.
      (9)   If a rezoning is requested, the boundaries of the requested
rezoning district will be reasonable in relationship to surrounding zoning
districts, and construction on the site will be able to meet the dimensional
regulations for the requested zoning district.
      (10)   If a rezoning is requested, the requested zoning district is
considered to be more appropriate from the City's perspective than another
zoning district.
      (11)   If a rezoning is requested to allow for a specific use, rezoning
the land is considered to be more appropriate than amending the list of
permitted or special land uses in the current zoning district to allow the use.
      (12)   If a rezoning is requested, the requested rezoning will not create
an isolated or incompatible zone in the neighborhood.
   (e)   Notice of Adoption of Amendment. Following adoption of an amendment by
the City Commission, one notice of adoption shall be filed with the City Clerk
and one notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City within fifteen days after adoption, in accordance with the Michigan Zoning
Enabling Act, Public Act 110 of 2006, as amended, being MCL 125.3101 et seq. A
record of all amendments shall be maintained by the City Clerk. A Zoning Map
shall be maintained by the City Clerk, which shall identify all map amendments.
The required notice of adoption shall be maintained by the Planning and Zoning
Administrator and include all of the following information:
      (1)   In the case of a newly adopted Zoning Ordinance, the following
statement: "A zoning ordinance regulating the development and use of land has
been adopted by the City of Battle Creek."
      (2)   In the case of an amendment(s) to the existing Zoning Ordinance,
either a summary of the regulatory effect of the amendment(s), including the
geographic area affected, or the text of the amendment(s).
   (f)   Referendum.
      (1)   Within seven days after publication of the Zoning Ordinance, a
registered elector residing in the zoning jurisdiction of the City may file
with the City Clerk a notice of intent to file a petition under this section,
in accordance with Section 401 of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, Public Act
110 of 2006, as amended, being MCL 125.3401.
      (2)   If a notice of intent is filed under subsection (1) above, the
petitioner shall have thirty days following the publication of the zoning
ordinance to file a petition signed by a number of registered electors residing
in the zoning jurisdiction of the City not less than 15% of the total vote cast
within the zoning jurisdiction for all candidates for governor at the last
preceding general election at which a governor was elected, with the City Clerk
requesting the submission of the zoning ordinance or part of the zoning
ordinance to the electors residing in the zoning jurisdiction of the City for
their approval, in accordance with Section 402 of the Michigan Zoning Enabling
Act, Public Act 110 of 2006, as amended, being MCL 125.3402.
      (3)   Whenever there is a conflict between this section of the Zoning
Ordinance or the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, Public Act 110 of 2006, as
amended, being MCL 125.3101 et seq., shall govern.
   (g)   Conditional Rezoning.
      (1)   Intent. The Planning Commission and City Commission recognize that,
in certain instances, it would be an advantage to both the City and to a
property owner seeking rezoning if the property owner proposes certain
conditions and limitations as part of a petition for rezoning. Therefore, it is
the intent of this section to provide a process consistent with the provision
of Section 405 of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, Public Act 110 of 2006, as
amended, being MCL 125.3405, to permit property owners to offer conditions
regarding the use and/or development of land as part of the rezoning request.
It is the further intent of this Zoning Code to accomplish, among other things,
the objectives of the zoning ordinance and the master plan to achieve
integration of the proposed land development project with the characteristics
of the surrounding area.
      (2)   Definitions. The following definitions shall apply in the
interpretation of this Section:
         A.   “Rezoning Conditions” shall mean conditions regarding the
development and use of property proposed by the applicant and approved by the
City as part of an approval under this section, including review and
recommendation by the Planning Commission.
         B.   “Rezoning with Conditions Agreement” shall mean a written
agreement approved and executed by the City and property owner setting forth
the conditions attached to the rezoning pursuant to MCL 125.3405 (as amended)
and any other terms mutually agreed upon by the parties relative to land for
which the City has approved a rezoning with conditions.
         C.   “Rezoning with Conditions Plan” shall mean a plan of the property
which is the subject of a rezoning with conditions, prepared by a Michigan
licensed civil engineer or architect, that may show the location, size, height,
design, architecture or other measure or feature for and/or of buildings,
structures, improvements and features on, and in some cases adjacent to, the
property. The details to be offered for inclusion within the rezoning with
conditions plan shall be determined by the applicant, subject to approval of
the City Commission after recommendation by the Planning Commission.
         D.   “Rezoning” shall mean the amendment of this Zoning Code to change
the zoning map classification on property from its existing district to a new
district classification.
      (3)   Authorization and eligibility.
         A.   The standards of this Section shall grant a property owner the
option of voluntarily proposing conditions for the development and use of
property in connection with a submission of a petition seeking a rezoning. Such
conditions may be proposed at the time the application for rezoning is filed,
or at a subsequent point in the process of review of the proposed rezoning.
         B.   In order to be eligible for consideration of a rezoning with
conditions, a property owner must propose a rezoning of property to a new
zoning district classification, and must, as part of such proposal, voluntarily
offer certain site-specific conditions (to be set forth in a rezoning with
conditions agreement) that are more strict or limiting than the regulations
that would apply to the land under the proposed new zoning district. Such
conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
            1.   The location, size, height or other measure for and/or of
buildings, structures, improvements, setbacks, landscaping, buffers, design,
architecture and other physical features of the proposed development.
            2.   Specification of maximum density or intensity of development
and/or use, expressed in terms fashioned for the particular development and/or
use. For example: units per acre, maximum usable floor area, or hours of
operation.
            3.   Preservation of open space, natural resources and/or natural
features.
            4.   Improvements to address traffic issues, including paving,
substantial improvements to or funding of improvements to major roads to the
benefit of the entire City.
            5.   Site improvements such as signage, lighting, landscaping,
building materials for the exterior of some or all structures above and beyond
what would otherwise be required by City ordinance.
            6.   Limitations on permissible uses of the property.
            7.   Any other conditions that may be voluntarily proposed by the
property owner.
      (4)   Application and review procedures.
         A.   Application.
            1.   At the time of making application for amendment of this Zoning
Code seeking a rezoning of property, or at a later time during the process of
City consideration of such rezoning a property owner may submit a complete
application for approval of a rezoning with conditions to apply in conjunction
with the rezoning.
            2.   The application, which may be amended by the applicant during
the process of consideration, shall specify the rezoning conditions proposed by
the applicant, recognizing that rezoning conditions shall not authorize uses or
development not permitted in the district proposed by the rezoning.
            3.   An application for a rezoning with conditions shall include a
rezoning with conditions agreement (“the agreement”). The agreement shall set
forth the rezoning conditions and may incorporate a rezoning with conditions
plan.
            4.   The application shall include a notarized signature of the
property owner indicating that the conditions attached to the rezoning are
voluntarily offered.
         B.   Planning Commission review.
            1.   The proposed rezoning with conditions shall be noticed for
public hearing before the Planning Commission as a proposed legislative
amendment of the zoning ordinance.
            2.   Following the public hearing, and further deliberations as
deemed appropriate by the Planning Commission, the Planning Commission shall
make a recommendation to the City Commission on the proposed rezoning with
conditions.
         C.   City Commission review. Upon recommendation by the Planning
Commission, the City Commission shall make a final determination to approve or
deny the rezoning with conditions as offered by the applicant. The City
Commission may only consider the conditions offered by the applicant, and may
not attach any other conditions to the rezoning other than those offered by the
applicant. The City Commission's deliberations shall include, but not be
limited to, a consideration of the review criteria for a rezoning with
conditions.
      (5)   Review criteria. A rezoning with conditions shall only be approved
if it meets the following requirements and standards:
         A.   The proposed rezoning with conditions will further the goals and
objectives of the city master plan.
         B.   Rezoning conditions shall not authorize uses or development not
permitted in the district proposed by the rezoning (and shall not permit uses
or development expressly or implicitly prohibited in the rezoning with
conditions agreement).
         C.   The use of the property in question shall be in complete
conformity with all regulations governing development and use within the zoning
district to which the property is proposed to be rezoned, including, without
limitation, permitted uses, lot area and width, setbacks, height limits,
required facilities, buffers, open space areas, and land use density; provided,
however, the following shall apply:
            1.   Development and use of the property shall be subject to the
more restrictive requirements shown or specified in the rezoning with
conditions agreement, and/or in other conditions and provisions set forth in
the rezoning with conditions agreement required as part of the rezoning with
conditions approval. Such rezoning with conditions agreement shall supersede
all inconsistent regulations otherwise applicable under the zoning ordinance.
            2.   As part of the grant of final approval of a rezoning with
conditions, the City Commission shall be authorized to grant modifications to
the strict terms of the zoning ordinance governing dimensional requirements on
the property; provided, such authorization to grant modifications shall be
conditioned upon the City Commission finding that each zoning ordinance
provision sought to be modified will result in an enhancement of the
development that would be in the public interest, and that approving the
modification would be consistent with the city master plan and compatible with
the surrounding area.
         D.   The proposed rezoning with conditions will result in integration
of the proposed land development project with the characteristics of the
project area, and result in an enhancement of the project area as compared to
the existing zoning, and such enhancement would be unlikely to be achieved or
would not be assured in the absence Of the use of a rezoning with conditions.
         E.   As compared to the existing zoning and considering the site-
specific conditions and/or land use proposed by the applicant, it would be in
the public interest to grant the rezoning with conditions. In determining
whether approval of a proposed application would be in the public interest, the
benefits which would reasonably be expected to accrue from the proposal shall
be balanced against and be found to clearly outweigh the reasonably foreseeable
detriments, taking into consideration reasonably accepted planning,
engineering, environmental and other principles, and also taking into
consideration the special knowledge and understanding of the City by the City
Commission and Planning Commission.
         F.   The proposed conditions will not preclude future zoning and
planning actions by or on behalf of the municipality.
         G.   Existing and available public services will be capable of serving
proposed or potential development that will occur as a result of the rezoning
with conditions without negatively impacting the delivery of public services to
other properties in the City, or the conditions will ensure that public
services will be sufficient to serve both the site and other properties in the
City.
         H.   The offered condition(s) are beneficial to the public good and
likely to be enforceable.
         I.   The condition does not have the same effect as a use variance.
         J.   The proposed conditions do not relieve the applicant of the
responsibility of securing any applicable site plan, plat, condominium, or
special land use approvals.
      (6)   Effect of approval. Approval of the rezoning with conditions and
rezoning with conditions agreement confirms only the rezoning of the property,
subject to any conditions reflected in the rezoning with conditions agreement
and after recordation as set forth in subsection (8) below. Any applicable site
plan, plat, condominium, special land use, or variance approvals shall be
required before any improvements to the property may be undertaken.
         If approved, the zoning district classification of the rezoned
property shall consist of the district to which the property has been rezoned,
accompanied by a reference to “CR Rezoning with Conditions”. The zoning map
shall specify the new zoning district plus a reference to “CR” e.g., the
district classification for the property might be “B-1, Corridor Commercial
District (CR, Rezoning with Conditions)”, with a zoning map designation of “B-
1/CR.” Use of the property so classified and approved shall comply with the
conditions set Forth in the rezoning with conditions agreement. No development
or use of the land inconsistent with the conditions of the rezoning with
conditions agreement shall be permitted.
      (7)   Compliance with conditions.
         A.   Any person who establishes a development or commences a use upon
land that has been rezoned with conditions shall continuously operate and
maintain the development or use in compliance with all of the conditions set
forth in the rezoning with conditions agreement. Any failure to comply with a
condition contained within the rezoning with conditions agreement shall
constitute a violation of this Zoning Code and shall be punishable accordingly.
Additionally, any such violation shall be deemed a nuisance per se and subject
to judicial abatement as provided by law.
         B.   No permit or approval shall be granted under this Zoning Code for
any use or development that is contrary to an applicable rezoning with
conditions agreement.
      (8)   Period of approval.
         A.   The rezoning with conditions and agreement shall expire after a
period of one year from the effective date of the rezoning unless substantial
progress towards obtaining site plan and other required approvals has been
made, and shall expire after a period of two years unless development of the
property is substantially begun within such two year period and proceeds
diligently and in good faith as required by ordinance to completion.
         B.   In the event substantial progress towards obtaining site plan and
other required approvals has not commenced within one year and bona fide
development has not commenced within two years from the effective date of the
rezoning, the rezoning with conditions and the rezoning with conditions
agreement shall be void and of no effect.
         C.   The property owner may apply for a one year extension two times.
The request must be submitted to the Planning Division before the approval time
limit expires. The property owner must demonstrate why the extension should be
granted, and must also demonstrate that there is a strong likelihood that the
development or use will commence within the period of extension and proceed
diligently thereafter to completion, and if the City Commission finds that
there has not been a change in circumstances that would render the rezoning
with conditions incompatible with adjacent or nearby use and zoning of land or
is otherwise inconsistent with sound zoning policy.
            An extension request shall be considered by the City Commission
following a recommendation by the Planning Commission.
         D.   If the rezoning with conditions becomes void in the manner
provided in this section, the following procedures shall apply:
            1.   The property owner may seek a new rezoning of the property
within thirty days of the expiration of the period of approval.
            2.   If no application is made for a new rezoning of the property,
the land shall revert to its former zoning classification as set forth in MCL
124.3405(2) (as amended). The City Commission shall direct the Planning
Commission to proceed with consideration of rezoning the land to its former
zoning designation following the standard rezoning procedures set forth in this
Zoning Code.
            3.   Until such time as a new zoning district classification of the
property has become effective, no development shall be undertaken or permits
for development issued.
      (9)   Rezoning with conditions agreement requirements. A rezoning with
conditions agreement shall be executed between the applicant and the City at
the time of City Commission approval of a rezoning with conditions.
         A.   Rezoning with conditions agreements shall, at a minimum, contain
all of the following items:
            1.   Identification of the requested zoning district and a listing
of the conditions offered by the applicant.
            2.   A statement acknowledging that the rezoning with conditions
was proposed by the applicant, and, further agreement and acknowledgment that
the conditions and rezoning with conditions agreement are authorized by all
applicable state and federal law and constitution, and that the agreement is
valid and was entered into on a voluntary basis and represents a permissible
exercise of authority by the City.
            3.   Agreement and understanding that the property in question
shall not be developed or used in a manner inconsistent with the rezoning with
conditions agreement.
            4.   Agreement and understanding that the approval and rezoning
with conditions agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
property owner and City, and their respective heirs, successors, assigns, and
transferees.
            5.   The date upon which the rezoning with conditions becomes void,
as specified in Section
1281.01(g)(8). If the City Council grants an extension of approval, a new
rezoning with conditions agreement with the new expiration date shall be
recorded.
            6.   Agreement and understanding that, if a rezoning with
conditions becomes void in the manner provided in Section
1281.01(g)(8), no development shall be undertaken or permits for development
issued until a new zoning district classification of the property has been
established.
            7.   Agreement and understanding that each of the requirements and
conditions in the rezoning with conditions agreement represents a necessary and
reasonable measure which, when considered with all other conditions and
requirements, is roughly proportional to the increased impact created by the
use represented in the approved rezoning with conditions, taking into
consideration the changed zoning district classification and the specific use
authorization granted.
            8.   A legal description of the property affected by the rezoning
with conditions.
            9.   Development regulations affected by the conditions of
rezoning, including but not limited to density, setbacks, height, site
coverage, signs, parking, architecture, etc.
            10.   Revocation of approval provisions returning the property to
its original zoning designation if the developer violates the terms of the
agreement.
         B.   A rezoning with conditions plan may be included as an exhibit to
the agreement. The rezoning with conditions plan may show the conceptual layout
of the proposed development or use, along with any other information deemed
relevant by the applicant. Inclusion of a rezoning with conditions plan as an
exhibit to a rezoning with conditions agreement shall not replace the
requirement for preliminary and final site plan, subdivision, condominium,
special land use or variance review and approval.
      (10)   Amendment of rezoning with conditions agreement. Amendment of a
rezoning with conditions agreement shall be proposed, reviewed and approved in
the same manner as a new rezoning with conditions.
      (11)   Recordation of rezoning with conditions agreement. A rezoning with
conditions shall become effective following publication in the manner provided
by law, and, after recordation of the rezoning with conditions agreement,
whichever is later. All rezoning with conditions agreements shall be recorded
with the Calhoun County Register of Deeds.
      (12)   Termination. The City Commission shall be the only body with the
authority to terminate a rezoning with conditions agreement. The consideration
to terminate the agreement shall be for reasons of expiration of the agreement,
discovery of false information upon which the initial approval was based, or
the existence or discovery of new information that alters the viability of the
approved rezoning. The termination shall comply with any applicable provisions
of this Zoning Code or the rezoning with conditions agreement. If the agreement
is terminated, the City shall follow the procedures in Section
1281.01 (g)(8)D.
      (13)   City right to rezone. Nothing in the rezoning with conditions
agreement or in the provisions of this section shall be deemed to prohibit the
City from rezoning all or any portion of land that is subject to a rezoning
with conditions to another zoning classification. Any such rezoning shall be
conducted in compliance with this Zoning Code and the Michigan Zoning Enabling
Act.
      (14)   If land that is subject to a rezoning with conditions agreement is
thereafter rezoned to a different zoning classification or to the same zoning
classification but with a different or no rezoning with conditions agreement,
the rezoning with conditions agreement attached to the former zoning
classification shall cease to be in effect. In such a case, the Planning and
Zoning Administrator or their designee shall record with the Calhoun County
Register of Deeds a notice that the rezoning with conditions is no longer in
effect upon the property owner's written request.
   (h)   Fees. Petitions for an amendment to this Zoning Code shall be
accompanied by a fee as prescribed in the schedule provided for in Section
802.24 . Such fee is applicable when filing a petition for zoning
reclassification or special use permits and is nonrefundable.
   (i)   Protest Petition. An amendment to a zoning ordinance is subject to a
protest petition under Section
1281.08 .
   (j)   An amendment to conform a provision of the zoning ordinance to the
decree of a court of competent jurisdiction as to any specific lands may be
adopted by the City Commission and the notice of the adopted amendment
published without referring the amendment to any other board provided for under
this chapter.

occupancy of an existing building shall be made, nor shall any new building be
occupied for any purpose, until a certificate of occupancy has been issued by
the Chief Building Official or their designee or agent. Such a certificate
shall state that the new occupancy complies with this Zoning Code.
   (b)   No permit for excavation, or the erection or alteration of, any
building or premise shall be issued before the application has been approved
for such activities, and no building or premises shall be occupied until a
certificate of occupancy is issued by the Chief Building Official or their
designee or agent.
   (c)   A record of all certificates of occupancy shall be kept on file in the

1281.03 APPLICATIONS FOR BUILDING PERMITS AND ZONING PERMITS; RECORDS.
   (a)   It shall be unlawful for any person to commence excavation for
construction of any building or structure, structural changes or repairs in any
existing building, a change in use, or moving of an existing building without
first obtaining a zoning permit and/or building permit from the City of Battle
Creek. No permit shall be issued for construction, alteration or remodeling of
any building or structure, or change in use, until an application has been
submitted in accordance with the provision of this Zoning Code showing that the
construction proposed is in compliance with the provisions of this Zoning Code
and with the Building Code adopted by the City. “Alteration” or “repair” of an
existing building or structure, shall include any changes in structural
members, stairways, basic construction type, kind or class of occupancy, light
or ventilation, means of egress and ingress, use, or any other changes
regulated by the Building Code of the City, the Housing Law of Michigan, Public

consideration of all plans for developments submitted for site plan approval:
      (1)   All elements of the site plan shall be harmoniously and efficiently
organized in relation to topography, the size and type of the lot, the
character of adjacent properties and the type and size of buildings.
      (2)   The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state, insofar as
practical, by minimizing tree and soil removal and by topographic modifications
which result in maximum harmony with adjacent areas.
      (3)   The site plan shall provide reasonable visual and sound privacy for
all occupants located therein. Fences, walks, barriers and landscaping shall be
used, as appropriate, for the protection and enhancement of property and for
the privacy of its occupants.
      (4)   All buildings or groups of buildings shall be so arranged as to
permit emergency vehicles access by some practical means to all sides as may be
required by the Building and/or Fire Code.
      (5)   Every structure or dwelling unit shall have access to a public
street, walkway or other area dedicated to common use.
      (6)   There shall be provided a pedestrian circulation system which is
insulated as completely as is reasonably possible from the vehicular
circulation system.
      (7)   The arrangement of public or common ways for vehicular and
pedestrian circulation shall respect the pattern of existing or planned streets
and pedestrian or bicycle pathways in the area. Streets and drives which are a
part of an existing or planned street pattern which serves an adjacent
development shall be of a width appropriate to the traffic volume they will
carry and shall have a dedicated right-of-way equal to that specified by the
City Engineer and/or any other entity having authority over said roadway.
      (8)   Where the Planning Division, City Engineer, or Traffic Engineer
finds that an excessive number of ingress and/or egress points may occur with
relation to major or secondary thoroughfares, thereby diminishing the carrying
capacity of the thoroughfare, they shall require marginal access drives as
follows:
         A.   For a narrow frontage of less than 120 feet, the design will
require a single outlet.
         B.   For a series of adjacent frontages in a developing area, a
service road shall be constructed and a single marginal access drive shall
serve all establishments fronting thereon, with road cuts not closer than 330
feet centerline to centerline, or 330 feet from a street intersection.
         C.   The overall design of a marginal access drive shall uphold the
purposes of this chapter, promote the public safety, and serve the public
interest.
         D.   Marginal access drives shall be required only if the concept is
reasonable in terms of the land available for such an improvement.
      (9)   All site plans shall be designed in accordance with the City of
Battle Creek Stormwater Management Program Technical Reference Manual. All
stormwater shall be detained on site for controlled release. Attention shall be
given to proper site drainage to ensure neighboring properties will not be
adversely affected.
      (10)   Loading and unloading areas and outside storage areas which face
or are visible from residential uses or districts or public thoroughfares,
shall be screened by a six foot solid screening fence (concealment screening)
and plant materials no less than six feet in height.
      (11)   Trash containers must be stored in a trash enclosure constructed
of solid screening fence (concealment screening) on all four sides from four
inches above the ground to six inches above the trash container. The enclosure
shall not be located in the front yard unless the Planning and Zoning
Administrator or their designee finds that there is no other feasible location.
      (12)   Exterior lighting shall be arranged so that it is deflected away
from adjacent properties and so that it does not impede the vision of traffic
along adjacent streets.
      (13)   Development occurring within the City of Battle Creek wellhead
protection area, in accordance with
Chapter 1041, shall comply with the requirements established in the performance
standards as administered by the Department of Public Works.
   (f)   Decisions and approval.
      (1)   The Planning Division, the Inspection Division, and the Department
of Public Works shall be responsible for reviewing site plans, and the Planning
and Zoning Administrator or their designee shall be responsible for granting
approval. A decision approving, conditionally approving, or rejecting a site
plan shall be based upon requirements and standards contained in the zoning
ordinance, other statutorily authorized and properly adopted City planning
documents, other applicable ordinances, and state and federal statutes.
      (2)   Any revisions to the site plan shall be submitted in accordance
with Section
1281.04(b).
      (3)   If approved, the site plan shall become part of the record of
approval, and subsequent actions related to the activity authorized shall be
consistent with the approved site plan, unless a change conforming to the
zoning ordinance is agreed to by the landowner and the body or official that
initially approved the site plan.
      (4)   A site plan approved under this section shall be valid for a period
of one year. If construction has not commenced within this time period, or if
construction has ceased for more than one year, the site plan shall become null
and void. Thirty days prior to the expiration of an approved final site plan,
an applicant may make application for a six-month extension of the site plan.
The extension shall be granted if the Planning and Zoning Administrator or
designee finds good cause for the extension and that zoning regulations and
site conditions of the subject property and adjacent properties have not
changed since the approval.
      (5)   Performance guarantee. In accordance with the Michigan Zoning
Enabling Act, the City may require that a cash deposit, certified check,
irrevocable letter of credit, or surety bond acceptable to the City, in an
amount to cover the estimated cost of the improvements associated with the
project, be deposited with the City Clerk to insure faithful completion of the
improvements as set out in the site plan approved by the Planning and Zoning
Administrator or their designee. If the City has required a performance
guarantee, then it shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:
         A.   The performance guarantee shall be deposited at the time of the
issuance of the permit authorizing the activity or project. The City may not
require the deposit of the performance guarantee until it is prepared to issue
the permit.
         B.   Rebates of cash deposits. Where the performance guarantee has
been made in the form of a cash deposit, the performance guarantor shall be
entitled to a rebate of the cash deposit in reasonable proportion to the ratio
of work completed on the required improvements as satisfactory work progresses.
The performance guarantor may request the rebates in three equal installments
each time one-third of the entire required work has been satisfactorily
completed in accordance with the final approved site plan, including any
approved amendments.
         C.   Failure to complete improvements. If the performance guarantor
fails to complete the improvements as approved in the final approved site plan
within such time period as is required by the conditions or guarantees as
outlined above, then the City may proceed to have such work completed and shall
reimburse itself for the cost thereof by appropriating the cash deposit,
certified check, or surety bond or by drawing upon the irrevocable letter of
credit, or shall take the necessary steps to require performance by the bonding
company.
   (g)   Appeals. An appeal may be taken to the Zoning Board of Appeals by any
person aggrieved by a decision of the Planning Division, the City Engineer or
the Traffic Engineer as it relates to this chapter. Such appeal shall be taken
within such time as is prescribed by Section
1280.03 .
   (h)   Amendments. All site improvements shall conform to the final site
plan. A site plan may be amended upon application and in accordance with the
procedure herein. The Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee shall
have the authority to determine if a proposed change requires an amendment to
an approved final site plan, provided that a revised final site drawing be
submitted showing such minor changes, for purposes of record.
   (i)   As-Built Plan. After construction has concluded, as-built plans shall
be submitted to ensure compliance with final site plan approval.
   (j)   Violations and Penalties.
      (1)   All site improvements shall conform to the final approved site
plan, unless an amendment has been approved by the Planning and Zoning
Administrator or their designee. If an amendment has not been approved, the
Planning Division may require the applicant to correct any physical changes to
the site that were completed without proper approval so as to conform to the
approved final site plan.
      (2)   Stop work order. If improvements and/or construction is being
undertaken contrary to this Chapter or the final approved site plan, including
any approved amendments, the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their
designee shall give written notice to the holder of the building permit, or if
a building permit has not been issued, then to the person doing the
construction and/or improvements, notifying them of the violation of this
Chapter, or other applicable laws and ordinances. If the person doing the
construction is not known, or cannot be located with reasonable effort, then
the notice may be delivered to the person in charge of, or apparently in charge
of, the construction/improvements. If the holder of the permit or the person
doing the construction or improvements fails to correspond with the City to
show good cause within one full working day after notice is delivered, the
Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee shall cause a written order
to stop construction and/or improvements to be posted on the premises. A person
shall not continue, or cause or allow to be continued, construction and/or
improvements in violation of a stop work order, except with permission of the
Zoning Administrator or their designee to abate the dangerous condition or
remove the violation, or except by court order. If an order to stop
construction and/or improvements is not obeyed, the Planning and Zoning
Administrator or their designee may apply to the Calhoun County circuit court
for an order enjoining the violation of the stop work order. This remedy is in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other remedy provided by law or
ordinance, and does not prevent criminal prosecution for failure to obey the
order.
      (3)   A person who violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions
of this Zoning Code is responsible for a Class C Municipal civil infraction and
shall be subject to the civil infraction fines provided in Section
202.98.

neighborhood. Any proposed special use shall otherwise comply with all of the
requirements set forth in this Zoning Code for the district in which the use is
located, except that the City Planning Commission may permit hospitals and
institutions to exceed the height limitations of such district.
      (5)   A special uses permit shall be valid for a period established by
the City Planning Commission or as long as the use is established and
maintained in conformity with the plans submitted and approved. Special use
permits shall expire after one year if the use is not under construction or
operational. For good cause shown and upon written application, the City
Commission may extend a special use permit for six months. The written
application to request a six month extension shall be filed with the Planning
Division no later than 60 days prior to expiration.

special land use, the Planning Commission and the City Commission shall
establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the general standards specified in
the following shall be satisfied by the completion and operation of a proposed
development:
         A.   The use will be harmonious with and in accordance with the
general objectives of the master plan.
         B.   The use will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so
as to be compatible with adjacent uses of land, the natural environment, and
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and will not change the essential character
of the neighborhood.
         C.   The use will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future
neighboring uses.
         D.   The use will be an improvement to property in the immediate
vicinity and to the community as a whole.
         E.   The use will be adequately served by essential public facilities
and services, such as streets, highways, police and fire protection, drainage,
refuse disposal and schools, or the persons or agencies responsible for the
development shall be able to adequately provide such services.
         F.   The use will not create excessive additional requirements at
public cost for public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to
the economic welfare of the community.
         G.   The use will not create activities, processes, materials,
equipment or conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any person,
property or the general welfare by reason of an excessive generation of
traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, glare, vibrations or odors.
         H.   The use will be consistent with the intent and purpose of this
Zoning Code.
      (3)   A request for approval of a special land use shall be approved
(except requests for approval of a group child care home, which are
discretionary approvals) if the request is in compliance with the standards
stated in this ordinance, the conditions imposed under this Zoning Code and
other applicable ordinances, and state and federal statutes.
   (d)   Approval of Special Land Use with Conditions.
      (1)   Reasonable conditions may be required with the approval of a
special land use. The conditions may include conditions necessary to ensure
that public services and facilities affected by a proposed land use or activity
will be capable of accommodating increased service and facility loads caused by
the land use or activity, to protect the natural environment and conserve
natural resources and energy, to ensure compatibility with adjacent uses of
land, and to promote the use of land in a socially and economically desirable
manner. Conditions imposed shall meet all the following requirements:
         A.   Be designed to protect the natural resources, the health, safety,
and welfare, as well as the social and economic wellbeing, of those who will
use the land use or activity under consideration, residents and landowners
immediately adjacent to the proposed land use or activity, and the community as
a whole.
         B.   Be related to the valid exercise of the police power and purposes
which are affected by the proposed use or activity.
         C.   Be necessary to meet the intent and purpose of the zoning
requirements, be related to the standards established in this zoning ordinance
for the land use or activity under consideration, and be necessary to ensure
compliance with those standards.
      (2)   The conditions imposed with respect to the approval of a land use
or activity shall be recorded in the record of the approval action and remain
unchanged except upon the mutual consent of the Planning Commission and the
landowner. The Planning Commission shall maintain a record of conditions which
are changed.
      (3)   To ensure compliance with any conditions imposed pursuant to the
section, the City may require that a cash deposit, certified check, irrevocable
letter of credit, or surety bond acceptable to the City covering the estimated
cost of necessary improvements be deposited with the City Clerk to insure
faithful completion of the improvements relative to the imposed conditions. The
performance guarantee shall be deposited at the time of the issuance of the
permit authorizing the special use. Refer to Section
1281.04(f)(4).
   (e)   Reapplication.
      (1)   No application for a special use permit shall be submitted for the
same property, or any part thereof, or as part of a larger parcel, for a period
of six months from the date of Planning Commission decision on a special use
application for the property, except on grounds of newly discovered evidence or
proof of changed conditions found, in the discretion of the Planning
Commission, to be sufficient to justify a reconsideration.
      (2)   As used in this section, “newly discovered evidence” means a
finding that the evidence itself, not merely its materiality, is newly
discovered; that the evidence is not cumulative; that the evidence is such as
to render a different result probable on rehearing; and that the evidence could
not, with reasonable diligence, have been discovered and produced at the time
of the original hearing.
      (3)   For purposes of this section, “proof of changed conditions” shall
not include an application for another or different special use than that
originally requested.

1442.01 PURPOSE.
   The City of Battle Creek participates in the Federal Emergency Management
Agency's (FEMAs) National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) by complying with the
program's applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for the purposes of
significantly reducing flood hazards to persons, reducing property damage, and
reducing public expenditures, and providing for the availability of flood
insurance and federal funds or loans within the City of Battle Creek. The NFIP
requires that floodplain management regulations, of which this Chapter is a
part, must be present and enforced in participating communities. By adopting
City Ordinance Section 1420.01, the City of Battle Creek under authority of
Section 8b of 1972 PA 230, being MCL 125.1501 et.seq., assumed responsibility
for administration and enforcement of the State Construction Code, including
Appendix G of the Michigan Building Code within the City of Battle Creek, and
designated the Superintendent of Building Inspections as the enforcing agency
for the same.
(Ord. 01-2011. Passed 3-15-11.)
1442.015   DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words and phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as they have in common
usage and so as to give this chapter its most reasonable application. As used
in this chapter:
   (a)   "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   (b)   "Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures and
mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation and drilling operations.
   (c)   "Flood" means:
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from:
         A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or
         B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or run-off of surface waters
from any source.
         C.   Mudflows; and,
      (2)   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or
other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or
currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by
an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a
severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding, as defined in section (l)A. of this definition.
   (d)   "Flood plain" and "flood-prone area" mean any land area susceptible to
being inundated by water from any source (see definition of “Flood”).
   (e)   "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural

damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   (f)   "Habitable floor" means any floor usable for living purposes, which
includes working, sleeping, cooking or recreation, or a combination thereof. A
floor used only for storage purposes is not a "habitable floor."
   (g)   "Mobile home" means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. It
does not include recreational vehicles or travel trailers. The term includes,
but is not limited to, the definition of "mobile home" as set forth in
regulations governing the Mobile Home Safety and Construction Standards Program
(24 CFR 3282.7(a)).
   (h)   "Person" includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association or any other entity, including State and local

ground, as well as a mobile home.
   (l)   "Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction or
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is
started, or, if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before
the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial
improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or
not the alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term
does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.

the Flood Boundary-Floodway Map and the water surface elevation of the base
flood.
   (p)   "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than .1 foot.
   (q)   "Flood Hazard Boundary Map" (FHBM) means an official map of a
community, issued by the FEMA, where the boundaries of the flood, mudslide
(i.e., mudflow) related erosion areas having special hazards have been
designated as Zone A, M, and/or E.
   (r)   "Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not
limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, and floodplain
management regulations.
   (s)   "Floodplain management regulations" means zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion
control ordinance), and other applications of police power that provide
standards for the purpose. Floodplain management regulations means zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance
and erosion control ordinance), and other applications of police power that
provide standards for the purpose.

1454.04 HEARINGS.
   (a)   At the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall take testimony of the City
Inspectors, the owner of the property and any interested party. Not more than

decision either closing the proceedings or ordering the building or structure
demolished, otherwise made safe or properly maintained.
   (b)   If the Hearing Officer determines that the building or structure
should be demolished, otherwise made safe or properly maintained, the Hearing
Officer shall so order, specifying the action the owner, agent, or lessee shall
take and fixing a time by which the owner, agent or lessee shall comply with
the order. If the building is a dangerous building under Section
1454.01(d)(10), the order may require the owner or agent to maintain the
exterior of the building and adjoining grounds owned by the owner of the
building, including, but not limited to, the maintenance of lawns, trees and
shrubs.
   (c)   If the owner, agent or lessee fails to appear or neglects or refuses
to comply with the order issued under subsection (b) hereof, the Hearing
Officer shall file a report of the findings and a copy of the order with the
Board of Appeals not more than five days after the date for compliance set in
the order and request that necessary action be taken to enforce the order. The
Hearing Officer shall file the report of the findings and a copy of the order
with the Board of Appeals established pursuant to
Chapter 1464 and request that necessary action be taken to enforce the order. A
copy of the findings and order of the Hearing Officer shall be served on the
owner, agent or lessee in the manner prescribed in Section
1454.03.
   (d)   The Board of Appeals, shall fix a date not less than 30 days after the

the Hearing Officer, and shall give notice to the owner, agent or lessee in the
manner prescribed in Section

of Appeals, the owner, agent or lessee shall be given the opportunity to show
cause why the order should not be enforced.
   (e)   The Board of Appeals shall either approve, disapprove or modify the
order of the Hearing Officer. If the Board of Appeals approves or modifies the

order within 60 days after the date of the hearing under this subsection. In
the case of an order of demolition, if the Board of Appeals determines that the
building or structure has been substantially destroyed by fire, wind, flood,
deterioration, neglect, abandonment, vandalism or other cause and the cost of
repair of the building or structure will be greater than the State-equalized
value of the building or structure, the owner, agent or lessee shall comply
with the order of demolition within 21 days after the date of the hearing under
this section. If the estimated cost of repair exceeds the State equalized value
of the building or structure to be repaired, a rebuttable presumption that the
building or structure requires immediate demolition exists.
   (f)   The cost of the demolition, of making the building safe, or of
maintaining the exterior of the building or structure or grounds adjoining the
building or structure, incurred by the City to bring the property into

structure and grounds adjoining the building or structure includes but is not
limited to, fees paid to hearing officers, costs of title searches or
commitments used to determine the parties in interest, recording fees for

the charges authorized under this chapter, including but not limited to the
costs of placarding and vacating a dangerous building.
   (g)   The owner or party in interest in whose name the property appears upon
the last local tax assessment records shall be notified by the City Assessor of
the cost of the demolition, of making the building safe or of maintaining the
exterior of the building or structure or grounds adjoining the building or
structure, by first-class mail at the address shown on the records. If the
owner or party in interest fails to pay the cost within 30 days after mailing
by the City Assessor of the notice of the amount of the cost, the City shall
have a lien for the cost incurred by the City to bring the property into
conformance with this chapter. The lien shall not take effect until notice of
the lien has been filed or recorded as provided by law. A lien provided for in
this subsection does not have priority over previously filed or recorded liens
and encumbrances. The lien for the cost shall be collected and treated in the
same manner as provided for property tax liens under the General Property Tax
Act, being Act 206 of the Public Acts of 1893, as amended.
   (h)   In addition to other remedies prescribed in this chapter, the City may
bring an action against the owner of the building or structure for the full
cost of the demolition, of making the building safe or of maintaining the
exterior of the building or structure or grounds adjoining the building or
structure. The City shall have a lien on the property for the amount of a
judgment obtained pursuant to this subsection. The lien provided for in this
subsection shall not take effect until notice of the lien is filed or recorded
as provided by law. The lien does not have priority over previously filed or
recorded liens and encumbrances.

provided by law, and the lien does not have priority over prior filed or
recorded liens and encumbrances.

Building Official, shall deface or remove said placard.
   (b)   A dangerous building which has been placarded under this section shall

CHAPTER 1456
Vacant or Abandoned Structures
1456.01   Findings.
1456.02   Definitions.
1456.03   Registration.
1456.04   Registration exemptions.
1456.05   Administrative fee.
1456.06   Monitoring and securing structures.
1456.07   Right of entry and inspection.
1456.08   Reuse and occupancy.
1456.09   Responsibility for violations.
1456.10   Change in and/or transfer of ownership of dwelling.
1456.99   Penalty.
1456.01 FINDINGS.
   The City Commission determines that the presence of vacant or abandoned
structures creates an element of community blight. It is recognized that blight
lowers property values, leads to deteriorating housing conditions, undermines
the quality of neighborhood life, affects the public health, safety and general
welfare and can also result in human injury and criminal activities. It is also
determined that vacant and unoccupied structures occupy an inordinate amount of
City administrative and ordinance enforcement resources. As such, the City
Commission finds the prolonged presence of vacant or abandoned structures to be
unacceptable to the citizens of Battle Creek.
(Ord. 22-05. Passed 9-20-05; Ord. 04-2016. Passed 5-17-16.)
1456.02 DEFINITIONS.

days or less each year if the owner submits a request for exemption in writing
to the Inspections Division that the dwelling will remain unoccupied for a
period of 180 consecutive days or less each year. An owner who has given the
notice prescribed by this division shall notify the Inspections Division not
more than 30 days after the dwelling no longer qualifies for this exception. As
used in this division, "dwelling" means a dwelling such as a vacation or
seasonal home that is occupied by the owner or a member of the owner's family
during part of a year.
   (b)   A building under active construction or renovation and having a valid
trade permit(s) at the time of initial inspection shall be exempt from

Michigan Realtor shall be exempted for a period of 12 months from the start of

1456.05 ADMINISTRATIVE FEE.
   (a)   An owner of a vacant or abandoned structure, whether registered or
not, shall pay a vacant or abandoned structure registration fee and a monthly
administrative monitoring fee, the amounts of which shall be established by
City Commission resolution, for the time during which such structure remains a
vacant or abandoned structure.
   (b)   Fees under this section shall be established to support the services
rendered by the City in the course of its duties related to vacant or abandoned
structures. Fees shall be as determined in the fee, bond and insurance schedule
as approved from time to time by the City Commission. Failure to register a
vacant or abandoned structure or pay the administrative monitoring fee shall be
cause for penalties to be assessed and are criminal violations of this chapter.
   (c)   The monthly administrative monitoring fee shall be invoiced for all
months during which the structure was a vacant or abandoned structure for 15
days or more. However, the monthly administrative monitoring fee for a vacant
or abandoned property shall be suspended for a maximum period of six months
from the date on which an initial building, electrical, mechanical, or plumbing
permit issues for work the premises.
   (d)   A late fee, in an amount to be established by the City Commission,
shall also be payable by an owner of a vacant or abandoned structure when the
monthly administrative monitoring fee is not timely paid.
   (e)   If any portion of the fees required by this chapter are not paid or
are overdue, the City may:
      (1)   Direct the City Assessor to add the amount due to the next tax roll
of the City as a single lot assessment under these Codified Ordinances and
collect said sum in the same manner as provided by law for collection of taxes
and special assessments;
      (2)   The City shall keep an accurate account of all costs incurred for
the monitoring conducted with respect to each lot or parcel of land in carrying
out the provisions of this chapter. Such costs shall constitute a lien upon the
lot or land. A copy of the account of all unpaid costs incurred under this
chapter shall be transmitted to the City Treasurer for collection. The
Treasurer shall add to all such accounts 10% of the amount of all such
expenditures, to cover notice requirements, overhead and other administrative
costs. If the account is not paid in full within 60 days after the date the
Treasurer mails the same to the owner by first-class mail, a finance charge of
1.5% shall be added on the remaining unpaid balance. That portion of the
account remaining unpaid as of January 1 and June 1 of the year of services
rendered shall then be collected under the procedures of a special lot
assessment as set forth in Chapter 216 of the Administration Code;
      (3)   Filing suit against the owner for entry of civil money judgment; or
      (4)   Any other means available by law.

secured by use of exterior grade plywood or its equivalent, of at least one-
half inch thickness, cut to the size of the opening and secured by the use of
two-inch long screws.
      (2)   Any entry points above the first story or not accessible from
ground level, such shall be secured by use of exterior grade plywood or its
equivalent of at least one-half inch thickness, cut to the size of the opening
and secured by the use of 16 penny common nails or two inch long screws.
      (3)   Any bare wood surface shall be painted the same or similar color of
the surrounding surface.

completed or does not comply with the requirements for securing the structure
under this chapter, the City may secure the structure and the City shall bill

the time of inspection the Certificate of Occupancy is reinstated and the
property can be occupied. If violations are present at the time of inspection
but none of which are health, safety, or welfare, a Temporary Certificate of
Occupancy may be issued and the property occupied providing follow up
reinspection is conducted to verify that all violations have been corrected.
Once all violations have been corrected, and all outstanding registration and
monitoring fees have been paid, the full Certificate of Occupancy is
reinstated.

order shall not be relieved of the responsibility of having violated any of the
provisions of the International Property Maintenance Code by transferring title
to another person.
   (b)   Transfer of Ownership. It shall be unlawful for the owner of any
dwelling unit or structure who has received a notice of violation has been
served to sell, transfer, mortgage, lease or otherwise dispose of such dwelling
unit or structure to another until the provisions of the compliance order or

      (3)   If it is documented that service, after reasonable efforts, has not
been able to be accomplished as provided pursuant to the above paragraphs of
this section, service may be made by publication.
      (4)   If service has been accomplished pursuant to the above paragraphs
of this section, or it is established that the person had actual or

public, the property can be ordered to be vacated immediately.
      (2)   Where the property is already vacant, the order to vacate may be
given immediate effect.
      (3)   Where the property is being ordered vacated for failure to have a
valid rental permit and for no other reason, the property is to be ordered
vacated at the soonest date using the most expeditious means available to the
owner under the law, whether eviction, or otherwise, but in any case no later
than 60 days unless the owner or owner’s legal agent provides documentation
that any delay beyond 60 days is not attributable to the actions or inactions
of the owner or owner’s legal agent.
      (4)   In all other cases, the property is to be ordered vacated within 30
days.
      (5)   The order to vacate shall remain in effect unless and until it

dwelling unit, or structure is already vacant, then the condemnation is
effective upon posting of the condemnation placard.
         C.   The condemnation shall remain in effect unless and until it shall
be set aside or is modified by the Administrator, the Board of Appeals, or
judicial action.

task, the amount of the receiver’s bid to the City.
   (b)   The invoice shall state that the sum demanded must be paid within
thirty days and that if payment is not timely received the sum shall accrue
interest at the same rate of interest as established by City policy for past
due accounts.
   (c)   If the sum demanded by the City from the property’s owner is not
timely paid and the City elects not to pursue a foreclosure sale, the City may
recover the sum:
      (1)   By the City Manager or the designee of the City Manager directing

violation of the PMC.
(Ord. 22-89. Passed 8-1-89; Ord. 08-2016. Passed 6-21-16.)
1462.37 CIVIL REMEDIES FOR VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   If a dwelling is constructed, altered, converted or maintained in
violation of any of the provisions of the PMC or of any order or notice given
hereunder, or if a nuisance exists at any dwelling, then the City, by and
through the Administrator, may institute an action in the Circuit Court to
prevent such unlawful construction, alteration, conversion or maintenance; to
restrain, correct or abate such violation or nuisance; to prevent the
occupation of such dwelling; or to prevent any illegal act in the conduct of
any business in or about such dwelling. The procedure for such action shall be
the same as for an injunction or abatement of a nuisance under Circuit Court
rules, under the statutes made and provided in such cases or under the common
law. The judgment of the Court in such a cause may direct the correction,
repair or rehabilitation of the dwelling or the abatement of the nuisance, may
authorize a reasonable time within which the defendant may make such correction
or abatement and may authorize the City to execute and carry out the judgment
in case of default by the defendant. Whenever the City has incurred any expense
for the enforcement of the PMC or the judgment of the Court, the City may
institute and maintain a suit against the responsible party of the dwelling in
respect to which such expense was incurred and may recover the amount of such
expense in addition to the costs of the suit. The judgment of the Court may
order the vacation of the dwelling until the corrections, rehabilitations or
abatements are completed.
   (b)   In appropriate cases, the City shall have a lien upon the premises for
the expenses necessarily incurred in the execution of such judgment, which lien
shall have priority over all other liens or encumbrances, except taxes,
assessments or mortgages recorded previous to the existence of such lien. Such
a lien may be foreclosed, as in the case of foreclosure of mortgages, by court
action, as established by Circuit Court rules and the statutes of the State
made and provided in such cases.
   (c)   In any action instituted by the City under this section, the City
Attorney shall file, in the office of the County Register of Deeds, a notice of
the pendency of the action or proceeding. A notice may be filed at the time of
the commencement of the action or proceeding, or at any time afterward before
final judgment or order, or at any time after the service of any notice or
order issued by the City. The notice shall have the same force and effect as a
lis pendens as provided for in State statutes. The County Register of Deeds
shall record it and shall index it to the name of each person specified in
directions prescribed by the City Attorney. Any notice may be vacated upon the
order of the judge of the court in which the action or proceeding was
instituted or is pending, or upon consent, in writing, of the City Attorney.
The County Register of Deeds shall mark the notice and any record thereof as
cancelled of record upon the presentation, for filing, of the consent, or of a
certified copy of the order.
(Ord. 19-85. Passed 8-20-85; Ord. 08-2016. Passed 6-21-16.)
1462.38 DELAYING OR TERMINATING PROSECUTION.
   Nothing in this chapter shall delay or be cause for terminating the
prosecution of a responsible party for failure to correct violations of the
PMC, unless an appeal has been filed pursuant to Section 1462.17, or unless the
Board of Appeals has ordered an extension of time to correct violations.
(Ord. 19-85. Passed 8-20-85; Ord. 08-2016. Passed 6-21-16.)
1462.39 SEPARATE VIOLATIONS.
   A person may be charged with more than one violation of any of the
provisions of the PMC in a single complaint or appearance ticket, provided that
each violation so charged relates to the same property. Each violation so
charged shall be denominated as a separate count on the complaint or appearance
ticket and on any warrant issued pursuant thereto. Each count shall be
submitted separately to the court or jury for its determination as to the
defendant's guilt or innocence. Upon conviction the court shall sentence the
defendant separately on each count.
(Ord. 19-85. Passed 8-20-85; Ord. 08-2016. Passed 6-21-16.)
1462.40 FINES AND JAIL SENTENCES.
   Fines and jail sentences shall reflect the seriousness of each offense as
well as any previous history of recurrent violations of the PMC by the person
convicted. If after conviction, the Court does not require, as a condition of
sentence or probation, that the person reimburse the City for the costs of
enforcement of the PMC attributable to the violations for which such person was
convicted, including, but not limited to, the costs of inspection, prosecution
and administration, then the City may file a civil action against such person
in the appropriate court and may, upon proof of such person's conviction,
recover all costs referent to in this section.
(Ord. 22-89. Passed 8-1-89; Ord. 08-2016. Passed 6-21-16.)
1462.99 PENALTY; EQUITABLE REMEDIES.
   (a)   Unless otherwise provided, a person who violates or fails to comply
with any of the provisions set forth in the PMC is responsible for a Class D
Municipal civil infraction and shall be subject to the civil fines provided in
Section
202.98.
   (b)   In addition to the penalty provided in Section
202.98, this chapter may be enforced by suit for injunction, action for damages
or any equitable relief appropriate to the enforcement of the PMC.
   (c)   Upon conviction for a violation of the PMC which is subject to the
general Code penalty provisions of Section
202.99, the court may, in addition to such fine and/or imprisonment, place the
person on probation for any period of time, subject to any conditions permitted
by State law. The court may also, as a condition of probation or as part of a
convicted person's sentence, order the person to reimburse the City for all
costs of enforcement attributable to the violation for which such person was
convicted, including, but not limited to, the costs of inspection, prosecution
and administration. The court may also order repairs as part of any probation,
or, if authorized by State law, as part of a sentence.
(Ord. 7-95. Passed 3-21-95; Ord. 08-2016. Passed 6-21-16.)
   (d)   In addition to any other remedy available to the City under law,
including City ordinances, an owner, tenant, or other occupant who fails to
vacate a dwelling, dwelling unit or structure after having been given notice of
an order to vacate under this chapter or who occupies a condemned dwelling,
dwelling unit, or structure, is responsible or guilty as follows:
      (1)   Except as provided in subsection (d), where the order to vacate is
not based upon an imminent danger to life, limb or property of the occupant or
the public at large, then an owner or tenant who fails to vacate after notice
of an order to do so is responsible for a Class D Municipal Civil Infraction.
Each day that the person fails to vacate after the date indicated on the notice
is a new violation.
      (2)   Where the order to vacate is based upon an imminent danger to life,
limb or property of the occupant or the public at large, then the person who
fails to vacate after notice of the order to do so is guilty of a misdemeanor.
Each day that the person fails to vacate after the date indicated on the notice
is a new violation.
      (3)   Anyone other than an owner or tenant of a dwelling, dwelling unit,
or structure that has been ordered vacated, who fails to vacate, is guilty of a
misdemeanor.
      (4)   A responsible party or tenant who has filed an appeal in accordance
with the provisions of the PMC is not subject to the provisions of subsection
(a) when the PMC provides for the stay of an order of vacation during such
action.
      (5)   Anyone who occupies a dwelling, dwelling unit, or structure that
has been posted condemned is guilty of a misdemeanor.

1466.01 STATEMENT OF PUBLIC INTEREST.
   It is hereby declared that substandard, unsanitary, polluted or neglected
areas exist in the City; that these areas have resulted from inadequate
planning, excessive land coverage, lack of proper light, air and open space,
pollution, neglect, defective design and arrangement of buildings, lack of
proper sanitary facilities, or the existence of buildings which, by reason of
age, obsolescence, inadequate or outmoded design or physical deterioration,
have become economic or social liabilities, or both; that such conditions are
prevalent in areas where substandard, unsanitary, outworn or outmoded
industrial, commercial or residential buildings, or polluted and neglected
watercourses, prevail, and are conducive to ill health, transmission of
disease, infant mortality, juvenile delinquency, crime and poverty; that such
conditions impair the economic value of large areas, infecting them with
economic blight; that such areas are characterized by depreciated values,
impaired investments and reduced capacity to pay taxes; that such conditions
are chiefly in areas which are so subdivided into small parcels in divided
ownerships and frequently with defective titles, that their assembly for
purposes of clearance, replanning, rehabilitation and reconstruction is
difficult and costly; that the existence of such conditions and the failure to
clear, replan, rehabilitate or reconstruct these areas result in a loss of
population in some areas and congestion and overcrowding in other areas and
further deteriorations, accompanied by added costs to the City and other
communities in the area for creation of new public facilities and services
elsewhere; that it is difficult and uneconomic for individual owners
independently to undertake to remedy such conditions; that it is desirable to
encourage owners of property or holders of claims thereon in such areas to join
together and with outsiders in corporate groups for the purpose of the
clearance, replanning, rehabilitation, modernization, improvement and
reconstruction of such areas by joint action; that it is necessary to create,
with proper safeguards, inducements and opportunities for the employment of
private investment and equity capital in the clearance, replanning,
rehabilitation, modernization, improvement and reconstruction of such areas;
that the freezing of the assessed value of land and buildings in such areas at
the assessed values appearing on the tax rolls prior to the clearance,
replanning, rehabilitation, modernization, improvement and reconstruction of
such areas under a plan approved by the Planning Commission and supervising
agency is a necessary and fiscally sound inducement for the employment of
private investment and equity capital authorized by the State; that such
conditions require the employment of such capital on an investment rather than
a speculative basis, allowing, however, the widest latitude in the amortization
of any indebtedness created thereby; that such conditions further require the
acquisition at fair prices of adequate areas, the gradual clearance of such
areas through demolition of existing obsolete, inadequate, unsafe and
unsanitary buildings and the redevelopment of such areas under proper
supervision with appropriate planning, land use and construction policies; that
the clearance, replanning, rehabilitation, modernization, improvement and
reconstruction of such areas on a large scale basis are necessary for the
public welfare; that the clearance, replanning, reconstruction, modernization,
improvement and rehabilitation of such areas are public uses and purposes for
which private property may be acquired; that such areas constitute a menace to
the health, safety, morals, welfare and reasonable comfort of the residents of
the City; that the State has created redevelopment corporations for the purpose
of dealing with such conditions; that the State has authorized cities to assist
such corporations in the manner hereinafter provided; that the protection and
promotion of the health, safety, morals, welfare and reasonable comfort of the
residents of the City are a matter of public concern; and that the necessity in
the public interest for the provisions hereinafter enacted is hereby declared
as a matter of legislative determination.
(1975 Code Sec. 5.150)

substandard or unsanitary, and any real property, whether improved or
unimproved, the inclusion of which is deemed necessary for the effective

rehabilitation of the area of which such buildings, improvements or real
property form a part.
   (b)   "Assessed valuation," with respect to any local tax on a parcel of
real property, means the State equalized value of such parcel, including

redevelopment corporation a certificate stating the amount thereof as so
determined.
   (b)   A redevelopment corporation may, at any time, whether prior or

within a reasonable time after such application, not to exceed sixty days,
render a ruling thereon, and if it is ruled that any item of cost may be
included in development cost, or upon the failure of the supervising agency to
make such ruling within sixty days, the amount thereof as so determined shall
be so included in the development cost when it is finally determined.
(1975 Code Sec. 5.161)
1466.13 EXEMPTION OF REAL PROPERTY FROM INCREASE IN ASSESSED VALUE.
   (a)   The real property held by redevelopment corporations in an area, which
is the subject of an ordinance passed by the City Commission under this chapter
during the maximum exemption period, shall be exempt from any increase in
assessed value over the maximum assessed value. Such exemption shall not,
however, apply to any improvement made upon such real property after the
beginning of the maximum exemption period, but the City may, by appropriate
legislative action, under this chapter, establish a maximum assessed value and
maximum exemption period for such subsequent improvements.
   (b)   For the purpose of fixing the date of commencement of the maximum
exemption period for a group of parcels of real property in a development area,
the City is hereby authorized to contract with a redevelopment corporation to
place in one or more groups the various parcels of real property therein. Such
a contract may provide that all the parcels in each group shall be deemed to
have a common stated date of completion of the development by the redevelopment
corporation.
(1975 Code Sec. 5.162)
1466.14 LIMITATIONS ON PAYMENT BY REDEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS OF INTEREST ON
DEBENTURES AND DIVIDENDS ON STOCK.
   (a)   No redevelopment corporation shall pay any interest on its income
debentures or dividends on its stock during any dividend year, unless there
exists, at the time of any such payment, no default under any amortization
requirements with respect to its indebtedness.
   (b)   No redevelopment corporation shall pay or declare as interest on its
income debentures, and as dividends on its stock, during any dividend year
during any portion of the maximum exemption period, in an amount in excess of
the maximum dividend, except as provided in this section.
   (c)   If, in any dividend year, the maximum exemption period with respect to
some parcels has not expired, then that portion of its net earnings which may
be paid or declared as interest on its income debentures and as dividends on
its stock during such dividend year shall be determined as follows: Multiply
the net earnings of the corporation subject to payment or declaration as such
interest or dividends, by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total of
the maximum assessed valuation of all real property for which the maximum
exemption period has not expired and the denominator of which is the total of
the maximum assessed valuation of all the real property of the corporation, and
the result will be apportioned net earnings restricted as to payment as such
interest or dividends; compute the amount of the maximum dividend as though no
apportionment of the same were to be affected and multiply the amount so
arrived at by the same fraction, and the result will be the apportioned maximum
dividend. Only that portion of such apportioned net earnings which does not
exceed such apportioned maximum dividend may be paid or declared as such
interest or dividends. That portion of the net earnings obtained by subtracting
from the total net earnings such apportioned net earnings restricted as to
payment as such interest and dividends may be paid or declared without
restriction as such interest or dividends.
   (d)   If in any one or more prior dividend years, the total amount paid or
declared as interest on the corporation's income debentures or as dividends on
its stock is less than the amounts allowable pursuant to subsections (b) and
(c) hereof, then the cumulative interest and dividends equal to the difference
may be paid out of any net income applicable thereto in any subsequent dividend
year, despite the limitation imposed by subsection (b) hereof.
(1975 Code Sec. 5.163)
1466.15 ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST REDEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS.
   Whenever a redevelopment corporation has not obtained the certificates of
approval of its development plan required by Section
1466.03 within twelve months of the date it became a redevelopment corporation,
or has not substantially complied with its development plan within the time
limits for the completion of each stage thereof as therein stated, reasonable
delays caused by unforeseen difficulties excepted, or does, permits to be done
or fails or omits to do anything that it is not permitted to do or that is
required of it, as the case may be, by this chapter, or is about to do, permit
to be done or fail or omit to have done, as the case may be, then any such fact
may be certified by the supervising agency to the City Attorney, who may
thereupon commence a proceeding in the Circuit Court of the County in the name
of the City for the purpose of having such action, failure or omission, or
threatened action, failure or omission, established by order of the Court for
the purpose stated in this chapter, or stopped, prevented or otherwise
rectified by mandamus, injunction or otherwise. Such proceedings shall be
commenced by a petition to the Circuit Court alleging the violation complained
of and praying for appropriate relief. It shall thereupon be the duty of the
Court to specify the time, not exceeding twenty days after the service of a
copy of the petition, within which the redevelopment corporation complained of
must answer the petition. The Court shall, immediately after a default in
answering or after answering, as the case may be, inquire into the facts and
circumstances in such a manner as the Court directs without other or formal
proceedings and without respect to any technical requirements. Such other
persons or corporations as it seems to the Court necessary or proper to join as
parties in order to make its orders or judgment effective, may be joined as
parties. The final judgment or order in any such action or proceeding shall
dismiss the action or proceeding or establish the failure complained of or
direct that a mandamus order, or an injunction, or both, issue, or grant such
other relief as the Court may deem appropriate.

   (b)   Certificates, bonds and notes, or part interests therein, or any part
of an issue thereof, which are secured by a first mortgage on the real property

not apply to certificates, bonds and notes, or part interests therein, or any
part of an issue thereof, which are secured by a first mortgage on real
property in a development area, or any part thereof, which the Federal Housing
Administrator has insured or has made a commitment to insure under the National
Housing Act. Any such person may receive and hold any debentures, certificates
or other instruments issued or delivered by the Federal Housing Administrator,
pursuant to the National Housing Act, in compliance with the contract of
insurance of a mortgage on real property in the development area or any part
thereof.
(1975 Code Sec. 5.166)
1466.18 SALE OR LEASE OF REAL PROPERTY TO THE REDEVELOPMENT CORPORATION.
   (a)   The City may, by resolution, determine that real property, the title
to which is held by the City, specified and described in such resolution, is
not required for use by the City and that such real property, therefore, may be
conveyed, sold or leased to a redevelopment corporation. However, the title of
the City to such real property shall not be declared inalienable by the City
Charter or other similar law or instrument.
   (b)   Notwithstanding any general, special or local law or ordinance, such
sale or lease may be made without appraisal, public notice or public bidding
for the price or rental and upon such terms (and, in the case of a lease, for
such term not exceeding fifty years with a right to one renewal term of thirty
years), as may be agreed upon between the City and the redevelopment
corporation.
   (c)   Before any sale or lease to a redevelopment corporation is authorized,
a public hearing shall be held by the City to consider the proposed sale or
lease.
   (d)   Notice of such hearing shall be published at least ten days before the
date set for the hearing in such publication and in such a manner as may be
designated by the City.
   (e)   The deed or lease of such real property shall be executed in the same
manner as a deed or lease by the City of other real property owned by it and
may contain appropriate conditions and provisions to enable the City to re-
enter the real property in the event of a violation by the redevelopment
corporation of any of the provisions of Act 250 of the Public Acts of 1941, as
amended, or of the conditions or provisions of such deed or lease.
   (f)   A redevelopment corporation purchasing or leasing real property from a
city shall not, without the written approval of the city, use such real
property for any purpose except in connection with its development. The deed
shall contain a condition that the redevelopment corporation will devote the
real property granted only for the purposes of its development, subject to the
restrictions of Act 250 of the Public Acts of 1941, as amended, failing which
the City shall have the right to re-enter and repossess itself of the real
property.
(1975 Code Sec. 5.167)
1466.19 LEASE OF PROPERTY TO REDEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS.
   If real property of a city is leased to a redevelopment corporation:
   (a)   The lease may provide that all improvements shall be the property of
the lessor.
   (b)   The lessor may grant to the redevelopment corporation the right to
mortgage the fee of such property and thus enable the redevelopment corporation
to give as security for its notes or bonds a first lien upon the land and its
improvements.
   (c)   The execution of a lease shall not impose upon the lessor any
liability or obligation in connection with or arising out of the financing,
construction, management or operation of a development involving the land so
leased. The lessor shall not, by executing such lease, incur any obligation or
liability with respect to such leased premises other than that which may
devolve upon the lessor with respect to premises not owned by it. The lessor,
by consenting to the execution by a redevelopment corporation of a mortgage
upon the leased land, shall not thereby assume, and such consent shall not be
construed as imposing upon the lessor, any liability upon the note or bond
secured by the mortgage.
   (d)   The lease may reserve such easements or other rights in connection
with the real property as may be deemed necessary or desirable for the future
planning and development of the City and the extension of public facilities
therein, including the construction of subways and conduits and the widening
and change of grades of streets. Such lease may contain such other provisions
for the protection of the parties as are not inconsistent with the provisions
of this chapter.
(1975 Code Sec. 5.168)
1466.20 SEPARABILITY; INTERPRETATION.
   The sections of this chapter are severable. If any section of this chapter
is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional, the
remaining sections of this chapter are valid unless the court finds that
sections of this chapter are so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the void section that it cannot be presumed that the City
Commission would have enacted the valid sections, standing alone. This chapter
shall be construed liberally to effectuate the purposes hereof and the
enumeration of specific powers herein shall not operate to restrict the meaning
of any general grant of power contained in this chapter or in Act 250 of the
Public Acts of 1941, as amended, or to exclude other powers comprehended in
such general grants.
(1975 Code Sec. 5.169)
1466.21 ACCEPTANCE OF URBAN REDEVELOPMENT CORPORATION LAW.
   The provisions of the Urban Redevelopment Corporation Law, being Act 250 of
the Public Acts of 1941, as amended, are hereby accepted and all of such
provisions are hereby incorporated into this chapter by reference. All such
provisions shall apply, where applicable, to any person acting under this
chapter.
(1975 Code Sec. 5.170)
1466.22 ACTION TO BE TAKEN BY PLANNING COMMISSION IN CASE OF MULTIPLE OR
OVERLAPPING DEVELOPMENT PLANS.
   If one or more redevelopment corporations submit development plans to the
Planning Commission for development areas which overlap in whole or in part,
then the Planning Commission shall:
   (a)   Disapprove all plans in accordance with this chapter; or
   (b)   Approve one plan over all the others, with respect to the common
development area, and disapprove in part the other plans for the common area,
if the Commission is able to determine that the plan approved is best suited to
the public interest.

(Ord. 14-97. Passed 8-5-97; Ord. 04-2024. Passed 4-16-24.)
1470.09 REVIEW OF APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   In reviewing plans, the Historic District Commission shall follow the
U. S. Secretary of the Interior's standards for rehabilitation and guidelines
for rehabilitating historic buildings, as set forth in 36 C.F.R. Part 67.
Design review standards and guidelines that address special design
characteristics of Historic Districts administered by the Commission may be
followed if they are equivalent in guidance to the Secretary of the Interior's
standards and guidelines and are established or approved by the Bureau of
History.
   (b)   The Commission shall also consider all of the following:
      (1)   The historic or architectural value and significance of the
resource and its relationship to the historic value of the surrounding area.
      (2)   The relationship of any architectural features of the resource to
the rest of the resource and the surrounding area.
      (3)   The general compatibility of the design, arrangement, texture and
materials proposed to be used.
      (4)   Other factors, such as aesthetic value that the Commission finds
relevant.
   (c)   The Historic District Commission shall review and act upon only
exterior features of a resource and shall not review and act upon interior
arrangements unless specifically authorized to do so by the City Commission or
unless interior work will cause visible change to the exterior of the resource.
   (d)   The Historic District Commission shall not disapprove an application
due to considerations not prescribed in this section.
   (e)   Work within a Historic District shall be permitted through the
issuance of a notice to proceed by the Commission if any of the following
conditions prevail and if the proposed work can be demonstrated by a finding of
the Historic District Commission to be necessary to substantially improve or
correct any of the following conditions:
      (1)   The resource constitutes a hazard to the safety of the public or to
the structures and occupants.
      (2)   The resource is a deterrent to a major improvement program that
will be of substantial benefit to the community, and the applicant proposing
the work has obtained all necessary planning and zoning approvals and financing
and environmental clearances.
      (3)   Retaining the resource will cause undue financial hardship to the
owner when a governmental action, an act of God or other event beyond the
owner's control created the hardship, and all feasible alternatives to
eliminate the financial hardship, which may include offering the resource for
sale at its fair market value or moving the resource to a vacant site within
the Historic District, have been attempted and exhausted by the owner.
      (4)   Retaining the resource is not in the interests of the majority of
the community.
   (f)   The Historic District Commission shall meet within sixty calendar days
after a complete application is filed with the Commission to review and
consider the permit application. A permit shall not be issued and proposed work
shall not proceed until the Commission has acted on the application by issuing
a certificate of appropriateness or a notice to proceed, as prescribed in this
chapter.
   (g)   If the Historic District Commission approves the application, it shall
issue a certificate of appropriateness or notice to proceed, which is to be
signed by the Chairperson of the Commission and filed with the Inspections
Division.

decision is binding upon the Inspections Division and the Planning and Zoning
Division. A denial and the reasons therefor shall be in writing and filed with
the Inspections Division and furnished to the applicant. The denial shall also
include notification of the applicant's rights of appeal to the State Historic
Preservation Review Board and to the Circuit Court.

be re-submitted for Historic District Commission review when suggested changes
have been made.
   (j)   Failure of the Historic District Commission to approve or disapprove
an application for a certificate of appropriateness or written modification
thereto, as provided for in this section, within sixty days from the date such
application or modifications are filed with the Commission, unless an extension
is agreed upon in writing by the applicant and the Commission, shall be deemed
to constitute approval.

within a Historic District or proposed Historic District is threatened with
demolition by neglect, the Commission may require the owner of the resource to
repair all conditions contributing to demolition by neglect. If the owner does
not make repairs within a reasonable time, the Commission or its agents may
enter the property and make such repairs as are necessary to prevent demolition
by neglect. The cost of the work shall be charged to the owner and may be
levied by the City as a special assessment against the property. The Commission
or its agents may enter the property for purposes of this section upon

(Ord. 14-97. Passed 8-5-97.)
1470.13 PERMIT FEES.
   Fees charged for an application for a permit made pursuant to this chapter
shall be approved by the City Commission from time to time. Nothing in this
chapter shall be construed to prohibit the charging and collection of fees for
permits and inspections pursuant to the Building and Housing Code of these
Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 14-97. Passed 8-5-97; Ord. 04-2024. Passed 4-16-24.)
1470.14 ORDINARY MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY REPAIRS.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent routine maintenance of

(Ord. 14-97. Passed 8-5-97; Ord. 04-2024. Passed 4-16-24.)
1470.15 PLANS FOR PRESERVATION OF RESOURCES.
   If an application is made for work that will adversely affect the exterior
of a resource the Historic District Commission considers valuable to the City,
the State or the nation, and the Commission determines that the alteration or
loss of that resource will adversely affect the public purpose of the City, the
State or the nation, the Commission shall attempt to establish with the owner
of the resource an economically feasible plan for preservation of the resource.
(Ord. 14-97. Passed 8-5-97.)
1470.16 ACQUISITION OF RESOURCES.
   If all efforts by the Historic District Commission to preserve a resource
fail, or if it is determined by the City Commission that public ownership is
most suitable, the City Commission, if it is considered to be in the public
interest, may acquire the resource using public funds, public or private gifts,
grants or proceeds from the issuance of revenue bonds. The acquisition shall be
based upon the recommendation of the Historic District Commission. The Historic
District Commission shall be responsible for maintaining publicly owned
resources using its own funds, if not specifically designated for other
purposes, or public funds permitted for that use by the City Commission. Upon
recommendation of the Historic District Commission, the City may sell resources
acquired under this section with protective easements included in the property
transfer documents, if appropriate.
(Ord. 14-97. Passed 8-5-97; Ord. 04-2024. Passed 4-16-24.)
1470.17 PRESERVATION OF HISTORIC FEATURES.
   (a)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for
a resource, which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or
site and its environment, or to use the resource for its originally intended
purpose.
   (b)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a resource and
its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any
historic material or distinctive architectural features shall be avoided when
possible.
   (c)   All resources shall be recognized as products of their own time.
Alterations that have no historic basis and which seek to create an earlier
appearance shall be discouraged.
   (d)   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence
of the history and development of a resource and its environment. These changes
may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall
be recognized and respected.
   (e)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship,
which characterize a resource shall be treated with sensitivity.
   (f)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features,
substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements
from other resources.
   (g)   The surface cleaning of resources shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic materials shall not be undertaken.
   (h)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by or adjacent to any project.
   (i)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
resources shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historic, architectural or cultural material and when such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood or environment.
   (j)   Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to resources shall be
done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed
in the future, the essential form and integrity of the resource would be
unimpaired.

in the City.
(Ord. 14-97. Passed 8-5-97.)

   (a)   The Inspections Division is hereby authorized and directed to enforce
all provisions of this chapter, subject to review by the Historic District
Commission.
    (b)   If the City Commission determines that pending work will cause
irreparable harm to resources located within an established Historic District
or a proposed Historic District, the City Commission may by resolution, declare
an emergency moratorium on all such work for a period not to exceed six months.
The City Commission may extend the emergency moratorium for an additional
period not to exceed six months upon finding that the threat of irreparable
harm to resources is still present. Any pending permit application concerning a
resource subject to an emergency moratorium may be summarily denied.
   (c)   Whenever any work on a resource subject to this chapter is being done
contrary to the provisions of this chapter or this Building and Housing Code,
officials of the Inspections Division may order the work stopped by notice
served, in writing, to the owner of record. Such persons engaged in doing or
causing such work shall immediately stop such work until authorized by the
Inspections Division to proceed after review by the Historic District
Commission.
   (d)   When work has been done upon a resource without a permit, and the
Historic District Commission finds that the work does not qualify for a
certificate of appropriateness, the Commission may require an owner to restore
the resource to the condition the resource was in before the inappropriate
work, or to modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of
appropriateness. If the owner does not comply with the restoration or
modification requirement within a reasonable time, the Commission may seek an
