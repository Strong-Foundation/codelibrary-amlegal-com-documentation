and other subdivisions of the code printed in the supplement and make changes
in catchlines, headings and titles;

“this chapter,” “this article,” “this division” and the like, as the case may
be, or to “sections _____ to _____” (inserting section numbers to indicate the
sections of the code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance
incorporated into the code); and
      (5)   Make other non-substantive changes necessary to preserve the
original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the code; but in no case
shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance
material included in the supplement or already embodied in the code.

part, the Council shall have power to cause a new assessment to be made for the
same purpose for which the former assessment was made, whether the improvement
or any part thereof has been completed and whether any part of the assessment
has been collected or not. All proceedings on the reassessment and for the
collection thereof shall be made in the manner as provided for the original
assessment. If any portion of the original assessment shall have been collected

therefore, in anticipation of the payment of special assessments in one or more
special assessment districts, which bonds may be an obligation of the special
assessment district or may he or she both an obligation of the special
assessment district and a general obligation of the village. The Village
Council may issue general obligation bonds to defray that portion of the cost
and expense of a local public improvement chargeable to the village at-large.
(Ord. 32, passed 4-14-1986)
§ 32.23 SINGLE LOT ASSESSMENTS.
   When any expense shall have been incurred by the village upon or in respect
to any single premises, which expense is chargeable against the premises and
the owner thereof under the provisions of this code, the Village Charter, or

incurred, and the name of the owner, if known, shall be reported to the Village
Treasurer, who shall immediately charge and bill the owner, if known. The

deem advisable, direct the Village Treasurer to prepare a special assessment
roll covering all such charges reported to it together with a penalty and
administrative fee of 10%. The roll shall be filed with the Village Clerk, who
shall advise the Council of the filing of the same, and the Council shall then
set a date for the hearing of objections to such assessment roll. The
assessment roll shall be open to public inspection for a period of ten days
before the Council shall meet to review the roll and hear complaints. The
Village Clerk shall give notice of the roll for public inspection and of the
meeting of the Council to hear complaints to the owners of and persons having
an interest in property affected by first class mail at their addresses as
shown on the last tax roll of the village, at least ten full days prior to the
date of the hearing. Such special assessments and all interest and charges
thereon, shall, from the date of confirmation of the roll by the Council, be
and remain a lien upon the property assessed, of the same character and effect
as a lien created by general law for state and county taxes, until paid. The
same penalty and interest shall be paid on such assessments, when delinquent
from such date after confirmation as shall be fixed by the Council, as are
provided by the Village Charter to be paid on delinquent general village taxes
and such assessments, with penalties and interest, shall be added by the
Treasurer to the next general village tax roll and shall thereafter, be
collected and returned in the same manner as general village taxes.

(Ord. 69, passed 10-24-2005; Ord. 164, passed 10-24-2022)
§ 51.02 FINDINGS.
   (A)   Necessity for potable water. The Village Council has previously found
and currently reaffirms that the residents, businesses, industries and
governmental and charitable agencies located in the village need to have
potable and otherwise usable water.
   (B)   Availability of potable water. The Village Council has previously
found and currently reaffirms, that the supply of potable water available from
private wells or other sources within the village is insufficient to assure
that all residents, businesses, industries and governmental and charitable
agencies will have sufficient potable water available for their use and other
water necessary for industrial and fire prevention and control unless the
village offers water to properties located within the village.
   (C)   Method of measuring use of Water Supply System. The Village Council
has previously found and currently reaffirms that the most practical, cost-
effective and accurate method, given available technology of measuring the use
of the water supply provided by the Water Supply System by any user, is by a
meter or meters controlled by the village.
   (D)   Continuation of water supply service.  The Village Council has
previously found and further currently reaffirms that in order to provide and
continue to provide clean, potable and otherwise usable water to all users of
the Water Supply System, in quantities necessary for all varieties of use, it
is necessary from time to time to install improvements, enlargements,
extensions and repairs to the Water Supply System.
   (E)   Purpose of fees. The fees for the use of and connection to the Water
Supply System are hereby established for the purpose of recovering the cost of
operation, maintenance, repair, replacement and improvement of the Water Supply
System and to comply with federal and state laws and regulations, to provide
for the payment of principal of and interest on any bonds authorized to be
issued as and when the same become due and payable, and to provide an account
for reasonable and necessary improvements to the Water Supply System. The fees
shall be made against all users of the Water Supply System in a fair and
equitable manner and based on the level of service provided, in accordance with
the purposes herein described, as well as the following:
      (1)   All premises connected to the Water Supply System shall be charged
and shall make payments to the village in amounts computed on the basis of this
subchapter;
      (2)   The rates and fees for water supply service by the Water Supply
System are established herein to adequately provide for bond requirements and
to ensure that the Water Supply System does not operate at a deficit. The rates
and fees shall be established by resolution of the Village Council based upon
advice of the village's engineers and administrative staff; and
      (3)   The charges, rates and fees shall be set so as to recover costs
from users in reasonable proportion to the cost of serving those users.
   (F)   Proportionality, fairness and benefits of rates and fees. The Village
Council has previously found and further currently reaffirms that the most fair
and reasonable method of providing for the operation, maintenance, repair,
replacement and improvement of the Water Supply System is to charge each user a
proportionate share of the cost of:
      (1)   Retiring debt secured by the net revenues of the Water Supply
System issued to pay for improvements and replacements to the Water Supply
System;
      (2)   Ongoing repair, replacement and improvement and budgeted as part of
the annual costs of the Water Supply System; and
      (3)   Operation, administration and maintenance costs of the Water Supply
System.
   (G)   Water service charges. The village has investigated several methods of
apportioning the costs of the water service provided by the Water Supply
System. Based on its investigation, the Village Council has previously found
and currently reaffirms that to ensure the stability and viability of the Water
Supply System for the benefit of its users, the fairest and most accurate way
to apportion the costs of operation, maintenance, replacement and improvement
of the Water Supply System is to charge each user:
      (1)   A commodity charge for water usage which is based on the user's
actual metered use of water supplied by the Water Supply System;
      (2)   A readiness-to-serve charge for water usage based on meter size,
which fee reflects each user's proportionate share of the fixed costs of
operating and maintaining the Water Supply System;
      (3)   A capital connection fee to be paid by persons connecting to the
Water Supply System or changing their user classification in order to defray
certain capital costs incurred to provide sufficient capacity to all users; and
      (4)   The other fees and costs for services as authorized by this
subchapter.
         (a)   The Village Council further has previously found and currently
reaffirms that the charges, rates and fees set forth herein and by resolution
fairly and accurately apportion the fixed and variable costs of providing water
service among the users of the Water Supply System, and that the commodity
charge and readiness-to-serve charges provide actual benefits to the users in
the form of ready access to water that would be unavailable if the charges were
not imposed.
         (b)   In addition to the findings set forth above, the Village Council
has previously found and currently reaffirms that the capital connection fee is
a fair and proportionate charge for new users of the Water Supply System, and
that the opportunity to connect to the Water Supply System provides actual
benefits to each new user equal to or greater than the amount of the charge.

of same.
   (K)   Water supply emergencies.
      (1)   Authorization. The Director is hereby authorized to declare a water
supply emergency whenever he or she determines, on the basis of existing or
anticipated drought conditions, depletion of the water supply, reduction in
water pressure, failure of one or more parts of the supply system, or for other
good reasons, that there is a threat of loss of water supply to the village or
a portion of the village.
      (2)   Method of declaration.
         (a)   A water supply emergency shall exist when the Director has
caused a declaration of such emergency to be made by:
            1.   Public posting the declaration at the Village Hall;
            2.   Announcement on the Village Hall telephone answering system;
            3.   Announcement on one or more radio or television stations with

§ 51.10 ESTABLISHMENT OF RATES; RATES AND CHARGES.
   (A)   Establishment of cost of service. The Village Council has determined
that the purpose of water rates is to produce sufficient revenues each year to
pay the costs of service. The costs of service to be paid from revenues shall
include all of the following:
      (1)   Operation and maintenance expenses;
      (2)   Debt service expenses; and
      (3)   Capital expenses not funded from bonded indebtedness.
         (a)   The rates to be charged for water service furnished by the Water
Supply System shall be made against each lot, parcel or premises having any
connection with the Water Supply System.
         (b)   The village shall periodically review rates, fees, rules and
regulations of the Water Supply System. The review shall be completed not less
than one time per fiscal year. The review will define actual expenses
associated with the operation, maintenance and administration of the Water
Supply System, as well as debt service requirements, repair and replacement
costs. Results of the review shall be reported to the Village Council with
recommendations for any adjustments.
   (B)   Allocation of cost of service; user classification. The Village
Council has determined that not all classes of users of the Water Supply System
cause the same costs of service. Based on independent investigation and on the
advice of the village's independent engineering consultants, the Village
Council has previously found and currently reaffirms that:
      (1)   The commodity costs of water service for users of the Water Supply
System located within the village are uniform among users in accordance with
the volume of use. Accordingly, all classes of users located within the village
shall pay the same rate per gallon of metered water for water supply services;
      (2)   Certain indirect costs of providing water service, including size
of the water service pipe, materials used, location of meters, size of storage
and treatment facilities, maintenance and administrative overhead, vary
according to the size of meters employed;
      (3)   Users taking possession of previously undeveloped properties and
users changing the nature and amount of use of the Water Supply System at
renovated or expanded properties would not bear their proportionate share of
the cost of capital improvements to the Water Supply System unless required to
pay a capital connection fee; and
      (4)   Certain types of property use require a reservation of a greater
capacity of the Water Supply System than others. The Village Council has
therefore developed the following classification of users which the Village
Council finds is the most fair and accurate means of apportioning the indirect
costs of providing service among different classes of users for purposes of
calculating the readiness-to-serve charge and determining the relative demand
on capacity of the Water Supply System among different classes of users for
purposes of calculating the capital connection fee. For meters of the following
sizes, the following meter equivalency ratios shall be used for purposes of
allocating the amount of the indirect costs of service and determining the
relative demand on capacity of the Water Supply System per meter size.
Meter Size (Inches) AWWA
Meter Capacity Ratio
Meter Size (Inches) AWWA
Meter Capacity Ratio
5/8 and 3/4         1
1                   2.5
1-1/2               5
2                   8
3                   17.5
4                   30
6                   62.5
 
   (C)   Specific rates and charges.
      (1)   Commodity charge. Every user shall pay a commodity charge for all
water furnished by the Water Supply System. Except as otherwise provided in
this subchapter, commodity charges for all water service shall be calculated on
the basis of metered gallons of water consumed at rates determined by the
Village Council and which fairly apportion the variable costs of providing
water service to users of the Water Supply System.
      (2)   Readiness-to-serve charge. Every user shall pay a readiness-to-
serve charge for water service on the basis of meter size in an amount and in
the manner determined by the Village Council and which fairly apportions the
fixed costs of providing water service for users of the Water Supply System and
may include periodic depreciation expenses to allocate the original cost of the
system's assets over the life of those assets.
      (3)   Connection fee. Each user connecting or reconnecting to the Water
Supply System shall pay a connection fee equal to the actual cost of the
material, labor, equipment and overhead related to the installation and
inspection of the connection or re-connection as determined by resolution of
the Village Council.
      (4)   Capital connection fee. The Village Council may, by resolution,
establish a capital connection fee to defray or recover the cost of capital
improvements which are acquired and constructed for the primary purpose of
providing additional capacity determined by the village to be reasonably
necessary to accommodate:
         (a)   New connections to the Water Supply System; or
         (b)   Modifications of existing connections for a use estimated to
demand the reservation of greater capacity of the Water Supply System than
previously required. Every person seeking to connect previously unconnected
property to the Water Supply System, or to reconnect previously connected
property to the Water Supply System for a use estimated to demand the
reservation of greater capacity of the Water Supply System, may be required to
pay a capital connection fee. A capital connection fee shall be established and
managed as provided in this section.
            1.   Calculation of estimated demand on capacity. The estimated
demand on capacity of a new connection to the Water Supply System (or
modification of an existing connection to the Water Supply System) shall be
based on the meter equivalency table set forth in division (B)(4) above.
            2.   Calculation of capital cost requirements. The capital costs to
be defrayed or recovered through the imposition of the capital connection fee
shall be determined annually by the village and shall be based on the estimated
cost of capital improvements incurred or to be incurred for the primary purpose
of providing additional capacity determined by the village to be reasonably
necessary to accommodate new connections to the Water Supply System, or
modifications of existing connections for a use estimated to demand the
reservation of greater capacity of the Water Supply System than previously
required.
            3.   Credits. If the capital connection fee relates to an increase
in demand on capacity, the village shall credit against the specific amount of
the capital connection fee, the amount of any capital connection fee or similar
charges previously paid for connection of that property to the Water Supply
System.
      (5)   Equity buy-in. This fee may include a component that represents the
capital equity share within the system as established prior to the new or
expanded user's connection or a user's increased use of the system's capacity.
      (6)   Turn-on/turn-off fee. Each user desiring to:
         (a)   Reinstate service which has been discontinued due to violations
of the provisions of this subchapter; or
         (b)   Voluntarily discontinue or reinstate water service shall pay a
fee for reinstating or discontinuing water service, as applicable, in an amount
equal to the actual costs of the labor and administrative expenses as
determined by resolution of the Village Council. This shall include shut-offs
and/or turn-on's requested upon the change of ownership and change of tenants
under §
51.11(C)(4) and (D).
      (7)   Meter charge. Each user connecting to the Water Supply System shall

fire hydrant in the village shall make application to the village for the use,
which application shall specify the hydrant or hydrants to be used, the length
of time the hydrant(s) will be used and the purpose for which the hydrant(s)
will be used. Village Council and/or the Department of Public Works Director
shall have the authority to deny any application or grant said application in
whole or limit the approval up to a certain amount of gallons. If the
application is granted, the applicant shall submit a non-refundable rental
charge plus a cash deposit for a temporary meter in amounts established by
resolution of the Village Council. The fire hydrant connection and meter
installation shall be made by the village. A monthly hydrant rental charge and
a usage commodity charge, calculated on the basis of metered gallons of water
consumed, shall be assessed at rates determined by resolution of the Village
Council. Upon expiration of the rental period, the village shall remove the
connection and temporary meter. The cash deposit shall be applied by the
village to the payment of the hydrant usage charge and the excess amount of the
deposit, if any, shall be refunded to the applicant. The purchaser is liable
for any damage to the hydrant, village equipment, or the surrounding area.
      (9)   Annual fire suppression sprinkler line service fee. Each user
connecting or reconnecting a dedicated service line for fire suppression
services shall pay an annual sprinkler line service fee on the basis of fire
service line size in an amount and in the manner determined by the Village
Council and which fairly apportions the fixed costs of providing fire
suppression services to users of the Water Supply System.
      (10)   Debt service charge. The charge assessed users of the system which
is used to pay principal, interest, and administrative costs of retiring the
debt incurred for the construction of the water system, and construction of
improvements of, and extensions to, the water system.
      (11)   Continuing fees. The readiness-to-serve and debt service charges
established by the Village Council shall continue to be assessed to a property
to which water service is available regardless of whether or not such premises
has had its service disconnected or shut-off unless it can be established that
the connection to the premises is permanent and will not be reestablished. If
service that has permanently been discontinued is subsequently reestablished
after these fees are terminated, that property will charged a new capital
connection fee.
      (12)   Other fees. The Village Council may, by resolution, establish
certain additional fees as may be required to carry out the purposes of this
subchapter.
   (D)   Publication of rates. Following approval from time to time by the

bill shall not relieve the person of the liability for the charges incurred,
and the person shall notify the Village Clerk if a bill has not been received
by day 15 of the end of a quarterly billing period.
   (C)   Rates and charges to constitute lien on premises served. 
      (1)   Tax lien. Under the provisions of Public Act 178 of 1939, being
M.C.L.A. §§ 123.161 through 123.167, as amended, and Act 94 of 1933, M.C.L.A.
§§ 141.121, as amended, as security for the collection of water service
supplied to any house or any other building or any premises, lot or lots, or
parcel or parcels of land, the village shall have a lien upon the house or
other buildings and upon the premises, lot or lots, or parcel or parcels of
land, upon which the house or other building is situated. This lien shall
become effective immediately upon the distribution of the water service to the
premises or property supplied. This lien created herein shall be collected and
enforced in the same manner as provided for the collection of taxes assessed
upon the tax roll pursuant to Village Charter, except that the same shall not
be enforceable for more than three years after it becomes effective.
      (2)   The village shall annually, on April 1, certify to the appropriate
tax assessing officer or agency, all unpaid water service charges for the
services furnished to any premises, which, on the last day of March immediately
preceding April 1, have remain unpaid for a period of six months or more,
whereupon the charge shall be entered upon the next tax roll as a charge
against the piece of property or premises served. The charges shall be
collected and the lien thereof enforced in the same manner as general village
taxes.
      (3)   This lien remedy does not preclude any other remedy provided by
law.
      (4)   Lease exception. Charges for water services furnished to any
premises, as described in the preceding paragraph, shall not be a lien thereon
if all of the following exist:
         (a)   A legally executed written lease between the owner of the
premises and the tenant containing a provision that the owner of the premises
shall not be liable for the paying of water services accruing subsequent to the
filing of an affidavit by the owner with the Village Clerk;
         (b)   An affidavit filed by the owner with the Village Clerk
containing statements as to the date of the execution of the lease, that the
lease contains a provision holding the tenant liable for water services on the
premises, the expiration date of the lease; and 20 days’ written notice shall
be given to the village by the lessor of any cancellation, change in, or
termination of the lease; and
         (c)   In the case of multiple tenancies in one building, the owner
shall provide, at his or her cost, a separate meter, service line and curb box
to each apartment or leasehold within the building that is to be servicing the
tenants responsible for charges under this section.
   (D)   Deposits.
      (1)   Deposit required by tenant. If notice of a tenant’s liability has
been filed with the Village Clerk, the village shall render no further service
to such premises until a cash deposit in a sum sufficient to cover three times
the average quarterly bill for such premises, as estimated by the Village
Clerk, has been made as security for the payment of such charges.
      (2)   Deposit required for non-village service. Whenever services are
applied for under this chapter for premises located outside the village, the
Village Clerk shall forthwith advise Council of such application, and no such
service shall be furnished without the approval of Council, nor until a cash
deposit in a sum sufficient to cover three times the average quarterly bill for
such premises, as estimated by the Village Clerk, has been made as security for
the payment to secure all bills and charges. However, the Council may waive
this requirement in the event the property being served by the village water
services is covered by an agreement with Putnam Township to provide for the
collection of unpaid rates, fees, and charges and payment to the village by
placing such unpaid rates, fees, and charges on the township’s summer tax roll.
      (3)   The security deposit shall be retained by the village in a separate
account established for that purpose and shall be forfeited to the village if
the lessee of property contemplated in division (D)(1) above, or the owner on
property outside of the village contemplated in division (D)(2) above, shall be
or become delinquent in the payment of water rates or charges. Upon such
forfeiture of a security deposit, the Village Clerk shall transfer as much of
the sum of the deposit as is required to satisfy the delinquency to the credit
of the proper account, and the remainder, if there be any, shall be transferred
to the contingent reserve fund of the water department, as the case may be. The
property affected shall not be served again unless a new security deposit be
made in the same amount as the original, and disconnection preceding under
division (G) below shall be commenced.
      (4)   Monies deposited with the village for tenants under this division
(D), which shall not have been forfeited in the above described manner, shall
be returned to the depositor upon his or her application at the expiration of
the lease period. Such deposits may be left undisturbed to apply on renewals or
extensions of a lease for which the original deposit was made. Upon a sublease
or cancellation of a lease contemplated hereunder, security deposits shall,
upon request, be returned to the depositor. In the case of a sublease, no such
return shall be made unless there be a similar guarantee deposit made by the
holder of such sublease. Monies deposited with the village under this division
(D) for non-village property service, which shall not have been forfeited in
the above described manner, shall be returned to the depositor when all
services provided for in this chapter have been paid for in full and further
services are not required.
   (E)   Appeal of charges. Any user shall have the right to appeal any rates,
charges or fees levied in accordance with this subchapter. Appeals shall be
directed to the village within 30 days of the billing or invoice date along
with any supporting documentation. Any additional information required to
resolve the appeal shall be obtained by the user at his or her expense.
Resolution of appeals shall be made within 60 days by the Village Council or
its designee in accordance with the best available data and this subchapter.
All bills for rates and charges outstanding during the appeal process,
including all late payment fees or delinquency charges, shall continue to be
due and payable.
   (F)   No free service. No free service shall be furnished to any user of the
Water Supply System.
   (G)   Termination of water service by village. The village reserves the
right to terminate a user’s water service in each case where payment for water
service has not been timely received, and/or for violation of any of the rules
and regulations of the village relating to the Water System and/or the
provisions of this subchapter.
      (1)   It is the policy of the village to discontinue water service under
this code to customers by reason of nonpayment of bills only after notice and a
meaningful opportunity to be heard on disputed bills. The village’s form for
application for water service and all bills shall contain, in addition to the
title, address, room number, and telephone number of the official in charge of
billing, clearly visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:
         (a)   That all bills are due and payable on or before the date set
forth on the bill;
         (b)   That if any bill is not paid by or before that date, a second
bill will be mailed containing a cutoff notice that if the bill is not paid
within ten days of the mailing of the second bill, service may be discontinued
for nonpayment; and
         (c)   That any customer disputing the correctness of his or her bill
shall have a right to a hearing at which time he or she may be represented in
person and by counsel or any other person of his or her choosing and may
present orally or in writing his or her complaint and contentions to the
village official in charge of water billing. This official shall be authorized
to order that the customer’s service not be discontinued and shall have the
authority to make a final determination of the customer’s complaint.
      (2)   Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be entertained;
only questions of proper and correct billing will be considered. In the absence
of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided
herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified, but in no event
until the charges have been due and unpaid for at least 30 days.
      (3)   When it becomes necessary for the village to discontinue water
service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only
after all bills for service then due have been paid, along with a turn-on
charge in an amount set by Village Council.
   (H)   Litigation. In addition to discontinuing service to a delinquent user
and/or placing a lien on any premises for unpaid charges, the village shall
have the option of collecting all such delinquencies and penalties due by legal
proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction.

   (C)   Should it become necessary to shut off the water to any user or users
of the Water Supply System because of any accident or for the purpose of making
repairs or extensions, the village shall endeavor to give timely notice to the
users affected thereby and shall, so far as is practicable, use its best
efforts to prevent inconvenience and damages arising from any such causes, but
the failure to give the notice shall not render the village liable in damages
for any inconvenience, injury or loss which may result therefrom.
   (D)   The village shall not be responsible for interruptions of service
because of natural calamities, equipment failures or actions of users of the
Water Supply System. It shall be the responsibility of the user that all

§ 52.02 OBJECTIVES OF SUBCHAPTER.
   The objectives of this subchapter are:
   (A)   Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Sewage Disposal System
which will interfere with the normal operation of the Sewage Disposal System or
contaminate the resulting municipal sludge;
   (B)   Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Sewage Disposal System
which do not receive adequate treatment in the POTW and which will pass through
the Sewage Disposal System into receiving waters or the atmosphere, or will
otherwise be incompatible with the Sewage Disposal System;
   (C)   Improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge
from the Sewage Disposal System;
   (D)   Provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the Sewage Disposal
System;
   (E)   Protect both the general public and Sewage Disposal System personnel
who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment;
and
   (F)   Enable the village to comply with its NPDES permit conditions, sludge
use and disposal requirements, and any other federal or state laws to which the
Sewage Disposal System is subject.
(Ord. 68, passed 10-24-2005)
§ 52.03 FINDINGS.
   (A)   Necessity for sewer service. The Village Council has previously found
and currently reaffirms that the use of septic tanks, privies, privy vaults,
cesspools or similar private sewage disposal facilities is deleterious to the
health, safety and welfare of the residents, businesses, industries and
governmental and charitable agencies of the village and that the health, safety
and welfare of the residents, businesses, industries and governmental and
charitable agencies is enhanced by the creation of a public Sewage Disposal
System, with regulation by the village of pollutants and other harmful
materials, according to state and federal standards.
   (B)   Method of measuring use of Sewage Disposal System. The Village Council
finds that the most practical, cost-effective and accurate method, given
available technology, of measuring the use of the Sewage Disposal System by all
nonresidential users and by all residential users that receive water service
from the village's Water Supply System is by a meter or meters installed to
measure water usage by the user. The Village Council further finds that, with
respect to residential users not served by the village's Water Supply System,
it would be impractical and cost-prohibitive to require already-established
users to install a meter to measure water use from a well or other private
water source. Therefore, in the case of residential users that do not receive
water service from the village's Water Supply System, the Village Council
determines that use of the Sewage Disposal System shall be estimated based on a
meter equivalency unit established by the village, which the Village Council
finds to be a fair and reasonable estimate of the variable costs of the sewer
and wastewater treatment services provided by the Sewage Disposal System to the
users. However, new residential construction in areas not served by the
village's Water Supply System will be required to install a meter to measure
water usage for determination of sewer usage.
   (C)   Continuation of Sewage Disposal Service.  The Village Council has
previously found and further currently reaffirms that in order to provide and
continue to provide for the safe and uninterrupted removal and treatment of
sewage, pollutants and other harmful materials, it is necessary from time to
time to install improvements, enlargements, extensions and repairs to the
Sewage Disposal System.
   (D)   Purpose of fees. The fees for the use of and connection to the Sewage
Disposal Supply System are hereby established for the purpose of recovering the
cost of operation, maintenance, repair, replacement and improvement of the
Sewage Disposal System and to comply with federal and state laws and
regulations, to provide for the payment of principal of and interest on any
bonds authorized to be issued as and when the same become due and payable and
to provide an account for reasonable and necessary improvements to the Sewage
Disposal System. The fees shall be made against all users of the Sewage
Disposal System in a fair and equitable manner and based on the level of
service provided, in accordance with the purposes herein described, as well as
the following:
      (1)   All premises connected to the Sewage Disposal System shall be
charged and shall make payments to the village in amounts computed on the basis
of this subchapter;
      (2)   The rates and fees for sewage disposal service provided by the
Sewage Disposal System are established herein to adequately provide for bond
requirements and to ensure that the Sewage Disposal System does not operate at
a deficit. The rates and fees shall be established by resolution of the Village
Council based upon advice of the village's engineers and administrative staff;
and
      (3)   The charges, rates and fees shall be set so as to recover costs
from users in reasonable proportion to the cost of serving those users.
   (E)   Proportionality, fairness and benefits of rates and fees. The Village
Council has previously found and further currently reaffirms, that the most
fair and reasonable method of providing for the operation, maintenance, repair,
replacement and improvement of the Sewage Disposal System is to charge each
user a proportionate share of the cost of:
      (1)   Retiring debt secured by the net revenues of the Sewage Disposal
System issued to pay for improvements and replacements to the Sewage Disposal
System;
      (2)   Ongoing repair, replacement and improvement and budgeted as part of
the annual costs of the Sewage Disposal System; and
      (3)   Operation, administration and maintenance costs of the Sewage
Disposal System.
   (F)   Sewer service charges. The village has investigated several methods of
apportioning the costs of the sewer service provided by the Sewage Disposal
System. Based on its investigation, the Village Council has previously found
and currently reaffirms that to ensure the stability and viability of the
Sewage Disposal System for the benefit of its users, the most fair and accurate
way to apportion the costs of operation, maintenance, replacement and
improvement of the Sewage Disposal System is to charge each user:
      (1)   A commodity charge for sewer usage which is based on the user's
actual metered use of water supplied by the village's Water Supply System (or,
in the case of residential users not served by the village's Water Supply
System, based on actual metered water use from a private water supply or based
on a meter equivalency unit established by the village);
      (2)   A readiness-to-serve charge for sewer usage based on meter size,
which fee reflects each user's proportionate share of the fixed costs of
operating and maintaining the sewage disposal system;
      (3)   A capital connection fee to be paid by persons connecting to the
Sewage Disposal System or changing their user classification in order to defray
certain capital costs incurred to provide sufficient capacity to all users;
      (4)   A debt service charge assessed to users of the system which is used
to pay principal, interest, and administrative costs of retiring the debt
incurred for the construction of the sewage disposal system, and construction
of improvements of, and extensions to, the sewage disposal system; and
      (5)   The other fees and costs for services as authorized by this
subchapter.
   (G)   Benefits of charges. The Village Council further has previously found
and currently reaffirms that the charges, rates and fees set forth herein and
by resolution fairly and accurately apportion the fixed and variable costs of
providing sewer service among the users of the Sewage Disposal System and that
the commodity charge and readiness-to-serve charges provide actual benefits to
the users in the form of ready access to sewer service that would be
unavailable if the charges were not imposed.
   (H)   Fair charges. In addition to the findings set forth above, the Village
Council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the capital
connection fee is a fair and proportionate charge for new users of the Sewage
Disposal System and that the opportunity to connect to the Sewage Disposal
System provides actual benefits to each new user equal to or greater than the
amount of the charge.

village and abutting on any street, alley or right-of-way in which there is now
located or may in the future be located, a public sanitary sewer of the village
within 200 feet at the nearest point from the structure in which sewage
originates, is hereby required at the owner's expense to install suitable
sewage facilities therein, and to connect the facilities directly with the
proper public sewer in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter within
180 days after date of official notice to do so.
   (E)   No user shall discharge, cause or allow to be discharged any
stormwater, surface water, groundwater, water from footing drains, roof water
or backwash water to any sanitary sewer or sewer connection. Any premise
connected to a storm sewer shall comply with all county, state and federal
requirements as well as those of the village. Downspouts, roof leaders and
backwash lines shall be disconnected from the sanitary sewers within six months
of the effective date of this subchapter. Failure to disconnect shall give the
village the right to make the disconnection and the property owner shall be
responsible for paying the village for the costs incurred by the village in
making the disconnection.

National Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as
specified by Federal Pretreatment Standards and as required by the village. Any
facilities required to pre-treat wastewater to a level acceptable to the
village shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense.
Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures
shall be submitted to the village for review and shall be approved by the
village before construction of the facility. The review of the plans and
operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the
village under the provisions of this subchapter. Any subsequent changes in the
pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be
acceptable to the village prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
      (2)   The village will annually publish in a major local newspaper a list
of the users which were in significant noncompliance with any pretreatment
requirements or pretreatment standards at least once during the 12 previous
months. The notification will identify the nature of the violation and
summarize any enforcement actions taken against the user(s) during the same 12
months.
      (3)   All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards
shall be made available to officials of the EPA or Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality upon request.
   (F)   Additional reporting requirements.
      (1)   Baseline reports.
         (a)   Within 180 days after promulgation or revision of a National
Categorical Pretreatment Standard, all existing affected industrial users must
submit to the village the information specified by 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b),
paragraphs (1) through (7);
         (b)   At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources
and sources that become affected industrial users subsequent to the
promulgation of an applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, shall
submit to the village the information specified by 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b),
paragraphs (1) through (5). New sources shall also include in this report
information on the method of pretreatment they intend to use to meet the
applicable pretreatment standard and shall give estimates of the required
information regarding flow and pollutant discharge.
      (2)   Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the commencement
of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a New Source, any user
subject to pretreatment standards or Pretreatment Requirements shall submit to
the Director a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants
in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by pretreatment
standards or Pretreatment Requirements and the average and maximum daily flow
for these process units in the user facility which are limited by the
pretreatment standards or pretreatment requirements. For users subject to
equivalent mass or concentration limits, this report shall contain a reasonable
measure of the long-term production rate. For all other users subject to
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed per unit of production,
the report shall include the actual production during the sampling period. The
report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or
pretreatment requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the
applicable pretreatment standards or pretreatment requirements. This statement
must be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user as
required in division (I) below.
      (3)   Periodic compliance reports.
         (a)   All significant industrial users discharging into the POTW or
the Sewage Disposal System shall submit to the Director during the months of
June and December, unless required more frequently by applicable pretreatment
standards or by the Director, a report indicating the nature and concentration
of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by the pretreatment standards
or this subchapter;
         (b)   In addition, this report shall include a record of maximum daily
flows during the reporting period;
         (c)   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with division (I) below;
         (d)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep his or her monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results
are unrepresentative of its discharge;
         (e)   If a user is subject to reporting requirements required to
demonstrate continued compliance and monitors any pollutant more frequently
than required by the village, using standard laboratory procedures, the results
of this additional monitoring shall also be included in the periodic compliance
report described in division (F)(3) above; and
         (f)   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user
shall notify the village within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation.
The user shall also repeat the sampling and submit the results of re-analysis
to the village within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except
when the village will be performing scheduled surveillance sampling and/or
analysis within this 30-day period.
      (4)   Notification of hazardous waste discharges. All users shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and the State
Hazardous Waste Authority in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which would be a hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. § 261 if disposed
via other means. Notification details, as well as allowable exemptions, shall
be in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(p). In the case of any new regulations
under § 3001 of the Resource Recovery and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 6901
et seq.) identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing
any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must provide
notification of the discharge of the substance within 90 days of the effective
date of the regulations. In the case of any notification of hazardous waste
discharges, the user shall further certify that he or she has a program in
place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the
degree it has determined to be economically practical.
   (G)   Inspection and sampling.
      (1)   The village shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain
whether the purpose of this subchapter is being met, and the user is complying
with all requirements. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is
created or discharged shall allow the village or its representative ready
access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination, records copying or in the
performance of any of his or her duties.
      (2)   The village, Department of Environmental Quality and EPA shall have
the right to set up on the user's property the devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper
identification and clearance before entry into his or her premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with his or her security guards so that upon
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the village, Department
of Environmental Quality and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for
the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
   (H)   Confidential information.
      (1)   Information and data on a user obtained from reports,
questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from
inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency
without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the village, that the release of the
information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.
      (2)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portion of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written
request to governmental agencies for uses related to this subchapter, the NPDES
permit or the pretreatment standards; provided, however, that the portions of a
report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial
review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information.
      (3)   Information accepted by the village as confidential shall not be
transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the village
until and unless a ten-day notification is given to the user.
   (I)   Signatory requirements.
      (1)   All reports required by this section shall be signed by the
authorized representative of an industrial user and include the following
certification statement:
         “I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system
designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the
information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage
the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine
and imprisonment for knowing violations.”
      (2)   If the authorized representative of an industrial user changes
because a different individual has responsibility for the overall operation of
the facility or for environmental matters of the user, a new authorization
satisfying the definition of an authorized representative of an industrial user
as set forth in division (A) above, must be submitted to the village prior to,
or together, with any reports to be signed by that representative.

   (F)   Surcharge for discharges of unusual strength.
      (1)   Where the strength of sewage from any user exceeds the limits set
forth in division (C)(1) above for conventional pollutants, and where the
wastes are permitted to be discharged to the POTW by the Director, an added
charge as determined by resolution of the Village Council, will be made against
the establishment according to the strength of the wastes, or the Director
shall require that the sewage shall be denied, if necessary, to protect the
POTW or any part thereof.
      (2)   The strength of the wastes shall be determined by composite samples
taken over a sufficient period of time to ensure a representative sample. If
sampling is conducted on a flow-proportional basis, the sampling shall be taken
utilizing a flow-proportional sampling device and flow meter approved by the
village. The village or its authorized designee or independent contractor shall
have access to the premises of any user at all reasonable times for purposes of
sampling and testing the strength of sewage of any user in accordance with this
division.
      (3)   If the village determines that it is necessary to conduct sampling
and testing of the sewage of any user in order to determine the applicability
of any surcharge which may be imposed in accordance with this subchapter, the
village or its authorized agent shall be responsible for taking the initial
sample in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter. Testing of the
initial sample shall be made by an independent laboratory or by the village.
The cost of the initial sampling and testing shall be borne by the village. The
user may request that the village provide the user with a split sample for
testing at the user’s own laboratory or an independent laboratory selected by
the user; provided, however, that the cost of testing the split sample shall be
borne by the user.
      (4)   If the initial testing described in division (F)(3) above reveals
the presence of conventional pollutants in excess of the limits set forth in
division (C)(1) above, the costs of all subsequent sampling and testing,
including the testing of any split samples as described in this division, shall
be borne by the user. The subsequent sampling and testing may be conducted by
the user or, at the option of the user, by the village or its authorized agent.
         (a)   If testing and sampling is conducted by the user, the user shall
provide the village with a split sample. The split sample received by the
village may, at the option of the village, be tested by the village or by an
independent laboratory. In either case, the user shall reimburse the village
for all costs incurred in connection with the testing.
         (b)   If testing and sampling is conducted by the village, the user
may request that the village provide the user with a split sample for testing
at the user’s own laboratory or an independent laboratory selected by the user.
The cost of testing the split sample shall be borne by the user.
   (G)   Special agreements authorized. With respect to conventional pollutants
as set forth in division (C)(1) above, only no statement contained in this
subchapter shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or
arrangement between the village and any person, firm or corporation whereby
waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the village, subject
to payment therefore by the person, firm or corporation, provided the agreement
will not violate EPA guidelines or NPDES permit requirements and provided the
waste will not damage the Sewage Disposal System or the receiving waters.
   (H)   Wastewater sampling and analyses.
      (1)   The prohibitions and restrictions in divisions (A),(B) and (C)
above, or as set forth in a special agreement (which may be a use permit),
shall apply at the point where wastewater and pollutants are discharged or
caused to be discharged into the POTW and required pretreatment shall be
effected before that point is reached.
      (2)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of
water to which reference is made in this section shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition at the time of Standard Methods for
Examination of Water and Sewage, published by the American Public Health
Association, most current American Society for Testing Material (ASTM) and EPA
approved procedures contained in 40 C.F.R. Part 136, or any validated methods
from recognized authority in cases where the above referenced procedures are
not available or do not apply to the characteristic involved or another method
accepted by the village.
      (3)   Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a composite sample of all outfalls of a premise
is appropriate or whether grab samples should be taken. If composite sampling
is conducted on a flow- proportional basis, the sampling shall be taken
utilizing a flow-proportional sampling device and flow meter approved by the
village.
   (I)   Powers and authority of inspectors. Authorized agents of the village,
Livingston County Health Department, DEQ or the EPA shall have the right to
enter all properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement,
sampling and testing in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter, the
Act and State Act.
   (J)   Excessive discharges and/or dilution of discharge. Except where
expressly authorized to do so by an applicable National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard, no user shall ever increase the use of process water or,
in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute
for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in
the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, alternative discharge limits
or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the village or
state.
   (K)   Accidental discharges.
      (1)   Where required by the Director, qualified Village Agent or other
governmental agency, a user shall provide protection from accidental discharge
of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this subchapter, the
Act or the state. The village will evaluate, at least once every two years,
whether a user without the protection will be subjected to these requirements.
Facilities to prevent accidental discharge or prohibited materials shall be
provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed
plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection
shall be submitted to the village for review and shall be approved by the
village before construction of the facility. All required users shall complete
such a plan within 180 days after the adoption of this subchapter. If required
by the village, a user who commences contribution to the POTW after the
effective date of this subchapter shall not be permitted to introduce
pollutants into the POTW until accidental discharge procedures have been
approved by the village. Review and approval of the plans and operating
procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the
user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this subchapter.
      (2)   In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of
the user to immediately telephone and notify the village of the incident. The
notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration
and volume and corrective actions.
      (3)   Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall
submit to the Director a detailed written report describing the cause of the
discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future
occurrences. The notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or property; nor shall the
notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability
which may be imposed by this subchapter or other applicable law.
   (L)   Violations. It shall be a violation of this subchapter for any
industrial user to:
      (1)   Fail to completely and/or accurately report the wastewater
constituents and/or characteristics of the industrial user's discharge;
      (2)   Fail to report significant changes in the industrial user's
operations or wastewater constituents and/or characteristics within the time
frames provided in this subchapter;
      (3)   Refuse reasonable access to the industrial user's premises or waste
discharge for the purpose of inspection or monitoring;
      (4)   Restrict, lockout or prevent, directly or indirectly, access to any
monitoring facilities constructed on public or private property. The locking or
securing of the monitoring facility shall not constitute a violation pursuant
to this subsection, provided that, upon request, reasonable access to the
facility is promptly provided;
      (5)   Restrict, interfere, tamper with or render inaccurate any
monitoring devices including, but not limited to, samplers;
      (6)   Fail to comply with any condition or requirement of the industrial
user's wastewater discharge permit, if any; and
      (7)   Fail to comply with any limitation, prohibition or requirement of
this subchapter including any rule, regulation or order issued hereunder.
   (M)   Upsets.
      (1)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with applicable National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards or pretreatment standards, provided the following requirements are
met:
         (a)   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause
(s) of the upset;
         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
worker-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         (c)   The user submitted the following information to the village
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided
orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
            1.   A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (2)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (N)   Bypass.
      (1)   Bypasses are prohibited unless the bypass does not cause a
violation of pretreatment standards or pretreatment requirements, but only if
it is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the POTW.
These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of divisions (N)(2) and (3)
below.
      (2)   Industrial users anticipating a bypass shall submit notice to the
village at least ten days in advance.
      (3)   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the village within 24
hours from the time the user becomes or should have become aware of the bypass.
A written submission shall be provided within five days of the time the
industrial user becomes or should have become aware of the bypass. The written
submission shall contain a description of the bypass including exact dates and
times, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
      (4)   Bypass is prohibited and the village may take enforcement action
against a user for the bypass, unless:
         (a)   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
         (c)   The industrial user submitted required notices.
      (5)   Where it meets all conditions in division (D) above, the village
may approve an anticipated bypass.

§ 52.26 DISPOSAL AT WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANT.
   Waste from individual Sewage Disposal Systems (as defined in §
52.25(A)(1)(p)) may be disposed of at the POTW treatment plant with permission
of the Director. Rates for the disposal shall be established by resolution of
the Village Council. No other waters or wastes described in §
52.25(A) shall be disposed of through the POTW.
(Ord. 68, passed 10-24-2005)
§ 52.27 INDUSTRIAL PRETREATMENT FEES AND SURCHARGES.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this section to provide for the recovery from
industrial users of the Sewage Disposal System of the actual costs of
implementing the pretreatment program established herein. The applicable
charges or fees shall be established by resolution of the Village Council. The
fees may be implemented to recover the actual cost of:
      (1)   Setting up and operating the pretreatment program;
      (2)   Monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures;
      (3)   Reviewing accidental discharge procedures and construction;
      (4)   Processing permit applications or transfers and reviewing and
processing appeals;
      (5)   Removal by the village of pollutants otherwise subject to federal
pretreatment standards;
      (6)   Treatment of pollutant loadings not normally treated at or in
excess of those treated by the POTW; and
      (7)   Charges for laboratory testing of wastewater. The laboratory charge
shall be for the cost labor, equipment and the actual cost of laboratory
testing and will be determined for and paid by each industrial user.
   (B)   The foregoing charges and fees for the services described above may be
established by the Village Council and levied upon any industrial user which
may have any sewer connection with the Sewage Disposal System and which
discharges industrial waste to the Sewage Disposal System.
(Ord. 68, passed 10-24-2005)
§ 52.28 MEASURING SEWER USAGE; WATER METERS REQUIRED FOR ALL NONRESIDENTIAL
USERS.
   (A)   As described in §
52.03(B), the Village Council finds that the most practical, cost-effective and
accurate method, given available technology, of measuring the use of the Sewage
Disposal System by all nonresidential users and all residential users that
receive water service from the Village's Water Supply System is by a meter or
meters installed to measure water usage by the user.
   (B)   All new users of the Sewage Disposal System, who or which are not
served by the village Water Supply System, shall be required to purchase and
install a water meter or meters for the purpose of measuring the amount of
water supplied to the premises by river water or from private wells or other
private sources. The meter or meters shall be purchased by the owner of the
property served by the Sewage Disposal System and shall be maintained at the
expense of the owner. The purchase and installation of a water meter as
described in this section shall be required as a condition to the connection to
and use of the Sewage Disposal System.
   (C)   Residential users not served by the village's Water Supply System are
encouraged, but shall not be required to purchase and install a water meter for
the purpose of measuring the amount of water supplied to the premises by
private well or other private source. A meter described in this section shall
be purchased by the residential user from the village and shall be maintained
at the expense of the user. A residential user electing to purchase and install
a water meter as described in this section shall be assessed a commodity charge
on the basis of metered water consumption as described in §
52.29(C)(4)(b)l. in lieu of the commodity charge calculated in accordance with
§
52.29(C)(4)(b)2.
   (D)   Any user may, but shall not be required to install a secondary water
meter for outdoor irrigation systems. Any outdoor hose spigots may be part of
the independent water system metered by the secondary irrigation system meter.
The secondary irrigation meter shall be installed in such a manner that the
water usage registered through the secondary irrigation meter is entirely
separate from the water usage metered through the primary water meter or
meters. A meter described in this section shall be purchased by the owner of
the property served by the Sewage Disposal System and shall be maintained at
the expense of the owner. Water consumed for irrigation purposes, as measured
by a secondary irrigation meter installed in accordance with this section,
shall be excluded from the calculation of, and shall not be subject to, the
commodity charge described in §
52.29(C)(1)(a). Any meter installed pursuant to this section shall comply with
the Village Technical Standards.
(Ord. 68, passed 10-24-2005; Ord. 165, passed 10-24-2022)
§ 52.29 ESTABLISHMENT OF RATES; RATES AND CHARGES.
   (A)   Establishment of cost of service. The Village Council has determined
that the purpose of sewer rates is to produce sufficient revenues each year to
pay the costs of service. The costs of service to be paid from revenues shall
include all of the following:
      (1)   Operation and maintenance expenses;
      (2)   Debt service expenses; and
      (3)   Capital expenses not funded from bonded indebtedness.
         (a)   The rates to be charged for sewer service furnished by the
Sewage Disposal System shall be made against each lot, parcel of land or
premises having any connection with the Sewage Disposal System.
         (b)   The village shall periodically review rates, fees, rules and
regulations of the Sewage Disposal System. The review shall be completed not
less than one time per fiscal year. The review will define actual expenses
associated with the operation, maintenance and administration of the Sewage
Disposal System, as well as debt service requirements and repair and
replacement costs. Results of the review shall be reported to the Village
Council with recommendations for any adjustments.
   (B)   Allocation of cost of service; user classification. The Village
Council has determined that not all classes of users of the Sewage Disposal
System cause the same costs of service. Based on independent investigation and
on the advice of the village's independent engineering consultants, the Village
Council has previously found and currently reaffirms that:
      (1)   The commodity costs of sewer service for users of the Sewage
Disposal System located within the village are uniform among users in
accordance with the volume of use; provided, however, that in certain cases
where the character of the sewage from a particular source is such that
unreasonable additional burden is placed on the Sewage Disposal Systems, the
additional cost of treatment created thereby requires an additional surcharge
above the rates normally charged for the service;
      (2)   Certain indirect costs of providing sewer service vary according to
the size of meters employed;
      (3)   Users taking possession of previously undeveloped properties, and
users changing the nature and amount of use of the Sewage Disposal System at
renovated or expanded properties would not bear their proportionate share of
the cost of capital improvements to the Sewage Disposal System unless required
to pay a capital connection fee.;
      (4)   Certain types of property use require a reservation of a greater
capacity of the Sewage Disposal System than others. The Village Council has
therefore developed the following classification of users, which the Village
Council finds is the most fair and accurate means of apportioning the indirect
costs of providing service among different classes of users for purposes of
calculating the readiness-to-serve charge and determining the relative demand
on capacity of the Sewage Disposal System among different classes of users for
purposes of calculating the capital connection fee;
      (5)   For meters of the following sizes, the following meter equivalency
ratios shall be used for purposes of allocating the amount of the indirect
costs of service and determining the relative demand on capacity of the Sewage
Disposal System per meter size:
Meter Size (Inches) AWWA
Meter Capacity Ratio
Meter Size (Inches) AWWA
Meter Capacity Ratio
5/8 and 3/4         1
1                   2.5
1-1/2               5
2                   8
3                   17.5
4                   30
6                   62.5
 
      (6)   Un-metered single-family residential properties shall be assigned a
meter capacity ratio of one for purposes of calculating the rates and charges
prescribed by this subchapter.
   (C)   Specific rates and charges.
      (1)   Commodity charge. Every user of the Sewage Disposal System shall
pay a commodity charge for all sewer and wastewater treatment services
furnished by the Sewage Disposal System:
         (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, commodity
charges for all sewer and wastewater treatment services shall be calculated on
the basis of metered gallons of water consumed (excluding water consumed for
irrigation purposes as measured by a secondary irrigation meter installed in
accordance with § 52.28(D)) at rates determined by resolution of the Village
Council and which fairly apportion the variable costs of providing sewer and
wastewater treatment services to users of the Sewage Disposal System.
         (b)   Single-family residential users not served by the village's
Water Supply System and which have not elected to install a water meter in
accordance with §
52.28(C) shall be assessed a commodity charge calculated based on an estimated
a meter equivalency unit established by the village as determined by resolution
of the Village Council and which the Village Council finds to be a fair and
reasonable estimate of the variable costs of the sewer and wastewater treatment
services provided by the Sewage Disposal System to the users.
      (2)   Readiness-to-serve charge. Every user shall pay a readiness-to-
serve charge for sewer service on the basis of meter size in an amount and in
the manner determined by resolution of the Village Council and which fairly
apportions the fixed costs of providing sewer service for users of the sewage
disposal system and may include periodic depreciation expenses to allocate the
original cost of the system's assets over the life of those assets.
      (3)   Connection fee. Each user connecting or reconnecting to the Sewage
Disposal System shall pay a connection fee equal to the actual cost of the
material, labor, equipment and overhead related to the installation and
inspection of the connection or re-connection, as determined by resolution of
the Village Council.
      (4)   Capital connection fee. The Village Council may, by resolution,
establish a capital connection fee to defray or recover the cost of capital
improvements which are acquired and constructed for the primary purpose of
providing additional capacity determined by the village to be reasonably
necessary to accommodate:
         (a)   New connections to the Sewage Disposal System; or
         (b)   Modifications of existing connections for a use estimated to
demand the reservation of greater capacity of the Sewage Disposal System than
previously required. Every person seeking to connect previously unconnected
property to the Sewage Disposal System, or to reconnect previously connected
property to the Sewage Disposal System for a use estimated to demand the
reservation of greater capacity of the Sewage Disposal System, may be required
to pay a capital connection fee. A capital connection fee shall be established
and managed as provided in this section.
            1.   Calculation of estimated demand on capacity. The estimated
demand on capacity of a new connection to the Sewage Disposal System (or
modification of an existing connection to the Sewage Disposal System) shall be
based on the meter equivalency table set forth in division (B)(5) above.
            2.   Calculation of capital cost requirements. The capital costs to
be defrayed or recovered through the imposition of the capital connection fee
shall be determined annually by the village and shall be based on the estimated
cost of capital improvements incurred or to be incurred for the primary purpose
of providing additional capacity determined by the village to be reasonably
necessary to accommodate new connections to the Sewage Disposal System or
modifications of existing connections for a use estimated to demand the
reservation of greater capacity of the Sewage Disposal System than previously
required.
            3.   Credits. If the capital connection fee relates to an increase
in demand on capacity, the village shall credit against the specific amount of
the capital connection fee, the amount of any capital connection fee or similar
charges previously paid for connection of that property to the Water Supply
System.
      (5)   Sewer surcharges. The Village Council may, by resolution, establish
surcharges for the actual cost of treatment of pollutant loadings not normally
treated or in excess of those normally treated by the POTW, as described in §
52.25(F).
      (6)   Meter charge. Each user installing a water meter in accordance with
§
52.28(B) and (C) or a secondary irrigation meter in accordance with §
52.28(D) shall pay the actual cost of the meter and components plus a 10% fee
for administration and handling. The meter charge shall be in addition to the
connection fee and other fees and charges prescribed by this subchapter.
      (7)   Debt service charge. The charge assessed to users of the system
which is used to pay principal, interest, and administrative costs of retiring
the debt incurred for the construction of the Sewage Disposal System, and
construction of improvements of, and extensions to, the Sewage Disposal System.
      (8)   Equity buy-in. This fee may include a component that represents the
capital equity share within the system as established prior to the new or
expanded user's connection or a user's increased use of the system's capacity.
      (9)   Other fees. The Village Council may, by resolution, establish
certain additional fees as may be required to carry out the purposes of this
subchapter.
   (D)   Publication of rates. Following approval from time to time by the
Village Council of rates and charges or revisions thereto for use of the Sewage
Disposal System in accordance with this subchapter, the rates as approved by
the Village Council shall be published once in a newspaper of general
circulation in the village within 30 days of approval thereof.

§ 52.30 PROTECTION FROM DAMAGE.
   No unauthorized person shall enter or maliciously, willfully or negligently
break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure,
appurtenance or equipment which is a part of the Sewage Disposal System.
(Ord. 68, passed 10-24-2005) Penalty, see §
52.99
§ 52.31 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Notice of violation. The village may issue a notice of violation with
or without an order against any user believed to be in violation of this
subchapter and determine the civil administrative penalty, if any, to be
imposed. The notice of violation shall be served upon the user either by
personal delivery or by first class mail addressed to the user at his or her
billing address, except that an immediate cease and desist order may be written
or oral, and may also be served by telephone. The notice of violation shall
specify the:
      (1)   Date and time of issuance;
      (2)   Date(s), time(s) and place(s) of violation;
      (3)   Nature of the violation;
      (4)   Possible penalties under the ordinance; and
      (5)   The right of the alleged violator to present to the village written
explanations, information or other materials in answer to the notice, including
any defenses.
   (B)   Emergency suspensions and orders.
      (1)   Issuance of order. If the village determines that a user has
violated any provisions of this subchapter or other applicable laws or
regulations which the village is authorized to enforce, the village may issue
an order, with or without notice of violation and whether or not a notice of
violation was previously issued, to take action deemed appropriate under the
circumstances.
      (2)   Immediate cease and desist order.  The village may issue an order
to cease and desist from discharging any wastewater, incompatible pollutant or
illegal discharge. The order shall have immediate effect when the actual or
threatened discharge of pollutants to the Sewage Disposal System presents, or
may present, imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons, to the environment, or cause interference with the operation of the
Sewage Disposal System. If action is not taken immediately to correct illegal
discharge, the village will implement whatever action is necessary to halt the
discharge, including appropriate legal and/or equitable relief, in the
appropriate legal forum.
      (3)   Order to show cause. In cases other than those described in
division (B)(2) above, the village may issue an order to show cause why an
order to cease and desist by a certain time and date should not be issued. The
proposed time for remedial action shall be specified in the order to show
cause. The order may also contain the conditions deemed appropriate by the
village, including, but not limited to, a requirement to:
         (a)   Submit samples;
         (b)   Install sampling or monitoring equipment;
         (c)   Submit reports;
         (d)   Permit access for inspection, sampling, tests, monitoring and
investigations;
         (e)   Install and operate pre-treatment equipment;
         (f)   Reduce or eliminate a discharge or pollutants in a discharge;
and
         (g)   Payment of use permit fees.
      (4)   Disconnection orders. The Director may disconnect a user from the
Sewage Disposal System if the user violates any provision of a final order
issued pursuant to this section or an immediate cease and desist order issued
pursuant to division (B)(2) above (whether final or not).
      (5)   Content of orders. Any order issued by the village shall contain
the facts and grounds for its issuance and the remedial action ordered,
together with the time within the action shall be taken. No such order shall be
deemed insufficient, however, for inconsequential errors and omissions in the
facts and grounds for the order. If any user deems the content of the order to
contain insufficient information, it may request additional information from
the village; however, no request shall extend any time limit or defer any
payment, except as hereinafter set forth.

§ 52.35 BILLING AND COLLECTIONS; TERMINATION OF WATER AND SEWER SERVICE BY
VILLAGE.
   (A)   Billing.
      (1)   Meters shall be read at least quarterly.
      (2)   The Village Clerk shall render bills for sewer service provided by
the Sewage Disposal System and all other charges in connection therewith. Bills
for sewer service shall be sent quarterly and delivered to the user or owner of
the premises, as applicable, by mail. No bill for sewer service shall be
changed, altered or amended, nor shall the basis upon which it was computed be
changed or altered, without consent of a majority of the Village Council.
Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, all bills shall be payable by
day 30 following the mailing of the bill and shall be paid at the Village Hall.
      (3)   The Village Treasurer or an authorized agent of the village shall
collect all monies due for sewer service and all other charges in connection
with the operation of the Sewage Disposal System.
      (4)   If any billed charge for sewer service shall not be paid by day 30
following the mailing of the bill for which the charges were made, a delayed
payment charge of 10% of the amount of the bill shall be added thereto, plus
interest in an amount determined by Village Council resolution, and shall be
collected therewith.
      (5)   Failure of the user or owner of the premises served to receive any
bill shall not relieve the person of the liability for the charges incurred,
and the person shall notify the Village Clerk if a bill has not been received
by day 15 of the end of a quarterly billing period.
   (B)   Rates and charges to constitute lien on premises served.
      (1)   Tax lien. Under the provisions of Public Act 178 of 1939, being
M.C.L.A. §§ 123.161 through 123.167, as amended, and Act 94 of 1933, M.C.L.A. §
141.121, as amended, as security for the collection of sewer service supplied
to any house or any other building or any premises, lot or lots, or parcel or
parcels of land, the village shall have a lien upon the house or other
buildings and upon the premises, lot or lots, or parcel or parcels of land,
upon which the house or other building is situated. This lien shall become
effective immediately upon the distribution of the sewer service to the
premises or property supplied. This lien created herein shall be collected and
enforced in the same manner as provided for the collection of taxes assessed
upon the tax roll pursuant to Village Charter, except that the same shall not
be enforceable for more than three years after it becomes effective.
      (2)   The village shall annually, on April 1, certify to the appropriate
tax assessing officer or agency, all unpaid sewer service charges for the
services furnished to any premises, which, on the last day of March immediately
preceding April 1, have remain unpaid for a period of six months or more,
whereupon the charge shall be entered upon the next tax roll as a charge
against the piece of property or premises served. The charges shall be
collected and the lien thereof enforced in the same manner as general village
taxes.
      (3)   This lien remedy does not preclude any other remedy provided by
law.
      (4)   Lease exception. Charges for sewer services furnished to any
premises as described in the preceding paragraph, shall not be a lien thereon
if all of the following exist:
         (a)   A legally executed written lease between the owner of the
premises and the tenant containing a provision that the owner of the premises
shall not be liable for the paying of sewer services accruing subsequent to the
filing of an affidavit by the owner with the Village Clerk;
         (b)   An affidavit filed by the owner with the Village Clerk
containing statements as to the date of the execution of the lease, that the
lease contains a provision holding the tenant liable for sewer services on the
premises, the expiration date of the lease; and 20 days’ written notice shall
be given to the village by the lessor of any cancellation, change in, or
termination of the lease; and
   (C)   Deposits.
      (1)   Deposit required by tenant. If notice of a tenant’s liability has
been filed with the Village Clerk, the village shall render no further service
to such premises until a cash deposit in a sum sufficient to cover three times
the average quarterly bill for such premises, as estimated by the Village
Clerk, has been made as security for the payment of such charges.
      (2)   Deposit required for non-village service. Whenever services are
applied for under this chapter for premises located outside the village, the
Village Clerk shall forthwith advise Council of such application, and no such
service shall be furnished without the approval of Council, nor until a cash
deposit in a sum sufficient to cover three times the average quarterly bill for
such premises, as estimated by the Village Clerk, has been made as security for
the payment to secure all bills and charges. However, the Council may waive
this requirement in the event the property being served by the village sewer
services is covered by an agreement with Putnam Township to provide for the
collection of unpaid rates, fees, and charges and payment to the village by
placing such unpaid rates, fees, and charges on the township’s summer tax roll.
      (3)   The security deposit shall be retained by the village in a separate
account established for that purpose and shall be forfeited to the village if
the lessee of property contemplated in division (C)(1) above, or the owner on
property outside of the village contemplated in division (C)(2) above, shall be
or become delinquent in the payment of sewer rates or charges. Upon such
forfeiture of a security deposit, the Village Clerk shall transfer as much of
the sum of the deposit as is required to satisfy the delinquency to the credit
of the proper account, and the remainder, if there be any, shall be transferred
to the contingent reserve fund of the sewer department, as the case may be. The
property affected shall not be served again unless a new security deposit be
made in the same amount as the original, and disconnection preceding under
division (F) of this section shall be commenced.
      (4)   Monies deposited with the village for tenants under this division
(C), which shall not have been forfeited in the above described manner, shall
be returned to the depositor upon his or her application at the expiration of
the lease period. Such deposits may be left undisturbed to apply on renewals or
extensions of a lease for which the original deposit was made. Upon a sublease
or cancellation of a lease contemplated hereunder, security deposits shall,
upon request, be returned to the depositor. In the case of a sublease, no such
return shall be made unless there be a similar guarantee deposit made by the
holder of such sublease. Monies deposited with the village under this division
(C) for non-village property service, which shall not have been forfeited in
the above described manner, shall be returned to the depositor when all
services provided for in this chapter have been paid for in full and further
services are not required.
   (D)   Appeal of charges. Any user shall have the right to appeal any rates,
charges or fees levied in accordance with this subchapter. Appeals shall be
directed to the village within 30 days of the billing or invoice date along
with any supporting documentation. Any additional information required to
resolve the appeal shall be obtained by the user at his or her expense.
Resolution of appeals shall be made within 60 days by the Village Council or
its designee in accordance with the best available data and this subchapter.
All bills for rates and charges outstanding during the appeal process,
including all late payment fees or delinquency charges, shall continue to be
due and payable.
   (E)   No free service. No free service shall be furnished to any user of the
Sewage Disposal System.
   (F)   Termination of water and sewer service by village. The village
reserves the right to terminate a user’s sewer service and water service (if
the user is a customer of the village’s Water Supply System), in each case
where payment for sewer service has not been timely received, and/or for
violation of any of the rules and regulations of the village relating to the
Sewage Disposal System and/or the provisions of this subchapter.
      (1)   It is the policy of the village to discontinue sewer service under
this code to customers by reason of nonpayment of bills only after notice and a
meaningful opportunity to be heard on disputed bills. The village’s form for
application for sewer service and all bills shall contain, in addition to the
title, address, room number, and telephone number of the official in charge of
billing, clearly visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:
         (a)   That all bills are due and payable on or before the date set
forth on the bill;
         (b)   That if any bill is not paid by or before that date, a second

shall have a right to a hearing at which time he or she may be represented in
person and by counsel or any other person of his or her choosing and may
present orally or in writing his or her complaint and contentions to the
village official in charge of water billing. This official shall be authorized
to order that the customer’s service not be discontinued and shall have the
authority to make a final determination of the customer’s complaint.
      (2)   Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be entertained;
only questions of proper and correct billing will be considered. In the absence
of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided
herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified, but in no event
until the charges have been due and unpaid for at least 30 days.
      (3)   When it becomes necessary for the village to discontinue sewer
service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only
after all bills for service then due have been paid, along with a turn-on
charge in an amount set by Village Council.
   (G)   Litigation. In addition to discontinuing service to a delinquent user
and/or placing a lien on any premises for unpaid charges, the village shall
have the option of collecting all such delinquencies and penalties due by legal
proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (H)   Poverty exemption. This division (H) is known and cited as the Village
of Pinckney Utilities Poverty Exemption. In certain rare cases the village
reserves the right to grant forgiveness of a portion of utility billing,
provided that:
      (1)   The resident requesting hardship forgiveness of utility billing
meets all of these requirements:
         (a)   Is the head of the family or primary individual of a household;
         (b)   Has filed and been approved for a principle residence exemption
of property taxes through Putnam Township;
         (c)   The current total income from all sources for all persons living

         (d)   Is willing to provide adequate financial information for village
staff to determine a legitimate hardship status;
      (2)   The term of any exemption is for one year only and must be renewed
annually;
      (3)   A preliminary review board consisting of the Village Clerk, the
Village Treasurer, the Village Council President, and the DPW director reviews
application materials and recommends granting an exemption;
      (4)   Village Council then accepts that recommendation and approves the
exemption;
      (5)   The resident requesting hardship exemption identifies an achievable
payment amount, in consultation with the Village Clerk, and
      (6)   The resident requesting hardship exemption makes regular, on-time
payments of the exemption rate at intervals established in consultation with
the Village Clerk (i.e., the resident may ask to pay monthly instead of
quarterly).

§ 53.01 FINDINGS.
   The village finds:
   (A)   Discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system that are not
composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased non-point source
pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
   (B)   These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and
improper connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system from
residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments;
   (C)   These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually
but, geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have
cumulative impacts on receiving waters;
   (D)   The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and
safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life,
property values and other uses of lands and waters;
   (E)   These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills,
dumping and discharges into the municipal separate storm sewer system;
   (F)   The village is required to comply with a number of county, state and
federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the
impacts of stormwater runoff quality and non-point source pollution due to
improper non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer
system;
   (G)   Therefore, the Council adopts the ordinance from which the provisions
of this chapter derive to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of
spills, improper pumping and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer
system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and
safety and the environment.
(Ord. 121, passed 8-26-2013)
§ 53.02 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety,
environment and general welfare through the regulation of non-stormwater
discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent
practicable as required by federal law. This chapter establishes methods for
controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate storm
sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process.
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are to:
      (1)   Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate
storm sewer system by any person;
      (2)   Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the
municipal separate storm sewer system;
      (3)   Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills,
inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the municipal separate storm sewer
system; and
      (4)   Establish legal authority to carry out all inspection,
surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure
compliance with this chapter.
(Ord. 121, passed 8-26-2013)
§ 53.03 COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER REGULATIONS.
   This chapter is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule,
regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of this chapter are in
addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other
provision of law and where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions
different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other
provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher
protective standards for human health or the environment shall control.

an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person’s expense,
additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge
of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid
NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the
provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater management
plan (SWMP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.

that an immediate cease and desist order may be written or oral and may also be
served by telephone.
      (2)   The notice of violation shall specify the:

was previously issued, to take action deemed appropriate under the
circumstances.
      (2)   Immediate cease and desist order. The village may issue an order to
cease and desist from discharging any wastewater, incompatible pollutant,
illegal discharge or illegal connection. The order shall have immediate effect
when the actual or threatened discharge of pollutants to the MS4 presents, or
may present, imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons, to the environment or cause interference with the operation of the
MS4. If action is not taken immediately to correct illegal discharge, the
village will implement whatever action is necessary to halt the discharge,
including appropriate legal and/or equitable relief, in the appropriate legal
forum.
      (3)   Order to show cause. In cases other than those described in
division (B)(2) above, the village may issue an order to show cause why an
order to cease and desist by a certain time and date should not be issued. The

cause. The order may also contain the conditions deemed appropriate by the
village, including, but not limited to, a requirement to:

section or an immediate cease and desist order issued pursuant to division (B)
(2) above (whether final or not).
      (5)   Content of orders. Any order issued by the village shall contain
the facts and grounds for its issuance and the remedial action ordered,
together with the time within the action shall be taken. No such order shall be
deemed insufficient, however, for inconsequential errors and omissions in the
facts and grounds for the order. If any user deems the content of the order to
contain insufficient information, it may request additional information from
the village; however, no request shall extend any time limit or defer any
payment, except as hereinafter set forth.

approved or authorized by Council. The appeal shall be directed to the village
within 30 days of the issuance of the order or the effective date of any

   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish and impose
restrictions upon the construction and operation of outdoor furnaces within the
limits of the village to secure and promote the public health, safety and
welfare of the village and its inhabitants. Outdoor furnaces can create noxious
and hazardous smoke, soot, fumes, odors, air pollution, particles and other
products of combustion, particularly when restricted airflow and low operating
temperatures are present. These products can be detrimental to citizen's health
and can deprive neighboring residents of the enjoyment of their property. These
regulations are intended to eliminate noxious and hazardous conditions caused
by outdoor furnaces.
   (B)   Definition. For the purpose of this section, the following definition
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      FREE-STANDING FUEL-BURNING FURNACE. Any device or structure that:
         (a)   Is designed, intended or used to provide heat and/or hot water
to any residence, or other structure;
         (b)   Operates by the burning of wood or other fuel;
         (c)   Is not located within a residential or other structure for which
it provides heat, unless the structure is designed solely to house the furnace;
and
         (d)   Excluded from the definition of a FREE-STANDING FUEL-BURNING
FURNACE is any device which is not designed or used to heat a structure other
than the structure in which it is located.
   (C)   Regulations. It shall be unlawful to install or operate a free-
standing fuel-burning furnace, within the village.
   (D)   Existing free-standing fuel-burning furnace. This section shall not
apply to any freestanding fuel-burning furnace that was installed, connected
and operating as of the effective date of this section. However, this section
shall not be deemed as specific authorization for the use of any pre-existing
free-standing fuel-burning furnace and shall not be deemed to bar, limit or
otherwise affect the rights of any person to take private legal action
regarding damage to a nuisance caused by the use of a free-standing fuel-
burning furnace. If a pre-existing free-standing fuel-burning furnace is
converted, moved to a new location within the same property or is adapted to
service additional structures, it will be construed to be a newly installed
furnace and this section shall apply in its entirety. Any free-standing fuel-
burning furnace installed or operated in violation of this section is hereby
declared to be a nuisance per se.

STREET AND STREET RIGHT-OF-WAY PROTECTION
§ 92.01 NAME.
   This subchapter shall hereafter be known as the Village of Pinckney Street
and Street Right-of-Way Protection Ordinance.
(Ord. 57, passed 9-9-2002)
§ 92.02 PURPOSE.
   The Village of Pinckney needs to be able to monitor work in or upon the
village streets and street right-of-ways through the permitting process in
order to maintain and protect the condition of the streets and street right-of-
ways within the jurisdiction and control of the village. This enables the
village to coordinate activities between the village and other entities,
maintain a record of work within village streets, establish specific village
requirements to help protect village streets and street right-of-ways and to
supervise activities on village streets or within street right-of-ways that
could damage those streets or street right-of-ways.
(Ord. 57, passed 9-9-2002)
§ 92.03 PERMITS REQUIRED.
   Any work within or upon any village street or street right-of-way that will
include, but not be limited to, disturbing the pavement, curb and/or gutter,
driveway entrance or sidewalk, requires a permit for that purpose. A Utility
company, property owner, or his/her authorized agent, shall complete an
"application for authorization to construct utilities, excavate, or perform
work in village streets or right-of-way" to apply for a street right-of-way
permit at the village. The work would also include the movement of any trucks,
truck tractors or other heavy equipment upon village streets outside
established truck routes as established pursuant to §
71.06 and in accordance with the Motor Vehicle Code adopted by the village by
reference in §
70.01. The terms TRUCK and/or TRUCK TRACTOR as used herein, shall have the
meaning as set forth in M.C.L.A. § 257.75 and M.C.L.A. § 257.77, respectively.
Since there might be circumstances where travel by a truck or truck tractor
over a village street or street that is not a designated truck route is
necessary, especially for the development and/or construction of projects that
involve more than, or other than, a single-family dwelling, this subchapter
will provide a means by which the use of a non-designated truck route street
may be used. Any work that does not disturb the right-of-way is exempt from
permitting requirements except that traffic detours or lane closures must be
approved by the Director of Public Works and/or his or her designee. Work
covered under §§
92.25 et seq. shall be subject to the permitting process under §§
92.25 et seq.
   (B)   This subchapter shall not be deemed to apply to construction traffic
related to the construction, remodeling or repair of a new or existing single-
family home.
(Ord. 57, passed 9-9-2002; Ord. passed 10-2-2002; Ord. passed 10-7-2002; Ord.
155, passed 1-11-2021)
§ 92.04 OBTAINING A PERMIT.
   (A)   Prior to commencement of any work that would include, but not be
limited to, disturbing the pavement, curb and/or gutter, driveway entrance,
sidewalk, the street or street right-of-way or the movement of trucks, truck
tractors or heavy equipment upon village streets outside village established
truck routes, the necessary permit shall be obtained from the Director of
Public Works and/or his or her designee. If work on an existing permit has not
been started by the expiration date, the permit will become void and a new
permit will then be required to initiate the work. The fee for the permit shall
be in accordance with the fee schedule then in effect, plus any financial
guarantees that might be required, depending upon the nature of the work for
which the permit is sought. No permit will be issued until all fees and
guarantees have been paid and/or posted. The permit will be issued in the name
of the person who requests the permit and not in the name of the contractor or
subcontractor.
   (B)   In the event that the work proposed to be done provides a risk of
damage to the surface of the street or is the result of truck or truck tractor
traffic, or the movement of heavy equipment on streets outside established
village truck routes, the Director of Public Works shall refer the permit
applicant to the Village Council for issuance of a permit. The Village Council
shall review the application and, if a majority of the Council finds there is a
risk of damage or destruction to the street(s), the Council may decide to
withhold issuance of the permit until the applicant posts with the village an
adequate financial guarantee in cash, bond or a letter of credit acceptable to
the Village Council per § 152.026 regarding performance guarantee. The
guarantee shall be deemed adequate if it is in an amount equal to the cost that
would be incurred if the street surface had to be replaced for the length of
the street that will be traveled by the trucks, truck tractors or heavy
equipment. This replacement cost shall be computed by the Village Engineer
based upon then prevailing costs. The financial guarantee shall be held by the
village until two years after the work has been completed and all truck, truck
tractor and/or heavy equipment traffic has ceased its use of the village street
(s) or street right-of-way for the work for which the permit was issued or as
otherwise approved by the Village Council. Thereafter the Village Engineer
shall inspect the street to determine the extent of damage attributable to the
use. If any repairs or replacement is necessary the village shall order the
repairs to be made and the cost shall be deducted from the financial guarantee
and any remaining balance returned to the applicant. In the event the financial
guarantee proves to be insufficient to cover the repair costs, the applicant
shall be responsible to pay any shortfall. During the period of time when the
work is being done, or while the trucks, truck tractors or heavy equipment
traffic is using the street(s), the applicant shall insure that any dirt,
debris and the like from the work or work site is not allowed to accumulate on
village streets and shall clean the village street(s) for which the travel
route is specified as needed to accomplish this, unless otherwise agreed by the
Village Council. Failure of the applicant to so clean the street will be
grounds to allow the village, at its option, to clean the street(s) and assess
those costs to the applicant including obtaining reimbursement from the
guarantee.

155, passed 1-11-2021)
§ 92.05 RESPONSIBILITY.
   The applicant receiving the permit is responsible for the work performed,
and the village will contact the applicant to whom the permit was issued for
required adjustments or corrections regardless of whether the applicant
performed the work himself or herself or subcontracted and assigned the work.
The permit is issued to the person applying for the permit and that person is
solely responsible for the work performed.
(Ord. 57, passed 9-9-2002; Ord. 155, passed 1-11-2021)
§ 92.06 INSPECTION.
   In all cases the permit applicant shall notify the village when the work
will commence so, if necessary, arrangements may be made to have the Village
Engineer or qualified Village Agent present while the work is in progress. The
applicant will be billed for the necessary expense of this inspection in
accordance with the Village Fee Schedule.
(Ord. 57, passed 9-9-2002; Ord. 155, passed 1-11-2021)
§ 92.07 GENERAL WORK SITE RESPONSIBILITIES.
   The applicant shall be responsible to ensure that the condition of any
village street or street right-of-way is not damaged as a result of the project
for which the permit was issued. Pavement repairs shall be warranted until the
time as the village shall overlay or reconstruct the pavement. Should the
condition of a patch become such that additional pavement is in jeopardy of
failure, the applicant may be held responsible for an area larger than the
original repair. Other repairs (sidewalk, curb and gutter, trenches and the
like) shall be warranted for the reasonable life of the structures.
(Ord. 57, passed 9-9-2002; Ord. 155, passed 1-11-2021)
§ 92.08 ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS.
   (A)   In granting a permit, the Director of Public Works or the Village
Council may attach the conditions thereto as may be reasonably necessary to
prevent damage to public or private property or to prevent the operation from
being conducted in a manner hazardous to life or property or in a manner likely
to create a nuisance.
   (B)   The conditions may include, but shall not be limited to:
      (1)   Limitations on the period of time in which the work may be
performed;
      (2)   Restrictions as to the size and type of equipment commensurate with
the work to be done;
      (3)   Designation of routes upon which materials may be transported;

which could also include setting the hours during which work can be done in
accordance with the Village Technical Standards.
(Ord. 57, passed 9-9-2002; Ord. 155, passed 1-11-2021)
§ 92.09 PERMIT FEES.
   Permit fees shall be set forth in the Village Fee Schedule.

§ 92.10 ROADWAY AND PARKING LOT DESIGN CRITERIA.
   Roadway and parking lot design plans must be submitted to the village as
part of the final site plan application. The plans shall be designed and the
project constructed in accordance with the Village Technical Standards. Plans
are not required for projects limited to resurfacing of roadways or parking
lots.

STREET UTILITY RIGHT-OF-WAY
§ 92.25 PURPOSE.
   The Village of Pinckney needs to be able to monitor work in the village
streets and street right-of- ways through the permitting process in order to
maintain and protect the condition of the streets and street right-of-ways
within the jurisdiction and control of the village. This enables the village to
coordinate activities between the village and other entities, maintain a record
of work within village streets, establish specific village requirements to help
protect village streets and street right-of-ways and to supervise activities on
village streets or within street right-of-ways that could damage those streets

(Ord. 56, passed 11-27-2000; Ord. passed 9-9-2002)
§ 92.26 PERMITS REQUIRED.
   Any work within any village street or street right-of-way that will include,
but not be limited to, disturbing the pavement, curb and/or gutter, driveway
entrance, sidewalk, landscaping or grassed areas requires a permit. A utility
company, property owner, or his/her authorized agent, shall complete an
“application for authorization to construct utilities, excavate, or perform
work in village streets or right-of-way” to apply for a street right-of-way
permit at the village. This work may include, but is not limited to, utility
main and/or lateral replacement and repair, valve replacement and repair,

§ 92.27 EMERGENCY STREET CUTS.

requires immediate action, grant permission to make a necessary street cut or
excavation before a permit is issued. Street cuts shall be per § 92.31.

§ 92.28 OBTAINING PERMITS.

limited to, disturbing the pavement, curb and/or gutter, driveway entrance,
sidewalk, the street or street right-of-way or the movement of trucks or heavy
equipment upon village streets outside established truck routes, the necessary
permit shall be obtained from the village. Unless otherwise agreed, emergency
work requires that a permit be obtained as soon as possible but not later than
48 hours after the onset of work. Permits are usually issued for the time
period requested by the applicant. However, when situations warrant, the permit
expiration date may be extended if prior notification is received and the
applicant is otherwise in compliance with applicable village ordinances. If
work on an existing permit has not been started by the expiration date, the
permit will be canceled and a new permit will then be required to initiate the
work. The fee for the permit shall be in accordance with the fee schedule then
in effect, plus any financial guarantees that might be required, depending upon
the nature of the work for which the permit is sought. No permit will be issued
until all fees and guarantees have been paid and/or posted per Village Fee
Schedule and §
152.026.
   (B)   In the event that the work proposed to be done provides a risk of
damage to the surface of the street as the result of truck traffic, or the
movement of heavy equipment on streets outside established village truck
routes, the Village Engineer, Director of Public Works, or other qualified
Village Agent shall refer the permit applicant to the Village Council for
issuance of a permit. The Village Council shall review the application and, if
a majority of the Council finds there is a risk of damage or destruction to the
street(s), the Council may decide to withhold issuance of the permit until the
applicant posts with the village an adequate financial guarantee in cash or a
letter of credit acceptable to the Village Council. The guarantee shall be
deemed adequate if it is in an amount equal to the cost that would be incurred
if the street surface had to be replaced for the length of the street that will
be traveled by the trucks or heavy equipment. This replacement cost shall be
computed by the Village Engineer based upon then prevailing costs. The
financial guarantee shall be held by the village until one year after the work
has been completed and all truck and/or heavy equipment traffic has ceased its
use of the village street(s) or street right-of-way for the work for which the
permit was issued. Thereafter the Village Engineer shall inspect the street to
determine the extent of damage attributable to the use. If any repairs or
replacement is necessary, the village shall order the repairs to be made and
the cost shall be deducted from the financial guarantee and any remaining
balance returned to the applicant. In the event the financial guarantee proves
to be insufficient to cover the repair costs, the applicant shall be
responsible to pay any shortfall. During the period of time when the work is
being done, or while the truck or heavy equipment traffic is using the street
(s), the applicant shall insure that any dirt, debris and the like from the
work or work site is cleaned from the village street(s) on a daily basis unless
otherwise agreed by the Village Council. Failure of the applicant to so clean
the street will be grounds to allow the village, at its option, to clean the
street(s) and deduct those costs from the guarantee.

Marihuana Act, 2018 IL 1, M.C.L.A. 333.27951 et seq. (hereafter referred to as
the "MRTMA"), The Village finds that these activities are significantly
connected to the public health, safety, security and welfare of its residents
and it is therefore necessary to regulate and enforce safety, security, fire,
policing, health and sanitation practices related to such activities. This
ordinance also provides a method to defray the costs incurred by such
regulation and enforcement.
   (B)   It is not the intent of this subchapter to diminish, abrogate or
restrict protections for the medical use of marihuana provided in the Michigan
Medical Marihuana Act. Nothing in this subchapter is intended to grant
individuals immunity from the enforcement of federal laws prohibiting marihuana
activity. The provisions of this subchapter are regulatory in nature and not
intended to be interpreted as zoning laws.

initial Class C grower license or a municipal license holder that has been
issued a Class C grower license may apply for one or more stacked licenses at
the same municipally licensed premise subject to all requirements of the MRTMA,
administrative rules and local regulations. Each stacked license is subject to
all applicable fees for application and renewal. There are two categories for a

additional special land use approved by the Planning Commission and can be

additional impact to water and wastewater capacity and treatment. Such review
would be paid for by the applicant.
      (2)   Stacked license - major. A major license is one that requires
changes to the municipally licensed premise or municipally licensed property
and/or has changes to the information provided in the original Class C grower
application; for example, changes to owner/operator information, alterations to

   (E)   Asphalt based sealcoat products. The provisions of this section shall
only apply to coal tar or other high PAH content sealant products in the

distribute sealants containing any of the substances herein prohibited.
Enforcement shall be the responsibility of the Zoning Administrator and the
Police Department in coordination to identify, investigate, and cite the owner
of any property in violation immediately upon being made aware. The
recognizable odor of coal tar or other high PAH substances as identified by any
village employee is considered sufficient to prove violation in the absence of
containers, packaging, receipts, or any other documents. Any person or entity
found to be in violation during or after application shall be ticketed and
fined; there is no option of a warning or relaxation of this section in any
way.
   (H)   Penalty. Any person or entity that violates any of the provisions of

§ 151.01 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Village of Pinckney's
Wetlands and Watercourses Ordinance.
(Ord. 34, passed 7-24-1989)
§ 151.02 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The wetlands and watercourses of the village are indispensable but
sensitive natural resources subject to flooding, erosion, soil bearing capacity
limitations and other hazards.
   (B)   In their natural state, wetlands and watercourses serve multiple
functions for flood control, stormwater storage and release, pollution control,
erosion control, wildlife habitat, aesthetics, open space and recreation.
   (C)   The continued destruction and loss of wetlands and watercourses
constitutes a distinct and immediate danger to the public health, safety and
general welfare.
   (D)   Pursuant to the Michigan Constitution 1963, Art. IV, 52, the
conservation and development of natural resources of the state is a matter of
paramount public concern in the interest of the health, safety and general
welfare of the people.
   (E)   It is, therefore, the policy of the Village of Pinckney:
      (1)   To protect wetlands and watercourses while taking into account
varying economic, ecological, hydrologic, recreation and aesthetic values;
      (2)   To provide for the protection, preservation, replacement, proper
maintenance and use of wetlands and watercourses located in the Village of
Pinckney in order to minimize disturbance to them and to prevent damage from
erosion, siltation and flooding;
      (3)   To provide for the issuance of use permits and approved activities;
      (4)   To establish standards and procedures for the review of proposed
activities in wetlands and watercourses; and
      (5)   To establish penalties for the violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 34, passed 7-24-1989)
§ 151.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context indicates or requires a different meaning.

   AQUATIC VEGETATION. Plants and plant life forms which naturally occur in,
at, near or predominantly near water.
   BOTTOMLANCK. All land area of a lake, stream or watercourse which lies below
the ordinary high water mark and which may or may not be covered by water.
   CHANNEL. The geographical area within the natural or artificial banks of a
watercourse required to convey continuously or intermittently flowing water
under normal or average flow conditions.
   CONTIGUOUS. Any of the following:
      (1)   A permanent surface water connection or other direct physical
contact with an inland lake or pond;
      (2)   A seasonal or intermittent direct surface water connection; and
      (3)   A wetland partially or entirely located within 500 feet of the
ordinary high water mark.
   DRAINAGEWAY. Any drain, pipe, stream, creek or swale which serves to
transport water runoff to the primary watercourse system.
   FILL MATERIAL. Any soil, sand, gravel, clay, peat, debris and refuse, waste
of any kind or any other material which displaces soil or water or reduces
water retention potential.
   HYDRIC SOIL. A soil that is saturated, flooded or ponded long enough during
the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part.
   MINOR ACTIVITIES. Activities that are similar in nature, that will cause
only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed separately and that
will have only minimal cumulative adverse effects on the environment.
   MINOR DRAINAGE. Includes ditching or tiling for the removal of excess soil

markedly distinct from the upland and is apparent in the soil itself, the
configuration of the surface of the soil and the vegetation. On an inland lake
which has a level established by law, the ordinary high water mark means the
high establishing level. When water returns to its natural level as a result of
the permanent removal and abandonment of a dam, it means the natural ordinary
high water mark.

means an uninterruptible time period less than one year in duration.
   WATERCOURSE. Any waterway, drainageway, drain, river, stream, lake, pond or
retention basin, or any body of surface water having well defined banks,
whether continually or intermittently flowing. Watercourses subject to
regulation are designated on the official wetlands map.
   WETLANDS. Lands characterized by the presence of water at a frequency and
duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support
wetland vegetation or aquatic life and are commonly referred to as bogs,
swamps, marshes and wet meadows.

§ 152.026 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE.
   (A)   Purpose. The Village Council or Qualified Village Agent may require
that a performance guarantee be deposited with the Village Clerk to ensure
compliance with the provisions of this chapter and any conditions imposed
hereunder and full completion of necessary improvements [see definition under §
152.026 (B), below]. The performance guarantee shall be of an amount equal to
125% of the estimated construction costs associated with the project to cover
costs associated with the normal rate of inflation.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      IMPROVEMENTS. Those features and actions associated with a project that
are considered necessary by the Planning Commission or Village Council to
protect natural resources or the public health, safety and welfare, including
roads, lighting, utilities, sidewalks, screening, landscaping and drainage.
Improvements do not include the entire project that is the subject of zoning
approval.
      PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE. A cash deposit, certified check, irrevocable bank
letter of credit, corporate surety bond or combination thereof, in the amount
of 125% of the estimated cost of the improvements for which the guarantee is
required.
   (C)   Estimated cost of improvements. The estimated cost of the improvements
for which a performance guarantee is required shall be determined by the
applicant and verified by the village. The village shall be authorized to
employ the Village Engineer and/or Department of Public Works and/or
consultants to review cost estimates and conduct periodic inspections of the
improvements. If the amount of the estimated cost is not reasonably
ascertainable by the village, the applicant may be required to submit:
      (1)   A certified estimate prepared by the applicant's licensed engineer
or architect; or
      (2)   Alternatively, a bona fide contract for the work to be performed,
including a provision authorizing enforcement of the contract by the village in
the event of a default by the applicant.
   (D)   Terms and provisions of performance guarantees.
      (1)   The performance guarantee shall be deposited with the Village Clerk
at the time of the issuance of a land use permit authorizing the development.
The village may not require the deposit of the performance guarantee before the
date on which the village is prepared to issue the land use permit.
      (2)   The land use permit shall prescribe the period of time within which
the improvements for which the performance guarantee has been required are to
be completed. This period shall begin from the date of issuance of the land use
permit and shall not exceed two years.
      (3)   A letter of credit and corporate surety bond shall cover a time
period equal to or longer than the time anticipated to complete improvements,
and shall require 30 days' advance written notice to the village prior to
termination.
      (4)   If the performance guarantee is in the form of cash or a certified
check, the Clerk shall deposit the funds in an interest-bearing account in a
financial institution with which the village regularly conducts business.
      (5)   The entire performance guarantee, including accrued interest, shall
be returned to the applicant upon satisfactory completion of the required
improvements, as determined by the village.
      (6)   In the event the performance guarantee posted is a cash deposit or
certified check, the village, upon written request by the applicant, shall
rebate to the applicant 50% of the deposited funds when 75% of the required
improvements are completed as confirmed by the village, and rebate the
remaining 50% of the deposited funds when 100% of the required improvements are
completed as confirmed by the village.
      (7)   In the event the applicant does not install or maintain the
required improvements within the time period established by the village,
following notice to the property owner and/or other responsible parties, the
village shall have the right to use the performance guarantee and any accrued
interest to complete the improvements through contract or otherwise, including
specifically the right to enter upon the subject property to make the
improvements. One or more of the following methods may be used to provide
notice to the property owner, regular mail to the address on the permit
application and/or by delivery of the notice to the property owner at the
address and/or by posting the property.
      (8)   If the performance guarantee is not sufficient to allow the village
to complete the improvements for which the guarantee was posted, the applicant
shall be required to pay the village the amount by which the cost of completing
the improvements exceeds the amount of the performance guarantee deposited.
Should the village use the performance guarantee, or a portion thereof to
complete the required improvements, any amounts remaining after the completion
shall be applied first to the village's administrative costs including, without
limitation, attorney fees, planning consultant fees, engineering consultant
fees and similar expenses, with any balance remaining being refunded to the
applicant.
      (9)   If the applicant has posted a performance guarantee or bond with
another governmental agency other than the village to insure completion of a
required improvement, the applicant shall not be required to deposit a
performance guarantee with the village for that same improvement.
      (10)   At the time the performance guarantee is deposited with the
village and prior to the issuance of a land use permit, the applicant may be
required to enter into a written agreement with the village incorporating the
terms and provisions applicable to the use of the performance guarantee,
provided, however, that in the absence of such an agreement, the terms and
provisions of this section shall govern.
      (11)   A performance guarantee in the form of a performance bond shall be
posted by the proprietor prior to the beginning of construction to insure
complete construction of structures and development of the land area as
proposed and approved. Such bond shall be posted in an amount equal to 125% of
the estimated cost of the site improvements as identified in the fee schedule
and may be reduced in proportion to the amount of work accomplished or the
amount of land left undisturbed upon recommendation of the Village Engineer or
Qualified Village Agent. A performance bond shall be returnable in full upon
the issuance of a certificate of compliance of the completion of all
construction phases, and approval from the Village Engineer or Qualified
Village Agent. The performance bond will meet the requirements set forth in §
152.026(E)(1) through (E)(4).
   (E)   Maintenance and guarantee bonds. The proprietor shall submit to the
village a two-year maintenance and guarantee bond, equal to the estimated cost
of the site improvements as established by the fee schedule. This shall be done
before the village accepts any improvements by the proprietor. An acceptable
surety bond shall be issued:
      (1)   By a company licensed to do business in the State of Michigan by
the Department of Labor and Economic Growth, Office of Financial and Insurance
Services;
      (2)   By a company with a rating of not less than "A" as determined by
A.M. Best Company or a similarly recognized rating agency;
      (3)   In a form that does not require the village to expend money to
complete the project bonded and thereafter seek reimbursement from the surety
company; and
      (4)   With a provision specifying that any dispute on whether and/or the
amount of payment to be made by the surety shall be resolved by binding
arbitration.
   (F)   Insurance.
      (1)   Prior to construction and/or project improvements, the contractor
shall procure and maintain during the term of the project, public liability and
property damage insurance with an insurance company rated A+ with Michigan Best
Rating System, in such amounts as will be adequate to protect the public, the
village, village employees and agents, Village Engineer, Livingston County
Drain Commission, Livingston County Road Commission, Livingston County Building
Department, and other parties of interest as required by the village and shall
not be less than the limits set forth in the fee schedule.
      (2)   Certificates of insurance will be furnished and the Village of
Pinckney will be the certificate holder. Underground construction, where
applicable, shall be specified in the coverage. Certificates of coverage signed
by the insurance carriers shall include a guarantee that 30 days written notice
shall be given by the insurance carrier to the village prior to cancellation of
or any changes in the respective policies. In the event that insurance is
canceled, operations shall cease prior to the cancellation date and shall not
resume until evidence is provided that proper insurance is again in effect.
Additional insured shall include the Village of Pinckney, the Village Council
and individual members thereof, village employees and agents for the village,
the Village Engineer and their employees, Livingston County Drain Commission,
Livingston County Road Commission, Livingston County Building Department and

classify a use that is not specifically listed along with a comparable
permitted or prohibited use for the purpose of clarifying the use regulations
in any district, if so petitioned in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter. If the Zoning Board of Appeals finds no comparable uses based on an
examination of the characteristics of the proposed use, it shall so state and
the Planning Commission may be petitioned to initiate an amendment to the text

right or special approval) and criteria that will apply for that use. Once the
ordinance has been amended to include the new regulations, then an application
to establish that use can be processed.

units/acre
      136 rooms/3 rooms = 45 two-bedroom units/five acres = 9.0 dwelling units/
acre
      136 rooms/4 rooms = 34 three-bedroom units/five acres = 6.8 dwelling
units/acre

152.280 et seq. upon finding that all of the criteria in §
152.281(B) are met.
   (G)   Compliance required. Uses and structures shall comply with all other
provisions of this chapter, including §§
152.240 et seq. through §§
152.415 et seq. and all other applicable federal, state and local codes and
ordinances.

the following items: rooflines and cornices, fenestration and brackets, shape
and style of windows, shape and style of lights within windows, colors and
finish materials. Exterior building materials shall employ a variety of
textures and colors and window and door details. Desirable materials include
brick, stone (natural and cast), wood siding and glass. Exterior materials that
should not be used in large applications, but can be used as detail material or
as a small application include EIFS (exterior insulation and finishing system),
vinyl siding, asphalt or metal siding, composite fiberglass and reflective
glass. Review of architectural concepts, colors and materials will be part of
the site plan review.
      (1)   Additions to buildings. New construction, additions and
modifications to buildings shall be harmonious with the historic scale and
nature of other structures in the vicinity. Additions may be made to building
facades not facing a street. Additions to a structure may be permitted except
that additions to a structure’s facade (the front side of the building facing
the street) may be made only when such addition adds to the historical or
architectural value and significance of the structure. Items to be considered
for site plan review include the following:
         (a)   Whether modifications are consistent with the existing
architectural motif;
         (b)   Whether new exterior additions are constructed to minimize the
loss of historical materials and so that character-defining features are not
obscured, damaged, destroyed or covered;
         (c)   Whether attached exterior additions are located at the rear or
on an inconspicuous side of a historic building and minimize, to the extent
possible, its size and scale relative to the historic building; and
         (d)   Whether new exterior additions are designed in a manner that
makes clear what is historic and what is new while maintaining consistent
design motifs from the historical building.
      (2)   Constancy.  General architecture, front facade and overall building
appointments should be consistent with the historical buildings of the downtown
Main Street area. As an example, a multistory, brick building with historically
formatted storefront windows and doors with upper and lower cornices.
      (3)   Surface covering. Existing and proposed buildings may be painted or
stained to be consistent with the majority of the established buildings in the
area or which are consistent with a documented earlier or original condition of
existing buildings. Surfaces which are currently covered by wood, vinyl or
aluminum siding may be repaired with the same material as currently exists.
Exterior color shall be consistent with the majority of the established
buildings in the Central Business District. “Non-traditional” or “Non-
historical” colors are not permitted. The use of paint to attract attention or
advertise using geometric shapes and color, or is in other ways inconsistent
with the surrounding architecture is prohibited.
   (J)   First floor. All new buildings shall have at least 70% of their first
floor facade on the street-facing sidewalk as non-reflective/non-tinted glass.
The use of reflective/tinted glass on the first floor side and rear windows is
discouraged. Use of reflective/tinted windows requires Planning Commission
approval.
   (K)   Pedestrian entrance. All new buildings shall have at least one
pedestrian entrance on the front. Rear or side entrances should be provided
where parking is on the side or rear of the building.
   (L)   Businesses to be retail and service establishments.  All business
establishments shall be retail or service establishments dealing directly with
customers. All goods produced on the premises shall be sold at retail on
premises where produced.
   (M)   Where business conducted. All business, servicing or processing,
except for loading, shall be conducted within a completely enclosed building.
   (N)   Exterior walls and hiding unsightly objects. Exterior walls facing
public rights-of-way, customer-parking areas and adjoining property that is
zoned or used for residential purposes shall have a finished appearance, using
the same materials as used on the front of the building. Wherever possible,
meter boxes, dumpsters and mechanical equipment should be screened on a side of
the building that faces residentially zoned or used property, or mounted and
screened on the roof.
   (O)   Site design. The site design shall be sensitive to pedestrian and
bicycle needs. Buildings over 6,000 square feet gross floor area must provide a
minimum of two bicycle hoops.
   (P)   Additional standards. The Planning Commission may determine that
additional standards are required to be harmonious with the historic scale and
nature of other structures in the vicinity. To achieve this objective the
Planning Commission may, at its discretion, add to or modify the required
standards above.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
§ 152.230 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this subchapter to allow flexibility in
development which either includes a mix of land uses or is proposed for a site
containing unique natural features which the developer and the village desire
to preserve. The standards of this subchapter are intended to encourage
innovative design and to create opportunities which may not be obtainable
through the more rigid standards of the other zoning districts.
   (B)   The Planned Unit Development (hereinafter referred to in this
subchapter as the “PUD”) standards are not intended to be used as a technique
to circumvent the intent of this chapter, to avoid imposition of specific
zoning ordinance standards, or the planning upon which this chapter is based.
Thus, the provisions of this subchapter are designed to promote land use
substantially consistent with recommendations of the village's master plan and
the character of the surrounding area, with modifications and departures from
generally applicable requirements made to provide the developer with
flexibility in design on the basis of the total PUD plan approved by the
village.
(Ord. 150, passed 10-12-2020)
§ 152.231 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   A PUD may be applied for in any zoning district. The approval of a PUD
application shall require a rezoning by way of amendment of this chapter upon
the recommendation of the Village Planning Commission and approval of the
Village Council. The process for PUD approval shall be in accordance with §
152.235. Notification and public hearing requirements shall be in accordance
with §
152.460.
   (B)   Generally, proposed uses shall be consistent with the underlying

      (2)   Storage. It is hereby determined that the storage or accumulation
of trash, junk, junk vehicles, abandoned vehicles, building materials,
construction equipment and the maintenance of blighted structures upon any
private property within the Village of Pinckney tends to result in blighted and
deteriorated neighborhoods, the spread of vermin and disease, the increase in
nuisance complaints and therefore is contrary to the public health, safety and
general welfare of the community.
      (3)   Unlawful storage. It shall be unlawful for any person to store, or
to permit the storage or accumulation of trash, rubbish, junk, junk vehicles or
abandoned vehicles on any private property in the village except within a
completely enclosed building or upon the premises of a legally operating,
licensed or approved junk dealer, junk buyer, dealer in used auto parts, dealer
in second-hand goods or junk, or operator of an vehicle repair service and/or
automobile wrecker business.
      (4)   Unlawful maintenance. It shall be unlawful for any person to keep
or maintain any vacant or blighted structure, unless the same is kept securely
locked, the windows kept glazed or neatly boarded up and otherwise protected to
prevent entrance thereto by unauthorized persons or unless the structure is in
the course of construction in accordance with a valid building permit issued by
the county for the Village of Pinckney and unless the construction is completed
with one year.
      (5)   Accumulation of building materials and construction equipment. It
shall be unlawful for any person to store or permit the storage or accumulation
of building materials or construction equipment on any private property, except
in a completely enclosed building or except where the building materials and/or
construction equipment are part of the stock in trade or business located on
the property, or except when the materials are being used in the construction
of a structure on the property in accordance with a valid building permit
issued by Livingston County for the Village of Pinckney.
      (6)   Unlawful storage of commercial purposes. It shall be unlawful for
any person to store any item, material or substance used for commercial
purposes on a lot in the R1, R2, R3, R4 or ROB District, except in a completely
enclosed building and when the materials are being lawfully used in conjunction
with an approved home occupation or otherwise permitted use.
      (7)   Unlawful storage of vehicles. It shall be unlawful for any person
to store more than a combined total of three licensed or unlicensed, operable
recreational vehicles outdoors on a lot in a residential district, 24 hours per
day for more than 30 consecutive days.
      (8)   Inspection. If upon inspection, the Building Inspector, Zoning
Administrator, any village police officer, Fire Inspector, health officer,
elected official or County Health Department shall find that any property
within the village is being used in violation of the above sections of this
chapter, the owner and/or occupant shall be notified of the violation which may
be given by certified letter to the owner as he or she appears on the tax rolls
of the village or by service upon the occupant personally by any official of
the Village of Pinckney or the Livingston County Health Department.
      (9)   Appeals. The owner and/or occupant may appeal to the Village
Council for a public hearing, which shall be held at the next regular Council
meeting providing he or she files a request in writing with the Village Clerk
within ten days of the receipt of the notice above specified. Following the
hearing, the decision of the Village Council as to the violation shall be
final.
      (10)   Costs eliminated. If the owner and/or occupant of the premises
shall not cause the material in violation of this chapter, as described above,
to be eliminated or removed within ten days after notice or within ten days
after the decision of the Village Council is rendered in case of an appeal, the
Village President shall direct some person or persons to remove and/or
eliminate the same at the cost and expense of the owner and/or occupant of the
premises. After causing the materials to be eliminated or removed, the Village
President may obtain a judgment against the owner and/or occupant in the amount
of the total expense incurred by the village which shall be a lien upon the
property and the same may be collected in any manner authorized by statute and,
if not paid, may be placed on the Tax Roll and collected the same as other
taxes.
   (M)   Screening dumpsters.
      (1)   Design. Outside dumpsters serving a multiple-family residential or
commercial use shall be:
         (a)   Located on concrete pads of sufficient size and construction to
prevent containers from leaking directly onto the ground and to fully support
the containers without cracking;
         (b)   Completely surrounded with a fence or wall and gate at least six
feet in height, so as not to be visible from adjacent lots or roads; and
         (c)   The design and materials of the surrounding fence or wall and
gate shall be compatible with the architectural style of the buildings on the
site, as determined by the Planning Commission. Acceptable materials may
include treated wood, brick and vinyl.
      (2)   Landscaping. The Planning Commission, at its discretion, may
require planting around dumpsters if deemed necessary due to the proximity of
public and/or conflicting uses.
      (3)   Location. Dumpsters shall be consolidated to minimize the number of
collection sites. Dumpsters and enclosures shall be located:
         (a)   Away from public view insofar as possible, and on that side
which is opposite or the maximum distance possible from adjacent residential
uses; and
         (b)   So that they do not cause excessive nuisance or offense to the
occupants of nearby buildings.
      (4)   Maintenance. Dumpsters, enclosures and the immediately surrounding
area shall be continuously maintained to be fully functioning, aesthetically
pleasing and free of litter and debris.
   (N)   Conditional re-zoning of land. It is recognized that there are certain
instances where it would be in the best interest of the village, as well as
advantageous to property owners seeking a change in zoning boundaries, if
certain conditions could be offered by property owners as part of a request for
a re-zoning. It is the intent of this section to provide a process consistent
with the provisions of § 405 of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act (Public Act
110 of 2006) as amended by which an owner seeking a re-zoning may voluntarily
propose conditions regarding the use and/or development of land as part of the
re-zoning request. Therefore, as an alternative to a re-zoning amendment as
described in §
152.460, the Village of Pinckney may allow conditional re-zoning to help ensure
the proper use of land and natural resources and to allow for a more flexible
approach to the re-zoning process in accordance with the Michigan Zoning
Enabling Act (Public Act 110 of 2006), as amended. If a property owner submits
an offer for conditional re-zoning as provided within this section, then the
procedure for the proposed conditional re-zoning of land shall follow the
standards and procedures as noted below.
      (1)   Procedure. The amendment procedure for a conditional re-zoning
shall follow the same procedure as a traditional re-zoning amendment pursuant
to §
152.460, except as modified by this section.
      (2)   Application and offer of conditions. An owner of land may
voluntarily offer in writing conditions relating to the use and/or development
of land for which a re-zoning is requested. This offer may be made either at
the time the application for re-zoning is filed or may be made at a later time
during the re-zoning process. In addition to the procedures as noted in §
152.460, the following procedures, standards and requirements apply to all
proposed conditional re-zoning requests:
         (a)   A conditional re-zoning request must be voluntarily offered by
the owner of land within the village. All offers must be made in writing and
must provide the specific conditions to be considered by the village as part of
the re-zoning request. The offer may be made either at the time the application
for re-zoning is filed or may be made at a later time during the re-zoning
process. All offers shall be in the form of a written agreement approved by the
village and property owner, incorporating the conditional re-zoning site plan
when required below and setting forth any conditions and terms mutually agreed
upon by the parties relative to the land for which the conditional re-zoning is
sought.
         (b)   Conditional re-zoning shall not allow a use or activity that
would not otherwise be allowed in the proposed zoning district.
         (c)   Conditional re-zoning shall not alter any of the various zoning
requirements for the use(s) in question, i.e. parking, landscaping, lot area,
lot width, building height, setbacks, lot area coverage and the like.
Conditional re-zonings shall not grant zoning variances of any kind. Any zoning
variance must follow the provisions of §§
152.440 et seq.
         (d)   The owner's offer of conditions shall bear a reasonable and
rational relationship to the property and the surrounding area for which re-
zoning is requested.
         (e)   Conditional re-zoning shall not grant, nor be considered as a
grant of special land use approval. The process for review and approval of
special land uses must follow the provisions of §§
152.240 et seq.
         (f)   All conditions offered by a land owner in relation to a re-
zoning request must have a direct relationship to the re-zoning itself. The
provisions to allow conditional re-zoning shall not be construed to allow re-
zoning by exaction.
         (g)   In addition to the informational requirements provided for in §
152.460, the applicant may be required by the village to provide a conditional
re-zoning site plan prepared by a licensed professional allowed to prepare the
plans under this chapter that may show the location, size, height or other
measures for and/or of buildings, structures, improvements and features on, and
in some cases adjacent to the property that is the subject of the conditional
re-zoning of land. The details to be offered for inclusion in the conditional
re-zoning site plan shall be determined by the applicant, subject to approval
of the village. A conditional re-zoning site plan shall not replace the
requirement under this chapter for site plan review and approval, or
subdivision or site condominium approval, as the case may be.
         (h)   The offer of conditions may be amended during the process of re-
zoning consideration provided that any amended or additional conditions are
entered voluntarily by the owner. If the amendment occurs subsequent to the
Planning Commission's public hearing on the original re-zoning request, then
the re-zoning application shall be referred to the Planning Commission for a
new public hearing with appropriate notice and a new recommendation.
         (i)   An owner may withdraw all or part of his or her offer of
conditions any time prior to final re-zoning action of the Village Council
provided that, if the withdrawal occurs subsequent to the Planning Commission's
public hearing on the original re-zoning request, then the re-zoning
application shall be referred to the Planning Commission for a new public
hearing with appropriate notice and a new recommendation.
      (3)   Planning Commission review.  The Planning Commission, after public
hearing and consideration of the factors for re-zoning set forth in §
152.461, may recommend approval, approval with recommended changes or denial of
the re-zoning; provided, however, that any recommended changes to the offer of
conditions are acceptable to and thereafter offered by the owner.
      (4)   Village Council review. After receipt of the Planning Commission's
recommendation, the Village Council shall deliberate upon the requested re-
zoning and may approve or deny the conditional re-zoning request. The Village
Council deliberation shall include, but not be limited to, a consideration of
the factors for re-zoning set forth in §
152.461. Should the Village Council consider amendments to the proposed
conditional re-zoning advisable and is such contemplated amendments to the
offer of conditions are acceptable to and thereafter offered by the owner, then
the Village Council shall, in accordance with § 401 of the Michigan Zoning
Enabling Act (Public Act 110 of 2006), as amended, refer the amendments to the
Planning Commission for a report thereon within a time specified by the Village
Council and proceed thereafter in accordance with the statute to deny or
approve the conditional re-zoning with or without amendments.
      (5)   Approval.
         (a)   If the Village Council finds the re-zoning request and offer of
conditions acceptable, the offered conditions shall be incorporated into a
formal written Statement of Conditions acceptable to the owner and conforming
in form to the provisions of this section. The Statement of Conditions shall be
incorporated by attachment or otherwise as an inseparable part of this chapter
adopted by the Village Council to accomplish the requested re-zoning.
         (b)   The Statement of Conditions shall:
            1.   Be in a form recordable with the Livingston County Register of
Deeds and in a manner acceptable to the Village Council;
            2.   Contain a legal description of the land to which it pertains;
            3.   Contain a statement acknowledging that the statement of
conditions runs with the land and is binding upon successor owners of the land;
            4.   Incorporate by attachment or reference any diagram, plans or
other documents submitted or approved by the owner that are necessary to
illustrate the implementation of the Statement of Conditions. If any documents
are incorporated by reference, the reference shall specify the date of the
document and where the document may be examined;
            5.   Contain a statement acknowledging that the Statement of
Conditions shall be recorded by the village with the Livingston County Register
of Deeds; and
            6.   Contain the notarized signatures of all of the owners of the
subject land preceded by a statement attesting to the fact that they
voluntarily offer and consent to the provisions contained within the Statement
of Conditions.
         (c)   Upon the re-zoning taking effect, the zoning map shall be
amended to reflect the new zoning classification along with a designation that
the land was re-zoned with a Statement of Conditions. The Village Clerk shall
maintain a listing of all lands re-zoned with a Statement of Conditions.
         (d)   The approved Statement of Conditions shall be filed by the
village with the Livingston County Register of Deeds. The Village Council shall
have the authority to waive this requirement if it determines that, given the
nature of the conditions and/or the time frame within which the conditions are
to be satisfied, the recording of such a document would be of no material
benefit to the village or to any subsequent owner of the land.
         (e)   Upon the re-zoning taking effect, the use of the land so re-
zoned shall conform thereafter to all of the requirements regulating the use
and development within the new zoning district as modified by any more
restrictive provisions contained in the Statement of Conditions.
      (6)   Compliance with conditions.
         (a)   Any person who establishes a development or commences a use upon
land that has been re-zoned with conditions shall continuously operate and
maintain the development or use in compliance with all of the conditions set
forth in the Statement of Conditions. Any failure to comply with a condition
contained within the Statement of Conditions shall constitute a violation of
this Zoning Ordinance and be punishable accordingly. Additionally, any such
violation shall be deemed a nuisance per se and subject to judicial abatement
as provided by law.
         (b)   No permit or approval shall be granted under this chapter for
any use or development that is contrary to an applicable Statement of
Conditions.
      (7)   Time period for establishing development or use. Unless another
time period is specified in the ordinance re-zoning the subject land, the
approved development and/or use of the land pursuant to building and other
required permits must be commenced upon the land within 18 months after the re-
zoning took effect and thereafter proceed diligently to completion. This time
limitation may, upon written request, be extended by the Village Council if:
         (a)   It is demonstrated to the Village Council's reasonable
satisfaction that there is a strong likelihood that the development and/or use
will commence within the period of extension and proceed diligently thereafter
to completion; and
         (b)   The Village Council finds that there has not been a change in
circumstances that would render the current zoning with Statement of Conditions
incompatible with other zones and uses in the surrounding area or otherwise
inconsistent with sound zoning policy.
      (8)   Reversion of zoning. If approved development and/or use of the re-
zoned land does not occur within the time frame specified under division (7)
above, then the land shall revert to its former zoning classification as set
forth in §405 of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act (Public Act 110 of 2006) as
amended. The reversion process shall be initiated by the Village Council
requesting that the Planning Commission proceed with consideration of re-zoning
of the land to its former zoning classification. The procedure for considering
and making this reversionary re-zoning shall thereafter be the same as applies
to all other rezoning requests.
      (9)   Subsequent re-zoning of land. When land that is re-zoned with a
Statement of Conditions is thereafter re-zoned to a different zoning
classification, or to the same zoning classification but with a different or no
Statement of Conditions, whether as a result of a reversion of zoning pursuant
to division (8) above or otherwise, the Statement of Conditions imposed under
the former zoning classification shall cease to be in effect. Upon the owner's
written request, the Village Clerk shall record with the Livingston County
Register of Deeds a notice that the Statement of Conditions is no longer in
effect.
      (10)   Amendment of conditions.
         (a)   During the time period for commencement of an approved
development or use specified pursuant to division (7) above or during any
extension thereof granted by the Village Council, the village shall not add to
or alter the conditions in the Statement of Conditions.
         (b)   The Statement of Conditions may be amended thereafter in the
same manner as was prescribed for the original re-zoning and Statement of
Conditions.
      (11)   Village right to re-zone. Nothing in the Statement of Conditions
nor in the provisions of this section shall be deemed to prohibit the village
from re-zoning all or any portion of land that is subject to a Statement of
Conditions to another zoning classification. Any re-zoning shall be conducted
in compliance with this chapter and the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act (Public
Act 110 of 2006), as amended.
      (12)   Failure to offer conditions. The village shall not require an
owner to offer conditions as a requirement for re-zoning. The lack of an offer
of conditions shall not affect an owner's rights under this chapter.

   (B)   The following standards shall also apply:
      (1)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be required by the Planning Commission

§ 152.282 OFF-STREET PARKING.
   (A)   Use. Off-street parking shall be used only for the short-term storage
of licensed and operable vehicles. Off-street parking shall not be used for the
sale, servicing, repair, dismantling or long-term storage of any vehicle,
equipment or material. For the purposes of this requirement, SHORT-TERM shall
mean fewer than 24 consecutive hours and LONG-TERM shall mean 24 or more
consecutive hours.

maximum extent practicable.
      (3)   Off-street parking spaces shall be at least five feet from any
principal building.
   (C)   Ownership. If off-street parking spaces are not under the same
ownership as the principal use(s) being served, evidence of the right to use
the off-street parking spaces shall be submitted with the application for site
plan approval. This evidence shall be in the form of a property easement, long-
term lease or other legally binding agreement between the owner of record and
joint users. The agreement shall clearly establish rights of use and
responsibility for ongoing maintenance and shall be recorded with the
Livingston County Register of Deeds before issuance of a land use permit. The
agreement shall require written notification by the lessee to the village at
least 14 days prior to the amendment or termination of the agreement.
   (D)   Dimensions.
      (1)   Individual parking spaces shall be a minimum of nine feet in width
and 20 feet in length. Where a parking space is against an edge, the vehicle
overhang may be credited as two feet, if abutting landscaping or abutting
sidewalk is at least seven feet wide.
      (2)   Traffic aisles within parking lots shall be a minimum width of 22
feet.
   (E)   Calculation. FLOOR AREA is defined in §
152.283. For the purpose of calculating off-street parking spaces, the

spaces shall be the sum of the required spaces for each individual use computed
separately.
      (2)   Students and employees. The Planning Commission shall determine the
number of employees and students based upon the largest possible number of
employees working on any single shift, the maximum student enrollment permitted
by the State of Michigan or the maximum building capacity.
      (3)   Fractions. Fractions of less than one-half shall be disregarded and
fractions of one-half or more shall be counted as one space.
      (4)   Barrier free parking. Barrier free parking facilities shall be
provided and designed in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) and Construction Code requirements. ADA required spaces may be excluded
from the minimum number of spaces required per §
152.283.
   (F)   Maximum. The number of off-street parking spaces provided to serve a
use shall not exceed the number of spaces required in §
152.283, except the Planning Commission may allow an increase of up to 50% at
its discretion.
   (G)   Reduced minimum. The Planning Commission may reduce the number of off-
street parking spaces required in §
152.283 by up to 25%, based upon a parking analysis submitted by the applicant.
      (1)   The parking analysis shall clearly demonstrate that fewer spaces
will result in a better design and more efficient use of land, or will
otherwise achieve an established goal within the Village Master Plan.
      (2)   Consideration shall be given to peak use, availability of car pool
and off-site parking, public transportation, pedestrian and bicycle access and
preservation of natural resources and community character.
      (3)   The parking analysis shall contain, at a minimum:
         (a)   Plans showing the location of all relevant uses and structures
and the location of roads, off-street parking, public transit and bicycle and
pedestrian facilities; and
         (b)   A schedule showing the maximum number of vehicles to be
accommodated during peak hours of operation. This schedule shall be based on

   (H)   Surface. Surfacing shall comply with the Village Technical Standards.
   (I)   Wheel guards. Boundary or perimeter areas shall be provided with wheel
or bumper guards or continuous curbing located so that no part of parked
vehicles will extend beyond the lot line or into any access aisle, maneuvering,
setback, pedestrian or landscaped area.
   (J)   Access.  All parking areas containing three or more parking spaces
shall be located and designed so that vehicles can enter and exit the parking
area without backing onto a public right-of-way.

§ 152.300 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to regulate the location, size,
construction, and manner of display of signs and outdoor advertising in order
to minimize their harmful effects on the public health, safety, and welfare.
While this subchapter recognizes that signs and outdoor advertising are
necessary to promote commerce and public information, failure to regulate them
may lead to poor identification of individual businesses, deterioration and
blight of the business and residential areas of the village, conflicts between
different types of land use, and reduction in traffic safety to pedestrians and
motorists.
   (B)   To achieve its intended purpose, this subchapter has the following
objectives:
      (1)   To prevent the placement of signs in a manner that will conceal or
obscure signs or adjacent businesses;
      (2)   To keep the number of signs and sign messages at the level
reasonably necessary to identify a business and its products;
      (3)   To keep signs within a reasonable scale with respect to the
buildings they identify;
      (4)   To reduce visual distraction and obstructions to motorists
traveling along, entering, or leaving streets;
      (5)   To promote a quality manner of display which enhances the character
of the village;
      (6)   To prevent the proliferation of temporary signs which might promote
visual blight; and
      (7)   To eliminate the potential for any adverse affects on the
neighboring properties.

   (A)   Existing vegetation.
      (1)   Existing vegetation shall not be removed or disturbed until the
Village of Pinckney has approved the required landscape plan, final site plan
and land use permit.
      (2)   Existing, healthy, native vegetation shall be preserved to the
maximum degree practical, especially trees eight inches or more in diameter at
breast height.
      (3)   Planting requirements may be waived if the existing vegetation to
be retained on the site meets or exceeds the standards set forth in this
subchapter.
   (B)   Quality. Plant materials shall be of generally acceptable varieties
and species, free from insects and diseases, hardy to southeast Michigan and
shall conform to the current minimum standards of the American Association of
Nurserymen.
   (C)   Composition.
      (1)   Plantings shall be clustered and staggered rather than situated in
straight rows for interest and variety unless the placement is an integral part
of a design element, such as an alley of trees.
      (2)   A mixture of plant materials is recommended as a protective measure
against insect and disease infestation. However, a limited mix of hardy species
is recommended rather than a large number of different species to produce a
more cohesive and orderly design.
   (D)   Ground cover. All landscaped areas that do not contain trees, shrubs
or planting beds shall be covered with living ground cover (including grass)
and/or organic mulch. Stone or aggregate shall not be accepted as a ground
cover. Ground cover shall be planted in sufficient quantity to present a
finished appearance within one growing season and shall not exceed 18 inches in
height at maturity.
   (E)   Berms.
      (1)   Height. Berms shall be at least two and one-half feet in height and
no more than five feet in height, as measured on the side of the proposed berm
having the highest finished grade.
      (2)   Side slopes. Side slopes shall be no steeper than one vertical foot
for every three horizontal feet, and shall be designed and planted to prevent
erosion. Side slopes shall be planted with naturalized groupings as required
for landscape buffers herein.
      (3)   Shape. Berms shall be constructed with a rounded surface at least
two feet in width at the highest point and extending the length of the berm. In
general, the shape of berms shall appear to be as natural as possible.
   (F)   Visibility at road intersections. All plant materials and structural
landscape elements within a vision clearance area shall comply with §
152.261(E).
   (G)   Curb stops. A curb or wheelstop may be required along interior parking
lot landscape islands, perimeter landscape strips and landscapes adjacent to
road rights-of-way to prevent vehicles from damaging plants and structural
landscape elements.
   (H)   Dumpsters. Dumpsters shall be located and screened in accordance with

demonstrate compliance with the criteria below:
      (1)   Zoning. The final site plan shall conform to the purpose and
standards of the zoning district in which it is located.
      (2)   Surrounding uses. The proposed use and site design shall not be
injurious to the surrounding neighborhood or impede the normal and orderly
development or use of surrounding property. The site plan shall be harmonious,
efficient and coordinated in relation to topography, size and type of land use
and the character and improvement of adjacent properties.
      (3)   Phasing. Every individual development phase shall be designed to
function independently in a safe, convenient and efficient manner without being
dependent upon subsequent development phases and/or improvements.
      (4)   Natural features. The development shall protect natural features to
the maximum extent possible including woodlands, wetlands, lakes, ponds,
rivers, streams, wildlife habitat, steep slopes and groundwater recharge areas.
The development shall preserve and incorporate the features into the site
design. No grading, excavation, fill, clearing of topsoil, clearing of trees or
other disturbance of the natural environment shall occur outside of those areas
approved for the placement of physical improvements. Topography; the
development shall conform to existing topography to the degree possible. The
amount of cutting and filling shall be minimized and shall not destroy the
character of the subject property or adversely affect surrounding properties.
      (5)   Soils. The soil and subsoil conditions shall be suitable for
excavation and on-site septic systems, if any. Soils and slopes not suitable
for development will be protected. The proposed development will not cause soil
erosion or sedimentation problems. Adequate measures will be taken to control
soil erosion and sedimentation during grading and construction operations and
until permanent ground cover is established. These measures shall be based on
the latest standards published by the County Drain Commissioner and/or USDA
Soil Conservation Service.
      (6)   Drainage. The final drainage plan shall conform to the natural
drainage pattern as much as possible. The development shall not substantially
reduce the existing storm water infiltration or storage capacity, thereby
increasing the frequency or volume of flooding at other locations. The drainage
design shall not perceptively increase the pollution, volume or intensity of
runoff onto adjacent properties or receiving waterways.
      (7)   Environmental performance. The proposed development shall not
result in pollution, noise, odor, light, dust, dirt, smoke or other external
effects that adversely affect neighboring properties. Development that includes
the use and/or storage of hazardous or polluting materials shall be designed to
prevent spills and discharge of polluting materials to the ground or nearby
water bodies. A completed Environmental Checklist and Hazardous Substances
Reporting Form, supplied by the village, may be required.
      (8)   Public services, facilities and utilities. Adequate services and
utilities shall be available or provided, located and constructed with
sufficient capacity and durability to properly service the development. The

field verified by a professional engineer or a representative thereof. The
drawings shall be identified as as-built drawings in the title block of each
drawing and shall be signed and dated by the owner of the development or the
owner’s legal representative and shall bear the seal of a professional

NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES AND STRUCTURES
§ 152.415 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to regulate existing lots, uses and
structures that were lawful before this chapter was adopted, but which have
become nonconforming under the terms of this chapter and its amendments. It is
the intent of this chapter to permit the legally established non-conformities
to remain until they are discontinued or removed, but not to encourage their
continuance and to bring them into conformity as circumstances allow without
unreasonably interfering with established property rights.
(Ord. 37, passed 8-28-2005)
§ 152.416 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   It shall be the responsibility of the owner of a nonconforming lot,
use or structure to prove to the Zoning Administrator that the lot, use or
structure was lawfully established, existed on the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this chapter and has existed continuously.
   (B)   Nonconforming uses and structures are hereby declared to be
incompatible with the uses and structures permitted within the various zoning
districts. Nonconforming uses and structures shall not be enlarged, expanded,
extended or increased, except as provided for herein and shall not be used as
grounds for adding other uses and/or structures that are prohibited.
   (C)   Nonconforming uses shall comply with current Zoning Ordinance
requirements (such as landscaping, screening, parking, environmental
performance and general standards) to the maximum extent possible.
(Ord. 37, passed 8-28-2005)
§ 152.417 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   A legal nonconforming lot, as defined herein, which does not meet the
minimum standards of the zoning district in which it is located for lot area or
lot width may be developed, provided that the use, access, height, yard,
setback, landscaped buffer, off-street parking and other requirements of the
district are met and, provided further, that the lot meets all of the current
requirements of the Livingston County Health Department.
(Ord. 37, passed 8-28-2005)
§ 152.418 NONCONFORMING USES.
   Any lawful nonconforming use may be continued, subject to the following
provisions:
   (A)   Expansion.  A nonconforming use shall not be expanded, enlarged,
extended or increased, so as to occupy a greater area of land or more floor
area within a structure than was occupied by the use on the effective date of
this chapter or its amendment.
   (B)   Relocation. A nonconforming use shall not be moved, in whole or in
part, to any other structure, or to any other portion of the lot or site upon
which it was located on the effective date of this chapter or its amendment.
   (C)   Discontinuance. If a nonconforming use is discontinued, it shall not
thereafter be reestablished, and any subsequent use of the land shall comply
with the allowable uses in the district in which it is located. A nonconforming
use shall be considered discontinued if the customary use ceases for any reason
for a period of 12 months or more.
   (D)   Change of use. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any other
use except to a use permitted in the district in which the subject property is
located.
   (E)   Accessory structures. New accessory structures associated with a
nonconforming use shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission at
a regular public meeting.
(Ord. 37, passed 8-28-2005) Penalty, see §
152.999
§ 152.419 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Any lawful nonconforming structure may be continued subject to the following
provisions:
   (A)   Alteration. A nonconforming structure may not be enlarged or altered
in any way that increases its nonconformity, except porches, decks, patios,
fire escapes and similar minor appurtenances may be attached to existing
structures.
   (B)   Relocation. If a nonconforming structure is moved, in whole or in
part, any distance for any reason it shall thereafter conform to the
regulations of the district in which it is located after it is moved.
   (C)   Maintenance. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the repair or
routine maintenance of a lawful nonconforming structure to correct
deterioration, obsolescence, depreciation and/or wear.
   (D)   Replacement. A nonconforming structure that has been partially
destroyed may be rebuilt provided:
      (1)   The building footprint and height of the replacement structure do
not increase the level of nonconformity;
      (2)   The cost of restoration does not exceed the state equalized value
of the structure at the time of damage; and
      (3)   The reconstruction is completed within one year of the time of
damage.
   (E)   Signs. Every permanent sign that lawfully existed at the time of the
enactment of this chapter, but which does not conform to a height, size, area,
location or other requirement of this chapter, is hereby deemed to be legally
nonconforming. This status shall not be granted to any temporary sign.
      (1)   Nonconforming signs may not be altered, enlarged or replaced;
however, nonconforming signs may be reduced in size and/or maintained and
repaired so as to continue the useful life of the sign.
      (2)   The copy of the sign may not be amended or changed, unless
specifically designed to be changed periodically as in reader board signs,
without bringing the use into compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   Any nonconforming sign destroyed by fire or other casualty loss
shall not be restored or rebuilt.
      (4)   Any sign advertising a business that is no longer conducted for a
period of one year or more shall be removed by the owner of the building,
structure or lot upon which the sign is located within 30 days of receipt of
written notice by the Zoning Administrator.
      (5)   A sign accessory to a nonconforming use may be erected in the
village in accordance with the current sign requirements of §§
152.300 et seq.
(Ord. 37, passed 8-28-2005)
§ 152.420 CHANGE OF TENANCY OR OWNERSHIP.
   There may be a change of tenancy, ownership or management of a nonconforming
use and/or nonconforming structure, provided that there is no change in the use
and/or structure.
(Ord. 37, passed 8-28-2005)
§ 152.421 SPECIAL LAND USES.
   Any use for which a special land use permit is required, as provided in this
chapter, shall not be deemed a nonconforming use but shall, without further
action, be deemed a conforming use in the district.
(Ord. 37, passed 8-28-2005)
§ 152.422 PURCHASE OR CONDEMNATION.
   In order to eliminate nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures that
constitute a nuisance or are detrimental to the public health, safety and/or
welfare, the village may acquire private property by purchase, condemnation or
otherwise for the purpose of discontinuing the use and/or removing the
structure.
(Ord. 37, passed 8-28-2005)
§ 152.423 PRIOR CONSTRUCTION APPROVAL.
   (A)   Nothing in this subchapter shall prohibit the completion of
construction and use of a nonconforming structure for which, prior to the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, a building permit was
obtained and actual construction was lawfully commenced on the site. Further,
actual construction must have commenced within three months after the issuance
of the permit and must thereafter be diligently carried on to completion
according to the approved plans, without any period of suspension or
abandonment of work in excess of three months, and the entire structure shall
have been completed according to the approved plans within two years after the
issuance of the building permit.
   (B)   For the purposes of this section, the commencement of actual
construction means work of a substantial nature by way of site preparation. The
actual use must be apparent and manifested by a tangible change in the land, as
opposed to merely intended or contemplated work by the property owner. In this
regard, preliminary operations, such as the ordering of plans, surveying,
grading, clearing of trees and debris and the removal of old structures are
insufficient. The test in each case is not how much money may have been spent
in reliance upon prior zoning regulations but, whether there has been any
tangible change in the land itself by excavation and construction, such as
placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner.

§ 152.444 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance would involve practical difficulties or
cause unnecessary hardship within the meaning of this chapter, the Zoning Board
of Appeals shall have the power upon appeal in specific cases to authorize such
variation or modification of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance with such
conditions and safeguards as it may determine as may be in harmony with the
spirit of this chapter and so that public safety and welfare be secured and
substantial justice done.
   (B)   No such variance or modification of the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance shall be granted unless it appears that all of the following facts
and conditions exist:
      (1)   The alleged practical difficulties, hardships or both, are
exceptional and peculiar to the subject property or intended use of the
property, that do not apply generally to other properties or class of uses in
the same district;
      (2)   Failure to grant the variance will deprive the property owner of
his or her reasonable use as enjoyed by other property owners in the same
district and vicinity. This shall include substantially more than mere
inconvenience and/or inability to attain a higher financial return;
      (3)   Allowing the variance will result in substantial justice being
done, considering the public benefits intended to be secured by this chapter,
the individual hardships that will be suffered by failure to grant the variance
and the rights of others whose property would be affected by approval of the
variance;
      (4)   The variance will be consistent with the purpose and intent of this
chapter, will not adversely affect the purpose or objectives of the master plan
of the village, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not injure
the public or private rights of others and will not diminish the value of
surrounding properties;
      (5)   The conditions and circumstances on which the variance request is
based have not been self-created by the applicant or predecessors in title; and
      (6)   The variance will not constitute a special privilege inconsistent
with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and the same zoning
district, and shall be the minimum variance that will make possible a
reasonable use of the land or structure.
(Ord. 37, passed 8-28-2005; Ord. 87 ZBA, passed 3-23-2009)
§ 152.445 RULES FOR GRANTING VARIANCES.
   The following rules shall be applied in the granting of variances.
   (A)   In granting a variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall specify, in
writing, to the applicant the conditions of approval that will, in its
judgment, ensure the purpose and intent of this chapter are met. The breach of
any conditions shall automatically invalidate the permit granted.
   (B)   The Zoning Board of Appeals may, upon review and public hearing, and
unless good cause can be shown, declare a variance null and void if
construction authorized by the variance has not commenced within one year after
the date of approval and been pursued diligently to completion.
   (C)   No application for a variance that has been denied wholly or in part
by the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be resubmitted for a period of one year
from the date of last denial, except on the grounds of newly discovered
evidence or proof of changed conditions found upon inspection by the Zoning
Board of Appeals to be valid.
   (D)   In authorizing any variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals may require
that a performance bond be furnished to insure compliance with the
requirements, specifications and conditions imposed (see §
152.026).
