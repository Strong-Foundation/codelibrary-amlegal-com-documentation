(2005 Code, § 9.110) (Ord. 2-88, passed - -)
§ 33.11 DETERMINATION OF COSTS OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT; NOTICE OF HEARING.

estimated costs on the basis of the estimate of the Village Superintendent

Any changes made in such roll shall be noted in the Council’s minutes. After
such hearing and review, the Council may confirm such special assessment roll
with such corrections as it may have made, if any, or may refer it back to the
assessor for revision, or may annul it or any proceedings in connection
therewith. No special assessment roll shall be finally confirmed, except by the
affirmative vote of five Council members, if prior to said hearing written
objections to the proposed improvement have been filed with the Village Clerk
by the owners of property which will be required to bear 50% or more of the
estimated cost of the improvement. The Clerk shall endorse the date of
confirmation upon each assessment roll.

costs, the Council shall have the right to determine, after reviewing the
findings of the Village Assessor and the Village Superintendent together with
such other information as Council may require, a fixed cost to be borne by the
lands benefited by such improvements. In the event the Council shall determine
a fixed cost for improvements as herein provided, the public hearings required
in §§

or parcels of land assessed and until paid, shall be a charge against the
respective owners of the several lots and parcels of land, and a debt to the
village from the persons to whom they are assessed.
      (2)   Such liens shall be of the same character and effect as the lien
created by the Village Charter for village taxes, and shall include accrued
interest and fees.
   (B)   (1)   No judgment or decree nor any act of the Council vacating a
special assessment shall destroy or impair the lien of the village upon the
premises assessed for such amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged
against the same or as by a regular mode of proceeding might be lawfully
assessed thereon.
      (2)   All special assessments shall become due upon confirmation of the
special assessment roll or in annual installments, not to exceed ten in number,
as the Council may determine at the time of confirmation, and if in annual
installments, the Council shall determine the first installment to be due upon
confirmation and the subsequent installments due on July 1 in each succeeding
year.
(2005 Code, § 9.114) (Ord. 2-88, passed - -)
§ 33.15 TRANSMISSION OF FINALIZED SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ROLL TO VILLAGE TREASURER;
TREASURER TO PAY PROPERTY OWNERS.
   Whenever any special assessment roll shall be confirmed and be payable, the
Council shall direct the Village Clerk to transmit the assessment roll to the
Village Treasurer for collection. The Village Treasurer shall mail statements
of the several assessments to the respective owners of the several lots and
parcels of land assessed, as indicated by the records of the Village Assessor,
stating the amount of the assessment and the manner in which it may be paid;
provided, however, that failure to mail any such statement shall not invalidate
the assessment or entitle the owner to an extension of time within which to pay
the assessment.
(2005 Code, § 9.115) (Ord. 2-88, passed - -)
§ 33.16 PAYMENT WITHOUT PENALTY OR INTEREST.
   The whole or part of any special assessment may be paid at any time after
the date of confirmation of the special assessment roll until the tenth day of
the second calendar month following such confirmation, without interest or
penalty.
(2005 Code, § 9.116) (Ord. 2-88, passed - -)
§ 33.17 INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS, INTEREST THEREON, AND THE LIKE; DUE DATE OF
ASSESSMENTS.
   (A)   Upon the confirmation of any special assessment roll, the Council may
direct that the total amount of such special assessment shall be divided into
such number of annual installments as determined by the Council, but not to
exceed ten in number, the first of which shall be due and payable on the tenth
day of the second calendar month following such confirmation of the special
assessment roll, and one of which installments shall be due and payable within
a year thereafter, at a time corresponding to the date of the confirmation of
the assessment roll. In case the Council does not divide any special assessment
into installments, then the whole of such special assessment shall be due and
payable on the tenth day of the second calendar month after the date of the
confirmation thereof; provided, however, that the Council may fix an earlier
date when the entire assessment, or, if divided into installments, when the
first installment shall be due and payable.
   (B)   All installments of any special assessment, except the first, shall
bear interest from the date of the confirmation of the special assessment roll
until their maturity at such rate, not exceeding 8% per annum, as may be fixed
by the Council, payable annually; provided, however, that the entire assessment
against any lot or parcel of land may be paid without interest on or prior to
the tenth day of the second calendar month following the confirmation of said
roll. Every special assessment, or installment thereof, one month in default
because of nonpayment at maturity shall have added thereto a collection fee of
1% for each month or fraction thereof so in default. All collection fees shall
belong to the village and shall be collected in the same manner as the
collection fee for village taxes.
(2005 Code, § 9.117) (Ord. 2-88, passed - -)
§ 33.18 PREPAYMENT OF INSTALLMENTS.
   After the expiration of the period provided in §
33.16 for payment without interest or fees, any installment which has not been
spread upon the tax rolls may be discharged by paying the face amount thereof
together with interest thereon from the date of confirmation to date of
payment; provided, however, that if the public improvement was financed by the
sale of noncallable bonds or other evidences of indebtedness which are not
payable, then the interest shall be computed from the date of confirmation to
the date upon which such installment would have fallen due had it not been
prepaid. The Village Treasurer shall report to the Village Assessor all advance
payments on installments so that the assessor shall have such information
before spreading installments on the next village tax roll.
(2005 Code, § 9.118) (Ord. 2-88, passed - -)
§ 33.19 COLLECTION BY COURT ACTION.
    In addition to any other remedies and without impairing the lien therefor,
any delinquent special assessment, together with interest and penalties, may be
collected in an action in assumpsit in the name of the village against the
person assessed, in any court having jurisdiction of the amount. If in any such
action it shall appear that by reason of any irregularities or informalities
the assessment has not been properly made against the defendant or upon the
premises sought to be charged, the court may, nevertheless, on satisfactory
proof that expense has been incurred by the village which is a proper charge
against the defendant or the premises in question, render judgment for the
amount properly chargeable against such defendant or upon such premises.
(2005 Code, § 9.119) (Ord. 2-88, passed - -)
§ 33.20 CERTIFICATION OF COSTS AFTER FINAL PAYMENT.
   Upon completion of the improvement, the financing thereof, and the payment
of the cost thereof, the Village Clerk shall certify to the Council the total
cost of said improvement together with the amount of the original roll for said
improvement.
(2005 Code, § 9.120) (Ord. 2-88, passed - -)
§ 33.21 DEFICIENCY IN ASSESSMENTS.
   Should the assessments in any special assessment roll, including the amount
assessed to the village at large, prove insufficient for any reason, to pay the
cost of the improvement for which they were made, then the Council may make
additional assessments to supply the deficiency against the village and the
several lots and parcels of land in the same ratio as the original assessments;
provided, however, if the additional assessment required shall be in an amount
exceeding 10% of the original assessment, a special assessment roll shall be
made therefor and shall be reviewed in the same manner and after the same
notice, as is required for the original assessment. The total amount assessed
against any lot or parcel of land shall not exceed the value of the benefits
received from the improvements.
(2005 Code, § 9.121) (Ord. 2-88, passed - -)
§ 33.22 EXCESS OF ASSESSMENTS.
    The excess by which any special assessment proves larger than the actual
cost of the improvement and expenses incidental thereto, may be placed in the
General Fund of the village, if such excess is 5% or less of the assessment;
but should the assessment prove larger than necessary by more than 5%, the
entire excess shall be refunded on a pro-rata basis to the owners of the
property taxes. Such refund shall be made by credit against future installments
in the inverse order in which they are payable, to the extent that such
installments shall exist, and the balance of such refund shall be paid in cash
to the owners of the property as shown by the last tax roll. No refunds may be
made which contravene the provisions of any evidence of indebtedness secured in
whole or in part by such special assessments.
(2005 Code, § 9.122) (Ord. 2-88, passed - -)
§ 33.23 LANDS DIVIDED AFTER ASSESSMENTS, APPORTIONMENT OF ASSESSMENT.
   Should any lots or lands be divided after a special assessment divided into
installments, the Village Assessor shall apportion the uncollected amounts upon
the several lots and lands so divided, and shall enter the several amounts upon
the special assessment roll. If any party shall be dissatisfied by the
apportionment so made by the Assessor, he or she may appeal such determination
to the Council and the determination of the Council thereon shall be final and
binding on all parties concerned.
(2005 Code, § 9.123) (Ord. 2-88, passed - -)
§ 33.24 REASSESSMENTS IN CASE OF ILLEGAL ASSESSMENTS.
   (A)   Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of the Council,
be invalid by reason of irregularity or informality in the proceedings, or if
any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge such assessment to be
illegal, the Council shall, whether the improvement has been made or not, have
power to cause a new assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the
former assessment was made.
   (B)   All proceedings on such a reassessment and for the collection thereof
shall be conducted in the same manner as provided for the original assessment,
and whenever any assessment or part thereof, levied upon any premises, has been
set aside, if the same has been paid and not refunded the payment so made shall
be supplied upon the reassessment on said premises, and the reassessment shall
to that extent be deemed satisfied.
(2005 Code, § 9.124) (Ord. 2-88, passed - -)
§ 33.25 SPECIAL AGREEMENTS AUTHORIZED.
   Notwithstanding the special assessment procedure hereinbefore provided in
this subchapter, when any number of citizens desire a public improvement within
the village, and petition the Council for permission to be assessed for the
sole cost of such improvement, the Council may, upon the affirmative vote of at
least five members, order such improvement made, and the Council shall
determine and assess the cost thereof in accordance with the terms and
conditions of such petition; provided, however, that no expenditures other than
administrative, engineering, and legal costs and fees, shall be made unless
funds are on hand or provided for by proper appropriation; and provided
further, that the petitioners shall enter into a written contract with the
village for the payment by petitioners of the whole cost of such improvement.
The making and filing with the Clerk of such contract shall operate as a
complete special assessment procedure.
(2005 Code, § 9.125) (Ord. 2-88, passed - -)
§ 33.26 EFFECT OF IRREGULARITIES.
   If in any action it shall appear that by reason of any irregularities or
informalities, the assessment has not been properly made against the defendant,
or upon the lot or premises sought to be charged, the court may nevertheless,
on satisfactory proof that expense has been incurred by the village, which is a
proper charge against the defendant, or the lot or premises in question, render
judgment for the amount properly chargeable against such defendant, or upon
such lot or premises.
(2005 Code, § 9.126) (Ord. 2-88, passed - -)

assessment records means the last assessment roll for ad valorem tax purposes
which has been reviewed by the local board of review, as supplemented by any
subsequent changes in the names or the addresses of such owners or parties
listed thereon.
   (B)   Such notice shall describe the property to be included in the proposed
special assessment, the nature of the improvement, the estimated cost of same,
and shall set a time when the Council will meet and hear objections to the
proposed improvement.
   (C)   Objections to the improvement shall be filed in the same form and
manner as in the general special assessment provision of §
33.09.
2005 Code, § 9.202) (Ord. 2-88, passed - -)
§ 33.42 ADOPTION OF RESOLUTION, NOTICE, AND THE LIKE.
   (A)   (1)   At the meeting, the Council shall, if it so determines after
hearing objections to the proposed improvement, adopt an assessment resolution
showing the necessity for said improvement covering each parcel of land on

civil infraction violations for which a fine has been scheduled and for which a
municipal civil infraction violation notice (as compared with a citation) has
been issued. The fact that a fine has been scheduled for a particular violation
shall not entitle any person to dispose of the violation at the Bureau. Nothing
in this chapter shall prevent or restrict the village from issuing a municipal
civil infraction citation for any violation or from prosecuting any violation
in a court of competent jurisdiction. No person shall be required to dispose of
a municipal civil infraction violation at the Bureau and may have the violation

or in any way diminish the person’s rights, privileges, and protection accorded
by law.

the Bureau’s authority shall be limited to accepting admissions of
responsibility for municipal civil infractions and collecting and retaining
civil fines and costs as a result of those admissions. The Bureau shall not
accept payment of a fine from any person who denies having committed the
offense or who admits responsibility only with explanation, and in no event
shall the Bureau determine, or attempt to determine, the truth or falsity of
any fact or matter relating to an alleged violation.
   (E)   Municipal civil infraction violation notices.
      (1)   Municipal civil infraction violation notices shall be issued and

ordinances or other ordinance, the notice of violation shall indicate the time
by which the alleged violator must appear at the Bureau, the methods by which
an appearance may be made, the address and telephone number of the Bureau, the
hours during which the Bureau is open, the amount of the fine scheduled for the

right to demand that a person of his or her own choosing administer one of the
chemical tests; that the results of the test are admissible in a judicial

detention, and the results of the test shall be admissible and shall be
considered with other competent evidence in determining the innocence or guilt
of the defendant. If the person charged is administered a chemical test by a
person of his or her choosing, the person charged shall be responsible for
obtaining a chemical analysis of the test sample.
         (e)   If, after an accident, the driver of a vehicle involved in the
accident is transported to a medical facility and a sample of the driver’s
blood is withdrawn at that time for the purpose of medical treatment, the
results of a chemical analysis of that sample shall be admissible in any civil
or criminal proceeding to show the amount of alcohol or presence of a
controlled substance or both in the person’s blood at the time alleged,
regardless of whether the person had been offered or had refused a chemical
test. The medical facility or person performing the chemical analysis shall
disclose the results of the analysis to a prosecuting attorney who requests the
results for use in a criminal prosecution as provided in this subdivision. A
medical facility or person disclosing information in compliance with this
subsection shall not be civilly or criminally liable for making the disclosure.

accident is deceased, a sample of the decedent’s blood shall be withdrawn in a
manner directed by the medical examiner for the purposes of determining the
amount of alcohol or the presence of a controlled substance, or both, in the
decedent’s blood. The medical examiner shall give the results of the chemical
analysis of the sample to the law enforcement agency investigating the

liquor and a controlled substance, or whether the person had a blood alcohol
content of 0.10 percent or more by weight of alcohol.
      (5)   If a chemical test described in subsection (3) is administered, the
results of the test shall be made available to the person charged or the
person’s attorney upon written request to the prosecution, with a copy of the
request filed with the court. The prosecution shall furnish the results at
least two days before the day of the trial. The results of the test shall be
offered as evidence by the prosecution in that trial. Failure to fully comply
with the request shall bar the admission of the results into evidence by the
prosecution.
      (6)   Except in a prosecution relating solely to a violation of section
625(1)(b)), the amount of alcohol in the driver’s blood at the time alleged as
shown by chemical analysis of the person’s blood, urine, or breath shall give
rise to the following presumptions:
         (a)   If there was at the time 0.07 percent or less by weight or
alcohol in the defendant’
         (b)   If there was at the time in excess of 0.07 percent, but less
than 0.10 percent by weight of alcohol in the defendant’s blood, it shall be
presumed that the defendant’s ability to operate a vehicle was impaired within
the provisions of section 625(3) due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor.
         (c)   If there was at the time 0.10 percent or more by weight of
alcohol in the defendant’s blood, it shall be presumed that the defendant was
under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

arrest warrant is reissued, not more than 42 days after the date the reissued
arrest warrant is served. The Court shall order the defendant to attend the

advise the defendant that the maximum possible license sanctions that may be
imposed will be based upon the master driving record maintained by the
Secretary of State pursuant to Section 204a.
      (4)   Before imposing sentence, other than court-ordered license
sanctions, for a violation of section 625(1), (3), (4) or (5) a local ordinance

Court may order the person to participate in and successfully complete one or
more appropriate rehabilitative programs. The person shall pay for the costs of
the screening, assessment, and rehabilitative services.

nolo contendere or upon entry of a verdict of guilty for a violation of section
615(1), (3), (4), or (5) or a local ordinance substantially corresponding to
section 615(1) or (3), whether or not the person is eligible to be sentenced as

controls property if he or she is the grantee under a deed, purchaser under a
land contract, or a tenant.

statement was likely to result in the sending of an alarm; except when the
alarm or sending the alarm does so with the specific intention of sending a
false alarm or causing on to be sent, or does so without caring whether the
alarm is false.
      (3)   Subsequent false alarms in a calendar year. The fifth or subsequent
false alarm occurring within the calendar year, and every false alarm
thereafter from or in regard to the same premises or property, shall result in
the alarm user being assessed a service fee. Fire and non-fire false alarms
shall be counted separately. The service fee for false alarms, other than a
false fire alarm, will be $50. The service fee for false fire alarms will be
$100. This division (A)(3) shall apply only to alarm users. The service fee may
be waived by the Chief of Police or his or her designee in those cases of
development of false alarm conditions not reasonably attributable to the alarm
user or the alarm user’s equipment.
      (4)   Waiver, preconditions, and the like. Neither a proceeding nor the
result thereof under this section shall waive, preclude, or be a precondition

assessment shall constitute a lien upon the property and may be billed and
collected in the same manner as the tax applicable to the property.

nor shall a property owner or other person commence work or continue work, upon
or affecting an established or proposed historic district or district resource
until the provisions of this subchapter have been observed.
   (C)   (1)   The Commission shall recognize that the forms or characteristics
of historic district or district resource vary, and that the achievement of the
purposes prescribed in §
150.065(B)) may necessitate differences in the guidelines established with
respect to a particular historic district or resource and the guidelines to be
prescribed for a different historic district or resource. Guidelines in every
instance shall be negotiated, insofar as is practicable, by the Commission in
concert with property owners affected or to be affected, thereby, guidelines
formulated by the Commission shall apply uniformly as the same are found by the
Commission to be applicable, to each established or proposed historic district
or district resource having the same or similar form or characteristics.
      (2)   Guidelines shall specify with particularity all matters related to
the general compatibility of exterior design, structural height, mass
arrangement, texture, appearance, and building and finish materials. The
Commission may consider nationally accepted design treatment levels or
preservation standards in the formulation of guidelines with respect to
historical, architectural, and archaeological value and significance of a
historic district or proposed historic district or district resource in terms
of their relationship of the historic to the historical, architectural or
archaeological value of the surrounding area, and to such other factors,
including aesthetic, which the Commission deems pertinent.
   (D)   Guidelines prepared by the Commission shall be subject of at least one
public hearing and shall thereafter be submitted to the Council. Commission
guidelines shall not become effective until approved by resolution of the
Council.
   (E)   The power and duty of the Commission to review applications for
building or other permits or work plans shall be limited to exterior features
of a district resource. Work plans (or those parts of work plans) which pertain
to interior features shall not be considered by the Commission unless
specifically authorized by resolution of the Council. A certificate of
appropriateness shall not be denied for reasons other than prescribed in this
subchapter and guidelines adopted pursuant hereto. The powers of the Commission
shall not extend to any work which is not upon or within a historic district or
resource or proposed historic district or resource, however, the Commission
shall act as mediator and counselor, insofar as is possible, to provide
guidance to property owner and to present solutions or alternatives with
respect to conservation, rehabilitation, moving, or demolition, or other work
upon a district resource in instances in which the proposed work is not in
compliance with applicable guidelines.
   (F)   The Commission may:
      (1)   Conduct, assist, or participate in studies and programs designed to
identify and evaluate additional historic district and district resources
worthy of preservation;
      (2)   Consult with and consider the recommendations of civic groups,
public agencies, and citizens interested in historic preservations;
      (3)   Inspect, with the consent of the owners and/or occupants, a
property or premises under consideration for designation as a district resource
or as a part of a proposed historic district; and
      (4)   Encourage and advise property owners in the protection,
enhancement, perpetuation, and use of historic, architectural, and/or
archaeological properties.
   (G)   An application for repair or alteration affecting the exterior
appearance of a historic resource, or for its moving or demolition, shall be
approved by the Commission if any of the following conditions prevail, and if
in the opinion of the Commission the proposed changes will materially improve
or correct these conditions:
      (1)   The resource constitutes a hazard to the safety of its occupants or
to the public;
      (2)   The resource is a deterrent to a major improvement program which
will be of substantial benefit to the village;
      (3)   Retention of the resource would cause undue financial hardship to
the owner; or
      (4)   Retention of the resource would not be in the interest of the
majority of the people of the village.

historic district or district resource.
      (2)   The Building Official shall promptly furnish to the Commission the
application and accompanying documentation, and shall in addition submit his or
her comments and such other information as he or she deems pertinent. The
Commission shall review the application and documentation to determine whether
the proposed project or work impacts adversely upon an established or proposed
historic district or district resource. In the event the plans, elevations, and
other information would result in consequences, the Commission shall so inform
the applicant of its findings. The Commission and the applicant shall thereupon
meet and confer in order that modification of the application and project plan
may be discussed and compromise be reached.
   (C)   In the event modification of the proposed work plan cannot be agreed
upon, the Commission shall determine whether established guidelines apply to
the proposed undertaking and shall inform the applicant of its determination.
If established guidelines are not found to be applicable within the meaning of

to apply to the proposed work plan in accordance with the procedures prescribed
herein.

approves such application, it shall issue a certificate of appropriateness,
signed by the Chairperson which shall be attached to the application and
returned to the Building Official.
   (E)   If the Commission disapproves an application to build or other permit
and denies the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness, the disapproval
and denial shall be in writing and shall include the reasons for the
Commission’s determination and shall be promptly forwarded to the Building
Official and to the applicant by first-class mail. The Commission may include a
statement of what modifications would be necessary to cause the Commission to
reconsider its determination and disapproval of the application and of its
denial of a certificate of appropriateness. An applicant may take such
modifications to the plan and or other information as desired, and may resubmit
the application and attendant documentation to the Commission after so doing.
   (F)   The failure of the Commission to approve or to disapprove an
application or to issue or deny a certificate of appropriateness, or to prepare
new guidelines pertaining to the proposed work or project for approval by the
Council, within 60 days after the date of receipt of the application from the
Building Official with all necessary attendant documentation, shall, unless
otherwise clearly indicated, be deemed to constitute approval, and the issuance
of a certificate of appropriateness shall not be required.
