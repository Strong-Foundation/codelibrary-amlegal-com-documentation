§ 36.05 PUBLIC POLICY DECLARATION.
   It is hereby declared to be the standard of ethical service to the City of
Negaunee that all officials avoid conflicts between their private interests and
those of the general public whom they serve. To enhance the faith of the people
and to assure the integrity and impartiality of all officials of the city, it
is necessary that adequate guidelines be provided for separating their roles as
private citizens from their roles as public servants. Elected and appointed
officials, whether compensated or not, serve the public trust and any effort to
realize personal gain through official conduct is a violation of that trust.
The ethical standards established herein are intended to eliminate to the
fullest extent possible violations of ethical conduct and to ensure that such
are investigated and punished where applicable.

§ 36.07 STANDARDS OF CONDUCT.
   The city’s integrity rests solidly on the foundation of several general
rules of ethical behavior. These rules form fundamental values to be understood
and honored by all.
   (A)   Principles. The city expects elected or appointed officials to be
honest, to tell the truth, and to “play by the rules.” The city expects its
elected or appointed officials to be aware the first small step taken that
undermines one’s integrity or the integrity of the city usually leads to
another and another. In a short time, without having done anything major,
integrity is compromised.
   (B)   Honesty. The city expects its elected or appointed officials to not
misrepresent situations, to not steal from the city, not falsify records, or
misuse city property, equipment, supplies or assets for personal or financial
gain or benefit, or for the gain or benefit of others.
   (C)   Fairness. The city expects its elected or appointed officials to treat
each other and everyone else with evenhandedness, fairness and sincerity.
   (D)   Perception. The city expects elected or appointed officials to act in
such a way as to create the perception that he, she, and the city are acting
fairly, honestly, and evenhandedly without partiality, favoritism, or
dishonesty. The city expects elected or appointed officials to avoid the
appearance of impropriety, that behavior which suggests he, she or the city is
acting questionably.
   (E)   Letter of law, intent and spirit of law. The city expects its elected
or appointed officials to follow the letter of the law, and honor the intent
and spirit of the law, including federal, state and local laws.
   (F)   Direction and suggestion. The city expects its elected or appointed
officials to understand that no improper action is made proper because a higher
officer, official or employee might have directed or suggested the action, or
the higher officer, official or employee themselves engaged in improper action.
   (G)   Gray areas. Recognizing that there are times when elected or appointed
officials confront situations where there are two or more legitimate points of
view, where there is no clear right or wrong answer, and that past practices
have given way to new practices. It is in these situations the city expects its
elected or appointed officials to be particularly careful and give thorough
examination and thought before taking action or making decisions.
(Ord. passed 3-13-2025)
§ 36.08 PROHIBITED ACTS.
   The following acts, actions, inactions, and attempted acts and actions
constitute a violation of the ethical standards of conduct for elected or
appointed officials. These include, but are not necessarily limited to these
specific references but, rather, are intended as providing examples of actions
and inactions that are prohibited by this chapter.
   (A)   Gratuities. No elected or appointed official of the city shall
solicit, accept or receive, directly or indirectly, any gift, whether in the
form of money, service, loan, travel, entertainment, hospitality, thing or
promise, or in any other form, under circumstances in which it can reasonably
be inferred that the gift is intended to influence him or her in the
performance of their official duty/duties or is intended as a reward for any
official action on their part.
   (B)   Preferential treatment. No elected or appointed official of the city
shall use or attempt to use their official position to unreasonably secure,
request or grant, any privileges, exemptions, advantages, contracts, or
preferential treatment for themselves or others.

disclosing the full nature and extent of their interest. Such a disclosure must
be made before the time to perform their duty or concurrently with that
performance. If the elected or appointed official is a member of a decision-
making or advisory body, the disclosure must be made to the Chairman and other
members of the body on the official record. Otherwise, a disclosure would be
appropriately addressed by an appointed officer or employee to the supervisory
head of the organization, or by an elected officer to the general public.
   (E)   Use of city property. No elected or appointed official of the city
shall, directly or indirectly, make use of or permit others to make use of city

(Ord. passed 3-13-2025)
§ 36.09 EXCLUSIONS.
   This chapter is not intended to cover the following:
   (A)   This chapter shall not prohibit a elected or appointed official from

(Ord. passed 3-13-2025)
§ 36.10 INTEGRITY, REPUTATION AND THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE STANDARDS.
   Preserving the integrity of the City of Negaunee is important to all
officers, officials and employees of the city. Fairness, honesty,
evenhandedness, and sincerity, a kind that transcends both the law and the
values of individuals, are achieved by observing an overriding set of ethical
standards. Integrity is also preserved by recognizing, at times, complaints of
questionable actions of city officers, officials and employees and others that
need to be handled with the same fairness, honesty, evenhandedness and
sincerity. A city’s reputation and its overall success are securely linked. The
City of Negaunee’s reputation, obviously, is based on more than the collective
reputations of its employees and officials. The city’s reputation depends on
how people perceive that the city, whatever the issue or set of circumstances,
will act with integrity. Preserving the integrity of the city may result in
official action to enforce and punish violations of the ethical standards of
conduct.
   (A)   Controlling authorities. Requests to investigate or take action to
enforce the ethical standards of conduct regarding elected or appointed
officials shall go to the Mayor, City Council and City Attorney. The request
may be made by the individual or any elected or appointed official, or city
employee. Any elected or appointed official that is the subject of the request
shall not be a part of the controlling authority.
   (B)   Authority to render advisory opinions. The above listed authorities
may issue written advisory opinions, when deemed appropriate, interpreting the
ethical standards of conduct ordinance as set forth herein. Any elected or
appointed official may seek guidance from the controlling authority upon
written request on questions directly relating to the propriety of their
conduct as elected or appointed officials. Each written request and advisory
opinion shall be confidential unless released by the requester.
   (C)   Authority to punish violations. The above listed authorities shall
take appropriate action upon any complaint, request for information, or
otherwise resolve matters concerning the ethical standards of conduct ordinance
for the City of Negaunee. Except for direct references that may be provided by
City Charter or labor agreements controlling any action either authority above
may take or except as either may establish an action that either authority may
take, both authorities are herein empowered to take and enforce actions, as
they deem appropriate. The appropriate action to be taken in any individual
case shall be at the sole discretion of the controlling authority involved
which may include but is not necessarily limited to any of the following:
      (1)   Referral of the matter to a higher authority;
      (2)   Pursuing further investigation by the controlling authority;
      (3)   Deeming no action to be required;
      (4)   Pursuing another course of action which is reasonable, just and
appropriate under the circumstances;
      (5)   Taking appropriate disciplinary action, including declaring a
forfeiture of office pursuant and removal from office consistent with the
provisions of the City Charter.
         (a)   If the violation is for an offense also contained in the City
Charter and is one which the Charter determines is punished by removal, the
process for removal from office is the same as the process in the City Charter.
         (b)   If the violation is for an offense also contained in labor
agreements between the city and its employees, then the process for removal is
the same as contained in the labor agreements.
         (c)   If the violation is for an offense contained in this chapter and
for which the controlling authority recommends the forfeiture and removal from
office, whether elected or appointed, then the process contained herein is the
process that is followed.
   (D)   Advisory opinions. Any elected or appointed official or employee of
the City of Negaunee may seek advisory opinions. Advisory opinions may include
guidance to any candidate, officer, official or employee. Request for an
advisory opinion shall be made in writing and provide as much detail as
possible. The controlling authority may investigate as it deems appropriate.
The controlling authority may take as much time as it deems necessary before
rendering its opinion provided that all attempts to satisfy the request in a
timely manner are made. The controlling authority shall issue its advisory
opinions in writing. The advisory opinion shall be confidential and shall not
be released to anyone or any entity unless the person making the request
releases the opinion.
(Ord. passed 3-13-2025)
§ 36.11 REVIEW PROCESS.
   (A)   Determination to proceed. The controlling authority shall first make a
determination to proceed. Any elected or appointed official, official or
employee of the City of Negaunee may request that the controlling authority
review, investigate and recommend action regarding alleged violations of the
City of Negaunee ethical standards of conduct ordinance; such requests shall be
in writing. The controlling authority may decide to review, investigate and
recommend action regarding alleged violations of this chapter on their own
determination or at the request of other persons. All decisions to review,
investigate and recommend action shall first be made in writing.
   (B)   Duty of due care. The controlling authority shall be entitled to

         (b)   Amend its previous recommendation and determine punishment;
         (c)   Reject its previous recommendation altogether and take new
action or determine to take no punitive action; or
         (d)   Proceed with its previous recommendation and take punitive
action.
      (7)   Any punitive action recommended by the controlling authority shall
be forwarded to the City Council which shall vote on the recommendation for
punitive action at its next regularly scheduled meeting of the City Council. At
that meeting, the City Council, less any member for whom the punitive action is
recommended, a majority of those members remaining shall vote to accept, to
reject or to send the recommendation back to the controlling authority for
further consideration.
      (8)   If the recommendation of either the controlling authority or the
City Council is to result in further review and investigation of the
controlling authority, the process shall begin anew.
      (9)   If the recommendation of the controlling authority is accepted by
the City Council, its effect is binding and immediate and the elected or
appointed official has been deemed guilty of a violation of this chapter
offending all persons, the City Council, boards, and commissions, of the City
of Negaunee.

of competent jurisdiction, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $500 or
by a sentence of not more than 93 days in jail, or both, at the discretion of

FINANCES AND ADMINISTRATION
§ 50.25 INDUSTRIAL SURCHARGES.
   (A)   If the character of the sewage of any manufacturing or industrial
plant or any other building or premises shall be such as to impose any
unreasonable burden upon the sewers of the system or upon the sewage treatment
plant in excess of a maximum limit prescribed in this chapter, then an
additional charge shall be made over and above the regular rates, or the local
agency shall require that such sewage be treated by the person responsible
therefor before being emptied into the sewer, or the right to empty such sewage
shall be denied, if necessary, to protect the system or any part thereof.
Surcharges required shall be computed as the prorated share of the annual costs
of operation and maintenance, including replacement, attributable to treating a
substance, multiplied by the ratio of the weight of surchargeable excess of the
discharged substance to the total weight of such substance that is treated in
that year. This amount shall be collected on the basis of estimated
surchargeable amounts with each billing and shall be adjusted annually to
reflect actual operation, maintenance, and replacement costs. If any premises
connected to the system discharge a large portion of total water used into the
storm sewer and not into the sanitary sewer, all such discharges shall comply
with the requirements of state and federal agencies.
   (B)   Any wastewater discharged into the sewer system having a substance in
excess of the limits prescribed in §
50.05 shall be permitted only if provided for in a special agreement with the
industrial concern discharging the wastewater, and then only if such agreement
provides for the payment by the industrial concern for the full cost of
treating such excess constituents in the wastewater.

   The owner of a single-family residence, which residence has been assessed a
connection charge, may submit a hardship application to the city seeking a
deferment in the partial or total payment of the charges for benefits provided
for in this chapter, based upon a showing of financial hardship, subject to and
in accordance with the following.
   (A)   The owners of the premises shall, under oath, complete a hardship
application provided by Council and file such application, together with all
other information and documentation reasonably required by the city, with the
City Council not less than 60 days prior to the date of the annual installment
due. Any such deferment shall be for that annual installment only. An
application shall be completed and filed by each and every legal and equitable
interest holder in the premises, except financial institutions having security
interests in the premises.
   (B)   Hardship applications shall be reviewed by Council, and, after due
deliberation of the same, Council shall determine, in each case, whether there
has been an adequate showing of financial hardship, and shall forthwith notify
the applicant of said determination.
   (C)   An applicant aggrieved by the determination of Council may request the
opportunity to appear before Council in person for the purpose of showing
hardship and presenting any argument or additional evidence. A denial of
hardship following such a personal appearance before Council shall be final and
conclusive.
   (D)   In the event that Council makes a finding of hardship, Council shall
fix the amount of deferment of partial or total charges so imposed, and in so
doing, shall require an annual filing of financial status by each applicant,
provided that upon a material change of financial status of an applicant, said
applicant shall immediately notify the Clerk of the city so that a further
review of the matter may be made by Council, and provided, further, that the
duration of the deferment granted shall be self-terminating upon the occurrence
of any one of the following events:
      (1)   A change of the applicant’s financial status which removes the
basis for financial hardship;
      (2)   A conveyance of any interest in the premises by any of the
applicants, including the execution of a new security interest in the premises
or extension thereof; and/or
      (3)   A death of any of the applicants.
   (E)   (1)   Upon receiving a determination of Council deferring partial or
total charges imposed, the owners of the premises shall, within one month,
execute a recordable security instrument on the premises to the city, as the
secured party, payable on or before the death of any of the applicants, or, in
any event, upon the sale or transfer of the premises.
      (2)   Said security interest shall be in an amount necessary to cover all
fees and charges required under this chapter, and all costs of installation and
connection, the consideration for said security interest being the grant of
deferment pursuant to this chapter.

ACCOUNTS, RATES, AND BILLING
§ 50.45 ACCOUNT APPLICATIONS AND DEPOSITS.
   No connection or provision of sewer service shall be made until an applicant
therefor shall complete and sign an application form, which form shall include
an agreement that all charges for services shall be promptly paid when billed.
The application shall contain the name and address of both the consumer of the
service and the owner of the premises to be connected, and such other
information as the City Manager or Council shall require. In addition to
completing an application, the consumer shall make an account deposit as
determined by resolution of the Council. The city may require an increase in
the initial deposit if the account holder develops a record of delinquent
payments after the account has been opened. A new utility account shall not be
opened, nor shall any utility services be provided to a person or other legal
entity, until all prior unpaid utility charges, interest, penalties, and
collection fees owed to the city by that person or legal entity have been paid
in full. The account application shall also state that the applicant consents
to allow access to city meters at reasonable times by city employees for
inspection, maintenance, reading, and calibration.
(Ord. passed 4-11-2019)
§ 50.46 RATES.
   Rates to be charged for sewer service furnished by the system are listed in
the Council approved city fee schedule. These rates are estimated to be
sufficient to provide for the payment of the expenses of administration and
operation of the system and such expenses of maintenance of the system as are
necessary to preserve the same in good repair and working order, and to provide
for such other expenditures and funds for said system as this chapter may
require.
(Ord. passed 4-11-2019)
§ 50.47 BILLING.
   Cycle billing shall be made for all consumers of wastewater services. All
water meters shall be read or estimated within two days before or after the
first day of the month, and bills will be generated on a monthly basis
thereafter, payable without penalty before or by the billing statement due date
thereon. Payment received after such period shall be considered delinquent and
bear a penalty as listed in the Council approved city fee schedule.
(Ord. passed 4-11-2019)
§ 50.48 ENFORCEMENT.
   Charges for sewerage service shall constitute a lien on the property or
premises served, and liens for delinquent charges may be recorded against the
property with the office of the county’s Register of Deeds. If payment is not
made within six months of the beginning of the delinquency, the same shall be
certified to Council at the regular November meeting of the Council, and the
amounts so certified and approved by Council shall be spread upon the December
tax roll for collection. This procedure shall not apply if a lease has been
legally executed, containing a provision that the lessor shall not be liable
for payment of water or sewage bills accruing subsequent to the filing of the
written notice and a copy of the signed lease provided by this chapter. A
written notice with respect to the execution of a lease containing this
provision shall be filed with the Board, Commission, or other official in
charge of the water works system or the sewerage system, or both, and 20-day
notice shall be given by the lessor of any cancellation of, change in, or
termination of the lease. The written notice shall contain a notation of the
expiration date of the lease.
(Ord. passed 4-11-2019)
§ 50.49 SHUT-OFF.
   (A)   An account that has not been paid in full by the billing statement due
date shall be considered delinquent and shall have added to it a penalty in the
amount identified in the Council approved city fee schedule. Such charges and
penalties may be recovered by the city by court action. Once the account is
delinquent, the city shall mail a notice of delinquency and shut-off, on a form
approved by Council, to the consumer and to the owner of the premises, as
indicated on the account application, if different from the consumer. The
notice shall indicate that the account is delinquent and that services shall be
terminated as of the date reflected on said notice, unless the delinquent
portion of the account is paid in full. Before the wastewater services are
again turned on after such discontinuance, a reconnection fee established in
the Council-approved city fee schedule shall be paid, and an agreement
acceptable to the city, shall be made to pay the account in full.
(Ord. passed 4-11-2019)
   (B)   (1)   It is the policy of the city to discontinue utility service to
customers by reason of non- payment of bills only after notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard on disputed bills. The city’s form for application for
utility service and all bills shall contain, in addition to the title, address,
room number, and telephone number of the official in charge of billing, clearly
visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:
         (a)   That all bills are due and payable on or before the date set
forth on the bill;
         (b)   That, if any bill is not paid by or before that date, a second
bill will be mailed containing a cutoff notice that if the bill is not paid
within ten days of the mailing of the second bill, service will be discontinued
for nonpayment; and
         (c)   That any customer disputing the correctness of his or her bill
shall have a right to be heard at which time he or she may be represented in
person and by counsel or any other person of his or her choosing and may
present orally or in writing his or her complaint and contentions to the city
official in charge of utility billing. This official shall be authorized to
order that the customer’s service not be discontinued and shall have the
authority to make a final determination of the customer’s complaint.
      (2)   Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be entertained;
only questions of proper and correct billing will be considered. In the absence
of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided
herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified, but in no event
until the charges have been unpaid for at least 30 days.
      (3)   When it becomes necessary for the city to discontinue utility
service to a customer for non- payment of bills, service will be reinstated
only after all bills for service then due have been paid, along with connection
charge in an amount established in our city fee schedule.
§ 50.99 PENALTY.
   In addition to the penalty provided in §
10.99, any water meter found to have been tampered with or bypassed, having the
capability of being circumvented or with an illegal cross-connection present,
shall be presumed conclusively to have been in such condition for six months
prior to its discovery by the city. The owner of the premises serviced by a
meter which has been bypassed or circumvented, or having the capability of
being circumvented, shall be assessed and charged an amount double the sewer
usage of any comparable premises in six months. This charge shall be billed
subsequent to discovery of the bypass or circumvention and shall also be
recorded as a lien against the premises and certified and spread on the tax
rolls. For the purpose of this chapter, a comparable premises in the case of a
dwelling house shall be one with an equal number of adults and children, if
said information is available; otherwise the average usage for a similar size
dwelling should be used. For other types of premises, a comparable premises
shall be a similar establishment, i.e. a church, office, store, and the like.
Any residence or structure found in violation of this chapter shall be subject
to immediate utility disconnect and shall not be reconnected to the utility
supply until all bills, penalties, reconnection charges, and deposits have been
paid.

§ 51.02 ACCOUNTS, RATES FOR METERED SERVICE, AND BILLING.
   (A)   Account applications and deposits. No connection or provision of water
service shall be made until an applicant therefor shall complete and sign an
application form, which form shall include an agreement that all charges for
services shall be promptly paid when billed. The application shall contain the
name and address of both the consumer of the service and the owner of the
premises to be connected, and such other information as the City Manager or
Council shall require. In addition to completing an application, the consumer
shall make an account deposit as determined by resolution of the Council. The
city may require an increase in the initial deposit if the account holder
develops a record of delinquent payments after the account has been opened. A
new utility account shall not be opened, nor shall any utility services be
provided to a person or other legal entity, until all prior unpaid utility
charges, interest, penalties, and collection fees owed to the city by that
person or legal entity have been paid in full. The account application shall
also state that the applicant consents to allow access to city meters at
reasonable times by city employees for inspection, maintenance, reading, and
calibration.
   (B)   Rates. Rates to be charged for water furnished by the system are
listed in the Council approved city fee schedule. These rates are estimated to
be sufficient to provide for the payment of the expenses of administration and
operation of the system and such expenses of maintenance of the system as are
necessary to preserve the same in good repair and working order, and to provide
for such other expenditures and funds for said system as this subchapter may
require.
   (C)   Billing. Cycle billing shall be made for all consumers of water
services. All water meters shall be read or estimated within two days before or
after the first day of the month, and bills will be generated on a monthly
basis thereafter, payable without penalty before or by the billing statement
due date thereon. Payment received after such period shall be considered
delinquent and bears a penalty as listed in the Council approved city fee
schedule.

§ 51.03 WATER RATES FOR UNMETERED SERVICE.
   (A)   For premises served by the city’s water system, the monthly rates for
unmetered water are listed in the Council approved city fee schedule. The

prior written agreement with the city’s Water Department, and are subject to
the Council approved city fee schedule.
(Ord. passed 4-11-2019)
§ 51.04 TAP-IN CHARGES.
   (A)   For each three-fourth inch tap-in to the water main, the rate payer
shall pay to the city prior to the work being instituted a sum to be
established from time to time by resolution of Council. For said charge, the
city shall provide the water lateral from the main to the shut-off which shall
include the following items: copper tubing, shut-off, corporation stops, curb
box, street and curb restoration, and landscaping as required on city rights-
of-way.
   (B)   For each one-inch tap-in to the water main, the rate payer shall pay
to the city prior to the work being instituted a sum to be established from
time to time by resolution of Council. For said charge, the city shall provide
the water lateral from the main to the shut-off which shall include the

and curb restoration, and landscaping as required on city rights-of-way.
   (C)   In case a specially adapted tap in excess of one inch is needed for a
tap-in because of unusual use of the premises, an advance deposit, the amount
of which shall be established from time to time by resolution of Council, will
be required and the customer shall pay the actual cost of the tap-in.
   (D)   For the purposes of this subchapter, the city shall charge a re-
connection fee and a fee for sidewalk restoration. As established from time to
time by resolution of Council, said fees are to be paid in advance by the
property owner. Increases in these fees shall be by Council resolution. Re-
connection fees caused by water main freeze-up and main replacement shall be
waived.
(Ord. passed 4-11-2019)
§ 51.05 CHARGES FOR THAWING FREEZE-UPS AND FIXING LEAKS.
   (A)   All frozen water pipes from the shut-off to private dwellings, and on
or under private property, are not the responsibility of the city, and shall be
remedied privately by the property owner. If the property owner wishes to
retain the city to have the lines on his or her private property thawed, he or
she can arrange to do so, but the owner agrees to hold the city harmless and
expressly waives any liability of the city arising from any city thawing work.
Due to the potential hazard, no thawing services will be done after 8:00 p.m.
or before 7:00 a.m. The first thaw of frozen pipes by the city shall be at no
charge to the property owner. Subsequent thaws by the city shall be charged to
the owner pursuant to the Council approved city fee schedule. Failure to pay
charges pursuant to this subchapter shall be grounds for discontinuing service.

free of charge by the city.
   (C)   All special pipes or connections and all pipes over one inch shall be
charged to the person requesting the same.
   (D)   In the event that a water meter recording device is defective for any
reason and fails to record the water passing through the meter for any given
period of time, the city shall estimate the amount of water consumed during the
inoperable period of time. The estimate shall be reasonable and based on the
past record of consumption as shown on the city records. The city shall charge
a meter testing fee as established from time to time by resolution of Council,
to be paid in advance by the customer. If the meter is found to be defective,
it shall be repaired and the meter testing fee returned to the customer.
Council may adjust the meter testing fee from time to time by resolution.
   (E)   If a resident is permitted to allow his or her water to run in order
to prevent the water line from freezing, the procedure to be followed shall be
as adopted by Council in its Let Run Policy. Said policy may be amended from
time to time by Council resolution. Water shall not be permitted to run to
prevent freezing without first contacting the city for written permission.
   (F)   Water meters shall be installed upon any premises supplied with water
by the city, except as the Council shall by resolution provide. Water meters

similar uses, where the water used will not be entering the public sanitary
sewer system.
   (B)   The only separate water meter permitted to be used shall be a new
meter with vacuum breakers originally furnished by the city. In all cases, a
person requesting permission to use such a meter shall secure approval from the
City Manager or designee, install a vacuum breaker on all hose bibs that the
new meter is connected to, and have such meter and installation inspected by
the city’s Water Utility prior to use.
   (C)   The fee for the purchase and inspection of a new meter and vacuum
breakers shall be stated in the Council approved city schedule.
   (D)   The meter shall be the property of the premises owner or person
purchasing the meter and the city shall not be responsible for any repair or

summer meter testing shall be the same as the fee for testing of regular water
meters as set forth in the Council approved city fee schedule.
   (F)   Such separate meter may only be used to record water consumption
through the approved connections where installed during the months of April
through November each year. The separate meter shall be removed by the premises
owner or person purchasing the meter during the months of December through
March of each year and shall not be used during said period. It shall be the
premises owner’s responsibility to remove the meter to prevent it from freezing
and to re-install it each year in time for the city to conduct any required
inspections.
   (G)   Water consumption recorded by the separate meter shall be billed by
inclusion in the normal monthly water/sewer bill to the premises, except that
there shall be subtracted from the overall bill that portion of the regular
sewer charge attributable to the flow through the separate meter.
   (H)   If any such separate water meter shall become defective, it shall be
the responsibility of the premises owner to have the meter repaired or
replaced. Any and all readings from a defective meter shall result in the
premises owner being billed for both water and sewer consumption, without
credit for that portion of the sewer charge attributable to the flow through
the separate meter.

§ 52.44 CUSTOMER-OWNED DISTRIBUTED GENERATION FACILITIES.
   (A)   Requirements. In order to provide for the safety of customers, Utility
personnel, and others, and to assure reliable electric service consistent with
the requirements of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, being
16 U.S.C. §§ 2601 et seq., the following requirements are established for the
interconnection and operation of customer-owned Distributed Generation (DG)
Facilities in parallel with the city’s Electric Utility (Utility) Distribution
System:
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      AVOIDED COST RATE. The cost of the power, as set by the Utility’s
wholesale power supplier, that is not purchased by the Utility when a DG
facility delivers excess power to the Distribution System.
      CUSTOMER. Any account of the Utility in good standing and receiving
retail electric power service from the Utility’s Distribution System.
      DISTRIBUTED GENERATION (DG) FACILITY. The customer’s device(s) for the
conversion of energy to electricity, as identified in the interconnection
application.
      DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. The facilities and equipment owned by Utility and
used to deliver electricity to homes and industries.
      INTERCONNECTION APPLICATION. A customer’s formal request to interconnect
a new DG facility to the Utility’s Distribution System, or make a material
modification to the operating characteristics of an existing DG facility that
is interconnected to the Utility’s Distribution System.
      RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES. Any naturally occurring and theoretically
inexhaustible source of energy, including biomass, solar, wind, tidal wave, and
water current (e.g., run-of-river hydroelectric) resources, that are not
derived from fossil or nuclear fuel.
   (C)   Availability and participation requirements. The requirements in this
chapter apply to all customer-owned DG Facilities. Any customer may make a
request to interconnect a DG facility by completing the Utility’s
interconnection application and submitting it to the Utility for review with
all applicable charges as established by resolution of Council. Once the
Utility has determined that the DG facility complies with all applicable safety
and reliability standards, including but not limited to this chapter, ANSI/IEEE
Std. 1547, UL 1741, National Electrical Code, and the state’s Electrical Code,
the customer and the Utility shall execute a DG interconnection agreement.
Proposed DG Facilities will be handled on a case-by-case basis at the
discretion of the Utility and will be subject to a review process that may take
into account the impact of the interconnection on reliability, rates, power
supply agreements, and local and regional system planning. DG Facilities must
be interconnected on the customer side of the Utility’s metering, serving only
the customer’s premises, and must be intended to offset a portion or all of the
customer’s requirements for electricity. If the customer does not meet all of
the requirements listed in this chapter, the Utility may terminate parallel
operation of the DG facility and the customer shall be liable for any damages
or injury resulting from unauthorized or improper interconnection and/or
operation of the DG facility. These requirements apply to both existing and
proposed installations. The customer shall be responsible for procuring and
complying with all building, electrical, operating, and environmental permits
that are required by any governmental authority having jurisdiction for the
type of DG facility and for the necessary ancillary structures to be installed.
The DG facility is subject to inspection by duly authorized agents of the city
before commencement of parallel operation. In addition, the Utility may, at its
discretion, inspect or test the facility at any time. The customer shall pay
for all costs associated with any addition to, or alteration of, the Utility’s
equipment for the safe and reliable operation of the customer’s generating
equipment in parallel with the Utility’s Distribution System. The customer
shall also pay for costs of changes required due to safety or adverse effects
on other customers and/or on the Utility caused by the interconnection and/or
operation of the DG facility.
   (D)   Safety and reliability requirements. The DG facility’s Control and
Protection System shall provide for immediate automatic shutdown or separation
of the customer’s generator and the Utility System in the event of momentary or
extended loss of power from the Utility, including loss of one or more phases
if the customer is generating three phase power. The shutdown or separation
must continue until normal Utility service is restored. The shutdown or
separation shall occur when frequency, voltage, and/or current deviate from
normal Utility standards. The customer shall be liable if the customer’s
protection system fails to function. A safety disconnect device suitable for
use as a protective tag location may be required so as to be accessible,
visible, and in reasonably close proximity to the billing meter. The customer
shall advise the Utility prior to making any revisions to the DG facility, the
control system, or the interface between the two power systems after the
installation. Any such revision must be acceptable to the Utility.
   (E)   Net energy billing. Net energy billing is available only to customers
who operate DG Facilities using renewable energy sources with a nameplate
capacity of 20 kWAc or less, and are interconnected with the Utility’s
Distribution System, to generate a portion or all of the customer’s own
electricity. DG Facilities using non-renewable energy sources are not eligible
for credit of excess generation. The customer’s net energy consumption shall be
determined by a single meter installed by the Utility measuring delivered and
received power flow. When a customer’s monthly net energy consumption results
in a net flow of energy from the Utility to the customer, the customer shall
pay the full retail rate as listed in the Council approved city fee schedule.
When the customer’s monthly net energy consumption results in a net flow of
energy from the customer to the Utility, the customer shall be credited the net
energy billing avoided cost rate for the energy provided to the Utility as
listed in the Council approved city fee schedule. Net energy billing will be
done on a monthly basis. The credit for any excess generation, as determined by
each month’s meter reading, shall be credited against the following month’s
bill. Any credit carried forward to the following month that is not used up
that month shall be carried forward for use in subsequent billing periods. If a
customer terminates service with the Utility while having a net energy billing
credit amount on their account, the Utility shall refund the remaining credit
amount to the customer following a final meter reading by the Utility.
Customers shall be eligible to continue participation in net energy billing for
a minimum period of ten years under the terms of net energy billing in effect
at the time of enrollment. A participating customer may terminate net energy
billing at any time for any reason.
   (F)   Utility purchase of excess DG facility output. An excess DG facility
output avoided cost rate will be applied to customers who operate DG facilities
with a nameplate capacity greater than 20 IcWac using renewable energy sources,
and are interconnected with the Utility’s Distribution System, to generate a
portion or all of the customer’s own electricity. DG Facilities using non-
renewable energy sources are not eligible for credit of excess generation. The
customer’s energy consumption and production shall be determined by a single
meter installed by Utility measuring power flow in each direction. The customer
shall pay the full retail rate as listed in the Council approved city fee
schedule for all energy that flows from the Utility to the customer. The
customer shall be credited at the Utility’s excess DG facility output avoided
cost rate for excess energy that flows from the customer to the Utility as
listed in the Council approved fee schedule. Excess DG facility output billing
will be done on a monthly basis.

§ 52.45 OVERBILLING AND UNDERBILLING.
   (A)   In the event the Utility becomes aware of an overbilling of a
customer, the Utility shall promptly correct the billing error and notify the
customer of the circumstances surrounding the overbilling. The Utility shall
then determine the time period during which the overbilling occurred. Once the
Utility has determined the period of overbilling, the Utility shall calculate
the amount that it has overbilled the customer. The Utility shall then make a
refund to the customer of the amount of the overbilling for a time period not
to exceed three months from the date the overbilling was discovered.
   (B)   In the event the Utility becomes aware of an underbilling of a
customer, the Utility shall promptly correct the billing error and notify the
customer of the circumstances surrounding the underbilling. The Utility shall
then determine the time period during which the underbilling occurred. Once the
Utility has determined the period of underbilling, the Utility shall calculate
the amount that it has underbilled the customer. The Utility has the option to
back bill the customer for the amount of the underbilling for a time period not
to exceed three months from the date the underbilling was discovered.
(Ord. passed 1-10-2019)
§ 52.46 TEMPORARY SERVICE.
   (A)   The customer will pay fees and/or agree to reimburse the Utility for
its expenditures as listed in the Council approved city fee schedule.
   (B)   Temporary service shall be given to a customer connection only after
being inspected and approved by duly authorized agents of the city. The post
supporting the unit shall be located as near as possible to the location of
permanent service to the building. Abnormal conditions involving compliance
with the foregoing provision will be cleared with the Utility and permission
granted by the Utility prior to locating the customer connection.
   (C)   All temporary service shall be maintained in a safe manner in order to
keep the Utility harmless from injury to persons or property. The service shall
remain temporary only for a reasonable time and must be made permanent when the
Utility directs such action.
   (D)   Should the customer elect to receive permanent service, installation
charges as listed in the Council approved city fee schedule will be made to
such consumer. Credit shall be given for the payment already made for that
portion of the temporary service facilities which can be used for permanent
service without modification.
(Ord. passed 1-10-2019)
§ 52.99 PENALTY.
   In addition to the penalty provided in §
10.99, any electric meter found to have been tampered with or bypassed, having
the capability of being circumvented, or with an illegal connection present,
shall be presumed conclusively to have been in such condition for six months
prior to its discovery by the city. The owner of the premises serviced by a
meter which has been bypassed or circumvented, or having the capability of
being circumvented, shall be assessed and charged an amount double the electric
usage of any comparable premises in six months. This charge shall be billed
subsequent to discovery of the bypass or circumvention and shall also be
recorded as a lien against the premises and certified and spread on the tax
rolls. For the purposes of this chapter, a comparable premises in the case of a
dwelling house shall be one with an equal number of adults and children, if
said information is available; otherwise the average usage for a similar size
dwelling should be used. For other types of premises, a comparable premises
shall be a similar establishment, i.e. a church, office, store, and the like.
Any residence or structure found in violation of this chapter shall be subject
to immediate utility disconnect and shall not be reconnected to the utility
supply until all bills, penalties, reconnection charges, and deposits have been
paid.

§ 91.28 DISINTERMENT AND REMOVAL.
   (A)   Disinterment and removal of a body shall not be made without a
disinterment permit, notice in writing to the Sexton, and the permission in
writing of the lot owner and next of kin of the deceased. Graves shall not be
opened for inspection, except for official investigation by proper legal
proceedings.
   (B)   After the close of any funeral service at the grave and after the
placing of a body in the receiving vault, it shall not be permissible for
anyone to open the casket or to touch the body therein without the consent in
writing of the legal representative of the deceased or a court order for that
purpose.
   (C)   The city shall exercise due care in making a disinterment and/or

(Prior Code, § 1062.15)
§ 91.29 EXCEPTIONS.
   None of the provisions of this chapter are intended to violate any burial
customs of any religious organization, and where any contradictions exist,

§ 91.30 USE OF RECEIVING VAULTS.
   Receiving vaults are for temporary use only and on a rental basis to non-
residents of the city and under no circumstances shall a body be considered as
interred or buried by reason of being placed therein. However, the same permits
must be procured for placing bodies in the receiving vaults as for burials, and
the burial order will be issued the same as for immediate interment in a grave.
A deposit sufficient to cover the cost of opening and closing a grave, and
purchase of a single grave plus a rental charge for use of the receiving vault
by non-residents of the city, shall be required at the time of placing the
remains in the vault. Upon failure to make suitable arrangements for the final
disposition of the remains, within a reasonable time, or upon failure to pay
rental when required, the city may, in its discretion, remove the body and
inter it in a single grave, after first having mailed a certified letter,
return receipt requested, to the last known address of the person who made the
placement, stating its intention of making said removal, and shall then retain
said deposit as liquidated damages. In extremely cold weather or after a heavy
snow, all bodies will be placed in the receiving vault and retained there until
the cemetery management can make suitable arrangements for burial, and
arrangements must be made for their removal at as early a date as possible
thereafter. From May to November, bodies will be placed in the receiving vault
only on special written order from the Sexton, and, if they are to remain for
over three days, must be enclosed in hermetically sealed boxes as approved by
the county’s Health Officer. The remains of any person who has died of an
infectious and/or contagious disease shall not be allowed to be deposited in
the receiving vault, except on a special permit from the county’s Health
Officer stating that the rules and regulations of the Department of Health
regarding such cases have been complied with. Under no circumstances shall
visitors be admitted to the vaults.

remains and the placing of appropriate memorials.

or their families shall own a lot in the city cemetery, in which the said
indigents or paupers can be buried.

deceased, for remuneration, is hereby prohibited.

therein, may only be made to the city, by the surrender of the certificate of
burial rights, with the assignment, duly executed, attached thereto or endorsed
thereon.
         (b)   The transferee or assignee, in such case, shall be entitled to
be reimbursed only for the amount paid for such lot or interest therein, as
shown on the certificate of burial rights.
         (c)   In the event of a transfer or assignment of a portion of any
such lot not used for burial purposes, such amount shall be the proportion of
such payment as the unused portion of the lot bears to the entire lot.
         (d)   Such transfer or assignment shall thereafter be recorded on the
books of the cemetery, and if only a portion of a lot is so transferred or
assigned, a new certificate shall be issued to the owner of the lot for the
portion of the lot retained.
      (2)   If any indebtedness remains on any such lot due the city from the
owner at the time of such transfer or assignment, such indebtedness shall first
be deducted from the amount of the payment to the owner for the transfer or
assignment.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.01 TITLE.
   These regulations shall be known as the Property Maintenance Code of the
city, hereinafter referred to as the “this code.”
(Ord. passed 12-13-2018)
§ 153.02 FINDINGS AND DETERMINATION OF NECESSITY.
   The City Council finds and concludes there are non-residential buildings in
the city which are poorly maintained and neglected. These buildings adversely
affect citizens who own or occupy nearby buildings and dwellings by lowering
property values and rental values. These buildings also pose health and safety
concerns, as many of these poorly maintained and neglected buildings have
become so dilapidated that occupancy is no longer economically feasible, and
this increases the incidence of vandalism and fire. The City Council finds that
the elimination and prevention of these conditions is necessary and is in the
best interest of the city and its citizens.
(Ord. passed 12-13-2018)
§ 153.03 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to maintain, preserve and improve the
stock of non-residential buildings in the city.
   (B)   To accomplish this, the following minimum standards for the exterior
maintenance of all non-residential buildings are set forth herein.
   (C)   It is the intention of the City Council to exercise its full powers to
protect the public health, safety, and welfare, whether the powers so exercised
are derived from the Constitution, state law, or the City Charter.
(Ord. passed 12-13-2018)
§ 153.04 APPLICABILITY.
   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to any person or entity owning,
occupying, managing, and/or controlling any non-residential property in the
city as identified by this chapter.
(Ord. passed 12-13-2018)
§ 153.05 EXISTING REMEDIES.
   The provisions in this chapter shall not be construed to abolish or impair

§ 154.10 INSPECTION OF THE PREMISES.
   (A)   Periodic inspection. The Administrator of Planning and Zoning or his
or her authorized representative is hereby authorized to, and shall inspect all
rental dwellings on a periodic rotating basis of once every three years; upon
completion of the registration and receipt of the fee, the Administrator of
Planning and Zoning or his or her authorized representative shall schedule a
compliance inspection within three years of registration. Efforts shall be made
to schedule each compliance inspection at a reasonable time with respect to the
Inspector’s and the owner’s and operator’s convenience. The city will attempt
to give vacant units priority.
   (B)   Satisfactory inspection. Upon satisfactory completion of the
compliance inspection, and upon receipt of the fee for said inspection, the
Administrator of Planning and Zoning or his or her authorized representative
shall issue a certificate of compliance to the owner. A certificate of
compliance shall be valid for a period of three years. Subsequent periodic
inspections shall be conducted in accordance with this chapter. Satisfactory
completion means that every applicable requirement found in this chapter has
been adhered to and complied with. Only total compliance will be considered
satisfactory completion.
   (C)   Unsatisfactory inspection/notification of non-compliance/reinspection.
      (1)   If the Administrator of Planning and Zoning determines that a
dwelling unit does not comply with this chapter, he or she will notify the
property owner, in writing, of all areas of non- compliance, steps that must be
undertaken by the owner and/or operator to remedy the defects, and the time
frame to remedy all areas of non-compliance.
      (2)   The Administrator of Planning and Zoning must indicate in the
notice of non-compliance, whether the conditions are such that the rental
dwelling unit must be vacated, or whether steps to bring the unit up to code
may continue while the unit continues to be occupied by tenants.
      (3)    Notice of violations of the code shall be mailed by registered
first-class mail to the owners and/or operators of the property and by first-
class mail to the tenants within seven business days subsequent to the
inspection. The notice of violation shall state the right to appeal and the
instructions for making such appeal. Failure to remedy the violation within the
time specified in the notice, and the owner fails to appeal within the time
specified herein shall be deemed a violation of the code.
   (D)   Non-periodic inspections. Any rental unit may be subject to non-
periodic inspection if any of the following occur:
      (1)   Upon receipt of a complaint of an owner, operator, occupant or
citizen who has reasonable cause to believe that the premises are in violation
of this chapter;
      (2)   Upon receipt of a report or a referral from a Police Department,
Fire Department, public or private school, or other public agency that the
rental property is not in compliance with this chapter;
      (3)   Upon reasonable belief that a rental structure is not registered
with the city as required by this chapter; and/or
      (4)   Upon evidence of a violation observed by, or brought to the
attention of, the Administrator of Planning and Zoning.
         (a)   The Administrator of Planning and Zoning is empowered to enter
at any and all reasonable times upon and into any premises, building, or
structure for the purpose of examining and inspecting with owner or tenant
consent. If the owner or tenant fails to permit an inspection, the
Administrator may seek a warrant as provided in division (B) above.
         (b)   If a dwelling unit is required to undergo a non-periodic
inspection pursuant to any of the items in division (B) above, the inspection
will be based on the same criteria as periodic inspections, and failure to pass
will lead to the Administrator of Planning and Zoning nullifying any previously
issued certificates of compliance. The Administrator of Planning and Zoning
will also establish clear requirements of what must be undertaken by the owner
or operator, and what time frame, in order to schedule a reinspection and, when
warranted, reissue the certificate of compliance. In addition, an Administrator
of Planning and Zoning must indicate whether the conditions are such that the
rental unit must be vacated, or whether steps to bring the unit up to code may
continue while the unit continues to be rented by tenants.
            1.   If the rental unit that undergoes a non-periodic inspection
passes the inspection, there will be no fee for this inspection.
            2.   If the rental unit that undergoes a non-periodic inspection
fails to pass the inspection, there will be a fee for non-periodic inspection,
as well as fees for re-inspections required to establish compliance with this
chapter.
   (E)   Fees. The city shall charge a non-refundable fee for registration and
inspections. Fees as set forth in the city’s fee schedule and shall be paid at
the time of registration and at the time of the periodic inspection. Any fee
under this act shall be set by resolution of the City Council and be based on
the administrative cost associated with enforcement of the chapter. The fee for
inspection covers the initial inspection. If any subsequent re-inspections are
required, the City Council shall establish by resolution a reinspection fee.
   (F)   Payment. Any fee for required registration, inspection, or re-
inspections, including the administrative service fee, shall be paid by the
owner or party in interest whose name appears on the city’s real property tax
assessment records and/or the person or entity that registered the property.
      (1)   In the event of non-payment of the required fee, the taxpayer of
record shall be notified of the amount of unpaid fees by first-class mail at
the address shown on the City Assessor’s records. If he or she fails to pay the
amount owed within 30 days after mailing of the notice, the City Assessor shall
add the amount to the next tax roll of the city and it shall be collected as
provided by law for the collection of city taxes, plus 10% administrative fee
for processing the tax information required.
      (2)   Any unpaid fees or costs assessed under this chapter shall be a
lien against the real property and shall be reported to the City Assessor for
placement on the real property tax assessment records. Any fees and costs may
also be collected as allowed by law. This provision does not limit any other
remedies available to the city for violation of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 3-14-2019)
§ 154.11 CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   (A)   Owner/operator. No owner or operator shall lease or rent a rental
dwelling unit, unless there is a valid certificate of compliance issued by the
Administrator of Planning and Zoning and the name of the owners. The
certificate shall be issued after registration and inspection by the
Administrator of Planning and Zoning to determine that each rental dwelling
unit complies with the provisions of the codes and ordinances of the city. The
only exception to this requirement is during the first certification period
during which all rental dwelling units will be inspected over a three-year
period.
      (1)   An Administrator of Planning and Zoning must inspect the premises
before the certificate of compliance is initially issued. Upon failure of the
Building Inspector to conduct an inspection prior to occupancy, the owner or
operator may rent the property until the Administrator of Planning and Zoning
has conducted an inspection and the owner or operator will not be deemed in
violation during that time. If, however, the Inspector’s inability to inspect
the premises is due to the owner’s or operator’s action, failure to act, or
inability to arrange the inspection after reasonable notice of the intent to
inspect, the owner or operator shall not rent the property without a current
certificate of compliance as required.
      (2)   Between 30 and 60 days before the expiration date of the
certificate of compliance, the city will arrange with the owner or operator for
an inspection date and time, and indicate the amount due for the next periodic
compliance inspection; said notice shall be by first-class mail to the address
as provided by the owner and/or operator. The Inspector shall attempt to
inspect the premises before the certificate of compliance expires. Upon failure
of the Inspector to conduct an inspection prior to expiration of the
certificate of compliance, the owner or operator may rent the property until
the Inspector has conducted an inspection, and the owners and operators will
not be deemed in violation during that time. If, however, the Inspector’s
inability to inspect is due to the owner’
   (B)   Certification. Once certified, the unit will be issued a certification
placard by the city. Emergency contact information and the Planning and Zoning
Office contact information will be included in said placard as well as date of
certification. Placed near the entrance in interior at a visible location.
   (C)   Warrants.
      (1)   In a non-emergency situation, if a registered owner, registered
agent or occupant demands a warrant for inspection of the premises, the
Administrator of Planning and Zoning shall obtain a warrant for inspection from
a court of competent jurisdiction.
      (2)   The Administrator of Planning and Zoning shall prepare the warrant,
stating the address of the structure to be inspected, the nature of the
inspection, as defined in this chapter or other applicable codes or statutes,
and the reason for the inspection.
      (3)   The warrant shall be issued. If the court finds the warrant is in
proper form and in accordance with this chapter, it shall be issued forthwith.
      (4)   In the event of an emergency, no warrant shall be required.
      (5)   The tenant shall notify the landlord of any problems first before
contacting the city.
(Ord. passed 3-14-2019)
§ 154.12 APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeal procedure. Any owner or operator affected by any notice of
violation which has been issued under this chapter may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the city Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA).
An appeal from a ruling of the Planning Commission or Zoning Administrator
under this chapter concerning the enforcement of the provisions of this may be
made to the ZBA within such time as shall be prescribed by ZBA in compliance
with state statute. The applicant shall file with ZBA a notice of appeal
specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning Administrator shall forthwith
transmit to ZBA all documents concerning the appeal. The notice requirements
under state law shall be met as to the matters heard by ZBA.
   (B)   Hearings. ZBA shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of an appeal
and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing, any party may
appear in person or by agent or attorney. ZBA actions shall be in the form of a
resolution clearly setting forth ZBA decision. ZBA may reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination, and to that end shall have all the powers of the office or board
or commission from whom the appeal is taken.
   (C)   Decisions and powers of the city’s Zoning Board of Appeals.
      (1)   After a hearing, the ZBA may sustain, modify, or withdraw the
notice of violation depending upon its findings. In rendering these
determinations, the powers of the ZBA shall be strictly limited to making
interpretations of the provisions of this chapter, to the applicability of its
specific provisions to the specific case being heard, and to granting
exemptions to the provisions of this chapter. In granting exemptions, the ZBA
shall be allowed to grant an exemption if it clearly appears that, by reason of
special condition, undue hardship would result from strict application of any
section of the chapter. However, no exemption shall be granted if the same
would result in either the purpose or intent of this chapter, or of any
particular sections at issue, being nullified, in reviewing a request for an
exemption, the ZBA shall consider the following to determine whether an
exemption would be appropriate:
         (a)   Whether there are exceptional or extraordinary conditions
applying to the property that do not apply to other similar properties;
         (b)   Whether the exceptional or extraordinary conditions resulted
from the action of the property owner;
         (c)    Whether there exists alternative or equivalent methods or
materials that would allow the purpose and intent of the particular sections at
issue to be satisfied;
         (d)   Whether the granting of an exemption would result in a
substantial detriment to the property; and
         (e)   Whether the exemption requested is the minimum exemption
possible that would still allow the purpose and intent of the particular
sections at issue should be met.
      (2)   The ZBA may permit an exemption for mandatory provisions in such a
manner that public safety shall be secured, substantial justice done, and the
spirit and intent of the provisions of this chapter are upheld. In no case
shall this Board grant an exemption which would lessen the safety, health and
welfare requirements of this chapter. Any exemptions granted shall be for this
chapter and shall not, and cannot, waive the requirements and provisions of any
other ordinance or law. All decisions rendered under this chapter shall be in
writing and shall be final. A copy of the decision shall be mailed to the
appellant at the address shown on the appeal. Failure of the appellant or his
or her representative to appear and state his or her case at the hearing, shall
have the same effect as if no appeal was filed and the ZBA shall proceed to
deny the appeal and affirm the notice of violation.
      (3)   ZBA shall meet in a fixed place and all meetings shall be opened to
the public. The ZBA shall keep a record of its proceedings, showing the actions
of the ZBA and the vote of each member upon each question considered. These
records shall be considered public records.
      (4)   The decision of ZBA shall be final. However, a party aggrieved by
the order or decision may appeal the decision to a court of competent
jurisdiction as provided by state statutes and court rules.
(Ord. passed 3-14-2019)
§ 154.13 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The Administrator of Planning and Zoning is hereby empowered to promulgate
such rules and regulations as shall be necessary for the enforcement of this
chapter subject, however, to the approval of the City Manager. When the rules
and regulations made hereunder have been adopted and promulgated by the
Administrator of Planning and Zoning and approved by the City Manager, they
shall be deemed to be as complete and binding a part of this chapter as if the
same were herein specifically set forth; and the violation of any of said

such rules and regulations shall be placed on file in the office of the City
Clerk for inspection by interested parties at any reasonable time.

application.
      (2)   The proprietor or his or her agent shall submit ten copies each of
the completed application form along with the preliminary plat to the City

      (3)   The City Engineer, upon finding the submission complete, will
notify the City Clerk who will in turn alert the Secretary of the Planning
Commission to place the matter on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled
meeting of the city’s Planning Commission.
      (4)   Distribution of the ten copies by the City Clerk as required in
division (A)(2) above shall be as follows:

      (6)   After careful review of the City Engineer’s report and
recommendation, along with any other relevant information, the Planning
Commission may, at its option, pursue the following course of action:
         (a)   Grant tentative approval or disapprove the plat. If the proposed
subdivision is disapproved, the Planning Commission shall set forth in writing
its reasons for rejection and specify to the proprietor the requirements for
tentative approval; or
         (b)   Grant provisional approval subject to certain modifications and/

forward two copies each to the Planning Commission, the City Manager, and the
City Engineer. The City Council shall not act on the matter until it has
received a recommendation from the Planning Commission that the final
preliminary plat is in general agreement with the previously submitted
preliminary plat.
      (11)   Prior to approval of the final preliminary plat by the City
Council, the City Manager shall require a written report from the City Engineer
regarding the adequacy of proposed improvements, their design, and their
scheduled installation, along with a review of the final preliminary plat prior

if it is determined, after reviewing written reports from the City Engineer,
and after receiving the recommendation of the Planning Commission, that the
plat and proposed improvements have met all requirements. Final approval of the
preliminary plat shall confer upon the proprietor, for a period of two years
from the date of approval, the conditional right that the general terms and
conditions under which approval was granted will not be changed. The two-year
period may be extended if applied for by the proprietor and granted by the City
Council in writing. The City Manager shall send written notice of any extension
to all other approving authorities in accordance with §§ 113 through 119 of

      (13)   After the City Council’s approval of the final preliminary plat,
the proprietor may begin the installation of the approved subdivision
improvements or post surety in the form of a performance bond, letter of
credit, certified check, or cash deposit as specified herein.
   (B)   Final plat requirements.

560.293.
      (2)   A written application for final plat approval along with the State
Treasurer’s recording fee shall accompany all final plats.
      (3)   The subdivider shall submit proof of ownership of the land included
in the final plat in the form of an abstract of title certified to the date of
the proprietor’s certificate or a policy of title insurance currently in force.
      (4)   The City Council may require such other information as it deems
necessary to establish whether the proper parties have signed the plat.
      (5)   Within two years from the date of the final preliminary plat
approval, the proprietor may file a final plat with the City Clerk who will in
turn forward the plat to the City Manager and place the item on the agenda of
the next regularly scheduled meeting.
      (6)   If the City Council determines that all conditions for final plat
approval have been satisfied, including pre-installation of required
improvements, and/or acceptable security provided to assure said installation,
Council may grant such approval in accordance with § 148 of the Subdivision
Control Act, being Public Act 288 of 1967, as amended, being M.C.L.A. §

DIVISION OF LAND
§ 155.015 LAND DETACHED.
    Land may be detached from one such lot, outlot, or parcel and added to
another lot, outlot, or parcel upon application to and approval by the City
Manager. The fact of such a division shall be noted upon the city assessment
roll and thereafter the enlarged lot, outlot, or parcel shall be considered to
be a single lot, outlot, or parcel for tax assessment, and all other purposes.
No such division shall be permitted unless the remainder of the lot, outlot, or
parcel from which the part was taken meets the minimum requirements of the
city’s Zoning Code, including width, area, setback, and side yard requirements.
(Prior Code, § 1244.02)
§ 155.016 LOT DIVIDED INTO TWO.
   Such a lot, outlot, or parcel may be divided into not more than two new
lots, outlots, or parcels upon application to and approval by the City Manager.
The fact of such a division shall be noted upon the city assessment roll and
thereafter each separate parcel shall be considered to be a single lot, outlot,
or parcel for tax assessment and all other purposes. No such division shall be
permitted unless each separate parcel meets the minimum requirements of the
city’s Zoning Code, including width, area, setback, and side yard requirements.
In those cases where water, sewer, or other services have been installed within
the subdivision plat by special assessment, and the lot, outlot, or parcel
proposed to be divided has been assessed therefor, no division shall be
permitted unless the applicant agrees in writing to pay into the Special
Assessment District an additional amount to be determined by the City Manager,
said amount representing the increased share of the cost of the Special
Assessment District which should be borne by the applicant for the divisions of
said lot, outlot, or parcel as the result of increased benefit received by the
applicant for the division of said lot, outlot, or parcel when divided into two
separate lots, outlots, or parcels.
(Prior Code, § 1244.02)
§ 155.017 DIVISION INTO THREE OR FOUR LOTS.

by the City Planning Commission. A survey showing such proposed divisions
prepared by a registered engineer or by a registered land surveyor, including a
proper legal description of each separate lot, outlot, or parcel proposed,
shall be submitted with the application. A copy of the application and the
survey shall be forwarded to the City Engineer for recommendation. Upon receipt
of such recommendation, the matter shall be placed upon the agenda of the next
regular meeting of the Planning Commission. Should the Planning Commission
approve the requested divisions, the Chairperson shall notify the City Manager,
and the fact of such a division shall be noted upon the city assessment roll
and thereafter the divided portions of the lot, outlot, or parcel shall be
considered to be separate lots, outlots, or parcels for tax assessment and all
other purposes. No such division shall be permitted unless each of the parts
into which such lot, outlot, or parcel is to be divided meets the minimum
requirements of the city’s Zoning Code, including width, area, side yard, and
setback requirements. In those cases where either sewer or other services have
been installed within the plat by special assessment and the lot proposed to be
divided has been assessed therefor, no division shall be permitted unless the
applicant agrees in writing to pay into the Special Assessment District an
additional amount to be determined by the City Manager representing the
increased share of the cost of the Special Assessment District which should be
borne by the applicant for the division of said divided lot, outlot, or parcel
when divided into three or four such lots, outlots, or parcels.

DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 155.060 DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS.
   (A)   General requirements. The Planning Commission shall not recommend for
approval any subdivision plat which does not make adequate provision for storm
or flood water run-off. The storm water drainage system shall be separate and
independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where required, shall
be designed by the rational method, or other methods as approved by the City
Engineer, and a copy of design computations shall be submitted along with
plans. Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried across or
around any intersection, nor for a distance of more than 600 feet in the
gutter. When calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a
point, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and catch
basins shall be used to intercept flow at that point. Surface water drainage
patterns shall be shown for each lot and block.
   (B)   Nature of storm water facilities.
      (1)   Location. The applicant may be required by the governing body to
carry away by pipe or open ditch, any spring or surface water that may exist
either previously to or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage
facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, or in
perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be constructed
in accordance with the local government’s construction standards and
specifications.
      (2)   Accessibility to public storm sewers.
         (a)   Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall
install storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable
distance, adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm waters,
subject to the specifications of the City Engineer. However, in subdivisions
containing lots less than 15,000 square feet in area and in Business and
Industrial Districts, underground storm sewer systems shall be constructed
throughout the subdivisions and shall be conducted to an approved outfall.
Inspections of all facilities shall be conducted by the City Engineer.
         (b)   If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided
eventually, as determined by the City Engineer and the Planning Commission, the
developer shall make arrangements for future storm water disposal by a public
utility system at the time the plat receives final approval. Provision for such
connection shall be incorporated by inclusion in the surety required for the
subdivision plat.
      (3)   Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert or other
drainage facility shall, in each case, be large enough to accommodate potential
run-off from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
subdivision. The City Engineer shall determine the necessary size of the
facility, based on the provisions of the construction standards and
specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed development
permitted by the Zoning Code.
      (4)   Effect on downstream drainage areas. The City Engineer shall also
study the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities
outside the area of the subdivision. Local government drainage studies together
with such other studies, as shall be appropriate, shall serve as a guide to
needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the additional run-off
incident to the development of the subdivision will overload an existing
downstream drainage facility, the City Council may withhold approval of the
subdivision until provision has been made for the improvement of said potential
condition in such amount as the City Council shall determine. No subdivision
shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be provided to an adequate
drainage watercourse or facility.
      (5)   Areas of poor drainage. Whenever a plat is submitted for an area
which is subject to flooding, the City Council, upon recommendation of the
Planning Commission, may approve such subdivision, provided that the applicant
fills the affected area of said subdivision to an elevation sufficient to place
the elevation of said streets and lots at a minimum of 12 inches above the
elevation of the maximum probable flood, as determined by the City Engineer.
The plat of such subdivision shall provide for a flood plain area along the
bank of any stream or watercourse, in a width which shall be sufficient in
times of high-water to contain or move the water, and no fill shall be placed
in the flood plain area nor shall any structure be erected or placed therein.
The boundaries and the elevation of the flood plain area shall be subject to
approval by the City Engineer and any other state and/or local agency which may
be required under Public Act 288 of 1967, as amended. Areas of extremely poor
drainage shall be discouraged from development.
      (6)   Flood plain areas. The Planning Commission may, when it deems it
necessary for the health, safety, or welfare of the present and future
population of the area, and necessary to the conservation of water, drainage,
and sanitary facilities, prohibit the subdivision of any portion of property
which lies within the flood plain of any stream or drainage course. These flood
plain areas shall be preserved from any and all destruction or damage resulting
from clearing, grading or dumping of earth, waste material or stumps.
   (C)   Dedication of drainage easements.
      (1)   General requirements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a
watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a storm
water easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines
of such watercourse, and of such width and construction or both as will be
adequate for the purpose. Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage
be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for
maximum potential volume of flow.
      (2)   Drainage easements.
         (a)   Where topography or other conditions make impractical the
inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-way, perpetual
unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for such drainage facilities
shall be provided across property outside the road lines and with satisfactory
access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the plat. Drainage
easements shall be carried from the road to a natural watercourse or to other
drainage facilities.
         (b)   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage easements must be secured.
         (c)   The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage
easement, land on both sides of existing watercourses, to a distance to be
determined by the City Engineer.
         (d)   Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as
drainageways. Such land or lands subject to periodic floodings shall not be
computed in determining the number of lots to be utilized for average density
procedure nor for computing the area requirement of any lot.
(Prior Code, § 1246.02)
§ 155.061 WATER FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   Necessary action shall be taken by the applicant to extend or
create a Water Supply District for the purpose of providing a water supply
system capable of providing domestic water use and fire protection.
      (2)   Where a public water main is accessible, the subdivider shall
install adequate water supply facilities, including fire hydrants, subject to
the specifications of the state and/or local authorities. All water mains shall
be at least six inches in diameter.
      (3)   All water main extensions shall be approved by the state’s Health
Department.
      (4)   To facilitate the requirements of this subchapter, the location of
all fire hydrants, all water supply improvements, and the boundary lines of
proposed districts, indicating all the improvements proposed to be served,
shall be shown on the proposed construction plans, and the cost of installing
the same shall be included in the surety to be furnished by the developer.
   (B)   Individual wells and central water systems.
      (1)   In Low Density Zoning Districts, in the discretion of the Planning
Commission, if a public water system is not available, individual wells may be
used or a central water system may be provided in such a manner that an
adequate supply of potable water will be available to every lot in the
subdivision. Water samples shall be submitted to the Health Department for
approval, and individual wells and central water systems shall be approved by
the appropriate health authorities. Orders of approval shall be submitted to
the Planning Commission.
      (2)   If the Planning Commission requires that a connection to a public
water main be eventually provided as a condition of approval of an individual
well or central water system, the applicant shall make arrangements for future
water service at the time the plat receives final approval. Performance or cash
bonds may be required to ensure compliance.
   (C) Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required for all subdivisions with
public water supply systems. Fire hydrants shall be located no more than 1,000
feet apart and within 500 feet of any structure and shall be approved by the
applicable protection unit. To eliminate future street openings, all
underground utilities for fire hydrants, together with the fire hydrants
themselves, and all other supply improvements, shall be installed before any
final paving of a street shown on the subdivision plat.
(Prior Code, § 1246.03)
§ 155.062 SIDEWALKS.
   (A)   Required improvements.
      (1)   Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated non-pavement
right-of-way of all roads as shown in the table below.
      (2)   Concrete curbs are required for all roads where sidewalks are
required by these regulations or where required in the discretion of the
Planning Commission.
      (3)   Sidewalks shall be improved as required in these regulations. A
median strip at least five feet wide shall separate all sidewalks from adjacent
curbs.
   (B)   Pedestrian accesses. The Planning Commission may require, in order to
facilitate pedestrian access from roads to schools, parks, playgrounds, or
other nearby roads, perpetual unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in width.
Easements shall be indicated on the plat.

(Prior Code, § 1246.05)
§ 155.063 UTILITIES.
   (A)   Location. All utility facilities, including, but not limited to, gas,
electric power, telephone, and CATV cables, shall be located underground
throughout the subdivision. Where possible, flush-type connections shall be
made. Wherever existing utility facilities are located above ground, except
where existing on public roads and rights-of-way, they shall be removed and
placed underground. All utility facilities existing and proposed throughout the
subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary plat. Underground service
connections to the street property line of each platted lot shall be installed
at the subdivider’s expense. At the discretion of the Planning Commission, the
requirement for service connections to each lot may be waived in the case of
adjoining lots to be retained in single ownership and intended to be developed
for the same primary use.
   (B)   Easements.
      (1)   Easements centered on rear lot lines shall be provided for
utilities (private and municipal). Such easements shall be at least 20 feet
wide, ten feet on either side of said lot line. Proper coordination shall be
established between the subdivider and the applicable utility companies for the
establishment of utility easements established in adjoining properties.
      (2)   Where topographical or other conditions are such as to make the
inclusion of utilities within the rear lot lines impractical, perpetual
unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in width, ten feet on either side of
the lot line, in width shall be provided along side lot lines with satisfactory
access to the road or rear lot lines. Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
(Prior Code, § 1246.06)
§ 155.064 PUBLIC USES.
   (A)   Parks, playgrounds, and recreation areas.
      (1)   Recreation standards. The Planning Commission shall require that
land be reserved for parks and playgrounds or other recreation purposes in
locations designated on the master plan or otherwise where such reservations
would be appropriate. Each reservation shall be of suitable size, dimension,
topography, and general character and shall have adequate road access for the
particular purposes envisioned by the Planning Commission. The park area shall
be shown and named on the plat. When parks and/or recreation areas are
required, the Planning Commission shall determine the number of acres to be
reserved from the following table, which has been prepared on the basis of
providing three acres of recreation area for every 100 dwelling units. The
Planning Commission may refer such proposed reservations to the local
government official or department in charge of parks and recreation for
recommendation. The developer shall dedicate all such recreation areas to the
local government as a condition of final subdivision plat approval. In Multi-
Family and High Density Residential Districts, the Planning Commission shall
determine the acreage for reservation based on the number of dwelling units per
acre to occupy the site as permitted by the Zoning Code.

      (2)   Minimum size of park and playground reservations. In general, land
reserved for recreation purposes shall have an area of at least four acres.
When the percentages from the table above would create less than four acres,
the Commission may require that the recreation area be located at a suitable
place on the edge of the subdivision so that additional land may be added at
such time as the adjacent land is subdivided. In no case shall an area of less
than two acres be reserved for recreation purposes if it will be impractical or
impossible to secure additional lands in order to increase its area. Where
recreation land in any subdivision is not reserved, or the land reserved is
less than the percentage set forth in division (A)(1) above, the provisions of
division (A)(4) below shall be applicable.
      (3)   Recreation sites. Land reserved for recreation purposes shall be of
a character and location suitable for use as a playground or playfield or for
other recreation purposes, shall be relatively level and dry, and shall be
improved by the developer to the standards required by the Planning Commission,
which improvements shall be included in the performance bond. The Planning
Commission may refer any subdivision proposed to contain a dedicated park to
the local government official or department in charge of parks and recreation
for a recommendation. All land to be reserved for dedication to the local
government for park purposes shall have prior approval of the governing body
and shall be named and shown on the plat.
      (4)   Alternative procedure: money in lieu of land. Where, with respect
to a particular subdivision, the reservation of land required pursuant to this
subchapter does not equal the percentage of total land required to be reserved
in division (A)(1) above, the Planning Commission shall require, prior to final
approval of the subdivision plat, that the applicant deposit with the governing
body a cash payment in lieu of land reservation. Such deposit shall be placed
in a neighborhood park and reservation improvement fund to be established by
the governing body. Such deposit shall be used by the local government for the
improvement of a neighborhood park, playground or recreation area, including
the acquisition of property. Such deposit must be used for facilities that will
be actually available to and benefit the persons in said subdivision and be
located in the general neighborhood of the subdivision. The Planning Commission
shall determine the amount to be deposited, based on the following formula:
$200 multiplied by the number of times the total area of the subdivision is
divisible by the required minimum lot size of the zoning district in which it
is located, less a credit for the amount of land actually reserved for
recreation purposes, if any, as the land reserved bears in proportion to the
land required for reservation in division (A)(1) above, but not including any
lands reserved through density zoning.
      (5)   Applicability to land utilizing average density. Any subdivision
plat in which the principle of average density of flexible zoning has been
utilized shall not be exempt from the provisions of this subchapter, except as
to such portion of land which is actually dedicated to the local government for
park and recreation purposes. If no further area, other than the area to be
reserved through averaging, is required by the Planning Commission, the full
fee shall be paid as required in division (A)(4) above. If further land is
required for reservation, apart from that reserved by averaging, credit shall
be given as provided by division (A)(4) above.
   (B)   Other public uses.
      (1)   Plat to provide for public uses. Except where an applicant utilizes
planned unit development or density zoning in which land is set aside by the
developer as required by the provisions of the Zoning Code, whenever a tract to
be subdivided includes a school, recreation uses (in excess of the requirements
of division (A) above), or any other public use as indicated on the master
plan, or any portion thereof, such space shall be suitably incorporated by the
applicant into his or her sketch plat. After proper determination of its
necessity by the Planning Commission and the appropriate local government
official or other public agency involved in the acquisition and use of each
such site, and after a determination has been made to acquire the site by the
public agency, the site shall be suitably incorporated by the applicant into
the preliminary and final plats.
      (2)   Referral to public body. The Planning Commission shall refer the
sketch plat to the public body concerned with acquisition for its consideration
and report. The Planning Commission may propose alternative areas for such
acquisition and shall allow the public body or agency 30 days for reply. The
agency’s recommendation, if affirmative, shall include a map showing the
boundaries and area of the parcel to be acquired and an estimate of the time
required to complete the acquisition.
      (3)   Notice of property owner. Upon receipt of an affirmative report,
the Planning Commission shall notify the property owner and shall designate on
the preliminary and final plats that area proposed to be acquired by the public
body.
      (4)   Duration of land reservation. The acquisition of land reserved by a
public agency on the final plat shall be initiated within 12 months of
notification from the owner, in writing, that he or she intends to develop the
land. Such letter of intent shall be accompanied by a sketch plat of the
proposed development and a tentative schedule of construction. Failure on the
part of the public agency to initiate acquisition within the prescribed 12
months shall result in the removal of the “reserved” designation from the
property involved and the freeing of the property for development in accordance
with these regulations.
(Prior Code, § 1246.07)
§ 155.065 PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES AND AMENITIES.
   Existing features which would add value to residential development or to the
local government as a whole, such as trees, watercourses, waterfalls, beaches,
historic spots, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in the
design of the subdivision. No trees shall be removed from any subdivision, nor
any change of grade of the land effected, until approval of the preliminary
plat has been granted. All trees on the plat required to be retained shall be
preserved, and all trees, where required, shall be welled and protected against
change of grade. The sketch plat shall show the number and location of existing
trees, as required by these regulations, and shall further indicate all those
marked for retention and the location of all proposed shade trees required
along the street side of each lot as required by these regulations.
(Prior Code, § 1246.08)
§ 155.066 NON-RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   In general. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for
commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect
to such land shall make such provision as the Planning Commission may require.
A non-residential subdivision may also be subject to the requirements for site
plan approval set forth in the Zoning Code. Site plan approval and non-
residential subdivision plat approval may proceed simultaneously at the
discretion of the Planning Commission. A non-residential subdivision shall be
subject to all the requirements of these regulations, as well as additional
standards required by the Planning Commission, and shall conform to the
proposed land use and standards established in the master plan, the official
map, and the Zoning Code.
   (B)   Standards. In addition to the principles and standards set forth in
these regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions,
the applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission
that the street, parcel, and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to
the uses anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The
following principles and standards shall be observed.
      (1)   Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and
dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated.
      (2)   Street rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate
the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon.
      (3)   Special requirements may be imposed by the city with respect to
street, curb, gutter, and sidewalk design and construction.
      (4)   Special requirements may be imposed by the city with respect to the
installation of public utilities, including water, sewer, and storm water
drainage.
      (5)   Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas
from potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on existing or
potential residential development and provisions for a permanently landscaped
buffer strip when necessary.
      (6)   Streets carrying non-residential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas.
(Prior Code, § 1246.09)
ROADS
§ 155.080 PURPOSE.
   To provide for roads of suitable location, width, and improvement to
accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access for police,
fire-fighting, snow removal, sanitation, and road maintenance equipment, and to
coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient system and avoid undue hardships
to adjoining properties, the following road design standards are required. Road
classification may be indicated on the master plan or official map, or it may
be determined by the Planning Commission.
(Prior Code, § 1246.01)
§ 155.081 ROAD SURFACING AND IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   After sewer and water utilities have been installed by the developer,
the applicant shall construct curbs and gutters and shall surface or cause to
be surfaced roadways to the widths prescribed in these regulations. Said
surfacing shall be of such character as is suitable for the expected traffic
and in harmony with similar improvements in the surrounding areas. Types of
pavement shall be determined by the City Engineer. Adequate provision shall be
made for culverts, drains, and bridges.
   (B)   All road pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements and structures,
curbs, turn-arounds, and sidewalks shall conform to all construction standards
and specifications adopted by the Planning Commission, the City Engineer, or
the governing body, and shall be incorporated into the construction plans to be
submitted by the developer prior to plat approval.
(Prior Code, § 1246.01)
§ 155.082 EXCESS RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards designated in these
regulations may be required whenever, due to topography, additional width is
necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Slopes shall not be in excess of
three-to-one.
(Prior Code, § 1246.01)
§ 155.083 RAILROADS AND LIMITED-ACCESS HIGHWAYS.
   Railroad rights-of-way and limited-access highways, where so located as to
effect the subdivision of adjoining lands, shall be treated as follows.
   (A)   In Residential Districts, a buffer strip of at least 25 feet in depth
in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be
provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited-access highway. This
strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat as
follows: “This area is reserved for screening purposes. The placement of
structures hereon is prohibited.”
   (B)   In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses, the
nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad
shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure
suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
   (C)   Streets parallel to the railroad, when intersecting a street which
crosses the railroad at grade, shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance
shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for
future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
(Prior Code, § 1246.01)
§ 155.084 INTERSECTIONS.
   (A)   The design of the internal road circulation system shall incorporate
the use of three-way or “T” intersections, wherever possible, to assure added
safety.
   (B)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle of less
than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. Not more than two streets shall
intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by the Planning
Commission.
   (C)   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall,
wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersection on the opposite
side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet
shall not be permitted. Where streets intersect major streets, their alignment
shall be continuous. Intersections of major streets shall be at least 800 feet
apart.
   (D)   The minimum curb radius at the intersection of two local streets shall
be at least 20 feet, and the minimum curb radius at an intersection involving a
collector street shall be at least 25 feet.
   (E)   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practicable. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a
leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a 2% grade at a
distance of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the
intersecting street.
   (F)   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing
vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting
visibility, the developer shall clear out such ground, and/or vegetation
(including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to
the extent deemed necessary by the City Engineer to provide adequate sight
distance.
   (G)   The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be 3%
or less.
(Prior Code, § 1246.01)
§ 155.085 BRIDGES.
   Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by the Planning
Commission, shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant without
reimbursement from the local government. The sharing expense for the
construction of bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined
by the Planning Commission, will be fixed by special agreement between the
governing body and the applicant. Said cost shall be charged to the applicant
pro rata as the percentage of his or her land developed and so served.
(Prior Code, § 1246.01)
§ 155.086 DEDICATIONS AND RESERVATIONS.
   (A)   New perimeter streets. Street systems in new subdivisions shall be
laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an
existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the
street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The Planning
Commission may authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves
and dedicates the entire required street right-of-way width within his or her
own subdivision boundaries.
   (B)   Widening and realignment of existing roads. Where a subdivision
borders an existing narrow road or when the master plan, official map, or
zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening a road
that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant
shall be required to improve and dedicate, at his or her expense, such areas
for widening or realignment of such roads. Such frontage roads and streets
shall be improved and dedicated by the applicant at his or her own expense to
the full width as required by these subdivision regulations. Land reserved for
any road purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements of
the Zoning Code, whether the land is to be dedicated to the municipality in fee
simple or an easement is granted to the local government.

(Prior Code, § 1246.01)
SEWERAGE FACILITIES
§ 155.100 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   The applicant shall install sanitary sewer facilities in a manner prescribed
by the local government construction standards and specifications. All plans
shall be designed in accordance with the rules, regulations, and standards of
the City Engineer, the state’s Department of Natural Resources, and other
appropriate agencies. Plans shall be approved by the aforementioned agencies.
Necessary action shall be taken by the applicant to extend or create a Sanitary
Sewer District for the purpose of providing sewerage facilities to the
subdivision where no district exists for the land to be subdivided.
(Prior Code, § 1246.04)
§ 155.101 HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL AND NON-RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   Sanitary sewerage facilities shall connect with public sanitary sewerage
systems. Sewers shall be installed to serve each lot and to grades and sizes
required by approving officials and agencies. No individual disposal system or
treatment plans, or private or group disposal systems, shall be permitted.
sanitary sewerage facilities, including the installation of laterals in the
right-of-way, shall be subject to the specifications, rules, regulations, and
guidelines of the City Engineer and the state’s Department of Natural
Resources.
(Prior Code, § 1246.04)
§ 155.102 LOW AND MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   Sanitary sewerage systems shall be constructed as follows.
   (A)   Where a public sanitary sewerage system is reasonably accessible, the
applicant shall connect with the same and provide sewers accessible to each lot
in the subdivision.
   (B)   Where public sanitary sewerage systems are not reasonably accessible
but will become available within a reasonable time (not to exceed 15 years),
the applicant may choose one of the following alternatives.
      (1)   A central sewerage system, where plans for future public sanitary
sewerage systems exist, the applicant shall install the sewer lines, laterals,
and mains to be in permanent conformance with such plans and ready for
connection to such public sewer mains.
      (2)   An individual disposal system, where an individual disposal system
is chosen, the applicant shall install sanitary sewer lines, laterals, and
mains from the street curb to a point in the subdivision boundary where a
future connection with the public sewer main shall be made. Sewer lines shall
be laid from the house to the street line, and a connection shall be available
in the home to connect the individual disposal system to the sewer system when
the public sewers become available. Such sewer systems shall be capped until
ready for use and shall conform to all plans for installation of the public
sewer system, where such exist, and shall be ready for connection to such
public sewer main.
   (C)   Where sanitary sewer systems are not reasonably accessible and will
not become available for a period in excess of 15 years, the applicant may
install sewage systems as follows.
      (1)   In Medium Density Residential Districts, only a central sewerage
system may be installed. No individual disposal system will be permitted. Where
plans exist for a public sewer system to be built for a period in excess of 15
years, the applicant shall install all sewer lines, laterals, and mains to be
in permanent conformance with such plans and ready for connection to such
public sewer main.
      (2)   In Low Density Residential Districts, an individual disposal system
or a central sewerage system shall be used.
(Prior Code, § 1246.04)
§ 155.103 MANDATORY CONNECTION TO THE PUBLIC SEWER SYSTEM.
   If a public sanitary sewer is accessible and a sanitary sewer is placed in a
street or alley abutting upon property, the owner thereof shall be required to
connect to said sewer for the purpose of disposing of waste, and it shall be
unlawful for any such owner or occupant to maintain or retain upon any such
property an individual sewage disposal system.
(Prior Code, § 1246.04)
§ 155.104 INDIVIDUAL DISPOSAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS.
   If public sewer facilities are not available and individual disposal systems
are proposed, minimum lot areas shall conform to the requirements of the Zoning
Code and percolation tests, and test holes shall be made as directed by the
county’s Health Department. The individual disposal system, including the size
of the septic tanks and the size of tile fields or other secondary treatment
devices, shall also be approved by the county’s Health Department.
(Prior Code, § 1246.04)
§ 155.105 DESIGN CRITERIA FOR SANITARY SEWERS.
   (A)   Deviations. These design criteria are not intended to cover
extraordinary situations. Deviations will be allowed and may be required in
those instances where considered justified by the City Engineer.
   (B)   Design factors.
      (1)   Sanitary sewer systems should be designed for the ultimate
tributary population. Due consideration should be given to current zoning
regulations and approved planning and zoning reports where applicable. Sewer
capacities should be adequate to handle the anticipated maximum hourly quantity
of sewage and industrial waste together with an adequate allowance for
infiltration and other extraneous flows. The unit design flows presented
hereinafter should be adequate in each case for the particular type of
development indicated. Sewers shall be designed for the total tributary area
using the following criteria.
 Cubic Feet per Second (cfs)/Acre
                                               Cubic Feet per Second (cfs)/Acre
Apartments
   One- and two-story                       .02
   Three- through six-story                 .03
Commercial
   High rise                                As directed by the City Engineer
   Industrial                               As directed by the City Engineer
   Shopping centers                         .02
   Small stores, offices, and miscellaneous .02
businesses
One- and two-family dwellings                  .02
 
      (2)   These design factors shall apply to watersheds of 300 acres or
less. Design factors for watersheds larger than 300 acres and smaller than
1,000 acres shall be computed on the basis of a linear decrease from the
applicable design factor for an area of 300 acres to a design factor of .01
cfs/acre for an area of 1,000 acres, unless otherwise directed by the City
Engineer. Design factors for watersheds larger than 1,000 acres shall be .01
cfs/acre unless otherwise directed by the City Engineer.
   (C)   Maximum size. The diameter of sewers proposed shall not exceed the
diameter of the existing or proposed outlet, whichever is applicable, unless
otherwise approved by the City Engineer.
   (D)   Minimum size. No public sewer shall be less than eight inches in
diameter.
   (E)   Minimum slope. All sewers shall be designed to give mean velocities,
when flowing full, of not less than 2.7 feet per second. All velocity and flow
calculations shall be based on the Manning Formula using an N value of 0.013.
The slopes shall be the minimum for the size indicated. Exceptions to these
slopes shall be made at the upper end of lateral sewers serving under 30
houses. Said sewers shall have a minimum slope of 0.76%. Where lateral sewers
serve less than ten houses, the minimum slope shall be not less than 1%.

   (F)   Alignment. All sewers shall be laid with straight alignment between
manholes, unless otherwise directed or approved by the City Engineer.
   (G)   Manhole location. Manholes shall be installed at the end of each line;

      (4)   Costs of improvements. All required improvements shall be made by
the applicant, at his or her expense, without reimbursement by the local
government or any improvement district therein.
      (5)   Failure to complete improvements. For subdivisions for which no
performance bond has been posted, if the improvements are not completed within
the period specified by the City Council in the resolution approving the final
plat, the approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where surety
has been posted and required improvements have not been installed within the
terms of such surety, the local government may declare the surety to be in
default and require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the
extent of the building development at the time the surety is declared to be in
default.
   (B)   Inspection of improvements.
      (1)   General procedure and fees. The City Council shall provide for the
inspection of required improvements during construction and ensure their
satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay to the local government an
inspection fee of 2% of the amount of the surety or the estimated cost of the
required improvements, and the subdivision plat shall not be approved by the
City Council unless such fee has been paid at the time of application. These
fees shall be due and payable upon demand of the local government and no
building permits or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all such
fees are paid. If the City Engineer finds upon inspection that any of the
required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the local
government’s construction standards and specifications, the applicant shall be
responsible for completing or correcting the improvements. Wherever the cost of
improvements is covered by a performance bond, the applicant, and the bonding
company shall be severally and jointly liable for completing the improvements
according to specifications.
      (2)   Release or reduction of performance bond.
         (a)   Certificate of satisfactory completion. The governing body will
not accept the dedication of required improvements, nor release or reduce a
performance bond, until the City Engineer has submitted a certificate stating
that all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until the
applicant’s engineer or surveyor has certified to the City Engineer, through
submission of a detailed “as-built” survey plat of the subdivision, indicating
location, dimensions, materials, and other information required by the City
Engineer, that the layout of the line and grade of all public improvements is
in accordance with construction plans for the subdivision, and that a title
insurance policy has been furnished to and approved by the City Attorney
indicating that the improvements have been completed, are ready for dedication
to the local government, and are free and clear of any and all liens and
encumbrances. Upon such approval and recommendation, the governing body shall
thereafter accept the improvements for dedication in accordance with the
established procedure.
         (b)   Reduction of performance bond. A performance bond shall be
reduced upon the actual dedication of public improvements, but only in the
ratio that the public improvement dedicated bears to the total public
improvements for the plat. In no event shall a performance bond be reduced
below 25% of the principal amount of such bond.
   (C)   Escrow deposits for lot improvements.
      (1)   Acceptance of escrow funds. Whenever, by reason of the season of
the year, any lot improvements required by these subdivision regulations cannot
be performed, the Building and Zoning Inspector may, nevertheless, issue a
certificate of occupancy, provided there is no danger to health, safety, or
general welfare, upon accepting a cash escrow deposit in an amount to be
determined by the City Engineer for the cost of said improvements. The
performance bond covering such lot improvements shall remain in full force and
effect.
      (2)   Procedures on escrow funds. All required improvements for which
escrow monies have been accepted by the Building and Zoning Inspector at the
time of issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall be installed by the
developer within a period of nine months from the date of deposit of such
escrow monies and the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. In the event
that the improvements have not been properly installed, at the end of the nine-
month period specified herein, the Building and Zoning Inspector shall give two
weeks’ written notice to the developer requiring him or her to install such
improvements. In the event that the required improvements are not installed
properly, in the discretion of the Building and Zoning Inspector, he or she may
request the governing body to authorize the local government to proceed to
contract out the work for the installation of the necessary improvements in a
sum not to exceed the amount of the escrow deposit. At the time of the issuance
of the certificate of occupancy for which escrow monies have been deposited
with the Building and Zoning Inspector, the applicant shall obtain and file
with the Building and Zoning Inspector, prior to obtaining the certificate of
occupancy, a notarized statement from the purchaser or purchasers of the
premises authorizing the Building and Zoning Inspector to install the
improvements at the end of the nine-month period in the event that the same
have not been duly installed by the developer.
   (D)   Maintenance of improvements.
      (1)   The applicant shall be required to maintain all improvements on the
individual and subdivided lots and to provide for snow removal on streets and
sidewalks, if required, until the acceptance of said improvements by the
governing body. If there are any certificates of occupancy on a street not
dedicated to the local government, the local government may, on 12 hours’
notice, plow the street or effect emergency repairs, and charge the same to the
applicant.
      (2)   The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance bond with the
governing body, prior to dedication, in an amount considered adequate by the
City Engineer, and in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney, in order to
assure the satisfactory condition of the required improvements, including all
lot improvements on the individual subdivided lots, for a period of one year
after the date of their acceptance by the governing body, and the dedication of
the same to the local government.
   (E)   Deferral or waiver of required improvements.
      (1)   At the time of final plat approval and subject to appropriate
conditions, Council may defer or waive the provision of any or all such
improvements as in its judgment are not requisite in the interests of the
public health, safety, and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because
of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities.
      (2)   Whenever it is deemed necessary by the Planning Commission to defer
the construction of any improvement required herein because of incompatible
grades, future planning, inadequate connecting facilities, or the lack thereof,
or for other reasons, the applicant shall pay his or her share of the costs of
the future improvements to the local government prior to the signing of the
final subdivision plat by Council, or the applicant may post acceptable surety
to ensure the completion of said improvements upon demand of the local
government.
(Prior Code, § 1248.04)
§ 155.161 ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY.
   (A)   Where surety has been required for a subdivision, no certificate of
occupancy for any building in the subdivision shall be issued prior to the
completion of the improvements and the dedication of the same to the local
government, as required in the City Council’s final approval of the subdivision
plat by Council.
   (B)   The extent of street improvement shall be adequate for vehicular
access by the prospective occupant and by police and fire equipment prior to
the issuance of an occupancy permit. The developer shall, at the time of the
dedication, submit monies in escrow to the local government in an amount
determined by the City Engineer for the necessary final improvement of the
street.
   (C)   No building permit shall be issued for the final 10% of lots in a
subdivision, or if 10% is less than two lots, then for the final two lots of a
subdivision, until all public improvements required by the City Council for the
plat have been fully completed and dedicated to the local government.
   (D)   No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be granted or
issued if a developer or his or her authorized agent shall have violated any
federal, state, or local law pertaining to the consumer protection of real
estate land sales, land subdivision, promotion, or practices, or any applicable
conflicts-of-interest legislation, with respect to the lot or parcel of land
which is the subject of the permit or certificate, until so ordered by a court
of competent jurisdiction.
   (E)   With respect to the lot or parcel of land, in the event a building
permit or certificate of occupancy has been granted or issued, such permit or
certificate shall be subject to revocation by the municipality until otherwise
ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided that in no event shall
the rights of intervening innocent third parties in possession of a certificate
of occupancy be prejudiced by any such revocation.
   (F)   Any violation of a federal, state, or local consumer protection law,
including, but not limited to, the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, being 39
U.S.C. §§ 410 et seq., the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1970, being 15
U.S.C. §§ 41 to 58, the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, being 15
U.S.C. §§ 1701 et seq., the Truth-in-Lending Act, being 15 U.S.C. §§ 16.01 et
seq., the Uniform Commercial Code, State Uniform Securities Act, being M.C.L.A.
§§ 451.2101 et seq., and State Land Division Act, being M.C.L.A. §§ 560.101 et
seq., or of a conflicts of interest statute, law, or ordinance, shall be deemed
a violation of these regulations and shall be subject to all of the penalties
and proceedings set forth in these regulations.
(Prior Code, § 1248.05)
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
§ 155.175 CONFORMANCE TO APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   In addition to the requirements established elsewhere in these subdivision
regulations, all subdivision plats shall be in compliance with the following
laws, rules, and regulations:
   (A)   All applicable statutory provisions;
   (B)   The local government Zoning Code, Building, and Housing Codes and all
other applicable laws of appropriate jurisdictions;
   (C)   The official master plan, official map, public utilities plant, and
capital improvements program of the local government, including all streets,

if a proposed subdivision plat is not in conformity with the guidelines
provided for herein or the policies and purposes set forth in §
155.126; and
   (H)   New subdivision developments shall incorporate non-motorized
facilities into the design of the site by providing context-appropriate design
features that meet the mobility needs of future occupants.
(Prior Code, § 1248.01) (Ord. passed 7-9-2020)
§ 155.176 SELF-IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS.
   If an owner places restrictions on any of the land contained in a
subdivision that are greater than those required by the Zoning Code or these
subdivision regulations, such restrictions or references thereto shall be
indicated on the subdivision plat, and the restrictive covenants shall be
recorded with the county’s Register of Deeds in a form approved by the City
Attorney.
(Prior Code, § 1248.01)
§ 155.177 PLATS STRADDLING MUNICIPAL BOUNDARIES.
   Whenever access to a subdivision is required across land in another local
government, the Planning Commission may request assurance from the City
Attorney that such access is legally established, and from the City Engineer
that the access road is adequately improved and/or that surety has been
provided and is sufficient in amount to assure the construction of the access
road. In general, lot lines should not cross municipal boundary lines.
(Prior Code, § 1248.01)
§ 155.178 CHARACTER OF THE LAND.
   Land which the Planning Commission finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or
development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations,
adverse earth formations, adverse topography, utility easements, or other
features which will be reasonably harmful to the safety, health, and general
welfare of present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its
surrounding areas shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods
are formulated by the developer and approved by the Planning Commission, upon
recommendation of the City Engineer, to solve the problems created by the
unsuitable land conditions.
(Prior Code, § 1248.01)
§ 155.179 SUBDIVISION NAME.
   The proposed name of a subdivision shall not duplicate or closely
approximate phonetically the name of any other subdivision in the area covered
by these regulations. The Planning Commission and the county’s Plat Board shall
have final authority to designate the name of the subdivision, which shall be
determined prior to pre-preliminary approval of the plat under the requirements
of § 112 of Public Act 288 of 1967, as amended, being M.C.L.A. § 560.112.
(Prior Code, § 1248.01)
LOTS
§ 155.190 ARRANGEMENT.
   The lot arrangement shall be designed so that there will be no foreseeable
difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing
permits to build on lots within the subdivision in compliance with either the
Zoning Code or Health Department regulations and in providing driveway access
to buildings on any lots from an approved street.
(Prior Code, § 1248.02)
§ 155.191 DIMENSIONS.
   (A)   Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the Zoning
Code.
   (B)   In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines or
radial to curving street lines, unless a variation from this rule will produce
a more desirable street or lot plan.
   (C)   The dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for the
erection of buildings, observing the minimum front yard setback from both
streets.
   (D)   The depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business,
commercial, or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for off-street
parking and loading facilities as required for the type of use and development
contemplated and established in the Zoning Code.
(Prior Code, § 1248.02)
§ 155.192 DOUBLE FRONTAGE LOTS.
   Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except where
necessary to provide separation of residential development from traffic
arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
(Prior Code, § 1248.02)
§ 155.193 DRAINAGE.
   Lots shall be designed to provide positive drainage away from all proposed
building sites. Individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general
storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage systems shall be designed to
avoid any concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent lots.
(Prior Code, § 1248.02)
§ 155.194 WASTE MATERIALS.
   No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk, rubbish, or
other waste materials of any kind shall be buried in any land, or left or
deposited on any lot or street at the time of the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy, and removal of the same shall be required prior to issuance of any
certificate of occupancy on a subdivision. No such waste materials shall be
left or deposited in any area of the subdivision at the time of the expiration
of the performance bond or the dedication of public improvements, whichever is
sooner.
(Prior Code, § 1248.02)
§ 155.195 FENCES.
   Each subdivider and/or developer shall be required to furnish and install
fences wherever the Planning Commission determines that a hazardous condition
may exist. The fences shall be constructed according to the standards
established by the City Engineer, and the height and material shall be noted on
the final construction plans. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until
said fence improvements have been duly installed.
(Prior Code, § 1248.02)
§ 155.196 WATERBODIES AND WATERCOURSES.
   If a tract being subdivided contains a waterbody, or portion thereof, lot
lines shall be so drawn as to distribute the entire ownership of the waterbody
among the fee simple owners of the adjacent lots. The Planning Commission may
approve an alternative plan whereby the ownership of and responsibility for the
safe maintenance of the waterbody is so placed that it will not become a local
government responsibility. No more than 25% of the minimum area of a lot
required under the Zoning Code may be satisfied by land which is under water.
Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the street by
which it has access, provisions shall be made for the installation of a culvert
or other structure of a design approved by the City Engineer.
(Prior Code, § 1248.02)
§ 155.197 SURETY TO INCLUDE LOT IMPROVEMENT.
   The surety shall include an amount to guarantee the completion of all
requirements, including, but not limited to, soil preservation, final grading,
lot drainage, removal of debris and waste, fencing, and all other lot
improvements required by the Planning Commission. Whether or not a certificate
of occupancy has been issued, at the expiration of a surety so placed, the
local government may enforce the provisions of the surety where the provisions
of this subchapter or any other applicable law, code, or regulation have not
been complied with.
(Prior Code, § 1248.02)
CONSTRUCTION AND ROADS
§ 155.210 FRONTAGE ON IMPROVED ROADS.
   No subdivision shall be approved unless the area to be subdivided shall have
frontage on and access from an existing street on the official map, or if there
is no official map, unless such street is.
   (A)   An existing state, county, city, or township highway; or
   (B)   Shown upon a plat approved by the Planning Commission and recorded in
the county’s Register of Deeds. Such street or highway must be suitably
improved as required by highway rules, regulations, specifications, or orders,
or be secured by a form of security required under these subdivision
regulations, with the width of the right-of-way as required by these
subdivision regulations or the official map. Wherever the area to be subdivided
is to utilize existing road frontage, such road shall be suitably improved, as
provided herein.
(Prior Code, § 1248.03)
§ 155.211 GRADING AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN.
   Roads shall be graded and improved, shall conform to the local government
construction standards and specifications, and shall be approved as to design
and specifications by the City Engineer in accordance with the construction
plans to be submitted prior to final plat approval.
(Prior Code, § 1248.03)
§ 155.212 TOPOGRAPHY AND ARRANGEMENT.
   (A)   Roads shall be appropriately related to the topography. Local roads
shall be curved wherever possible to avoid conformity of lot appearance. All
streets shall be arranged to obtain building sites at or above the grades of
the streets. Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the
original topography. Combinations of steep grades and curves shall be avoided.
Specific standards are contained in the design standards of these regulations.
   (B)   All streets and non-motorized facilities shall be properly integrated
with the existing and proposed circulation system as established in the
official map and/or master plan.
   (C)   All thoroughfares shall be properly related to special traffic
generators such as industries, Business Districts, schools, churches, and
shopping centers, to population densities and to the pattern of existing and
proposed land uses.
   (D)   Minor or local streets shall be designed to conform to the topography,
to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility
systems, and to provide convenient and safe access to property.
   (E)   The use of curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or U-shaped streets is
encouraged wherever such use will result in a more desirable and functional
layout.
   (F)   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract
to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions,
or unless, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, such extension is not
necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision
with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development of
adjacent tracts.
   (G)   In business and industrial developments, streets, and other accessways
shall be planned to accommodate the grouping of buildings, the location of rail
facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas,
and walks and parking areas, so as to minimize the conflict of movement between
the various types of traffic, including pedestrian traffic.
(Prior Code, § 1248.03) (Ord. passed 7-9-2020)
§ 155.213 BLOCKS.
   (A)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of
appropriate depth. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be permitted
in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads, or waterways.
   (B)   The length, width, and shape of blocks shall be appropriate for the
locality and the type of development contemplated. However, block length in
residential areas shall not exceed 2,200 feet or 12 times the minimum lot width
required in the zoning district, nor shall the length of such blocks be less
than 400 feet in length. Wherever practicable, blocks along major arterials,
and collector streets shall not be not less than 1,000 feet in length.
   (C)   In long blocks, the Planning Commission may require the reservation of
an easement through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, or
pedestrian traffic. Pedestrianways or crosswalks, not less than ten feet wide,
may be required by the Planning Commission through the center of blocks more
than 800 feet long where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to
schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, or other community
facilities. Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of such length and
width as may be determined to be suitable by the Planning Commission for the
prospective use.
(Prior Code, § 1248.03)
§ 155.214 ACCESS TO PRIMARY ARTERIALS.
   Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed primary
arterial, the Planning Commission may require that access to such street be
limited by one of the following means.
   (A)   The design of lots to back onto the primary arterial and to front onto
a parallel local street; no access shall be provided from the primary arterial,
and screening shall be provided in a strip of land along the rear property
lines of such lots.
   (B)   A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered from
and designed generally at right angles to a parallel street, with the rear
lines of their terminal lots backing onto the major arterial.
   (C)   A marginal access or service road, separated from the primary arterial
by a planting or grass strip, and having access at suitable points.
(Prior Code, § 1248.03)
§ 155.215 ROAD NAMES.
   All proposed road names shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning
Commission and the City Council and cleared through the county’s Road
Commission, prior to approval of the preliminary plat. Names shall be
sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other road names in the
local area so as not to cause confusion. A road which is or is planned as a
continuation of an existing road shall bear the same name.
(Prior Code, § 1248.03)
§ 155.216 ROAD REGULATORY SIGNS.
   The applicant shall deposit with the local government, at the time of
submission of the final plat for approval, the sum of $50 for each road sign
required. The city shall install all road signs prior to issuing certificates
of occupancy for any residence. Street name signs shall be placed at all
intersections within or abutting the subdivision, the type and location of
which shall be approved by the City Engineer.
(Prior Code, § 1248.03)
§ 155.217 STREET LIGHTS.
   Installation of street lights shall be required in accordance with design
and specification standards approved by the City Engineer.
(Prior Code, § 1248.03)
§ 155.218 RESERVE STRIPS.
   Reserve strips shall not be permitted adjacent to a proposed street in a
location which strips would deny access from adjacent property to the street.
(Prior Code, § 1248.03)
§ 155.219 CONSTRUCTION OF ROADS AND DEAD-END ROADS.
   (A)   Construction of roads. The arrangement of streets shall provide for
the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when such
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire
protection, and efficient provision of utilities and where such continuation is
in accordance with the local government plan. If the adjacent property is
undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-of-
way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary T- or L-shaped
turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets. The Planning
Commission may limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in accordance
with the design standards of these regulations.
   (B)   Dead-end roads (permanent). Where a road does not extend to the
boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the
Planning Commission for access to adjoining property, the Planning Commission
may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage
facilities, pedestrian traffic, or utilities. A cul-de-sac turn-around shall be
provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street in accordance with local
government construction standards and specifications. Permanent dead-end
streets shall be limited in length in accordance with the design standards of
these regulations.
(Prior Code, § 1248.03)
§ 155.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of §§ 155.140 through 155.145
or fails to comply therewith is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon
conviction thereof, be fined not more than $100 or imprisoned not more than 30
days, or both, for each offense. A separate offense shall be deemed committed
each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues. A landowner,
tenant, subdivider, builder, public official, or other person who commits,
participates in, assists in, or maintains such violation may be found guilty of
a separate offense and suffer the penalties herein provided. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the City Council or any other public official or
private citizen from taking such lawful action as is necessary to restrain or
prevent any violation of §§ 155.140 through 155.145 or of the Subdivision
Control Act, being Public Act 288 of 1967, as amended, being M.C.L.A. §§
560.101 through 560.293.
   (B)   Appropriate actions and proceedings may be taken at law or in equity
to prevent any violation of §§
155.140 through
155.145, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages, to restrain,
correct or abate a violation, or to prevent illegal occupancy of a building,
structure, or premises, and these remedies shall be in addition to the
penalties described in division (A) above.

   (A)   It is the intent of this subchapter to require a zoning compliance
permit for all new structures and uses, as well as changes in usage. The
regulations contained herein are intended to provide and promote the orderly
development of the city; safe and convenient traffic movement, both within a
site and in relation to access streets; the stability of land values and
investments by preventing the impairment or depreciation of land values, and
development by the erection of structures or additions or alterations thereto
without proper attention to setting or to unsightly or undesirable appearances;
harmonious relationship to buildings, other structures and uses, both within a
site and/or adjacent sites; and the conservation of natural amenities and
resources and to promote the public safety.

erected or enlarged until the person conducting such use or erecting or
enlarging such structure has obtained a zoning compliance permit from the
Zoning Administrator.
   (C)   No zoning compliance permit shall be issued where it appears that any
land area required to conform to any provision of this subchapter is also
required as part of any adjoining property to keep the development or use
thereof in conformity with this subchapter, or to keep it from becoming more
non-conforming. The applicant for a zoning compliance permit shall agree that
neither he or she nor his or her successor in title, shall sell, convey, lease,
or otherwise dispose of any land surrounding a structure if such conveyance
will result in the structure being left on a lot which fails to meet the
minimum requirements set forth in this subchapter.
   (D)   Any zoning compliance permit based on any material false statement in
the application of supporting documents is absolutely void and shall be
revoked.
   (E)   Special or conditional uses and non-conforming uses and structures
shall require approval of the Planning Commission and become part of the zoning
compliance permit.
   (F)   Variances require the approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
   (G)   The Zoning Administrator shall issue all zoning compliance permits and
shall clearly designate any and all conditions and variances, which have been
approved by the Planning Commission and/or Zoning Board of Appeals when
required by this or subchapter.
   (H)   If the applicant does not exercise the use of the zoning compliance
permit by completing any approved construction and/or use within two years
after its issue, the zoning compliance permit will become null and void.
   (I)   Any zoning compliance permit acted upon by the applicant or his or her
agents or successors will inure for the duration of the existing use and is
limited to those uses specified in the zoning compliance permit.
   (J)   It shall be unlawful to use or permit the use of any building or
premises or part thereof hereafter created, erected, or altered, or to change
or enlarge the use of any building or premises or part thereof, until a
certificate of occupancy shall have been issued by the county.

option to developers as authorized by Public Act 179 of 2001 for the purpose
of:
   (A)   Assuring the permanent preservation of open space, agricultural lands,
and other natural resources;
   (B)   Allowing innovation and greater flexibility in the design of
residential developments; and
   (C)   Encouraging a less sprawling form of development, thus preserving open
space. For the purpose of this chapter, the term OPEN SPACE shall refer to a
natural state preserving natural resources, natural features, or scenic or
wooded conditions; agriculture use; or a similar use or condition.
(Prior Code, § 1282.01) (Ord. passed 11-12-2009)
§ 156.106 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA.
   To be eligible for open space preservation consideration, the applicant must
present a proposal for residential development that meets each of the
following.
   (A)   Minimum project size. The minimum size of an open space preservation
development shall be five acres of contiguous land.
   (B)   Unified control. The proposed development shall be under single
ownership or control, such that there is a single person or entity having
proprietary responsibility for the full completion of the project. The
applicant shall provide sufficient documentation of ownership or control in the
form of agreements, contracts, covenants, and/or deed restrictions that
indicate that the development will be completed in its entirety as proposed.
   (C)   Guarantee of open space. The applicant shall guarantee to the
satisfaction of the Planning Commission that all open space portions of the
development will be maintained in the manner approved. Documentation shall be
presented that binds all successors and future owners in fee title to
commitments set forth in the applicant’s proposal. This provision shall not
prohibit a transfer of ownership or control, provided notice of such transfer
is provided to the city and the land uses continue as approved in the open
space preservation site plan.
(Prior Code, § 1282.02) (Ord. passed 11-12-2009)
§ 156.107 PROJECT DESIGN STANDARDS.

for the underlying zoning district and other city regulations shall remain in
full force.
   (C)   The developer shall maintain a minimum of 20% of the gross area of the
site as dedicated open space. Land dedicated for open space does not include a
golf course, street rights-of-ways, unbuildable land areas, or submerged land
areas but may include a recreational trail, picnic area, children’s play area,
greenway, or linear park. The dedicated open space may be, but is not required
to be, dedicated to the use of the public.
   (D)   The number of dwelling units allowable within an open space
preservation project shall be determined in the following manner: The applicant
shall prepare and present to the Planning Commission a design of the area that
is consistent with the existing city zoning requirements. The Planning
Commission shall review the design and determine the number of lots that could
be feasibly constructed on the property. This number, as determined by the
Planning Commission, shall be the maximum number of dwelling units allowable
for the open space preservation project.
   (E)   To encourage flexibility and creativity consistent with the open space
preservation concept, the Planning Commission may grant specific departures
from the requirements of the zoning ordinance for yard, lot, and bulk standards
as a part of the approval process. Any regulatory modification approved by the
Planning Commission shall result in a higher quality of development than would
be possible using conventional zoning standards. The regulatory modifications
are not subject to variance approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals. No part of
an open space preservation site plan may be appealed to the Zoning Board of
Appeals.
   (F)   The dedicated open space shall be set aside by the developer through
an irrevocable conveyance that is found acceptable to the Planning Commission,
such as:
      (1)    Recorded deed restrictions in perpetuity;
      (2)   Covenants that run perpetually with the land;
      (3)   A conservation easement established per the state’s Natural
Resources and Environmental Protection Act, Publi Act 451 of 1994, being
M.C.L.A. §§ 324.2140 et seq.; and
      (4)   Deeded property to the city.
   (G)   Such conveyance shall assure that the open space “will be protected
from all forms of development and shall never be changed to another use.” Such
conveyance shall:
      (1)   Indicate the proposed allowable use(s) of the dedicated open space;
      (2)   Require that the dedicated open space be maintained by parties who
have an ownership interest in the open space;
      (3)   Provide standards for scheduled maintenance of the open space; and
      (4)   Provide for maintenance to be undertaken by the city in the event
that the dedicated open space is inadequately maintained, or is determined by
the city to be a public nuisance, with the assessment of costs upon the
property owners of the development.
   (H)   The dedicated open space shall forever remain open space, subject only
to uses set forth on the approved site plan. Further subdivision of open space
land or its use for other than recreation or conservation shall be strictly
prohibited.
   (I)   Accessory structures related to a recreation or conservation use may
be erected within the dedicated open space, subject to the approved open space
preservation site plan. These accessory structures shall not exceed, in the
aggregate, 1% of the total required open space area.
   (J)   Direct access onto a public road shall be required for all
developments receiving approval under the open space preservation option.
   (K)   The developer shall be responsible for construction of roads providing
access into and circulation within the new development.
   (L)   The development shall be designed to promote the preservation of
natural features. If animal or plant habitats of significant value exist on the
site, the Planning Commission, as a condition of approval, may require that the
open space preservation site plan preserve these areas in a natural state and
adequately protect them as nature preserves or limited-access areas.

§ 156.163 WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.
   (A)   It is the intent of this section to recognize that the city has a
clear and identifiable interest in accommodating the communication needs of
residents and businesses but also has an interest in regulating highly visible
structures such as large, high communication towers. It is the city’s interest,
also, to induce, to the extent reasonable, cooperative use and collocation of

use, it must have a minimum area of two and one-half acres.
         (b)   If the property is occupied by a residential use, it must have a
minimum area of 20 acres.
      (3)   The site shall have legal documented access to a public road.
      (4)   Any wireless communication tower must be set back from all property
lines a distance equal to its height, unless engineering plans and
specifications have been certified by a licensed mechanical, civil,
professional engineer or architect, or other engineer licensed and competent in
assessing the structural integrity of such towers, verifying a safe fall zone.
All towers shall be certified by licensed engineer to verify that the
structural design will meet federal standards to withstand wind speeds and
icing under 100-year event conditions in the area.
      (5)   Accessory structures shall not exceed a total of 600 square feet of
gross building area.
      (6)   No wireless communication facility shall be approved unless the
applicant is able to establish in writing that any existing tower, structure,
or facility is not available for co-utilization based upon technical inadequacy
or lack of capacity, unreasonable or prohibitive cost, denial by owner, or
other practical impediment to use or access.
      (7)   There shall not be displayed on the wireless communication facility
advertising or identification of any kind intended to be visible from the
ground or other structures, except as required for emergency purposes.
      (8)   The wireless communication facility shall be maintained in a

for continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned and the owner
of such tower or antenna shall remove the same within 90 days of receiving an
abandonment notification from the city. Failure to remove an abandoned tower or
antenna within 90 days shall be grounds for the city to remove the tower or
antenna at the owner’s expense. The Planning Commission may require the
applicant to post a bond in an amount equal to the reasonable cost of removal
for the tower and/or antenna. If a bond is to be required, the Planning
Commission shall include the requirement as a condition of approval.
      (11)   Minimum spacing between wireless communication facilities
containing one or more towers shall be one mile in order to prevent a
concentration of facilities in one area.
      (12)   Wireless communication facilities shall not be artificially
lighted unless required by the Federal Aviation Administration.
      (13)   The base of any tower and any cable supports shall be fenced with
a minimum six- foot high security fence and all fencing shall be screened with
landscaping. Accessory structures shall match the construction characteristics
of other existing buildings in the surrounding area.
      (14)   All wireless communication facilities shall be inspected after
being constructed and then once every three years for compliance with all
ordinance, structural, and operational requirements and shall be certified as
in compliance by a licensed mechanical, civil, professional engineer or
architect, or other engineer licensed and competent in assessing the structural
integrity of such towers, and said certification shall be submitted to the
city.
      (15)   The Planning Commission may require additional setback distances
as part of a special land use permit approval or for towers located within
1,000 feet of property zoned for residential use.

intrude into the public sidewalk space, over the lot line, or into the street
right-of-way, in the space from the ground to eight feet above the ground, nor
to block clear sight lines of vehicles on streets and driveways.
   (F)   Fences shall be constructed such that posts and framework are on the

light and air on adjacent premises.

be a public nuisance which may be enjoined or abated and may subject the
violator to civil damages, fines, and penalties, including the costs of
abatement, as provided in the city’s nuisance ordinance. The city specifically
reserves the right to contract for the removal and clean-up of nuisance
fencing, walls, or hedges and to assess the cost thereof to the property owner.

be allowed only in the Rural Residential District for the purpose of containing
animals provided that proper signage is maintained.
   (M)   A protective measures fence shall not be allowable in Residential
Districts and shall constitute a special use in all Non-Residential Districts.
A protective measures fence may only be constructed pursuant to a finding by
the Planning Commission of a need for such fence. In approving such a fence,
the Planning Commission shall determine that the definition of protective
measure fence is met and there is no reasonable alternative to the erection of
the fence. The owner of a protective measures fence may be granted permission
to erect necessary and reasonable barriers along the uppermost edge of such
fence including barbed wire. The applicant may appeal a denial or conditions of
an approval by the Planning Commission to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
   (N)   A fence site plan review is required for all fences in Residential
Zones (R-1, R-2, RR), said fence site plan review will require a fee as set by
City Council.
   (O)   Fences or walls on all lots in all Business Zoning Districts shall not
