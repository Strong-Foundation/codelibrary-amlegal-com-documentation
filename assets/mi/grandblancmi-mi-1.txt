emergency, then and in such case such further sum as may be needed may in like
manner be borrowed for such purpose, provided such action shall be approved by
the electors of the City when submitted to them at a general or special
election called for that purpose.
   Section 14.   May Borrow Further for Emergency: In case of fire, flood or
other calamity, the Council may borrow for the relief of the inhabitants of
said City, and for the preservation of Municipal property in the City, a sum
not exceeding one-fourth of one percent of the assessed valuation of all real
and personal property in the City, such sum to be due and payable in not more
than three years. For such loans, lawfully made, the bonds of the City may be
issued, bearing a rate of interest not exceeding six percent.
   Section 15.   Bond, Authority and Requirements: Said City may also issue
bonds for the purposes and in the manner permitted to villages, and
particularly as provided by Chapter 9 of the aforesaid village Act, and more
particularly as provided by sections thereof numbers 2747 to 2751 both
inclusive, of the Compiled Laws of Michigan for 1915, subject only to the
limitations of this Charter and the laws governing the incorporation of the
City of Grand Blanc, provided all bond issues (excepting refunding bonds) shall
be approved by a vote of three-fifths of the electors voting thereon.
   Section 16.   Must Appropriate for Bonds and Interest: It shall be the duty
of said Council each and every year, so long as the City shall remain in debt,
to include in the taxes levied, a sum not less than the amount of the bonds and
interest coming due in said year.
   Section 17.   Bonds, Record of: The Clerk shall enter in a book kept for
that purpose a record of all bonds and warrants issued, showing the date,
number, amount, date of maturity and rate of interest, of each thereof, and for
what issued.
   Section 18.   Debt Limitation: The Council is hereby prohibited from
authorizing the creation of any liability or indebtedness against the City, in
any one fiscal year, exceeding in the aggregate the amount of one half of one
percent of the assessed valuation of the property of said City; nor shall it be
lawful for said City ever to create an indebtedness from time to time to
exceed, in the aggregate, eight percent of the then assessed valuation of the
property of the City. This section shall not apply to special assessments, or
other specific provisions and authorities of this Charter relative to light,
power, water or public utility projects, as permitted by Chapter 22 and 23 and
hereof, nor Sections 13 and 14 of this chapter. In case any sum or sums of
money shall be borrowed by the Council, the same shall be paid out of the sum
raised by taxes for such year if the payment is not otherwise provided for, and
all sums of money borrowed by said City shall be applied to the purpose for
which the sum was borrowed, and to no other purpose whatever.
   Section 19.   Maturity of Bond Issues: Every bond issue of the City shall be
made payable within thirty years from the date of the issue, and shall contain
on its face a statement specifying the object for which the same is issued; and
if issued for the purpose of raising money for any public improvement, the
particular improvement shall also be specified on the face of such bonds;
provided, any bond issue which shall not be made to mature within five years,
from date of issue shall be so divided and matured that some of said bonds
shall mature serially each year after the first three years. And it shall be
unlawful for any officer of the City to sign or issue any such bond unless such
matters are set forth on the face of the same as aforesaid, or to use such
bonds, or proceeds from the sale thereof for any other object then mentioned on
the face of the bond.

appropriation ordinance to be levied or assessed as special assessments (if
any) as well as any and all special assessments authorized and directed, shall
forthwith, upon adoption and confirmation, be certified by the City Clerk to

amount of all personal property liable under the laws of the State to taxation
in the City, and the name of the owner, agent, or person liable to pay taxes
thereon. If known, and shall set down in such roll the valuation of such
property at its true cash value, on such basis as may hereafter be provided by
general law, placing the value of the real and personal property in separate
columns; provided that the description of personal property on said roll may be
made by using the word “Personal” except in cases where the general law
requires the kind of personal property assessed to be designated upon the roll.
Upon making said assessment roll the Assessor shall be governed by all the
provisions of the general law for the assessment of property in townships. All
personal property found in the City may be assessed therein, whether the owner
thereof resides in the City or elsewhere.
   Section 4.   Board of Review, Composition and Quorum: The Board of Review

select one of their number as Chairman.
   Notice of Time of Meeting: The City Clerk shall give notice of the time of
meeting of said Board of Review and of the place of holding the same, at least

three public places in said City.
   Assessment Roll Confirmed: The roll as prepared by the Assessor shall stand
as approved and adopted as the act of the Board of Review when and as changed
as herein provided.
   After said Board shall have completed the revision of said roll the City
Clerk shall endorse and sign a statement upon the roll to the effect that the

following form, viz:
   (Form of Certificate)
STATE OF MICHIGAN
County of Genesee, ss.
   I hereby certify that the Board of Review of the City of Grand Blanc has
reviewed, equalized and corrected the within assessment roll and has deducted
from (or added to, as the case may be)             dollars from (or to, as the
case be) the valuation of the real estate and personal property made by the
Assessor, and has determined the aggregate value of such real estate to be
$            and the aggregate value of the personal estate to be $         
for the year A.D.                   .
Dated                      .
                                                                                                     
                                 City Clerk
   Upon the completion of such roll and its endorsement in manner aforesaid, it
shall be returned to the Assessor and shall be conclusively presumed by all
courts and tribunals to be valid and shall not be set aside except for causes
mentioned in the general laws of the State relating to the assessment of
property and the levy and collection of taxes thereon. The omission of such
endorsement, however, shall not affect the validity of any such roll.
   Section 6.   Blanket Authority of Board of Review: Said Board of
Equalization and Review shall have the same power and perform the same duties
in all respects as boards of review in townships in reviewing and correcting
assessments made by the supervisors of townships, except as in this Charter
otherwise provided.
   Section 7.   Assessor to Spread Tax: After confirmation of that assessment
roll and after passage of the annual appropriation ordinance, and certification
thereof to the assessor, as in Section 7 of Chapter 19 and Section 5 of this
chapter provided, and before the second Monday in June, the City Assessor shall
apportion the several taxes to be raised in said City, except school taxes,
according and in proportion to the equalized valuation entered by the Board of
Review and Equalization in the assessment roll of the City. Such taxes shall be
entered in separate columns with appropriate headings. The total of all taxes
assessed against any one valuation or parcel of property shall be added and
carried out in the last column under the right hand of such roll. The City
Assessor shall carefully foot the several columns of valuation and taxes and
make a detailed statement thereof to the City Clerk, and said Clerk shall
immediately charge the amount of taxes to the City Treasurer.
   Section 8.   Tax Roll Certified to Treasurer: The City Assessor shall
thereupon prepare a copy of said assessment roll with the taxes assessed as
hereinbefore provided, and annex thereto a warrant signed by the City Clerk
commanding the City Treasurer to collect the several sums mentioned in the last
column of such roll not less than thirty nor more than sixty days from the date
of such warrant, and deliver said tax roll and warrant to the City Treasurer on
or before the second Monday in June. The said warrant shall authorize and
command the Treasurer, in case any person named in the assessment roll shall
neglect or refuse to pay his tax, to levy the same by distress and sale of
goods and chattels of such person, and the said Treasurer shall have the same
power and authority to enforce the collection of said taxes by seizure and sale
of personal property, or by suit, as is conferred upon township treasurers by
the general tax law. This roll shall be known as the “City Tax Roll” and shall
be a duplicate copy of the assessment roll prepared for school, State and
County taxation after the same has been reviewed, but before the taxes have
been spread thereon. Said warrant may be renewed from time to time by order of
the Council, and for such time as the Council may direct; provided, that the
time shall not be extended later than October 31 of any year.
   Section 9.   Office Hours of the Treasurer: Upon receiving such tax roll and
warrant, the City Treasurer shall proceed to collect such taxes; and to receive
the payment of taxes, he shall remain in his office at least one day in each
week from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. throughout the tax collection period, and at such
other time as the Council may prescribe, and shall give notice of such days by
publication in a newspaper published and circulating in the City.
   Section 10.   When Taxes Due and Collection Fee: Taxes so assessed on the
City tax roll shall become due and payable on July 1 in each year, except as
conditionally authorized by Section 8 of Chapter 21 hereof. Taxes paid before
August 31 shall be paid with one percent fee or penalty: taxes paid thereafter
may be paid with a two percent fee or penalty: taxes remaining unpaid after
October 31, shall be returned as delinquent. Said fee shall belong to the City
and shall be paid into the general or contingent fund.
   Section 11.   Treasurer to Give Notice Taxes Due: The City Treasurer shall
give six days notice to the taxpayers of the City that such roll has been
delivered to him, by publication of such notice in a newspaper published in
said City at least six days before July 1, which notice shall be sufficient
demand for the payment of all taxes on said roll; and that payment therein
specified may be made to him at any time up to and including August 31 with one
percent therefor. Provided, that the failure to give the notice specified in
this section for the payment of such tax shall not invalidate the said tax nor
release the persons assessed from the penalty herein specified.
   Section 12.    The taxes thus assessed shall, on July 1, and on such other
date as provided under Section 8, Chapter 21, become at once a debt to the City
from the person to whom they are assessed, and the amounts assessed on any
interest in real estate shall on the said day become a lien upon such real
property, and the lien for such amount, and for all interest and charges
thereon, shall continue until payment thereof; and all personal taxes shall
also be a lien on all personal property of such person so assessed from and
after the said day in each year and shall take precedence of any sale,
assessment, chattel mortgage, levy or other lien on such personal property
executed or made after said day, except where such property is actually sold in
the regular course of trade.
   Section 13.   General Tax Law Adopted: All such taxes shall be collected on
or before October 31 in each year, and all provisions of the general tax law in
relation to the making of the assessment roll and the levying, collection and
payment of such taxes, are hereby adopted so far as the same are applicable.
   Section 14.   Treasurer to Certify Delinquents: If the City Treasurer shall
be unable to collect any of the taxes upon such roll assessed on real property
before October 31 in each year, he shall make a statement of the same, with a
full and perfect description of such property with the taxes upon each parcel
thereof, which statement shall be verified by his affidavit that such taxes
remain unpaid, and that he has not upon diligent inquiry been able to secure
any goods or chattels liable to pay such sum whereon he could levy the same;
and he shall also make a statement showing the taxes upon personal property
remaining unpaid, and the names of the persons against whom they are assessed,
and the amount against each, which statement he shall verify by his affidavit
that the amount so mentioned as uncollected remains unpaid and that he has not
been able after diligent inquiry, to discover any goods or chattels belonging
to the persons liable to pay such sum wherein he could levy the same. He shall
also make a statement showing the amount of all moneys collected by him on
account of taxes on said roll, which statement shall be filed with the City
Clerk. The Council shall direct the City Clerk to assess the annual roll for
the State, County and school taxes with all such delinquent taxes so returned,
with a penalty of six cents of each dollar of the sum total of taxes assessed
and returned delinquent on each particular description of land or other
property, and which penalty shall be carried out opposite to each particular
description of land or other property in a column provided for that purpose,
placing the aggregate sum of general taxes in the column headed “Delinquent
City Taxes” and all unpaid special district assessments shall be placed in a
column headed “Delinquent Special Assessment,” and the aggregate sum thereof,
including the six percent penalty tax, shall be placed in the column headed
“Total Delinquent City Taxes.”
   Section 15.   Roll to Board of Supervisors: The City Clerk shall keep the
original assessment roll in his office until the annual meeting of the Board of
Supervisors of Genesee County and he shall then present such rolls to said
Board, which roll shall be the assessment roll of the City for all taxation
purposes whatever, except the levying of taxes to be collected in the months of
July, August, September and October, as herein provided.
   Section 16.    School, State and County Tax Spread: On November 1, the City
Assessor shall apportion and spread upon the tax roll all school, State and
County Taxes, certified to him by the Board of Supervisors, delinquent City
taxes, and such other taxes as are legally required to be spread upon the roll.
   Section 17.   Fall Tax Roll Certified to Treasurer: Within thirty days after
November 1, the City Assessor shall deliver a certified copy of the above
mentioned assessment roll to the City Treasurer to be filed in his office to
which roll shall be annexed a warrant signed by the City Clerk and directed to
the Treasurer, in all respects as near as may be as warrants to township
treasurers for the collection of State, County and township taxes.
   Section 18.   Notice of Fall Tax: Upon receiving said tax roll as herein
provided, the City Treasurer shall give notice to the tax payers of the City
that such roll has been delivered to him, and that the taxes therein levied may
be paid to him at his office at any time after December 1, up to and including
January 9 next ensuing with a charge for collection of one percent, but that
four percent collection fee will be charged and collected upon all taxes
remaining unpaid on January 10. Said notice shall be given by publishing the
same in a newspaper published in said City ten days before December 1. But any
defect in said notice, or omission to comply with the provisions of this
section, shall not invalidate said tax roll, or any measure thereafter to be
taken to enforce collection of the taxes thereon.
   Section 19.   City Treasurer has Authority of Township Treasurer: For
collection of all taxes remaining unpaid on the general tax roll on January 10,
the City Treasurer shall proceed in the same manner as township treasurers are
required by law to do for the collection of taxes in townships, and shall for
that purpose have all the power and authority conferred by law upon township
treasurers for such purposes. And it is hereby made mandatory upon the City
Treasurer to exhaust all legal remedies for the collection of unpaid personal
taxes before the return thereon.
   Section 20.   Pay County Funds to County Treasurer-General Authority: The
said City Treasurer shall pay to the County Treasurer all moneys payable to him
at the same time and in the same manner as is required of township treasurers
by the general tax law, and he shall make return of delinquent taxes to the
County Treasurer according to the general law of the State relating to township
treasurers, and said general law shall govern all things relating to the levy
and collection of taxes not herein otherwise provided for.
   Section 21.   Delinquents Returned to County Treasurer. If the City
Treasurer shall be unable to collect any taxes on his roll as assessed on real
property, he shall make return thereof to the County Treasurer, and shall also
make statements showing the taxes upon personal property remaining unpaid in
the same manner as is required of township treasurers by the general tax law.
CHAPTER 21
Special Assessment
   Section 1.   When, by the provisions of this Charter, the cost and expense
of any local or public improvement may be defrayed in whole or in part by
special assessment upon the lands abutting upon or adjacent thereto, or
otherwise benefited by the improvements, such assessment may be made as in this
Charter provided.
   Section 2.   Right to Petition For: The residents and the property owners
upon any street or district desiring to have any public improvement made
therein, whether the same is to be paid by special assessment or not, may
petition therefor, and file such petition with the City Clerk. Upon filing of
such petition the City Clerk shall number it in its order for that year, make a
record thereof, and then turn the same over to the Mayor. The Mayor shall
thereupon investigate the subject and if, in his opinion, the improvement is
desirable, he shall include the same in the next appropriate annual budget for
improvements.
   Section 3.   Budget for Special Improvements: On or before May 1 in each
year the Mayor shall prepare and present to the Council a budget of all
improvements proposed to be made during the ensuing fiscal year to be paid for
in whole or in part by special assessment. This budget shall contain the
following information:
      A.   Location and general description of each improvement.
      B.   Estimated cost of the same.
      C.   Method of financing.
      D.   Method of assessment, mode of payment, number of annual payments and
such other information as the Council may require.
      E.   A schedule showing which of these improvements, in his opinion, is
most necessary to make and the order in which they should be taken up.
   Section 4.   Hearing on Special Improvement Budget: The Council shall,
immediately upon receipt of such budget, make the same provision for a public
hearing as is prescribed in Section 6, 19th Chapter for “annual City budget,”
which hearing may be held at the same time, or at a separate time, whichever
shall be decided upon by the Council; and like notice shall be given to the
public of the time and place of such hearings as that prescribed in said
Section 6.
   Section 5.   Effect of Petition For or Against: If, at or previous to the
public hearing mentioned in the last section in relation to any special
assessment and previous to the passage of the resolution hereinafter mentioned
declaring the same as a necessary public improvement, a majority of the
property owners in and owning at least fifty percent of the assessed value,
according to the preceding annual assessment roll, of the property to be taxed
for such public improvement shall file with the City Clerk a remonstrance
against the making of such improvement the Council shall drop said improvement
from such special improvement budget for that year; and if, at or previous to
the public hearing mentioned in the last section and previous to the passage of
the resolution hereinafter mentioned declaring the necessary public
improvements for that year, but not afterwards, one half of the property owners
in and owning fifty percent of the assessed value of the property to be taxed
for any public improvement, shall file with the City Clerk a petition
requesting that such improvement be made during the current year, then and in
such case such improvement petitioned for shall be considered as part of the
budget presented by the Mayor and be dealt with accordingly.
   Signatures may be withdrawn from or added to such petitions up to but not
after the Council shall have determined the sufficiency of such petition.
   Section 6.   Necessity to be Declared: Immediately after such public hearing
shall have been held, the Council, subject to petitions as above, shall approve
by resolution the whole of such budget or such portion thereof as to them shall
seem best, and shall enter such resolution at large upon their minutes, such
resolution shall contain a statement that the Council declares such
improvement, in each case, a necessary public improvement and shall therein
state what portion of the expense thereof shall be paid by special assessment
and what part, if any, shall be appropriated from the general funds of the
City, and shall in the same resolution designate the district of land and the
premises upon which each special assessment shall be levied.
   Section 7.   Special Assessment. Limitation: The cost and expenses of any
improvement which may be made by special assessment shall include the cost of
surveys, plans, assessments and cost of construction. In no case shall the
whole amount to be levied by special assessment upon any lot or premises for
any one improvement, exceed the amount of benefits resulting from such
improvement to such lot or land.
   Section 8.   Emergency Special Assessment: If, after preparation of and
hearing on the special assessment budget as in Sections 3 and 4 hereof
provided, the Council by a three fourths vote of all members elect shall
declare some additional proposed special improvement an immediate necessity, to
be borne by special assessment, such special improvement and special assessment
may be authorized and directed, subject to like notice, hearing, action and
confirmation as in case of ordinary special assessments, and said Council may
declare the sum due at such time as they deem necessary and issue their warrant
to the City Treasurer directing such collection; provided, not to exceed one
tenth part of the cost of such emergency improvement shall be spread over the
City at large unless provision shall have been anticipated and made in the last
annual appropriation bill for such greater part.
   Section 9.   Special Assessment. How Levied: In addition to the amount
hereinbefore authorized, the Council may raise, by special assessment upon a
special assessment district, the whole or such portion of the cost of such
improvement as they may determine, except as provided in Section 12 hereof, for
the purpose of grading, paving, curbing and otherwise improving streets as
herein provided, or for the constructing of sewers or drains, or for building
retaining walls upon or along any stream or water front, or for making other
local improvements especially beneficial to the lands and property in the
district.
   The amount to be so raised by special assessment for any form of street
improvement may be levied according to benefit, as the Council may determine.
   Section 10.   Special Assessment Funds: Revenues and moneys raised for
taxation in any special assessment district in the City shall be divided into
special assessment funds. The money raised by special assessment in any special
district for sewers, paving, repairs, or improvements of any kind, shall
constitute a special fund for the purpose for which it was raised, and such
fund shall be used for no other purpose whatever; provided, if there be a
surplus after paying for such special improvement, it may be credited to some
other fund when it does not exceed ten percent of the amount collected, as the
Council may determine, but if it exceeds such percent it shall be returned to
those form whom collected.
   Section 11.   Assessment Precedes Contract: Special assessments, to defray
the estimated cost of any improvement, shall be levied and the special
assessment roll confirmed before the making of the improvement or signing
contract.
   Section 12.   Part of Cost Paid from General Fund: Whenever any special
assessment is to be made according to a resolution of the Council made in the
manner prescribed in this chapter, the Council shall direct the assessment to
be made by the City Assessor against the premises or locality constituting the
district to be assessed therefor. If there shall be included in any special
assessment district lots belonging to the City, or public buildings or public
grounds belonging to the City, not taxable, such part of the expense of such
improvement as in the opinion of the Council making the special assessment
would be justly apportionable to such public grounds, buildings and City
property, and to any interior square or places formed by the intersection of
streets, were they taxable, shall be paid from the general fund, or from the
proper street district fund or partly from each, as the Council shall determine
to be just.
   Section 13.   Special Assessment Roll To Be Prepared: Upon receiving such
order the City Clerk shall at once make a transcript of that portion of the
last annual assessment roll covering the property to be assessed, so far as the
description of each parcel of land, the name of the owner, if known, and the
valuation thereof is concerned, which transcript, when completed, shall
constitute the special assessment roll for that district. The City Assessor
shall thereupon levy as a special assessment roll and against the person
chargeable therewith, if known, the amount which such Assessor shall fix as the
just proportion of benefit derived by him, such person, or shall spread and
levy the same according to the frontage touching and abutting on said street or
improvement, as the Council may direct, and in case of any irregularly shaped
premises, reasonable allowance may be made therefor. In all cases where the
ownership of any description is unknown to the Clerk he shall in lieu of the
name of the owner insert the word “unknown” and if by mistake or otherwise any
person shall be improperly designated as the owner of any lot, parcel of land,
or premises, or if the same shall be assessed without the name of the owner,
such assessment shall not for any cause be vitiated but shall, in all respects,
be as valid a claim upon and against such lot, parcel of land or premises, as
though assessed in the name of the proper owner, and when the assessment roll
shall have been confirmed, be a lien upon such lot, parcel of land or premises,
as though assessed in the name of the proper owner, and when the assessment
roll shall have been confirmed, be a lien upon such lot, parcel of land or
premises, and be collected as in other cases.
   Section 14.   Special Charges: When any expense shall be incurred by the
City or in respect to any separate or single lot, parcel of land or premises
which, by the provisions of this act, the Council is authorized to charge and
collect as a special assessment against the same, and not being of that class
of special assessment required to be made pro rata upon several lots or parcels
of land in an assessment district, the Mayor or Clerk shall make an account of
the labor or services for which such expense was incurred, verified by the
officer or person performing the labor or services, with a description of the
lot or premises upon in respect to which the expense was incurred, and the name
of the owner or person chargeable therewith shall be report to the Council in
such manner as they shall prescribe. The Council shall thereupon determine what
amount or part of every expense shall be charged and the person, if known,
against whom, and the premises upon which the same shall be levied as a special
assessment, and report the same to the City Clerk.
   Section 15.   Charges. How Collected: The City Clerk shall thereupon file
such report, together with the determination of the Council, in his office, and
at once present a bill therefore to the party charged therewith for payment. If
such payment shall not be made before the time of making out the next annual
City tax roll, then the City Clerk shall report that fact to the assessing
officer, and he shall thereupon place such sum, with interest at the rate of
seven percent per annum from the date of rendering such bill, upon the next
annual tax roll, in a column specially marked for that purpose, as a charge
against the premises designated by the Council in its original order; and the
assessment and all taxes levied thereon shall thereafter be in all things
governed by the general tax laws of the State and the provisions of this
Charter in relation to special assessment.
   Section 16.   Assessment a Lien: All special assessments shall, from the
date of confirmation thereof, constitute a lien upon the respective lots or
parcels of land assessed, and shall be charged against the person to whom
assessed until paid.
   Section 17.   Ten Installments Permitted: Upon the confirmation of any
special assessment, the amount thereof may be divided into not more than ten
installments, one of which shall be collected each year at such times as the
City Council shall determine, with annual interest at a rate not exceeding six
percent per annum, but the whole assessment, after confirmation, may be paid to
the City Treasurer any time in full, with appropriate interest thereon.
   Section 18.   When Due. All special assessments, except such installments
thereof as the City Council shall make payable at a future time, as provided in
the preceding section, shall be due and payable on confirmation.
   Section 19.   One Roll for all Installments: If any special assessment be
divided into installments, it shall not be necessary to make a special
assessment roll for each installment, nor to reconfirm or recertify the same to
successive Treasurers, but the assessment on the original assessment roll shall
be divided into installments and each installment, as the same becomes due,
with accrued interest upon all unpaid installments, shall be collected from
said original assessment roll.
   Section 20.   Additional Assessment if Necessary. Should any special
assessment prove insufficient to pay for the improvement or work for which it
was levied, and the expenses incident thereto, the City Council may, within the
limitations prescribed for such assessments, make an additional pro rata
assessment to supply the deficiency; and in case a larger amount shall be
collected than was necessary, the excess may be refunded ratable to those by
whom it was paid, in accordance with Section 10 of this chapter.
   Section 21.   Reassessment, When: Whenever any special assessment shall in
the opinion of the City Council, be invalid by reason of irregularity or
informality in the proceedings or in any court of competent jurisdiction shall
adjudge such assessment to be illegal, the City Council shall, whether the
improvement has been made or not, have power to cause a new assessment to be
made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was made. All
proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof, shall be
conducted in the same manner as provided for in the original assessment and
whenever any sum or part thereof levied upon any premises in the assessment so
set aside has been paid and not refunded, the payment so made shall be applied
upon the reassessment on said premises and the reassessment to that extent
shall be deemed satisfied.
   Section 22.   Lien Remains. When any special assessment shall be confirmed,
and be payable as hereinbefore provided, the City Clerk shall, within ten days
thereafter, attach his warrant for the collection of said special assessment
roll, therein commanding the City Treasurer to collect from each person the
amount assessed to and set opposite his name therein, and in case any person
named in said roll shall neglect or refuse to pay his assessment on demand,
then to levy and collect the same by distress and sale of goods and chattels of
such persons; and return said roll and warrant together with his doings
thereon, within sixty days from the date of the warrant.
   Section 23.   Treasurer to Collect. Upon receiving said special assessment
roll and warrant, the City Treasurer shall proceed to collect the amount
assessed thereon. If any person shall neglect or refuse to pay his assessment
on demand, the Treasurer shall seize and levy upon any personal property found
within the City or elsewhere, within the County, belonging to said person, and
sell the same at public auction, first giving six days notice of the time and
place of such sale by posting such notice in three of the most public places in
the City or township where such property may be found. The proceeds of such
sale, or so much thereof as may be necessary for that purpose, shall be applied
to the payment of the assessment, and a percentage of five percent upon the
amount of the assessment for the costs and expenses of said seizure and sale,
and the surplus, if any, shall be paid to the person entitled thereto.
   Section 24.   Return by Treasurer: The Treasurer shall make return of said
special assessment roll and warrant to the City Clerk, according to the
requirements of the warrant and if any of the assessments in said roll shall be
returned unpaid the Treasurer shall attach to his return a statement, verified

the lots and premises upon which the assessment remains unpaid, and the amount
unpaid on each.
   Section 25.   Renewal of Warrant. Said warrant may be renewed from time to
time by the City Clerk if the Council shall so direct, and for such time as
they shall determine, and during the time of such renewal, the warrant shall
have the same force and the City Treasurer shall perform the said duties and
make like returns, as above provided. In case of any special assessment being
finally returned by the City Treasurer unpaid, as aforesaid, the same may be
certified by the City Clerk in the manner provided in Sections 8, 14 and 21 of
Chapter 20, of this Charter, and shall then be reassessed with interest
included at the rate of six percent per annum from date of the confirmation of
the assessment until July 1 next, or until December 1 if the next City tax roll
be for general taxes payable on December 1, and then be collected in all
respects as other taxes are collected.
   Section 26.   May Sue. At any time after a special assessment has become
payable, the same may be collected by suit, in the name of the City against the
persons assessed, in any action of assumpsit in any court having jurisdiction
of the amount. In every action a declaration upon the common counts for money
paid shall be sufficient. The special assessment roll and certified order of
resolution confirming the same shall be prima facie evidence of the regularity
of the proceedings in making the assessment and right of the City to recover
judgment therefore.
   Section 27.   Suit, Further. If in any such action it shall appear that by
reason or any irregularities or informalities the assessment has not been
properly made against the defendant or upon the lot or premises sought to be
charged, the court may, nevertheless, on satisfactory proof that expense has
been incurred by the City, and that same is fair, reasonable charge against the
defendant or the lot or premises in question, render judgment for the amount
properly chargeable against such defendant, or upon such lot or premises.
   Section 28.   May Borrow for Deferred Installments. It shall be within the
power of the Council to direct and empower the Mayor and Clerk to issue and
negotiate, for and on behalf of the City, not exceeding six percent annual
interest notes, free of taxation for the aggregate amount of any special
assessment tax, the time for payment of which has been extended beyond the year
of the original warrant for their collection.
   Such notes shall be made payable at the office of the City Treasurer and
shall fall due at such time as the Council shall determine and such tax can be
collected; and the proceeds of such notes shall be deposited with the City
Treasurer and by him disbursed on the order of the Council in payment of the
cost and expense of the public improvement on account of which they have been
issued, and for no other purpose whatever, and the proceeds of such extended
tax, when collected, shall be used for the payment of said notes and for no
other purpose.
   Section 29.   Notice of Hearing. Whenever any special assessment roll as in
this chapter provided, shall have been completed by the City Assessor, he shall
report the same back to the Council. Before adopting the assessment, the
Council shall cause to be published for one week at least in some newspaper in
said City, if any be published therein, or if not, to be posted in three public
places in said City for the same length of time a notice of the filing of said
assessment roll with the Clerk and designating a time and place when and where
the Council and Board of Assessors will meet to review the assessment and hear
any objection thereto.
   Section 30.   Special Assessment Confirmed. At the time appointed for such
purpose, the Council and Assessor shall meet and there, or at some adjourned
meeting, review the assessment and hear any objections thereto, and the Council
shall correct the same, if necessary, and confirm it as reported or as
corrected, or they may refer the assessment back to the Assessor for revision,
or annul it and direct a new assessment, in which case the same proceedings
shall be had as in respect to the previous assessments. When a special
assessment shall be confirmed, the Clerk shall endorse a certificate thereof
upon the roll showing the date of confirmation.
   Section 31.   Village Act on Special Assessment Adopted in Part. Excepting
as herein otherwise specifically provided, the several provisions of Chapter 8

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT
§ 208.01 STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES.
   (a)   It is the policy of the city that all persons, except those
incarcerated, consistent with the Michigan Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”),
are entitled to full and complete information regarding the affairs of
government and the official acts of those who represent them as public
officials and employees. The people shall be informed so that they fully
participate in the democratic process.
   (b)   The city’s policy with respect to FOIA requests is to comply with
state  law in all respects and to respond to FOIA requests in a consistent,
fair and even-handed manner regardless of who makes such a request.
   (c)   The city acknowledges that it has a legal obligation to disclose all
non-exempt public records in its possession pursuant to a FOIA request. The
city acknowledges that sometimes it is necessary to invoke the exemptions
identified under FOIA in order to ensure the effective operation of government
and to protect the privacy of individuals.
   (d)   The city will protect the public’s interest in disclosure, while
balancing the requirement to withhold or redact portions of certain records.
The city’s policy is to disclose public records consistent with and in
compliance with state  law .
   (e)   The City Council has established the following written procedures and
guidelines to implement the FOIA and will create a written public summary of
the specific procedures and guidelines relevant to the general public regarding
how to submit written requests to the public body and explaining how to
understand a public body’s written responses, deposit requirements, fee
calculations and avenues for challenge and appeal. The written public summary
will be written in a manner so as to be easily understood by the general
public.
§ 208.02 GENERAL POLICIES.
   (a)   The City Council, acting pursuant to the authority at M.C.L.A. §
15.236, designates the City Clerk/Treasurer as the FOIA Coordinator. He or she
is authorized to designate other city staff to act on his or her behalf to
accept and process written requests for the city’s public records and approve
denials.
   (b)   If a request for a public record is received by fax or email, the
request is deemed to have been received on the following business day. If a
request is sent by email and delivered to a city spam or junk-mail folder, the
request is not deemed received until one day after the FOIA Coordinator first
becomes aware of the request. The FOIA Coordinator shall note in the FOIA log
both the date the request was delivered to the spam or junk-mail folder and the
date the FOIA Coordinator became aware of the request.
   (c)   The FOIA Coordinator shall review city spam and junk mail folders on a
regular basis, which shall be no less than once a month. The FOIA Coordinator
shall work with City Information Technology staff to develop administrative
rules for handling spam and junk mail so as to protect city systems from
computer attacks which may be imbedded in an electronic FOIA request.
   (d)   The FOIA Coordinator may , in his or her discretion, implement
administrative rules, consistent with state  law and this “Procedures and
Guidelines” document to administer the acceptance and processing of FOIA
requests.
   (e)   The city is not obligated to create a new public record or make a
compilation or summary of information which does not already exist. Neither the
FOIA Coordinator nor other city staff are obligated to provide answers to
questions contained in requests for public records or regarding the content of
the records themselves.
   (f)   The FOIA Coordinator shall keep a copy of all written requests for
public records received by the city on file for a period of at least one year.
   (g)   The city will make this “Procedures and Guidelines” document and the
“Written Public Summary” publicly available without charge. If it does not, the
city cannot require deposits or charge fees otherwise permitted under the FOIA
until it is in compliance.
   (h)   A copy of this “Procedures and Guidelines” document and the city’s
“Written Public Summary” must be publicly available by providing free copies
both in the city’s response to a written request and upon request by visitors
at the city’s office.
   (i)   This “Procedures and Guidelines” document and the city’s “Written
Public Summary” will be maintained on the city’s website at:
www.cityofgrandblanc.com, so a link to those documents will be provided in lieu
of providing paper copies of those documents.
§ 208.03 REQUESTING A PUBLIC RECORD.
   (a)   No specific form to submit a request for a public record is required.
However, the FOIA Coordinator may make available a FOIA request form for use by
the public.
   (b)   Requests to inspect or obtain copies of public records prepared,
owned, used, possessed or retained by the city may be submitted on the city’s
FOIA request form, in any other form of writing (letter, fax, email and the
like) or by verbal request.
   (c)   Verbal requests for records may be documented by the city on the
city’s FOIA request form.
   (d)   If a person makes a verbal, non-written request for information
believed to be available on the city’s website, where practicable and to the
best ability of the employee receiving the request, he or she shall be informed
of the pertinent website address.
   (e)   A request must sufficiently describe a public record so as to enable
city personnel to identify and find the requested public record.
   (f)   Written requests for public records may be submitted in person or by
mail to any city office. Requests may also be submitted electronically by fax
and email. Upon their receipt, requests for public records shall be promptly
forwarded to the FOIA Coordinator for processing.
   (g)   A person may request that public records be provided on non-paper
physical media, emailed or otherwise provided to him or her in digital form in
lieu of paper copies. The city will comply with the request only if it
possesses the necessary technological capability to provide records in the
requested non-paper physical media format.
   (h)   A person may subscribe to future issues of public records that are
created, issued or disseminated by the city on a regular basis. A subscription
is valid for up to six months and may be renewed by the subscriber.
   (i)   A person serving a sentence of imprisonment in a local, state or
federal correctional facility is not entitled to submit a request for a public
record. The FOIA Coordinator will deny all such requests.
§ 208.04 PROCESSING A REQUEST.

      (1)   Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the person making the

requested is available at no charge on the city’s website.
   (b)   When a request is granted.

will require that payment be made in full for the allowable fees associated
with responding to the request before the public record is made available.
      (2)   The FOIA Coordinator shall provide a detailed itemization of the
allowable costs incurred to process the request to the person making the
request.
      (3)   A copy of these “Procedures and Guidelines” and the “Written Public
Summary” will be provided to the requestor free of charge with the response to
a written request for public records, provided, however, that because these
“Procedures and Guidelines” and the “Written Public Summary” are maintained on
the city’s website at: www.cityofgrandblanc.com, a link to the “Procedures and
Guidelines” and the “Written Public Summary” will be provided in lieu of
providing paper copies of those documents.
      (4)   If the cost of processing a FOIA request is $50 or less, the
requester will be notified of the amount due and where the documents can be
obtained.
      (5)   If the cost of processing a FOIA request is expected to exceed $50
based on a good-faith calculation, or if the requestor has not paid in full for
a previously granted request, the city will require a good-faith deposit
pursuant to §
208.05 before processing the request.
      (6)   In making the request for a good-faith deposit, the FOIA
Coordinator shall provide the requestor with a detailed itemization of the
allowable costs estimated to be incurred by the city to process the request and
also provide a best efforts estimate of a time frame it will take the city to
provide the records to the requestor. The best efforts estimate shall be non-
binding on the city, but will be made in good faith and will strive to be
reasonably accurate, given the nature of the request in the particular
instance, so as to provide the requested records in a manner based on the
public policy expressed by §
208.02.
   (c)   When a request is denied or denied in part.
      (1)   If the request is denied or denied in part, the FOIA Coordinator
will issue a notice of denial which shall provide in the applicable
circumstance:
         A.   An explanation as to why a requested public record is exempt from
disclosure;
         B.   A certificate that the requested record does not exist under the
name or description provided by the requestor, or another name reasonably known
by the city;
         C.   An explanation or description of the public record or information
within a public record that is separated or deleted from the public record;
         D.   An explanation of the person’s right to submit an appeal of the
denial to either the office of the Mayor or seek judicial review in the County
Circuit Court;
         E.   An explanation of the right to receive attorneys’ fees, costs and

$1,000, should they prevail in Circuit Court; and
         F.   The notice of denial shall be signed by the FOIA Coordinator.
      (2)   If a request does not sufficiently describe a public record, the
FOIA Coordinator may , in lieu of issuing a notice of denial indicating that
the request is deficient, seek clarification or amendment of the request by the
person making the request. Any clarification or amendment will be considered a
new request subject to the timelines described in this section.
   (d)   Requests to inspect public records. The city shall  provide reasonable
facilities and opportunities for persons to examine and inspect public records
during normal business hours. The FOIA Coordinator is authorized to promulgate
rules regulating the manner in which records may  be viewed so as to protect
city records from loss, alteration, mutilation or destruction and to prevent
excessive interference with normal city operations.
   (e)   Requests for certified copies. The FOIA Coordinator shall, upon
written request, furnish a certified copy of a public record at no additional
cost to the person requesting the public record.
§ 208.05 FEE DEPOSITS.
   (a)   If the fee estimate is expected to exceed $50 based on a good-faith
calculation, the requestor will be asked to provide a deposit not exceeding
one-half of the total estimated fee.
   (b)   If a request for public records is from a person who has not paid the
city in full for copies of public records made in fulfillment of a previously
granted written request, the FOIA Coordinator will require a deposit of 100% of
the estimated processing fee before beginning to search for a public record for
any subsequent written request by that person when all of the following
conditions exist:
      (1)   The final fee for the prior written request is not more than 105%
of the estimated fee;
      (2)   The public records made available contained the information sought
in the prior written request and remain in the city’s possession;
      (3)   The public records were made available to the individual, subject
to payment, within the time frame estimated by the city to provide the records;
      (4)   Ninety days have passed since the FOIA Coordinator notified the
individual in writing that the public records were available for pickup or
mailing;
      (5)   The individual is unable to show proof of prior payment to the
city; and
      (6)   The FOIA Coordinator has calculated a detailed itemization that is
the basis for the current written request’s increased estimated fee deposit.
   (c)   The FOIA Coordinator will not require an increased estimated fee
deposit if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The person making the request is able to show proof of prior
payment in full to the city;
      (2)   The city is subsequently paid in full for the applicable prior
written request; or
      (3)   Three hundred sixty five days have passed since the person made the

§ 208.06 CALCULATION OF FEES.
   (a)   A fee may be charged for the labor cost of copying/duplication.
   (b)   A fee will not be charged for the labor cost of search, examination,
review and the deletion and separation of exempt from non-exempt information
unless failure to charge a fee would result in unreasonably high costs to the
city because of the nature of the request in the particular instance, and the
city specifically identifies the nature of the unreasonably high costs.
   (c)   Costs for the search, examination review and deletion and separation
of exempt from non-exempt information are “unreasonably high” when they are
excessive and beyond the normal or usual amount for those services (Attorney
General Opinion 7083 of 2001) compared to the costs of the city’s usual FOIA
requests, not compared to the city’s operating budget (Bloch v. Davison
Community Schools, Michigan Court of Appeals, Unpublished, April 26, 2011).
   (d)   The following factors shall be used to determine an unreasonably high
cost to the city:
      (1)   Volume of the public record requested;
      (2)   Amount of time spent to search for, examine, review and separate
exempt from non-exempt information in the record requested;
      (3)   Whether the public records are from more than one city department
or whether various city offices are necessary to respond to the request;
      (4)   The available staffing to respond to the request; and
      (5)   Any other similar factors identified by the FOIA Coordinator in
responding to the particular request.
   (e)   The state FOIA statute permits the city to charge for the following
costs associated with processing a request:
      (1)   Labor costs associated with copying or duplication, which includes
making paper copies, making digital copies or transferring digital public
records to non-paper physical media or through the internet;
      (2)   Labor costs associated with searching for, locating and examining a
requested public record, when failure to charge a fee will result in
unreasonably high costs to the city;
      (3)   Labor costs associated with a review of a record to separate and
delete information exempt from disclosure, when failure to charge a fee will
result in unreasonably high costs to the city;
      (4)   The cost of copying or duplication, not including labor, of paper
copies of public records. This may include the cost for copies of records
already on the city’s website if a person asks for the city to make copies;
      (5)   The cost of computer discs, computer tapes or other digital or
similar media when the requester asks for records in non-paper physical media.
This may include the cost for copies of records already on the city’s website
if a person asks for the city to make copies; and
      (6)   The cost to mail or send a public record to a requestor.
   (f)   Labor costs will be calculated based on the following requirements.
      (1)   All labor costs will be estimated and charged in 15-minute
increments, with all partial time increments rounded down. If the time involved
is less than 15 minutes, there will be no charge.
      (2)   Labor costs will be charged at the hourly wage of the lowest-paid
city employee capable of doing the work in the specific fee category,
regardless of who actually performs work.
      (3)   Labor costs will also include a charge to cover or partially cover
the cost of fringe benefits.
      (4)   The city may add up to 50% to the applicable labor charge amount to
cover or partially cover the cost of fringe benefits, but in no case may it
exceed the actual cost of fringe benefits.
      (5)   Overtime wages will not be included in labor costs unless agreed to
by the requestor; overtime costs will not be used to calculate the fringe
benefit cost.
      (6)   Contracted labor costs will be charged at the hourly rate of $48.90
(six times the state minimum hourly wage).
   (g)   The cost to provide records on non-paper physical media when so
requested will be based on the following requirements:
      (1)   Computer disks, computer tapes or other digital or similar media
will be at the actual and most reasonably economical cost for the non-paper
media;
      (2)   This cost will only be assessed if the city has the technological
capability necessary to provide the public record in the requested non-paper
physical media format; and
      (3)   The city will procure any non-paper media and will not accept media
from the requestor in order to ensure integrity of the city’s technology
infrastructure.
   (h)   The cost to provide paper copies of records will be based on the
following requirements.
      (1)   Paper copies of public records made on standard letter (eight and
one-half by 11) or legal (eight and one-half by 14) sized paper will not exceed
$0.10 per sheet of paper.
      (2)   Copies for non-standard sized sheets of paper will reflect the
actual cost of reproduction.
      (3)   The city will provide records using double-sided printing, if it is
cost-saving and available.
   (i)   The cost to mail records to a requestor will be based on the following
requirements:
      (1)   The actual cost to mail public records using a reasonably
economical and justified means;
      (2)   The city may charge for the least expensive form of postal delivery
confirmation; and
      (3)   No cost will be made for expedited shipping or insurance unless
specified by the requestor.
   (j)   If the FOIA Coordinator does not respond to a written request in a
timely manner, the city must:
      (1)   Reduce the labor costs by 5% for each day the city exceeds the time
permitted under FOIA up to a 50% maximum reduction, if any of the following
applies:
         A.   The city’s late response was willful and intentional;
         B.   The written request conveyed a request for information within the
first 250 words of the body of a letter facsimile, email or email attachment;
or
         C.   The written request included the words, characters or
abbreviations for “freedom of information”, “information”, “FOIA”, “copy” or a
recognizable misspelling of such or legal code reference to M.C.L.A. §§ 15.231
et seq. or Public Act 442 of 1976 on the front of an envelope or in the subject
line of an email, letter or facsimile cover page.
      (2)   Fully note the charge reduction in the detailed itemization of
costs form.
§ 208.07 WAIVER OF FEES.
   The cost of the search for and copying of a public record may be waived or
reduced if, in the sole judgment of the FOIA Coordinator, a waiver or reduced
fee is in the public interest because it can be considered as primarily
benefitting the general public. The City Council may identify specific records
or types of records it deems should be made available for no charge or at a
reduced cost.
§ 208.08 DISCOUNTED FEES.
   (a)   Indigence.
      (1)   The FOIA Coordinator will discount the first $20 of the processing
fee for a request if the person requesting a public record submits an affidavit
stating that they are:
         A.   Indigent and receiving specific public assistance; or
         B.   If not receiving public assistance, stating facts demonstrating
an inability to pay because of indigence.
      (2)   An individual is not eligible to receive the waiver if:
         A.   The requestor has previously received discounted copies of public
records from the city twice during the calendar year; or
         B.   The requestor requests information in connection with other
persons who are offering or providing payment to make the request.
      (3)   An affidavit is sworn statement. The FOIA Coordinator may make a
fee waiver affidavit form available for use by the public.
   (b)   Nonprofit organization advocating for developmentally disabled or
mentally ill individuals. The FOIA Coordinator will discount the first $20 of
the processing fee for a request from: a nonprofit organization formally
designated by the state  to carry out activities under subtitle C of the
Federal Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000,
Pub. Law No. 106-402, and the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with

      (3)   Is accompanied by documentation of its designation by the state ,
if requested by the public body.

office of the City Manager .
   (b)   The appeal must be in writing, specifically state the word “appeal”

subject of the written appeal, the requesting person may seek judicial review
of the nondisclosure by commencing a civil action in Circuit Court.
   (f)   Whether or not a requestor submitted an appeal of a denial to the City
Council, he or she may file a civil action in County Circuit Court within 180

as contempt of court.
   (h)   If a person asserting the right to inspect, copy or receive a copy of
all or a portion of a public record prevails in such an action, the court shall
award reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and disbursements. If the person or
city prevails in part, the court may , in its discretion, award all or an
appropriate portion of reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and disbursements.
   (i)   If the court determines that the city has arbitrarily and capriciously
violated this Act by refusal or delay in disclosing or providing copies of a
public record, the court shall order the city to pay a civil fine of $1,000,
which shall be deposited into the General Fund of the State Treasury. The court
shall award, in addition to any actual or compensatory damages, punitive
damages in the amount of $1,000 to the person seeking the right to inspect or
receive a copy of a public record. The damages shall not be assessed against an
individual, but shall be assessed against the next succeeding public body that
is not an individual and that kept or maintained the public record as part of
its public function.
§ 208.10 APPEAL OF AN EXCESSIVE FOIA PROCESSING FEE.
   (a)   FEE means the total fee or any component of the total fee calculated
under §
208.05, including any deposit.
   (b)   If a requestor believes that the fee charged by the city to process a

for a fee reduction to the office of the City Manager .
   (c)   The appeal must be in writing, specifically state the word “appeal”

§ 662.10 LOITERING PROHIBITED.
   (a)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law -abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall , prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the
person an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted,
by requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or
her presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and if it
had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled the
alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a loiterer
or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears the delay in arresting
the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the suspect's escape.
   (b)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, to loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi-
public sidewalk , street , curb, crosswalk, walkway area, park, mall or that
portion of private property utilized for public use, so as to hinder or
obstruct unreasonably the free passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It
shall be unlawful for any person to block, obstruct, or prevent free access to
the entrance to any building open to the public.
   (c)   It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter in or near any
thoroughfare or place open to the public for the purpose of inducing, enticing,
soliciting, or procuring another to commit an act of prostitution. The
circumstances considered in determining whether such action is consistent with
the intent to induce, entice, solicit, or procure another to commit an act of
prostitution include but are not limited to, the person is a known prostitute
or panderer and repeatedly beckons in the attempt to stop or engage male or
female passersby in conversation or repeatedly stops or attempts to stop motor
vehicles by engaging their operators by hailing, waving of arms, or other
bodily gestures. The violator's conduct must be such as to demonstrate a
specific intent to induce, entice, solicit, or procure another to commit an act
of prostitution. No arrest shall be made for a violation of this division
unless the arresting officer first affords the person an opportunity to explain
his or her conduct, and no one shall be convicted of violating this division if
it appears at trial that the explanation given was true and consists of a
lawful purpose.
   (d)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACE has the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including
those which serve food or drink or provide entertainment, and the doorways and
entrances to buildings or dwellings and the grounds enclosing them.

equipment at least two feet underground, then company  also shall place its
existing and its future cables, wires or other equipment underground within a
reasonable period of time, not to exceed six months, of notification by
municipality and without expense or liability therefor to municipality. In
those developing areas where underground facilities are required and meet the

at least a six-foot separation from water mains or sewer mains unless a lesser
separation is approved by municipality.
   (h)   New developments. Company  shall  install its cable system  (excluding

development unless company is not notified of the subdivision or development.
After cable system installation, company shall be capable of providing cable
service to any dwelling unit in such subdivision or development solely by the
construction of a drop  to the subscriber premises  when such dwelling unit is
constructed. Company shall  be required to comply with the preceding provisions

common trench or had an opportunity to attend the preconstruction meeting for
the subdivision or development in question.

vacated, eliminated, discontinued or closed, company shall  be notified of same
and all rights of company under this franchise agreement  to use same shall
terminate and company shall immediately remove the cable system  from such
street  or public way unless company obtains all necessary easements from the

extent consistent with the treatment of other utility facilities in the former
street  or public way, municipality  shall reserve easements for company to
continue to use the former street  or public way. Company shall bear the cost

accordance with the directions and specifications of municipality, and all
applicable laws, ordinances and regulations, at company’s sole expense. If such
removal and restoration is not completed within six months after the
revocation, termination or expiration of this franchise, all of company’s
property  remaining in the affected public ways shall, at the option of
municipality, be deemed abandoned and shall, at the option of municipality,
become its property  or municipality may  obtain a court order compelling
company to remove same. In the event company fails or refuses to remove its
cable system or to satisfactorily restore all areas to the condition in which
they existed prior to the original construction of the cable system,
municipality, at its option, may perform such work and collect the costs
thereof from company. No surety on any performance bond nor any letter of

street or public way, then company will notify municipality at least two weeks
in advance of same. If municipality so desires, company will then increase the
size of the bore (directional or otherwise) with municipality to pay only the
incremental cost of making the bore (directional or otherwise) larger.

any additional space or capacity created by increasing the size of the bore
(directional or otherwise) without additional charge or expense.
   (m)   Tree trimming. Company  may  trim trees upon and overhanging the
public ways  so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming into
contact with the cable system . Company shall  minimize the trimming of trees
to trimming only those trees which are essential to maintain the integrity of
the system. No trimming shall be performed in the public ways without
previously informing municipality  at least two weeks in advance. All trimming
of trees, except in an emergency, on public property  shall have the prior
approval of municipality and except in an emergency all trimming of trees on
private property  shall require the consent of the property  owner .

provided to municipality , upon request, in a standardized, non-proprietary
format at no cost to municipality. In addition, company shall provide
information and assistance on the GIS program it is using and its
implementation so as to aid municipality in converting the layer into a form
easily used by municipality and in using the layer.

agreement, and compliance with all orders, permits and directions of any agency
of municipality having jurisdiction over its acts or defaults under this
franchise, and the payment of company of any claims, liquidated damages, liens
or taxes due municipality which arise by reason of the construction, operation,
maintenance or repair of the cable system or provision of cable services .
      (2)   The condition of such bond should be that if company fails to make
timely payment to municipality or its designee of any amount or sum due under
this franchise ; or fails to make timely payment to municipality of any taxes
due; or fails to repay to municipality within ten days of written notification
that such repayment is due, any damages, costs or expenses which municipality
shall be compelled to pay by reason of any act or default of company in
connection with this franchise; or fails, after 30 days notice of such failure
from municipality, to comply with any provisions of this franchise which
municipality reasonably determines can be remedied by an expenditure of the
money (including, without limitation, the assessment of liquidated damages),
then municipality may demand and receive payment under such bond.
      (3)   In lieu of providing a bond, company  may provide a guarantee from
an entity acceptable to municipality substantially in the form set forth in
Appendix B.
      (4)   The rights reserved by municipality with respect to this section,
are in addition to all other rights of municipality whether reserved by this
franchise or authorized by law , and no action, proceeding or exercise of a
right with respect to such articles shall affect any other rights municipality
may have, except that municipality shall not be entitled to multiple remedies
for the same violation.
   (w)   Notice. If company  or its affiliates contend that company (or an
affiliate ) is permitted to provide any telecommunications service  or non-

or service which is not protected by the First Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution.
      (2)   Municipality and company have negotiated without reaching agreement
with respect to so-called “open access” for internet service providers and
certain related issues. The parties reserve their claims and contentions with
respect to these issues.
   (y)   Liquidated damages. Company  acknowledges that noncompliance with the
customer service rules of the FCC  (such rules as currently in effect set forth
in Appendix A) will harm subscribers and municipality  and the amounts of
actual damages will be difficult or impossible to ascertain. Municipality may
therefore assess the following liquidated damages against company for
noncompliance with such customer service rules. Each day on which a violation
of such FCC Rules occurs constitutes a separate offense, except that a
violation by company of a quarterly standard shall  constitute a single offense
for such quarter.
      (1)   First noncompliance with a given standard - $2,000;
      (2)   Second noncompliance with a given standard within four consecutive
calendar quarters - $4,000;

   (e)   Studio, van. Company  shall  continue to make available to
municipality  and the PEG channel operators  on a non-exclusive shared basis
the existing studio and existing mobile production van for the production and
presentation of programming on the PEG channels .
      (1)   The studio may be either:
         A.   Company’s current studio which is used both by company for its
local origination programming and by the PEG channels (or persons creating
programming for the PEG channels) throughout the Flint Metropolitan Area ; or
         B.   A separate, stand-alone studio administered by a non-profit
organization or local unit of government serving all or a portion of the Flint
Metropolitan Area (including such a studio which is combined or associated with
related non-profit or governmental activities and organizations, such as a
theater, radio station or computer/internet training/hosting/production site).
      (2)   The studio shall be the former of the two options until otherwise
elected by municipality and other municipalities in the Flint Metropolitan Area
served by company who collectively have at least 50% of the cable subscribers
in the Flint Metropolitan Area then being served by company.
   (f)   PEG access assistance. Company  shall  provide to municipality  grants
for capital facilities for the PEG channels  on the dates and in the amounts
set forth below where CAPITAL FACILITIES means those facilities that qualify as
same under Federal Cable Act § 622(g)(2)(c); 47 U.S.C. § 542(g)(2)(c). Company
will not directly or indirectly challenge any classification by municipality or
a PEG channel operator  of an item as a capital facility if such classification
is arguably correct. However, company reserves its rights regarding any third
party challenge to a “capital facilities” classification by municipality or a
PEG channel operator. Municipality shall  allocate such grants among the PEG
channel operators as it determines is in the public interest, may  place such
grants in an interest bearing account for such allocation in a subsequent year,
or may direct company to pay the grant directly to the PEG channel operators as
municipality determines is in the public interest. The grants and their timing
are as follows:
      (1)   Within 30 days of the effective, date , $22,500. This grant is for
a suitcase studio and related equipment.
      (2)   Annual grants on September 1, 2001, and on September 1 of each
successive year (until replaced by municipality’s electing grants pursuant to
division (f)(3) below). The amount of the annual grant shall be the number of
cable subscribers in municipality served by company on July 1 preceding the
September 1 in question times $1.75 with the $1.75 figure to be adjusted
annually starting with the September 1, 2002, grant for inflation computed
according to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Detroit
1982—1984 =100, with January, 2000, as the base point.
      (3)   If and when the separate stand alone studio described in division
(e)(2) above is elected by municipality pursuant to division (e)(1) above or if
municipality otherwise takes action with some or all municipalities in the
Flint Metropolitan Area such that company no longer has to maintain a studio,
van, personnel and their associated and related costs (for providing a public
access channel) as generally described in this section, then (instead of the
sums set forth in division (f)(2) above), company will pay municipality 0.5% of
company’s cable gross revenues computed and paid quarterly in the same manner
as which company pays franchise fees under §
806.08 of this chapter. Because such payment in parts offset operational costs
(salaries and the like) which company would otherwise incur, any payments under
this division (f)(3) may be used by municipality or PEG channel operators for
operational costs associated with PEG channels as well as for “capital
facilities”.
      (4)   For the purpose of computing the preceding grants, for multiple
dwelling units or bulk service, the number of cable subscribers shall be the
number of dwelling units (or other ultimate, individual customers) actually
served.
   (g)   Separate checks. To assist municipality  in separating checks for
capital facilities or PEG support from franchise fees  all payments to company
pursuant to division (f) above shall  be by separate checks and shall not be
combined with checks representing payments of franchise fees under §
806.08 of this chapter.

efforts to publicize and promote the public access channel and to encourage
members of the public to provide programming on the public access channel.

      (2)   Company  shall list all public, educational, and governmental
access channels on all print and cablecast electronic program guides, with
individual, unique descriptions on each channel, such as “municipal channel”,
“schools channel”, “schools/municipal channel”, “public access channel” and so
on.
      (3)   Company  shall include written information about public,
educational and governmental access programming and activities in its customer
handbook, and in materials given to new subscribers.
   (j)   Municipal publicity. Municipality  shall  undertake the following
publicity activities at its own expense:
      (1)   Describing the public access channel, shared schools/municipal
channel (and such other PEG channels as may from time to time exist) at least
yearly in any newsletter which municipality provides its residents;
      (2)   At least yearly similarly describing the contact person and
procedures for persons to put programming on the public access channel, and the

§ 806.08 FEES AND PAYMENTS.
   (a)   Franchise fee . Company  shall  pay municipality  throughout the term
of this franchise  an amount equal to 5% of company’s cable gross revenues .
Once per calendar  year municipality by resolution may  elect to reduce such
percentage to a smaller percentage, and by resolution in a subsequent calendar
year may change or revoke such election. Such payments shall be made quarterly,
and are due within 45 days after the end of each calendar  quarter.
      (1)   Each payment shall be accompanied by a written report to
municipality , verified by an appropriate representative of company containing
an accurate statement in summarized form of company’s cable gross revenues and
the computation of the payment amount.
      (2)   Municipality  may audit company to verify the accuracy of franchise
fees paid municipality. Any additional amount due municipality shall be paid
within 30 days of municipality’s submitting an invoice for such sum, and if

fee attributable to non-subscriber revenues (examples being revenues from tower

Company shall provide documentation of the preceding to municipality , upon

pay the franchise fee . Should company engage in a billing practice that, in
the determination of the municipality, does not fairly reflect an appropriate
split of revenue between cable service and telecommunications services,
municipality will notify grantee in writing of its determination. If the
parties do not resort to methods of dispute resolution, including litigation,
the parties will meet and discuss in good faith whether the billing practices
result in an unfair payment of fees to municipality. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if federal or state  law  establishes the method by which the
division of revenues should occur or that jurisdiction to establish such
guidelines appropriately rests with another body, such law  shall  supersede
the requirements of this division and be deemed by the parties to control.

following remedies:

may  be awarded municipality  (individually and on behalf of subscribers) from
company . Company acknowledges that the amounts of actual damages for the
violations and uncured events of default set forth below will be difficult or
impossible to ascertain; that the liquidated damages set forth below are a
reasonable approximation of actual damages; that the actual damages are often
incurred by municipality and subscribers and, while cumulatively large, are too
small to be worth while for individual subscribers to pursue; and that this
division (b) is intended to provide compensation to municipality and its
subscribers and is not a penalty. The amount of the liquidated damages are as
follows:
      (1)   For violations of §§
806.07 and
806.11 of this chapter, proven under division (c) below, liquidated damages not
to exceed $2,000 per day; and

for each day that the uncured event of default continues.
   (c)   Procedures. Liquidated damages may  be awarded (and this cable
franchise  forfeited or terminated) in accordance with the following procedure.
      (1)   Following notice from municipality , which notice, at
municipality’s election may be combined with the notice described in division
(c)(2) below, company  shall meet with municipality to attempt to resolve the
issue of what liquidated damages, if any, shall be awarded (or forfeiture or
termination of this cable franchise ). If there is no resolution of such issue
within 20 days of the mailing of the notice described in the first sentence,
then municipality’s legislative body may assess liquidated damages (or forfeit
or terminate this franchise) as described below.
      (2)   Company  shall be given notice of municipality’s intent to assess
liquidated damages (or forfeit or terminate this franchise ) at least 20 days
in advance of the meeting of the legislative body at which such damages are
assessed (or cable franchise forfeiture or termination considered).
      (3)   Company  may appear at the meeting of the legislative body at which
such damages are assessed (or cable franchise forfeiture or termination
considered) either in person, by agent, or by letter (or other writing) to
submit its views with respect to the proposed assessment (or the proposed
forfeiture or termination) or company may request a hearing. The legislative
body may conduct the hearing or, in its sole discretion, may by resolution
appoint a committee or subcommittee of the legislative body or a hearing
officer to conduct the hearing and submit a proposal for decision to it,
pursuant to procedures established by resolution. The hearing shall afford
company appropriate due process. The commission may, by resolution, establish
other procedural matters in connection with the hearing.
      (4)   The legislative body may then assess liquidated damages in amounts
not exceeding those set forth above (or forfeit or terminate the cable
franchise ).
      (5)   Any such assessment by municipality  shall be a monetary obligation
of company to municipality in the amount determined by the legislative body;
and shall be paid in full by company within 15 business days of the date of
assessment by the legislative body unless such payment is stayed by agreement
or court order. Any forfeiture or termination shall be effective 15 days from
the date of the legislative body decision to forfeit or terminate unless stayed
by agreement or court order.
      (6)   Only after assessment of liquidated damages (or forfeiture or
termination) may  company appeal such assessment (or forfeiture or termination)
to an appropriate state or federal court or agency, but only if such
assessment, forfeiture or termination is arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of
discretion.
   (d)   Remedies not exclusive. The rights and remedies of municipality  set
forth in this franchise  shall  be in addition to and not in limitation of, any
other rights and remedies provided by law  or in equity. Municipality and
company  understand and intend that such remedies shall be cumulative to the
maximum extent permitted by law  and the exercise by municipality of any one or
more of such remedies shall not preclude the exercise by municipality, at the
same or different times, of any other such remedies for the same uncured event
of default .

      (2)   All notices shall be deemed given on the day of mailing. Either
party to this franchise agreement  may change its address for the receipt of
notices at any time by giving notice thereof to the other as provided in this
section. Any notice given by a party hereunder must be signed by an authorized
representative of such party.
   (c)   Conferences. The parties hereby agree to meet at reasonable times on
reasonable notice to discuss any aspect of this franchise agreement , the
provision of cable services  or the cable system  during the term of this
franchise agreement.
   (d)   Governing law. This franchise agreement  shall  be construed pursuant
to the laws of the state  and the United States of America.
   (e)   Waiver of compliance. No failure by either party to insist upon the
strict performance of any covenant, agreement, term or condition of this
franchise agreement , or to exercise any right, term or remedy consequent upon
a breach thereof shall  constitute a waiver of any such breach or such
covenant, agreement, term or condition. No waiver of any breach shall affect or
alter this franchise agreement, but each and every covenant, agreement, term or
condition of this franchise agreement shall continue in full force and effect
with respect to any other then existing or subsequent breach thereof.
      (1)   Municipality  may waive any obligation of company under this
franchise agreement , in whole or in part, at any time. This includes, but is
not limited to, instances of a claim or showing by company that the costs
associated with the provision being waived would increase the rates company is
legally allowed to charge subscribers, such as a claim that such costs are an
“external cost” which allow company to increase its rates under the FCC rules.
      (2)   Municipality grants this franchise solely for a cable system and
for transaction of a cable television business . Company  may assert claims to
the effect that once its facilities have been placed in the streets and public
ways it will be entitled under federal law to use them for other purposes
without the consent or authorization of municipality and without necessarily
paying compensation therefore. Municipality disputes any such claim.
Municipality further asserts that if any such claims by company were to be
sustained there would be, among other things, an unconstitutional taking of
municipality’s property in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the United
States Constitution. Company disputes this claim. Neither the issuance nor the
acceptance of this franchise constitutes or will be claimed to constitute a
waiver or relinquishment of any rights or defenses of either municipality or
company in connection with these disputed issues. Municipality and company
acknowledge that this section is not intended to be a comprehensive statement
of their respective claims and positions and that they intend to defer all
disputes that may arise out of or relate to use by company of its facilities in
the streets and public ways for purposes other than a cable system.
      (3)   Company asserts that municipality’s franchise fees are limited by
federal statute to 5% of revenues from “cable services ,” all as defined in §
622 of the Telecommunications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. § 542. Municipality
asserts that any such limit is unconstitutional, among other things an
unconstitutional taking of municipality’s property in violation of the Fifth
Amendment of the United States Constitution. Company disputes this claim.
Neither the issuance nor the acceptance of this franchise constitutes or will
be claimed to constitute a waiver or relinquishment of any rights or defenses
of either municipality or company in connection with these disputed issues.
Municipality and company acknowledge that this section is not intended to be a
comprehensive statement of their respective claims and positions and that they
intend to defer all disputes that may arise out of or relate to statutory
limits on franchise fees.
   (f)   Independent contractor relationship. The relationship of company  to
municipality  is and shall  continue to be an independent contractual
relationship, and no liability or benefits, such as worker’s compensation,
pension rights or liabilities, insurance rights or liabilities or other
provisions or liabilities, arising out of or related to a contract for hire or
employer/employee relationship, shall arise or accrue to either party or either
party’s agents or employees as a result of the performance of this franchise
agreement , unless expressly stated in this franchise agreement.
   (g)   Severability. If any section, paragraph or provision of this franchise
agreement  shall  be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the
invalidity or unenforceability of such section, paragraph or provision shall
not affect any of the remaining provisions of this franchise agreement.
   (h)   Effective date . This franchise agreement  shall  be effective as of
September 1, 2001 (“effective date”). Any prior franchise  shall terminate as
of midnight of the day immediately preceding the effective date of this
franchise agreement, except as provided in division (a) above.
   (i)   FCC Rules. A copy of the FCC customer service rules as modified above
and in effect on the date of this franchise agreement  are shown in Appendix A.
A copy of FCC Rule 76.501 as in effect on the date of this franchise agreement
is shown in Appendix C.
   (j)   Captions. All captions are for convenience of use and have no
substantive effect, except for those captions in §
806.02 of this franchise agreement .
   (k)   Conflicts. In the event of a conflict between this franchise agreement
and the provisions of any prior franchise  or any franchise, permit, consent
agreement or other agreement with company , the provisions of this franchise
agreement shall  control.
   (l)   Force majeure. In the event company’s performance of any of the terms,
conditions or obligations required by this franchise agreement  is prevented by
a cause or event, not within company’s reasonable control, it shall  be deemed
excused for the period of such inability and no penalties or sanctions shall be
imposed as a result thereof. Causes or events not within the control of company
shall include acts of God, strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances,
failure or loss of utilities, explosions, acts of public enemies and natural
disasters.
   (m)   Franchise agreement  accepted. Company  further acknowledges by
acceptance of this franchise agreement that it has carefully read the terms and
conditions of this franchise agreement and accepts the lawful obligations
imposed thereby. As of the effective date , and without waiving any rights
company may  have to challenge the lawfulness or enforceability of the
franchise agreement in the future, company does not contend that any provision
of the franchise agreement is unlawful or unenforceable.
   (n)   Waiver of compliance. No failure by either party to insist upon the
strict performance of any covenant, agreement, term or condition of this
franchise agreement , or to exercise any right, term or remedy upon a breach
thereof shall  constitute a waiver of any such breach or such covenant,
agreement, term or condition. No waiver of any breach shall affect or alter
this franchise agreement, but each and every covenant, agreement, term or
condition of this franchise agreement shall continue in full force and effect
with respect to any other then existing or subsequent breach thereof.
   (o)   Reserved rights. Municipality  reserves all rights and powers under
its police powers or conferred by federal, state  or local law . In particular,
municipality reserves the right to amend its municipal code and cable ordinance
as it determines shall  be conducive to the health, safety, welfare and
accommodation of the public. Municipality agrees that by accepting this
franchise  company  has not waived its right to object to the application to it
of actions by municipality pursuant to its reserved rights or police powers.

amount of any rate change and briefly explain in readily understandable fashion
the cause of the rate change (e.g., change in external costs or the addition/
deletion of channels). When the change involves addition or deletion of

purposes of the carriage of digital broadcast signals, the operator need only
identify for subscribers, the television signal added and not whether that

franchising authority on the transaction between the operator and the
subscriber.
Note 1 to § 76.1603: § 624(h) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 544(h),
contains additional notification requirements which a franchising authority may
enforce. [The statutory section states “A franchising authority may require a
cable operator to do one or more of the following: (1) Provide thirty (30)
day’s advance written notice of any change in channel assignment or in the
video programming service provided over any such channel. (2) Inform
subscribers, via written notice, that comments on programming and channel
position changes are being recorded by a designated office of the franchising
authority.”]
Note 2 to § 76.1603: § 624(d)(3) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 544(d)
(3), contains additional notification provisions pertaining to cable operators
who offer a premium channel without charge to cable subscribers who do not
subscribe to such premium channel.
Note 3 to § 76.1603: § 631 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 551, contains

APPENDIX C: FCC DEFINITION OF CONTROL
 
47 C.F.R. § 76.501 Cross-ownership.
   (a)   No cable television system (including all parties under common
control) shall carry the signal of any television broadcast station if such
system directly or indirectly owns, operates, controls, or has an interest in a
TV broadcast station whose predicted Grade B contour, computed in accordance
with § 73.684 of part 73 of this chapter, overlaps in whole or in part the
service area of such system (i.e., the area within which the system is serving
subscribers).
   (b)   [Reserved]
   (c)   Effective date . The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section are
not effective until November 8, 1987, as to ownership interests proscribed
herein if such interests were in existence on or before July 1, 1970 (e.g., if
franchise  were in existence on or before July 1970), and will be applied to
cause divestiture as to ownership interests proscribed herein only where the
cable system  is directly or indirectly, owned, operated, controlled by, or has
an interest in a non-satellite television broadcast station which places a
principal community contour encompassing the entire community and there is no
other commercial non-satellite television broadcast station placing a principal
community contour encompassing the entire community.
   (d)   No cable operator shall offer satellite master antenna television
service (“SMATV”), as that service is defined in § 76.5(a)(2), separate and
apart from any franchised cable service in any portion of the franchise area
served by that cable operator’s cable system , either directly or indirectly
through an affiliate owned, operated, controlled, or under common control with
the cable operator.
   (e)   (1)   A cable operator may directly or indirectly, through an
affiliate owned, operated, controlled by, or under common control with the
cable operator, offer SMATV service within its franchise area if the cable
operator’s SMATV system was owned, operated, controlled by or under common
control with the cable operator as of October 5, 1992.
      (2)   A cable operator may directly or indirectly, through an affiliate
owned, operated, controlled by, or under common control with the cable
operator, offer service within its franchise area through SMATV facilities,
provided such service is offered in accordance with the terms and conditions of
a cable franchise agreement .
   (f)   The restrictions in divisions (d) and (e) of this appendix shall not
apply to any cable operator in any franchise area in which a cable operator is
subject to effective competition as determined under § 623(1) of the
Communications Act.
   Note 1: The word “control” as used herein is not limited to majority stock
ownership, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised.
   Note 2: In applying the provisions of this section, ownership and other
interests in broadcast licensees and cable television systems will be
attributed to their holders and deemed cognizable pursuant to the following
criteria:
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided herein, partnership and direct ownership
interest and any voting stock interest amounting to 5% or more of the
outstanding voting stock of a corporate broadcast licensee or cable television
system will be cognizable;
   (b)   No minority voting stock interest will be cognizable if there is a
single holder of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of the corporate
broadcast licensee or cable television system in which the minority interest is
held;
   (c)   Investment companies, as defined in 15 U.S.C. § 80a-3, insurance
companies and banks holding stock through their trust departments in trust
accounts will be considered to have a cognizable interest only if they hold 10%
or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate broadcast licensee or
cable television system, or if any of the officers or directors of the
broadcast licensee or cable television system are representatives of the
investment company , insurance company or bank concerned. Holdings by a bank or
insurance company will be aggregated if the bank or insurance company has any
right to determine how the stock will be voted. Holdings by investment
companies will be aggregated if under common management.
   (d)   Attribution of ownership interests in a broadcast licensee or cable
television system that are held indirectly by any party through one or more
intervening corporations will be determined by successive multiplication of the
ownership percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain and
application of the relevant attribution benchmark to the resulting product,
except that wherever the ownership percentage for any link in the chain exceeds
50%, it shall not be included for purposes of this multiplication. (For
example, if A owns 10% of company X, which owns 60% of company Y, which owns
25% of “Licensee”, then X’s interest in “Licensee” would be 25% (the same as
Y’s interest since X’s interest in Y exceeds 50%), and A’s interest in
“Licensee” would be 2.5% (0.1x0.25). Under the 5% attribution benchmark, X’s
interest in “Licensee” would be cognizable, while A’s interest would not be
cognizable.)
   (e)   Voting stock interests held in trust shall be attributed to any person
who holds or share the power to vote such stock, to any person who has the sole
power to sell such stock, and to any person who has the right to revoke the
trust at will or to replace the trustee at will. If the trustee has a familial,
personal or extra-trust business relationship to the grantor or the
beneficiary, the grantor or beneficiary, as appropriate, will be attributed
with the stock interests held in trust. An otherwise qualified trust will be
ineffective to insulate the grantor or beneficiary from attribution with the
trust’s assets unless all voting stock interests held by the grantor or
beneficiary in the relevant broadcast licensee or cable television system are
subject to said trust.
   (g)   (1)   A limited partnership interest shall be attributed to a limited
partner unless that partner is not materially involved, directly or indirectly,
in the management or operation of the media-related activities of the
partnership and the licensee or system so certifies.
      (2)   In order for a licensee or system to make the certification set
forth in division (g)(1) of this note, it must verify that the partnership
agreement or certificate of limited partnership, with respect to the particular
limited partner exempt from attribution, establishes that the exempt limited
partner has not material involvement, directly or indirectly, in the management
or operation of the media activities of the partnership. The criteria which
would assure adequate insulation for purposes of this certification are
described in the Memorandum Opinion and Order in MM Docket No. 83-46, FCC 85-
252 (released June 24, 1985) as modified on reconsideration in the Memorandum
Opinion and Order in MM Docket No. 83-46, FCC 86-410 (released November 28,
1986). Irrespective of the terms of the certificate of limited partnership or
partnership agreement, however, no such certification shall be made if the
individual or entity making the certification has actual knowledge of any
material involvement of the limited partners in the management or operation of
the media-related businesses of the partnership.
   (h)   Officers and directors of a broadcast licensee or cable television
system are considered to have a cognizable interest in the entity with which
they are so associated. If any such entity engages in businesses in addition to
its primary business of broadcasting or cable television service, it may
request the Commission to waive attribution for any officer or director whose
duties and responsibilities are wholly unrelated to its primary business. The
officers and directors of a parent company of a broadcast licensee or cable
television system, with an attributable interest in any such subsidiary entity,
shall be deemed to have a cognizable interest in the subsidiary unless the
duties and responsibilities of the officer or director involved are wholly
unrelated to the broadcast licensee or cable television system subsidiary, and
a statement properly documenting this fact is submitted to the Commission.
(This statement may be included on appropriate Ownership Report.) The officers
and directors of a sister corporation of a broadcast licensee or cable
television system shall not be attributed with ownership of these entities by
virtue of such status.
   (i)   Discrete ownership interests will be aggregated in determining whether
or not an interest is cognizable under this section. An individual or entity
will be deemed to have a cognizable investment if:
      (1)   The sum of the interests held by or through “passive investors” is
equal to or exceeds 10%; or
      (2)   The sum of the interests other than those held by or through
“passive investors” is equal to or exceeds 5%; or
      (3)   The sum of the interests computed under paragraph (i)(1) of this
note plus the sum of the interests computed under paragraph (i)(2) of this note
is equal to or exceeds 10%.
   Note 3: In cases where record and beneficial ownership of voting stock is
not identical (e.g., bank nominees holding stock as record owners for the
benefit of mutual funds, brokerage houses holding stock in street names for
benefit of customers, investment advisors holding stock in their own names for
the benefit of clients, and insurance companies holding stock), the party
having the right to determine how the stock will be voted will be considered to
own it for purposes of this subpart.
   Note 4: Division (a) of this section will not be applied so as to require
the divestiture of ownership interests proscribed herein solely because of the
transfer of such interests to heirs or legatees by will or intestacy, provided
that the degree or extent of the proscribed cross-ownership is not increased by
such transfer.
   Note 5: In applying the provisions of divisions (d) and (e) of this
appendix, control and an attributable ownership interest shall be defined by
reference to the definitions contained in Notes 1 through 4, provided however,
that:
   (a)   The single majority shareholder provisions of Note 2(b) and the
limited partner insulation provisions of Note 2(g) shall not apply; and
   (b)   The provisions of Note 2(a) regarding five (5) percent interests shall
include all voting or nonvoting stock or limited partnership equity interests
of five (5) percent or more.
(Ord. passed 9-5-2001)
APPENDIX D: SHARED EG CHANNEL INFORMATION
 
SHARED EG CHANNEL INFORMATION
GENESEE-NORTH OAKLAND AREA COMMUNITIES
   The following provides information on the two shared education/government
(“EG”) channels being provided for the ten participating Genesee-North Oakland
communities under the renewal franchise with Comcast.
   Two such channels are provided for each community, largely because the
achieves the communities’ goal of making sure that most/all subscribers receive
both the school and government programming appropriate to the school district/
community they live in, while doing so at the least expense to Comcast (by
having the EG channels the same for the large areas served by an Optical
Transfer Point, rather than having variations neighborhood by neighborhood
(node by node)).
I.   North Area:
   A.   Communities included:
      1.   City of Clio;

information is recorded accurately on a record of transaction form:
      (1)   The dealer certificate of registration number;
      (2)   A general description of the precious item or precious items

transaction shall destroy, and not keep a permanent record of, the record of
transaction. A dealer who goes out of business or changes his, her or its

year before his, her or its closing or moving to the local police agency;
      (6)   The price paid by the dealer for the precious or semi-precious

received shall be open to an inspection by the prosecuting attorney, the local
police agency, the sheriffs department of the local governmental unit in which
the customer resides, and/or the state police, at all times during the ordinary
business hours of the dealer. As a condition of doing business, a dealer is
considered to have given consent to the inspection prescribed by this division
(d). The record of transaction forms of a dealer shall not be open to

markings provided, as well as any other information as required pursuant to the

the transaction to which the record pertains.
   (b)   Within 48 hours after receiving or purchasing a precious item, the
dealer shall send a copy of the record of transaction form to the city’s Police
Chief or his or her designee and, if the record of transaction form indicates
that the customer resides outside the jurisdiction of the city, the dealer
shall send a copy of the record of transaction form to the police agency of the
city, village or township in which the customer resides as set forth on the
record of transaction, or, if that city, village or township does not have a
police agency, to the sheriffs department of the county in which the customer
resides as set forth on the record of transaction.
      (1)   Every licensee, owner and employee shall keep a record of all
persons and/or entities with whom business has transacted and all property
coming into their possession. Reports must be electronically transmitted to the
city’s Police Chief or his or her designee. Within 48 hours of receipt by
purchase or otherwise of a precious item, a report must be transmitted by means
of electronic transmission through a modem or similar device in a format that
the data is capable of direct electronic entry into the city’s computerized
system, as approved by the city’s Police Chief, or his or her designee, for
identifying property coming into the possession of a licensor. A transaction
report by electronic transmission under this subsection shall not be reported
on paper forms, unless the city’s Police Chief or his or her designee so
requires.
      (2)   A fee as adopted and subject to change periodically by the City
Council shall be assessed per transaction. The vendor will assess the property
registration fee for each transaction the licensee reports either through batch
file upload or directly using the vendor’s business interface or on the
vendor’s automated reporting service that involves transactions subject to the
provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   TRANSACTION is defined as a single buy, or which may  involve one
or more items and does not include contract extension, or claims. The per
transaction registration fee is not a per item fee, included in the
transaction. It is within the sole discretion of the secondhand dealer whether
to recover the fee from their customers for registering a transaction.
      (4)   The licensee will be invoiced on a monthly basis. The city’s vendor
automated reporting service isolates and generates a list of the billable
transactions and will be used for deriving invoiced amounts. The above fees are
assessed for the use of the standard vendor’s automated recording service. Any
custom programming completed for the secondhand dealer will be negotiated on a
contract basis and may result in additional licensing arrangements between the
vendor and the licensor. Sales tax will be added to the above amounts where
applicable. Failure to timely pay as invoiced is a violation of this chapter.
   (c)   The record of transaction forms received by a police agency or
sheriffs department shall not be open to inspection by the general public. Each
police agency or sheriff’s department holding record of transaction forms shall
be responsible for ensuring the confidentiality of the record of transaction
forms and ensuring that the record of transaction forms are used only for the
purpose for which they were received.

assessments to the respective owners, as indicated by the records of the City
Assessor, of the several lots or parcels of land  assessed, stating the amount

owner  to an extension of time within which to pay the assessment.
   (g)   Collection fees and penalties. After the confirmation of any special
assessment roll, the same collection fees shall  be collected on delinquent
special assessments and upon delinquent installments of such special

it is finally determined to proceed with the making of the improvement  in
question, which notice shall state the grounds on which the proceedings are to
be contested, no suit or action of any kind shall  be instituted or maintained
for the purpose of contesting or enjoining the collection of such special
assessment. Regardless of whether or not any public improvement  is completed
in any special assessment district, no owner  of real property  located in such
district shall be entitled to commence any suit or action for the purpose of
contesting or enjoining the collection of any such special assessment after he
or she has received the benefits from the substantial completion of that
portion of such public improvement  for which he or she is assessed.

of each local or special public improvement , compile the actual cost  thereof
and certify the same to the City Assessor who shall adjust the special
assessment roll to correspond therewith.
   (b)   Additional assessments. When any special assessment roll proves
insufficient to pay the cost  of the improvement  for which it was made,
Council may  make an additional pro rata assessment, but the total amount
assessed against any one lot or parcel of land  shall  not exceed the value of
the benefits received by such lot or parcel of land .
   (c)   Assessment refunds. If the assessment proves larger than necessary by
5% or less, such information shall  be reported to Council which may  place the
excess in the city treasury or make a refund thereof pro rata according to the
assessment. If the assessment exceeds the amount necessary by more than 5%, the
entire excess shall be refunded to the owners of the property  upon which
payments have been made in full, pro rata according to the assessment.
   (d)   Refund procedure on installments. Any excess refund, where payment in
full has not been received, shall  be made a credit against future unpaid
installments in the inverse order in which they are payable to the extent that
such installments exist, and the balance of such refund shall be made in cash.
   (e)   Restriction against refund. No refunds of special assessments may  be
made which impair or contravene the provisions of any outstanding obligation or
bond secured in whole or in part by such special assessment.
   (f)   Illegal or invalid assessments. Whenever Council determines that a
special assessment is invalid or defective for any reason whatsoever, or if any
court of competent jurisdiction has adjudged such an assessment to be illegal
for any reason whatsoever, in whole or in part, Council may  cause a new
assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was
made, whether the improvement  or any part thereof has been completed or not,
and whether any part of the assessment has been collected or not.
   (g)   Proceedings on reassessment. All proceedings on reassessments and for
the collection thereof shall  be made in the same manner as provided for an
original assessment. If any portion of the original assessment has been
collected and not refunded, if shall be applied upon the reassessment, and the
reassessment shall, to that extent, be deemed satisfied. If more than the
amount reassessed has been collected, the balance shall be refunded to the
person making such payments.

§ 1022.02 CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   All sidewalks, crosswalks and approaches hereafter constructed or repaired
in streets within the city shall be constructed or repaired according to the
following specifications.
   (a)   Location, grades, widths. Sidewalks to be constructed shall  be
located one foot from the property  line, unless special permission is granted
by Council to locate sidewalks at any other location. All sidewalks shall be
upon such grade as Council may  direct and shall not be less than four feet in
width.
   (b)   Filling, depth and grade. All necessary filling shall  be made with
earth free from vegetable material or refuse of any kind. It shall be deposited
in layers not exceeding six inches thick and each layer shall be tamped by a
hand tamper or packed by other means which will produce the same results to the
established grade, allowing for the thickness of the walk to be built upon it.
The fill on the top shall extend one foot in width on each side beyond the walk
to be built upon it. Its sides shall be constructed with a slope of not less
than one and one-half feet horizontal to one foot vertical. No walk shall be
constructed upon the fill until the earth is sufficiently compact to prevent
settlement.
   (c)   Unsuitable filling. Any soft material subject to shrinkage or decay,
trees under six inches in diameter, or other unsuitable material designated by
the Director of Public Works, shall  be removed and the space backfilled with
well-tamped earth.

or which interfere with the proper placing of the sidewalk , and which require
moving, will be removed by the city at the expense of the person adjacent to
whose property  the sidewalk  is to be constructed.
   (e)   Cuts. When cuts are necessary, the earth or other material shall  be
excavated to such width that the bottom of the excavation shall be at least one
foot wider on each side than the width of the walk to be built upon it, and the
sides shall, where possible, slope two feet horizontal to one foot vertical.
Excavated material shall be removed from the site of the work, and any excess
of excavation over fill shall be disposed of by the builder. The bottom of the
cut shall be tamped, provided it is not sufficiently firm.
   (f)   Material required. Walks shall  be constructed of cement concrete.
   (g)   Forms.
      (1)   The forms for the concrete shall be smooth, free from warp, of
sufficient strength to resist springing out of shape and of a depth to conform
to the thickness of the proposed walk. The divider plates shall be removed from
forms that have been previously used.
      (2)   The forms shall preferably be of steel and must be well staked and
set to the established lines, their upper edges conforming to the grade of the
finished walk, which walk shall have a fall towards the gutter of one-quarter
of an inch to one foot.
      (3)   The base shall be blocked out in sections which will not measure
more than four feet in any dimension, and in any given walk such sections are
to be uniformly spaced.
      (4)   The divider plates shall be made of steel not less than one-eighth
of an inch in thickness of a depth to correspond to the thickness of the
proposed walk, shall extend the full width of the walk and shall be set at
right angles to the side forms. They shall be left in place until the surface
coat is floated.
   (h)   Expansion joints. On concrete walks, three-quarter inch expansion
joints composed of some asphaltic composition satisfactory to Council shall  be
placed between curbs and walks at all points where they meet and in
intermediate joints at distances not to exceed 80 feet. These joints are to be
flush with the wearing surface and are to extend for the full depth of the
walk.
   (i)   Mixing and placing concrete.
      (1)   All concrete shall be mixed with a batch mixer of an approved type
except where the Director of Public Works may deem it necessary or expedient to
mix by hand methods. In the event hand mixing is resorted to, it shall be done
only as directed by the Director, in writing.
      (2)   Water shall be used in sufficient quantities to obtain concrete
which will hold its shape when struck off with a template. In no case shall
such concrete be wet enough to cause a separation of materials.
      (3)   Concrete shall be placed in such manner as to produce a dense
homogeneous mass. It shall be puddled, sliced or tamped with proper tools for
such purpose while being deposited.
      (4)   Special care must be exercised in reinforced concrete work not to
distort or displace any reinforcing steel during concreting.
      (5)   No used concrete or retempering of concrete which has partially set
will be allowed either by the addition of water or by mixing it with other
materials.
      (6)   Concrete shall not be mixed or deposited when the temperature is
below 40°F, unless special precautions, subject to the approval of the
Director, are taken to avoid the use of materials containing frost and to keep
the work protected until thoroughly hardened.
      (7)   In warm weather, walks shall be protected from the sun by a
covering and shall be kept moist by sprinkling for at least four days. At least
once on small areas, and at least every 50 feet on long stretches, suitable
nameplates or dies shall be used to mark the name of the builder employed on
the work and the date the work was done.
   (j)   Quantities of cement required.
      (1)   For a one course walk, the minimum amount of cement required for
the concrete is one barrel of cement for each 60 square feet of four-inch
sidewalk .
      (2)   For two course walks, the minimum amount of cement required for the
concrete is one barrel for each 100 square feet of base course, and one barrel
for each 100 square feet of top. In no case shall the builders use less than
these amounts of cement in sidewalk construction. In the event that less cement
than the above requirement is used in any walk constructed, the builder may be
required to tear out the walk and replace it with a walk containing the proper
amount of cement as required herein. Due allowance will be made for any waste
in mixing and placing concrete in forms.
   (k)   Gravel. Clean, hard, washed gravel, free from soft, porous particles,
clay, silt or vegetable matter, may  be used which may be finished to leave a
reasonably smooth and nonporous surface.
   (l)   Base course.
      (1)   A two course concrete sidewalk  shall consist of a bottom course
three inches thick under a wearing or top course of cement mortar one inch
thick.
      (2)   The base shall be mixed in a batch mixer in the proportion of one
part by volume of cement to six parts by volume of well graded bank-run gravel,
free from clay, loam or vegetable matter as herein specified. In preparing
concrete for the base, cement and gravel shall be measured separately and then
mixed thoroughly while dry.
      (3)   After being mixed dry, sufficient water shall be added to obtain
the desired consistency and the mixing shall be continued until the materials
are uniformly distributed and each particle of the same is thoroughly coated
with cement. All concrete shall be mixed for not less than 50 seconds after the
addition of water.
      (4)   The consistency of the mixture shall be such that the mortar,
composed of cement and the fine material, adheres to the pebbles, and such that
under heavy tamping, a small amount of water will flush to the surface.
      (5)   The concrete shall be deposited in such quantities that after being
thoroughly rammed into place, it will be three inches in thickness and the
upper surface shall be true, uniform, parallel to and one inch below the
surface of the finished work.
      (6)   Concrete must be conveyed from the place of mixing and placed in
such manner and so handled after depositing it that the concrete will be of
uniform composition throughout, showing no lack or excess of mortar in any
place.
   (m)   Wearing surface.
      (1)   The wearing surface shall be composed of one part by volume of
cement to two parts by volume of clean sand screened through a one-quarter inch
screen, not more than 5% of which shall pass a number 100 sieve. The sand and
cement shall be mixed thoroughly while dry and then sufficient water added
while the mixing is continued to produce a mortar of a consistency which can be
easily spread into position with a straight edge. The mortar shall be spread on
the base immediately after mixing and before the base has obtained its initial
set.
      (2)   After the wearing surface has been worked to an approximately true
plane, the slab marking shall be made directly over the joints in the base.
Such marking shall be made with a tool which will cut entirely through and
completely separate the surface of adjacent slabs.
      (3)   The slabs shall be rounded on all surface edges to a radius of
about one-half of an inch.
      (4)   The surface shall be troweled smooth and shall then be lightly
brushed with a stiff brush or broom. The application of neat cement in the
surface in order to hasten hardening is prohibited.
   (n)   Faulty materials.
      (1)   No materials of any sort not approved by Council are to be used in
any part of the work.
      (2)   All cement used shall be some recognized brand of cement that has
proven satisfactory and shall comply with the latest specifications of the
American Society for Testing Materials.
      (3)   The right is hereby reserved to inspect and test cement at any time
that Council deems it advisable to make such tests. If, in the short period
tests, it appears that a certain shipment of cement is not up to the desired
standard, no cement from this lot shall be used until the time necessary to
complete the tests requiring more time has elapsed. If, after these tests have
been made, it still appears that the cement is not satisfactory, then any part
of this cement on the job shall be hauled away and disposed of in some manner
which will insure its not being used in any part of the work. Lumps of cement
are to be thrown out in all cases. They shall not be used either as lumps or by
attempting to pulverize them.
   (o)   Walks across driveways. All sidewalks constructed, reconstructed or
repaired which cross existing or proposed driveways shall be built six inches
in thickness and the concrete used shall  be of the same mixture as specified
for other walks.
   (p)   Grades; permits required.
      (1)   All sidewalks, crosswalks and approaches hereafter constructed or
repaired in streets within the city shall be upon such grade and line as shall
be established by Council.
      (2)   All joints and edges shall be finished with tools for that purpose.
In the case of walks on slopes greater than one-half inch per foot, grooving or
brooming or checking the top surface shall be done as directed by the Director
of Public Works.
      (3)   No such construction, reconstruction or repair work shall be
commenced until after a permit has been obtained from Council.
   (q)   Approaches. For the purpose of this chapter, APPROACHES shall  be
taken to mean either driveways or sidewalks built on the street  property
between the gutter line and the sidewalk  line, or other miscellaneous
construction of a similar nature within the limits of the public streets and
highways.
   (r)   Crosswalks. All crosswalks shall  be built and kept in repair by the
city under the direction of Council and shall be not less than four feet wide
and of such material as heretofore specified. The expense of building and
repairing crosswalks shall be paid out of the General Highway or Street Fund.
   (s)   Permitted contractors.
      (1)   All sidewalks shall be built:
         A.   By the city by the direct employment of labor and the purchase of
materials;
         B.   By private contract under the supervision of, and with an
inspection by, the city; or
         C.   By bonded sidewalk contractors as hereinafter noted, under the
direction of Council.
      (2)   The construction of walks through the city may be undertaken by the
employment of labor and purchase of materials by the owner , provided that a
full-time city inspector is employed on the job to check, supervise and inspect
the work and provided that all expense of employing such inspector is paid by
the owner .

CHAPTER 1040: SEWERS (REPEALED)
Editor’s note:
Ordinance 08-06, passed March 12, 2008, repealed in its entirety Ordinance 40,
passed January 13, 1968, codified as Chapter 1040, Sewers, and adopts a new
Genesee County Sewer Use Ordinance for the City of Grand Blanc (hereinafter
referred to as the “ordinance”).
The Ordinance establishes uniform requirements for discharges by users located
within the city to Genesee County POTW, and to enable the city and the county
agency to comply with applicable state and federal laws as required by the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also knows as the “Clean Water Act”), as
amended, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq.; the General Pretreatment Regulations (40
C.F.R. part 403); Part 31 of Public Act 451 of 1994, being M.C.L.A. §§ 324.3101
et seq., as amended (“Water Resources Protection”); and the rules, Michigan
Administrative Code, R 323.2301 et seq., as amended, promulgated pursuant to §§
3103, 3106, and 3109 of Part 31 of Act 451 of Public Acts of Michigan of 1994,
being M.C.L.A. §§ 324.3103, 324.106 and 324.3109 respectively, as amended.
The ordinance prohibits the discharge of pollutants from within the city into
the Genesee County POTW that do not meet applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements; that would interfere with the operation of the POTW; that would
pass through the POTW into receiving waters or the atmosphere, the environment,
or otherwise be incompatible with the POTW; that would inhibit or disrupt the
POTW’s processing, use or disposal of sludge; that would cause health or safety
problems for POTW workers; or that would result in a violation of the POTW’s
NPDES permit or of other applicable laws and regulations.
The ordinance is intended to improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim
wastewaters and sludge from the Genesee County POTW, as required by law.
The ordinance regulates the discharge of wastewater and/or pollutants to the
POTW and provides the authority to enforce the requirements of the ordinance
through the issuance of permits and through other means as provided by the
ordinance.
The ordinance authorizes and requires all inspection, monitoring, reporting and
enforcement activities as necessary to ensure compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements and other applicable laws and
regulations.
The ordinance provides for the equitable distribution and recovery of costs
from users of the Genesee County POTW sufficient to administer regulatory
activities and to meet the costs of the operation, maintenance, improvement and
replacement of the POTW.
The ordinance applies to any person that discharges to the Genesee County POTW
from within the city. The ordinance also applies to any person owning, using,
constructing or maintaining any private system or facility intended or used for
the disposal of sewage or wastewater within the city.
The ordinance designates, empowers and authorizes the Genesee County POTW to
act as the agent and representative of the city for the purposes of
administering and enforcing the ordinance within the city. This includes, but
is not limited to, the power and authority of the POTW, as deemed necessary by
the POTW, to immediately and independently investigate, enforce, and prosecute
(administratively or judicially, and civilly or criminally) any violation of
the ordinance or of any notice, order, permit, decision or determination
promulgated, issued or made by the POTW under the ordinance, and to otherwise
implement the requirements of the ordinance.
The ordinance makes it unlawful for any person to discharge any wastewater or
pollutant to the POTW or to any storm sewer or natural outlet within the city
or in any area under the jurisdiction of the city, except in accordance with
the provisions of the ordinance and other applicable laws and regulations. If
any user discharges or proposes to discharge wastewaters or pollutants that are
prohibited or limited by the ordinance, the POTW may take any action as
provided by the ordinance or other applicable laws or regulations to assure and
require compliance with the provisions of the ordinance.

§ 1042.04 METERS.
   (a)   All premises using water shall be metered and payment shall be made
for water at rates as herein set forth. In no case will water be supplied at
fixture or flat rates, except for temporary supplies as provided in this
chapter, or in special cases reviewed and approved by formal resolution of
Council.
   (b)   Meters will be furnished by the Water Department. Meters shall remain
the property of the Department and will, at all times, be under its control.

five-eighths inch by three-fourths inch meter will be furnished. Where
application is made for a meter larger than five-eighths inch or five-eighths
inch by three-fourths inch, the Director of Public Works shall determine
whether a meter of such size is required. The Water Department will furnish
meters in sizes up to and including two inches. Where a meter larger than two
inches is required, special arrangements shall be made between the Department
and the customer. All such special arrangements shall be approved by Council
before becoming effective.
   (d)   Meters shall be set in an accessible location and in a manner
satisfactory to the Director. Where the premises contain no basement or cellar,
the meter shall be installed in a location which shall be approved by the
Director. Where it is necessary to set the meter in a pit, such pit shall be
built at the expense of the owner as directed by the Director and to his or her
entire satisfaction.
   (e)   Meters will be sealed by the Department. No person, except an
authorized employee of the Department, shall break or injure such seals. No
person, other than an authorized employee of the Department, shall change the
location of, alter or interfere in any way with the meter.
   (f)   The expense of installing, replacing and maintaining meters, after the
purchase of the initial meter at the owner ’s expense, will be borne by the
Department with the exception of irrigation meters, which costs shall be borne
by the owner . However, where replacements, repairs or adjustments of a meter
installed by the Department are made necessary by the act, negligence or
carelessness of the owner or occupant of the premises , the expense to the
Department caused thereby shall be charged and collected from the owner of the
premises .
   (g)   The owner or occupant of the premises where a meter is installed will
be held responsible for its care and protection from freezing and from injury
or interference by any person. In case of injury to the meter or in case of its
stoppage or imperfect operation, the owner or occupant of the premises  shall
give immediate notice to the Water Department. All water furnished by the city
and used on any premises must pass through the meter. No by-pass or connection
around the meter will be permitted. If any meter becomes defective or fails to
register, the consumer will be charged at the average bimonthly consumption
rate as shown by the meter over the period of the preceding four bimonthly
periods when the meter was accurately registering.
   (h)   The accuracy of the meter on any premises will be tested by the
Department upon written request of the owner , who shall pay, in advance, a fee
determined from time to time by Council, to cover the cost of the test. If, on
such test, the meter is found to register over 5% more water than actually
passes through it, another meter will be substituted therefor, such fee will be
refunded to the owner and the water bill may be adjusted in such a manner as
may be fair and just.

   (b)   If a permit is issued as provided in §
1042.03(h) and a water meter has been installed for the temporary use of water,
the owner  shall notify the Department upon the completion of his or her work
so that the water meter may be read and the connection shut off.
   (c)   No person shall take or use city water from premises other than his or

properties may be the same.
   (d)   Where the water has been turned off by the Department for any reason,
no person, except an authorized employee or agent of the Department, shall turn
it on again. Whenever this rule is violated, the Department may shut the water

Fire Department of the city or by such persons as may be specifically
authorized by the Water Department. No person shall in any manner, obstruct or
prevent free access to any fire hydrant by placing or storing, temporarily or
otherwise, any object or material of any kind within 20 feet of the same.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 1046.001 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the “City of Grand Blanc Storm Water
Management Ordinance” and may be so cited.
(Ord. 1411-04, passed 12-10-2014)
§ 1046.002 FINDINGS.
   The city finds that:
   (a)   Water bodies, roadways, structures and other property within, and
downstream of the city are at times subjected to flooding;
   (b)   Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is
also a danger to the natural resources of the city and the region;
   (c)   Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds,
resulting in increased storm water runoff rates and volumes, increased
flooding, increased stream channel erosion , and increased sediment transport
and deposition;
   (d)   Storm water runoff produced by land development contributes to
increased quantities of water-borne pollutants;
   (e)   Increases of storm water runoff, soil erosion , and non-point source
pollution have occurred as a result of land development, and cause
deterioration of the water resources of the city and downstream municipalities;
   (f)   Storm water runoff, soil erosion and non-point source pollution, due
to land development within the city, have resulted in a deterioration of the
water resources of the city and downstream municipalities;
   (g)   Increased storm water runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments and
pollutants associated with storm water runoff from future development projects
within the city will, absent reasonable regulation and control, adversely
affect the city water bodies and water resources, and those of downstream
municipalities;
   (h)   Storm water runoff, soil erosion , and non-point source pollution can
be controlled and minimized by the regulation of storm water runoff from
development;
   (i)   Adopting the standards, criteria and procedures contained in this
chapter and implementing the same will address many of the deleterious effects
of storm water runoff;
   (j)   Adopting these standards is necessary for the preservation of the
public health, safety and welfare.
(Ord. 1411-04, passed 12-10-2014)
§ 1046.003 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to establish minimum storm water
management requirements and controls to accomplish, among others, the following
objectives:
   (a)   To reduce artificially induced flood damage;
   (b)   To minimize increased storm water runoff rates and volumes from
identified new land development;
   (c)   To minimize the deterioration of existing watercourses, culverts and
bridges, and other structures;
   (d)   To encourage water recharge into the ground where geologically
favorable conditions exist;
   (e)   To prevent an increase in non-point source pollution;
   (f)   To maintain the integrity of stream channels for their biological
functions, as well as for drainage and other purposes;
   (g)   To minimize the impact of development upon stream bank and streambed
stability;
   (h)   To reduce erosion from development or construction projects;
   (i)   To preserve and protect water supply facilities and water resources by
means of controlling increased flood discharges, stream  erosion and runoff
pollution;
   (j)   To reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion , and
non-point source pollution, wherever practicable, from lands that were
developed without storm water management controls meeting the purposes and
standards of this chapter; and
   (k)   To reduce the adverse impact of changing land use on water bodies and,
to that end, this chapter establishes minimum standards to protect water bodies
from degradation resulting from changing land use where there are insufficient
storm water management controls.
(Ord. 1411-04, passed 12-10-2014)
§ 1046.004 APPLICABILITY, EXEMPTIONS AND GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   To prevent an increase in non-point source pollution; this chapter
shall apply to any earth-disturbing activities greater than or equal to one
acre ( ≥ 1 ac.) for new development or redevelopment projects or earth
disturbing activities less than one acre on parcels with greater than or equal
to 50% ( ≥ 50%) impervious surface which will alter storm water drainage
characteristics of the development site .
   (b)   Typically these developments require approval of a plat, a site
development plan , building permit, and other permits to be obtained. However,
this chapter shall not apply to the following:
      (1)   Development on one single-family lot, parcel or condominium unit
where the city determines that due to the size of the development site or other
circumstances, the quantity, quality and or rate of storm water flow does not
materially alter storm water flow from the property in terms of rate and/or
volume;
      (2)   The installation or removal of individual mobile homes within a
mobile home park. This exemption shall not be construed to apply to the
construction, expansion, or modification of a mobile home park;
      (3)   Ongoing farm operations such as tilling or plowing. Earth
disturbances that are not directly related to farming are not exempt from this
chapter;
      (4)   Plats with preliminary plat approval and other developments with
final land use approval prior to the effective date of this chapter, where such
approvals remain in effect;
      (5)   Additions or modifications to any single-family or duplex structure
disturbing less than 20,000 square feet of land ;
      (6)   Landscaping or gardening involving less than 5,000 square feet of
land ;
      (7)   Construction of a dwelling on a legal lot within a development that
itself previously received approval under this chapter, provided that less than
5,000 square feet of land is cleared or graded for such construction.

§ 1224.15 STORM SEWERS OR DRAINS; SPECIAL SEWER OR WATER FACILITIES.
   No subdivision will be accepted for final plat or condominium approval
unless water mains, storm water sewers or drains have been dedicated to the
public for that purpose and will be available to the use of other lands in the
city within the drainage district. Further, in the event the city  shall
determine that the public health, safety and welfare require such drains to be
tiled and covered, the subdivider will agree to do so. Further, in the event
the general plan of development of the city requires that pipelines and
facilities for storm water, public sanitary sewer or public water supply need
to be larger or deeper than the sizes and depth required to serve this
subdivision alone, for future development of other lands in the city , the
subdivider will place such larger or deeper pipelines available for connection
to other lands of the city , provided that the city allows for payback to the
developer in cash, or in a manner to be agreed upon, for the additional cost of
larger or deeper pipelines or facilities deemed necessary.

§ 1224.16 BUILDING FINISH GRADE.
   (a)   Any building requiring yard space shall be located at such an
elevation that a sloping grade shall be maintained to cause the flow of surface
water to run away from the walls of the building. A sloping grade, beginning at
the sidewalk level, shall be maintained and established from the center of the
front lot line to the finished grade line at the front of the building, and
also from the rear lot line to the front, both grades sloping to the front
property line. Where rear lot drainageways are required, an enclosed drain and/
or surface swale drain along the rear lot lines shall be provided with
easements provided in accordance with the city approval. However, this shall
not prevent the grading of a yard space to provide sunken or terraced areas,
provided proper means are constructed and maintained to prevent the run-off of
surface water from flowing onto the adjacent properties. Grade elevations shall
be determined by using the elevation at the centerline of the road in front of
the lot as the established grade or such grade determined by the City Engineer
or the Building and Zoning Administrator.
   (b)   When a new building is constructed on a vacant lot between two
existing buildings or adjacent to an existing building, the existing
established grade shall be used in determining the grade around the new
building and the yard around the new building and the yard shall be graded in
such a manner as to meet existing grades and not to permit run-off of surface
water to flow onto the adjacent property .
(Ord. 215, passed 9-5-1990)

public utilities or make other improvements in the right-of-way with no
obligation to preserve or replace such landscaping .
      (3)   An essential service structure;
      (4)   Mail boxes that meet USPS standards;
      (5)   Underground sprinkler systems when installed and located so the
street , non-motorized paths, and sidewalks are not impacted by overspray,
drift or run-off. Control panels, electrical systems or water supplies to the
sprinkler system or water supplies shall be located outside of the right-of-way
;
      (6)   Regulatory signs; and
      (7)   An existing natural feature that has been preserved.
   (b)   Any existing construction or site improvement currently within the
city ’s right-of-way and not previously approved, shall obtain approval or
shall be removed. The city shall not be responsible for replacing or repairing
any approved or non-approved construction, landscaping or other site

Act 288 of 1967, as set forth in M.C.L.A. § 560.167.
   (b)   Right-of-way requirements.
      (1)   State or national trunklines shall be of the width required by the
MDOT.
      (2)   County section-line roads, quarter section-line roads and existing
roads shall be a minimum of 100 feet wide, being 50 feet on each side of the
centerline or section line.
      (3)   All other streets and roads shall have a minimum right-of-way width
of 60 feet, unless additional right-of-way is required for proper construction.
      (4)   All dead-end streets shall be provided with an approved turn-around
constructed within the boundaries of the plat, unless otherwise approved by the
city. If there is even a remote possibility of the street ever being extended
into adjoining property , it shall extend to the plat line. In any event, the
maximum length of streets having only one means of ingress and egress shall be
subject to the approval of the city. Additional requirements shall be as
provided in §§
1226.04 and
1226.12.
      (5)   Outlots intended for future street extensions will be permitted if
expansion of the street system into adjacent property is contemplated, if it is
compatible with the plat layout and if, by circumstances, it is pertinent to
the area being platted. Provision shall be made, either as a part of the plat
dedication or by other means satisfactory to the city, to assure that outlots
intended for the future expansion of the street system are reserved and
restricted for that purpose, in satisfaction of Plat Act requirements. Also,

§ 1226.03 SUBMISSION OF STREET AND DRAINAGE PLAN.
   (a)   Generally.
      (1)   After approval of the preliminary plat layout, three sets of street
and drainage plans, covering all streets within the plat or condominium, shall
be submitted to the city for approval. These plans must show plan and profile,
typical cross-sections and special details and shall be accompanied by a plat
layout on the title or first sheet. This implies a workmanlike execution of the
street plans in every respect. The plans and special details must be complete
to the extent that they can be used as construction plans and must bear the
seal of a registered engineer licensed in the state . Suggested cross-sections
can be found in §
1226.11.
      (2)   Separate enlarged details showing unusual installations and
situations must be included. These details should include, but are not limited
to, pipe arches, acceleration/deceleration lanes and widened intersections or
other areas of construction which cannot be clearly shown and understood from
the conventional plan and profile.
   (b)   Street plans; information required. The plans must show plainly all of
the following information:
      (1)   A plan view with the centerline or top of the curb profile directly
below the plan view;
      (2)   The proposed grades taken from datum determined from a permanent
benchmark, the location of which shall be shown on the plans; and
      (3)   All pertinent design and construction information necessary to
construct and inspect the improvements.
   (c)   Drainage plans; information required. The plans must show plainly at
least all of the following information:
      (1)   The location, size and depth of all underground structures used for
street drainage within the plat or condominium. The drainage plans may be
incorporated as a part of the street plans if this can be done without
sacrificing clarity. A composite layout of the sewers and other drainage
structures must be shown on the overall street system submitted as a part of
the plans. A schematic drawing of this layout will suffice. Drainage plans
should be approved by both the County Drain Commissioner (if he or she shares
jurisdiction in these facilities with the city) and the city. Road plans should
be approved by the County Road Commission (if it shares jurisdiction in the
facilities with the city) and the city. In case of differences in standards
between these two organizations, the higher standard shall prevail.
      (2)   Sizes, lengths and locations of all cross culverts and/or storm
sewers existing or proposed within the development limits and adjacent to the
developed area which are to be used to drain the area and adjoining lands;
      (3)   The location and type of inlets and clean-out points for
underground drainage systems; and
      (4)   The MDOT detail number or reference to the standard plan number for
all catchbasins, inlets, manholes and similar structures.

(a rise or fall of six feet in 100 feet). The minimum grade shall be 0.40%
measured along the centerline of the street , except that on the circle area of
a cul-de-sac, the developed minimum grade shall be 0.6%, measured along the
outside edge of the cul-de-sac.
         E.   The minimum radii on platted street intersections shall be as
follows:
            1.   State and federal highways: as approved by the MDOT;
            2.   Major local or primary roads: forty feet to the back of the

         A.   Pavement width on each side of the median divider shall be not
less than 27 feet from back of curb to back of curb.
         B.   All medians shall be curbed in essentially the same manner and
according to the same detail of curb and gutter used elsewhere throughout the
development . High curbs, flagstone walls or similar medians will not be
permitted.
         C.   The distance from the back of the curb to the street right-of-way
line shall be not less than the minimum distance approved elsewhere in the
plat, except on cul-de-sacs with approval from the city.
         D.   The median divider maximum length from end to end shall be 200
feet. The minimum length along the same dimensions shall be 100 feet.
         E.   Median dividers shall be not less than 12 feet nor more than 20
feet in width from back of curb to back of curb and shall be of uniform even
width. Hour glass or other odd shaped medians shall not be permitted. Minimum
radii at median ends shall be one-half of the uniform median width.
         F.   The material placed between the curbs, inside the median, may
consist of sodded earth, limestone chips, brick or similar material approved by
the city.
         G.   The only other items to be sanctioned within the limits of the
median, until such time as the plat is approved, will be low growing shrubbery,
a maximum of 18 inches in height.
         H.   The typical cross-section of the boulevard section, at its
midpoint, showing the pavement crown and other pertinent information, shall be
required as a part of the street and drainage plans.
      (3)   Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sac length should be limited to seven times the
average lot width and in no case should a cul-de-sac exceed 1,200 feet in
length. Special consideration may  be given to longer cul-de-sacs under certain
topographic conditions or other unusual situations.
   (c)   Drainage design requirements; underground storm sewers.
      (1)   All underground drainage used to drain the streets in a development
must be approved by the city’s DPW. When requested, design data supporting the
adequacy of the underground drainage system shall be furnished before approval
of the plans. Storm sewer pipe shall be C76, 12-inch minimum diameter placed at
a minimum 2.5 fps grade slope. Storm sewer design shall be at no less than a
25-year storm. The minimum initial time of concentration shall be 20 minutes.
The run-off coefficient for single-family shall be 0.4, for multifamily 0.5,
and for commercial-industrial 0.75. Adjustments of run-off factors must be
approved by the city’s DPW prior to use.
      (2)   Where possible, the underground storm sewer of adequate diameter
shall be laid with sufficient gradient to be self-cleaning. Catchbasins, when
used, shall have minimum two-foot sumps. Structures may be two feet interior
for less than four feet of depth. All structures exceeding four feet in depth
must be at least four feet interior diameter.
      (3)   The proper type of pipe and bedding, complying with MDOT
specifications, shall be used as necessary for good design. Granular material
backfill must be used in trenches under all roadways and in all trenches, the
inside edges of which are within three feet of the back of the curb. Backfill
material shall be compacted to a minimum of 95% modified Proctor (ASTM Test T-
99).
      (4)   Manholes (or other approved clean-out points) on underground
drainage systems must be placed at maximum intervals of 400 feet.
      (5)   Manholes shall be built according to the MDOT Standard Plan with
Cover A. Catchbasins shall be built according to the MDOT Standard Plan with
the approved cover, unless otherwise approved by the city.
      (6)   Where applicable, an approved method must be used to drain the
subbase or subgrade. The minimum size open joint drain tile used shall be six
inches in diameter.
      (7)   Approaches to catchbasins or inlets behind the curbs shall be
sodded or otherwise protected from erosion.
      (8)   On cul-de-sacs having circular turn-arounds, a catchbasin or inlet
will be required in the gutter to drain the circular area, unless it can be
positively determined by the city’s DPW that the gradients and the like, are
sufficient to warrant omitting these structures (minimum pavement grade slope
within the circle area of a cul-de-sac shall be 0.6%). If a planting island is
created in such turn-arounds, a similar structure must be built in the island
gutter or the island gutter must be built 0.4% higher than the outside radius
gutter and the island shall have a slope-away gutter. Following construction,
if these areas do not drain to the satisfaction of the city, the installation
of the necessary drainage structures will be required before acceptance of the
street .
      (9)   Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be required.
      (10)   The proprietor  shall provide an acceptable auxiliary system of
underground drainage to enable lot owners to drain sump pump outlets, roof
drains and similar private drainage into an approved storm sewer network. This
sump pump system may be an approved solid wall PVC pipe a minimum of eight
inches in diameter with standard structures for clean-outs.
(Res. passed 11-12-1986)
§ 1226.05 FINAL PLAT REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Generally.
      (1)   The final plat should not be submitted until all streets within the
plat have been completed according to the plans and specifications as set forth

(As amended June 10, 1998)
SECTION 305   SINGLE family DWELLING DESIGN STANDARDS.
   a.   Intent: This section is intended to establish regulations for the
construction of new single family  dwellings, whether mobile homes,
manufactured  homes, modular homes or site (“stick”) built homes, located
outside a mobile home park  in addition to HUD standards or the City Building
Code, as appropriate. The standards herein are intended to prevent grossly
dissimilar dwellings which would adversely affect the value of dwellings in the
surrounding area, adversely affect the desirability of an area to existing or
prospective homeowners, impair the stability of the environment, prevent the
most appropriate use  of real estate  and lessen the opportunity to realize the
development  pattern envisioned in the Grand Blanc Community Master Plan .
These regulations are based on the finding that the cohesiveness and character
of the City’s neighborhoods are significant factors in the City’s quality of
life, contribute to the distinct character in the various neighborhoods and
help retain property values. These regulations further ensure new housing units
are harmonious with the general character of the adjacent houses and the City
overall and ensure a stable housing stock. While some level of diversity is
acceptable, these regulations are intended to ensure the design variation of
new homes is similar to the level of variation in existing homes in the
immediate area, or surrounding neighborhoods with similar densities for new
residential projects. The standards shall not be construed to prohibit
innovative design concepts involving such matters as solar energy, view, unique
land contour, or relief from the common or standard designed home.
   b.   Applicability: The regulations of this section shall  apply to all new
single family  home construction. Major home expansions where the homeowner is
expanding the footprint of the new home by forty percent (40%) shall comply
with subsections 305(d)(11), 305(d)(12), and 305(d)(13), in addition to
required building codes, to ensure the resulting home continues to maintain the
character of the neighborhood. The standards shall not apply to minor home
expansions, interior remodeling, or to residences outside of the single family
zoning districts.
   c.   Approval: Compliance with these regulations shall  be determined by the
Building and Zoning Administrator  at the time the building permit is reviewed
and shall be based on the standards of subsection ‘d’ below.
   d.   Standards:
      1.   Code compliance: Each such dwelling unit  shall  comply with all
pertinent building and fire codes. In the case of a mobile home , all
construction and all plumbing, electrical apparatus and insulation within and
connected to said mobile home  shall be of a type and quality conforming to the
“Mobile Home Construction and Safety Standards” as promulgated by the United
States Department of Housing and Urban Development, being 24 C.F.R. 3280, as
amended. Additionally, all dwellings shall meet or exceed all applicable roof
snow load and strength requirements. Where there are conflicting applicable
regulations, the more stringent shall apply.
      2.   Building permit: All construction required herein shall  be
commenced only after a building permit has been obtained in accordance with the
City Building Code and other building regulations.
      3.   Certification: If the dwelling unit  is a mobile home , the mobile
home  must either be (i) new and certified by the manufacturer and/or
appropriate inspection agency as meeting the Mobile Home Construction and
Safety Standards of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, as
amended, or any similar successor or replacement standards which may  be
promulgated, or (ii) used and certified by the manufacturer and/or appropriate
inspection agency as meeting the standards referenced in Subsection (1) above,
and found, on inspection by the Building and Zoning Administrator  or their
designee, to be in excellent condition and safe and fit for residential
occupancy.
      4.   Dimensional Standards: Each such dwelling unit  shall  comply with
the minimum standards listed in
Article XX  for the Zoning District in which it is located, including minimum
lot area , minimum lot width , minimum floor area, required setbacks and
maximum building height . Homes constructed within an existing neighborhood,
also called fill-in housing, are subject to the regulations of subsection ‘8’
and ‘9’ below.
      5.   Foundation: Each dwelling unit  shall  be firmly attached to a
permanent basement  or crawl space foundation constructed on the site in
accordance with the City Building Code and shall have a wall of the same
perimeter dimensions of the dwelling and constructed of such materials and type
as required in the applicable building code for single-family dwellings. If
said dwelling is a mobile home , the dwelling shall be securely anchored to the
foundation to prevent displacement during windstorms.
      6.   Undercarriage: In the event that such dwelling unit  shall  be a
mobile home , the wheels, tongue, hitch assembly and other towing appurtenances
shall be removed before attachment to its permanent foundation. The foundation
or skirting shall fully enclose the towing mechanism, undercarriage and
chassis.
      7.   Storage area: Each such dwelling unit  shall  contain a storage area
equal to ten percent (10%) of the square footage of the dwelling or one hundred
(100) square feet, whichever shall be less. This storage area shall consist of
a basement , attic or attached garage , or in a separate detached accessory
structure  that complies with the standards of this Section regarding accessory
buildings and structures. The intent of these standards is to limit the extent
of outdoor storage .
      8.   Roof: The roof shall  have a minimum 4:12 pitch and with a drainage
system that will collect and concentrate the discharge of storm water or snow
away from the sides of the dwelling. The roof shall have wood shake, asphalt,

a minimum of twenty (20) feet and comply in all respects with the City Building
Code (BOCA).
      11.   Building Mass: In-fill housing development  shall  consider the
gross floor area and lot coverage  of surrounding homes to ensure
compatibility. The gross floor area and lot coverage  of the proposed dwelling
shall be at least ninety percent (90%) and no more than one hundred and thirty-
five percent (135%) of the average square footage of constructed single family
dwellings within five hundred (500) feet of the subject dwelling unit , with
measurements made from the edge of the street .
      12.   Front Yard Setback: In-fill housing development  shall  maintain a
consistent front building line  along the street . The front yard  setback  of
the proposed dwelling shall be no less than ninety percent (90%) and no more
than one hundred and thirty-five percent (135%) of the average established
front yard  setback  of other single family  dwelling unit  within five hundred
(500) feet of the subject dwelling unit , with measurements from the edge of
the street .
      13.   Architectural Compatibility: Building appearance for all new single
family  dwelling unit  construction shall  be aesthetically compatible in
design and appearance with other residences in similar zoning districts in the
surrounding area. For new single family  neighborhood development  (in the form
of a new subdivision plat  or new site condominium project ), the surrounding
area is defined as the nearest existing neighborhoods with similar densities.
For in-fill housing development  where there is one or a few isolated sites
being developed within the existing neighborhood (in the form of an existing
lot of record  or recent land  division), surrounding area shall be defined as
within five hundred (500) feet of the subject dwelling unit ; with measurements
made from the edge of the lot in each direction, including the opposite side of
the street . The determination shall be made by the Building and Zoning
Administrator  and in considering similarity and compatibility with the
surrounding area, the following features must be considered in order to meet
this requirement. If the Building and Zoning Administrator  cannot reach a
determination on architectural compatibility, the applicant shall be forwarded
to the Planning Commission  for review and final action.
         a)   Exterior building material used on the proposed dwelling
         b)   Roof style
         c)   The design and position of
         d)   Front entry design (presence of porches, front door location,

   f.   Sewage disposal and water supply: Each such dwelling unit  shall  be
connected to a public sewer and water supply.
   g.   Exceptions: The foregoing standards shall not apply to a mobile home
located in a licensed mobile home park  except to the extent required by state
or federal law  or otherwise specifically required in this ordinance and
pertaining to such parks. Single family  homes which do not conform to the
standards of this section shall not be used for dwelling purposes within the
City unless located within a mobile home park  or a mobile home  subdivision

SECTION 309   DETERMINATION OF “SIMILAR USES”.
In recognition that every potential use cannot be addressed in this Zoning
Ordinance, each district includes the phrase “Uses of the same nature or class
as uses listed in this district as either a Principal Use Permitted or a
Special Land Use, but not listed elsewhere in this Zoning Ordinance, as
determined by the Planning Commission based on the standards of Section 309” at
the end of the list of Special Land Use s. The Planning Commission  shall  make
a determination of “Uses of the same nature and class...” according to the
following:
   a.   A finding the proposed use is not listed as a principal use permitted
or Special Land Use in any zoning district .
   b.   If the use is not addressed in the Zoning Ordinance, the Planning
Commission  shall select the use listed in the Zoning Ordinance which most
closely resembles the proposed use using criteria such as potential impact on
property values, traffic generated, aesthetics, noise, vibration, dust, smoke,
odor, glare and other objectionable impacts terms of health, safety and welfare
in the City. The Planning Commission  may determine that there is no similar
use and that the use should be prohibited (see
Section 310).
   c.   Once a similar use is determined, the proposed use shall comply with
any special conditions or Special Land Use Standard that apply to the similar
use.
   d.   The Planning Commission or applicant shall have the option to request
that the City Council consider an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance to
specifically address the use in question, rather than treating the proposed use
as a similar use.
   e.   The determination as to whether a proposed use is similar in nature and
class to other Principal Use Permitted or Special Land Use s within a district
should be considered as an expansion of the use regulations, not a variance
applying to a particular situation. Any use determined by the Planning
Commission to be a “use of the same nature or class as uses listed” shall
thereafter be included in the enumeration of the uses.
The Planning Commission determination of a “Similar Use” may be appealed to the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
SECTION 310   PROHIBITED USES.
Basis: Certain uses may  not be appropriate within the City of Grand Blanc
given the existing development  pattern, environmental condition and overall
character of the community. In accordance with the City or Village Zoning Act ,
a Zoning Ordinance or zoning decision can totally prohibit the establishment of
a requested land  use  within a City if there is not an appropriate location
within the community or the use is unlawful, even if there is a demonstrated
need for that land  use either in the City or surrounding area. In determining
there is no appropriate location for the requested use within the City, the
Planning Commission  shall  consider the following:
   a.   The land area required by the proposed use .
   b.   Existing environmental conditions and potential environmental hazards.
   c.   The potential impact on surrounding properties in terms of traffic,
noise, lighting, property valuation and views.
   d.   Demand and capacity of utilities and municipal services to support the
proposed use .
(Amended 2-14-1996)
   e.   Finding there is an alternative land  use for the property that will
provide the property  owner with a reasonable rate of return on investment.
The Planning Commission determination of a “Prohibited Use” may be appealed to
the Board of Zoning Appeals.
SECTION 311   ESSENTIAL PUBLIC SERVICES.
   a.   Essential services buildings and structures shall be permitted as
authorized under any franchise in effect within the City, subject to regulation

portion thereof, may  be erected  on a retaining wall, berm , or similar
feature provided the combined height of the retaining wall, berm , or such
feature and fence  shall not exceed the total allowable fence  height as
referenced under e. above, or as noted in the following paragraph.
   The Building and Zoning Administrator  may allow placement of a retaining
wall and fence , which, when combined, exceed the total allowable fence height
as referenced above. Said approval may occur when the Building and Zoning
Administrator determines that additional height is necessary to permit the
placement of a retaining wall of sufficient height to stabilize a natural bank
against which the retaining wall will be positioned. In granting said approval,
the Building and Zoning Administrator  shall determine that the additional
height is needed for said stabilization, as opposed to erecting an extended
base for purposes of gaining fence height. The combined height of the fence and
any portion of the retaining wall above the finished grade of the principal
structure shall not exceed the maximum fence height standards.
   o.   Fence placed on properties with significant grade change: Where the
finished grade  at the fence  line is two (2) or more feet above or below the
finished grade  line of the abutting lot or building the Building and Zoning
Administrator  may  allow the fence  to be increased in height up to a maximum
of nine (9) feet to ensure the intended screening and security benefits are
provided in a manner similar to a six (6) foot fence  located on a property
without significant topographic differences. The Building and Zoning
Administrator  may  require landscaping  or specific materials to mitigate the
aesthetic impacts of a taller fence .

and such other data as may from time to time be required by the Building and
Zoning Administrator . Such certificate may be issued in appropriate cases upon
the filing with the application of a Performance or Surety Bond in an amount as
established by the Building and Zoning Administrator sufficient to rehabilitate
the property upon default of the operator or such other reasonable expenses.
The form of the bond shall be approved by the City Attorney. This regulation
does not apply to normal soil removal for basement or foundation work when a
building permit has previously been duly issued by the Building Department.
SECTION 321   MINIMUM FRONTAGE ON PUBLIC STREET.
No lot shall be used for any purpose permitted by this Ordinance unless said
lot has at least sixty (60) feet abutting a public street or otherwise provided
in this Ordinance. This shall not preclude use of existing lots of record which
have a frontage of less than sixty (60) feet unless nonconforming lots are
contiguous and under the same ownership in which case the lots shall be
combined. The intent of this Section is to ensure no new lots with less than
sixty (60) feet of frontage are created and that conformance be required where
reasonable.
SECTION 322   CALCULATION OF (BUILDABLE) LOT AREA.
In the calculation of areas required to maintain specific densities, open space
requirements and similar needs, no lot or parcel or portion of same shall be
used more than once in such calculation, nor shall adjacent outlots or other
open space be used in lieu of space contained within the stated boundaries of
the subject lot or parcel . In calculating density for residential
developments, fifty percent (50%) of state or federally regulated wetlands area
shall be included in computing gross density (e.g. 100 acres of wetland equals
fifty (50) acres for computing maximum density ). Lakes, ponds, overhead
utility easements, public street right-of-ways and private road easements are
excluded from area calculations for buildable lot area .
SECTION 323   EXTERIOR LIGHTING.
   a.   Shielding: Only non-glare, color corrected lighting shall  be
permitted. All outdoor lighting shall be shielded to reduce glare and shall be
arranged to reflect light away from all adjacent residential districts. The
lighting source shall not be visible from adjoining properties.
   b.   Intensity: In parking lots, lighting shall  average one (1) foot candle
measured at the surface. No lighting may  extend beyond the property  line. A
lower intensity may  be required by the Planning Commission  where the adjacent
zoning district  is residential. The Building and Zoning Administrator  may
require a photometric plan (lighting grid) to determine the appropriateness of
proposed lighting layout and intensity.
   c.   Height of fixtures: The maximum height of light fixtures in parking
lots shall  be thirty (30) feet, measured from the parking lot surface to the
centerline of the lighting source. The Planning Commission  may  modify that
height standard in commercial and industrial districts based on consideration
of the type of fixture, the height of surrounding buildings, existence of
landscaping , the potential off-site impacts and the general character of the
surrounding uses. In no case shall the height of the lighting fixture exceed
the maximum height permitted for principal buildings in the zoning district .
   d.   Fixtures: Cut-off shoe box type fixtures shall  be required in any
parking lot adjacent to a residential district . Lighting fixtures shall be
mounted on milled steel or planed wooden poles. Lighting fixtures shall not be
attached to utility poles.
   e.   Building illumination: All lighting in non-residential districts or for
non-residential uses used for the external illumination shall  be placed and
shielded to prevent interference with the vision of motorists or nearby
residents.
   f.   Plan requirements: Parking lot and building lighting illumination shall
be illustrated and described on the site plan , including details showing the
type of fixture, height of poles and any proposed illumination of buildings,
signs or landscaping . Illumination of signs or buildings shall be directed to
prevent interference with motorists.
   g.   Wiring: No wiring shall  be exposed.
   h.   Restrictions: All illumination of signs and any outdoor feature shall
not be of a flashing, moving or intermittent type. Illumination of any outdoor
feature shall  be directed or shaded to not interfere with vision of motorists
or to adjacent property . Artificial light shall be maintained stationery and
constant in intensity and color.
SECTION 324   ENTRANCE FEATURES.
In all districts, so called entranceway structures including but not limited
to: walls, columns, and gates marking entrances to single-family subdivisions
or multiple housing projects, office complexes, shopping centers and industrial
parks may be permitted and may be located in a required yard , but not within a
public street  right-of-way , provided such entranceway structures do not
conflict with required sight distance. (See Section 330.)
SECTION 325   BUILDING GRADES.
   a.   Any building requiring yard space shall be located at such an elevation
that a sloping grade shall be maintained to cause the flow of water to run away
from the walls of the structures thereon. The balance of yard spaces shall be
graded and adequate drainage provided where necessary to deflect proper
drainage of surface waters from the said premises .
   b.   When a new building is constructed on a vacant lot between two existing
buildings or adjacent to an existing building, the existing established grade
 shall be used in determining the grade around the new building and the yard
around the new building shall be graded in such a manner as to meet existing
grades.
   c.   The final grade  shall be approved by the Building and Zoning
Administrator .
SECTION 326   EXCAVATION OR HOLES.
The construction, maintenance or existence within the City of any unprotected,
unbarricaded, open or dangerous excavations, holes, pits or wells, or any
excavations, holes or pits which constitute or are reasonably likely to
constitute a danger or menace to public health, safety or welfare, is hereby
prohibited; provided; however, this section shall not prevent any excavation
under a permit issued pursuant to this Ordinance or the City Building Code.
Where such excavations are properly protected and warning signs posted in such
a manner as may be required by the Building and Zoning Administrator .
SECTION 327   BUILDINGS TO BE MOVED.
Any building or structure which has been wholly or partially erected on any
premises within or outside the City of Grand Blanc shall not be moved to and/or
placed upon any premises in the City unless a building permit for such a
building or structure shall have been secured. Any such building or structure
 shall fully conform to all the provisions of this Ordinance in the same manner
as a new building or structure .
SECTION 328   REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPACT ASSESSMENT (see Section 2407).
For certain land uses that are considered to have a significant potential
impact on traffic, infrastructure, demands for public services and/or
significant impacts on surrounding properties due to scale, the applicant shall
be required to provide an impact assessment during the initial submittal for
either a rezoning or site plan approval. The cost of the impact assessment and
review by the City shall be borne by the applicant. The applicant may request a
meeting with City staff, consultants and key agency staff prior to developing
the Impact Assessment.
   The minimum contents of this impact assessment shall be:
   a.   Name(s) and address(es) of person (s) or firm(s) responsible for
preparation of the impact assessment and a brief statement of their
qualifications.
   b.   An area plan or aerial photograph illustrating the entire site and
nearby properties.
   c.   Overall site conditions: narrative and illustration describing adjacent
uses, zoning, public roadways, utilities, significant woodlands, trees over
eight inches (8”) caliper , soils types, 100 year floodplains, drainage ways
and general topography. The area described shall  be within one-quarter mile
for sites up to one hundred (100) acres, and one (1) mile radius for larger
sites. Aerial photographs are recommended to assist in describing the general
vicinity.
   d.   Wetlands: Documentation by a qualified wetland specialist shall  be
required wherever the City determines there is a potential state  or federally
regulated wetland which may  be impacted by the proposed project.
   e.   Conceptual site plan  illustrating very general layout of proposed uses
upon which preliminary impact analysis is based, and any proposed phasing.
   f.   Land use impacts: Description of the types of proposed uses and other
man made facilities, including any project phasing, and an indication of how
the proposed use (s) conforms or conflicts with existing and Master Planned
development  patterns. A description shall  be provided of any increases in
light, noise or air pollution which could negatively impact adjacent
properties, particularly associated with smoke or truck routing.
   g.   Environmental impacts: Description of any general impacts expected to
wildlife areas, lakes, streams, ponds and regulated wetlands. Conceptual
mitigation or replacement measures under consideration shall  be described. The
study shall also describe general measures to control soil erosion and
sedimentation during and after construction.
   h.   Impact on public facilities and services: Describe the number  of
expected employees, visitors or residents and the anticipated impact on police
and fire protection. In particular, describe the relationship of the use  to
municipal fire stations and the need for any new facilities or equipment.
Letters from the appropriate agencies should be provided.
   i.   Utility impacts: Describe proposed water and sanitary sewer facilities,
including any improvements or off-site extensions needed to serve the long
range development  on the site. For sites served with sanitary sewer and public

(Amended 2-14-1996)
   j.   Drainage: Describe conceptual plans to control drainage and any
significant changes from existing drainage patterns. If wetlands are to be used
as stormwater basins, methods to control fertilizers and filter runoff shall
be identified. Correspondence from the Genesee County Drain Commissioner shall
be attached indicating their concerns and suggestions.
   k.   Storage and handling of waste and hazardous materials: Methods of on-
and off-site disposal of solid waste shall  be identified. The information
shall describe the type of hazardous substances expected to be used, stored or
disposed of on the site; general location within the site; and method of
containment. Documentation of compliance with federal and state  requirements,
and a Pollution Incident Prevention Plan (PIPP) shall be submitted, as
appropriate.
   l.   Traffic impacts: A traffic study in accordance with
Section 329 below shall  be included in the Impact Assessment unless determined
to not be necessary by the Building and Zoning Administrator , because the use
will generate less than five hundred (500) one-way vehicle trips daily or less
than fifty (50) peak hour directional trips.
SECTION 329   MINIMUM CONTENTS OF TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY.
Where a traffic impact study is required or requested by the Planning
Commission or City Council , including when a component in an overall Impact
Study, the applicant shall bear the cost for preparation and evaluation of a
study prepared by a traffic engineer with experience preparing traffic impact
studies in Michigan during the preceding three (3) years to address the
following:
   a.   Existing conditions including existing daily and peak hour traffic on
adjacent street (s), a description of any sight distance limitations along the
site’s right-of-way frontage and accident histories within five hundred (500)
feet of the site and for any intersection which will experience a traffic
volume increase of at least five percent (5%) during the day or during a peak
hour due to the proposed project.
Where existing traffic counts are more than two (2) years old, new counts
should be taken. Traffic counts shall be taken on a Tuesday, Wednesday or
Thursday of non-holiday weeks. Additional counts (i.e. on a Saturday for a
proposed commercial development ) may also be required in some cases. The
following times/situations should also be avoided where possible so that the
traffic count data would represent a typical day: construction detours in the
area, summer days for a site near a school, etc. The firm performing the impact
study must make every effort to complete traffic counts during average or
higher than average volume conditions (i.e. regarding weather or seasonal
variations) for the area under study.
   b.   Forecasted trip generation of the proposed use for the a.m. and p.m.
peak hour and average daily traffic generated. The forecasts shall be based on
the data and procedures outlined in the most recent edition of the Institute of
Traffic Engineers Trip Generation Manual. The applicant may  use other commonly
accepted sources of data or supplement the standard data with data from similar
projects in Michigan.
   c.   For requests for a zoning change when such request represents a
departure from the land  use proposed in the City Master Plan , the study
should contrast the traffic impacts of typical uses permitted in the requested
zoning district with uses permitted in the current zoning district. The
Planning Commission  shall determine typical uses to be considered.
   d.   Projected traffic generated shall be distributed (inbound v. outbound,
left turn v. right turn) onto the existing street network to project turning
movements at major site access points and nearby intersections or expressway
interchange ramps. Rationale for the distribution shall be provided. If any
streets are proposed for realignment or vacation, the study shall forecast the
changes in traffic conditions along affected streets.
   e.   Capacity analysis at the proposed access points along public streets
using the procedures outlined in the most recent edition of the Highway
Capacity Manual published by the Transportation Research Board. Pre- and post-
construction capacity analyses shall also be performed at all street
intersections or expressway ramps where the expected traffic will comprise at
least five percent (5%) of the existing intersection capacity and/or for
roadway sections and intersections experiencing congestion or a relatively high
accident rate, as determined by the City.
(Amended 2-14-1996)
   f.   The City may require a “gap study” to analyze the frequency and
duration of gaps in the flow of through traffic to accommodate turning
movements.
   g.   Analysis of any mitigation measures warranted by the anticipated
traffic impacts. Where appropriate, documentation shall be provided from the
appropriate road agency regarding time schedule for improvements and method of
funding.
   h.   A map and description of the location and design of proposed access
(driveway or new street intersection), including any sight distance
limitations, dimensions from adjacent driveways and intersections within two
hundred fifty (250) feet, other data to demonstrate that the design and number
of driveways proposed is the fewest necessary, and the driveway(s) will provide
safe and efficient traffic operation and be in accordance with the standards of
this ordinance.
   i.   An analysis of the potential need for bypass lanes or deceleration
tapers/lanes, including attachment of any correspondence by the Genesee County
Road Commission or the Michigan Department of Transportation, as appropriate.
   j.   Resume and qualification of the preparer.
SECTION 330   CLEAR VISION ZONE.
There shall be a clear vision zone at all corners of intersecting streets and/
or private roads, consisting of a triangular area defined by the point of
intersection of the right-of-way lines and the two points extended along such
lines a distance of twenty-five (25) feet from the point of intersection, and
within which area no obstruction to vision, excluding existing topography,
shall be permitted from a height of two (2) feet to eight (8) feet above
centerline elevation of abutting streets, except not more than two (2) trees
with trunks of not more than thirty (30) inches in diameter each, and clear of
any branches for such heights may be located within such area. A greater clear
vision area may be reviewed where necessary in view of anticipated traffic
volumes, traffic speeds, geographic or topographic conditions or based on a
traffic engineering analysis using the standards of the American Association of
State and Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO).
SECTION 331   ACCESS THROUGH YARDS.
For the purpose of this Ordinance, access drives may be placed in the required
front or side yards so as to provide access to rear yards or accessory or
attached structures. These drives shall not be considered as structural
violations in front and side yards . Further, any walk, terrace or other
pavement servicing a like function, and not in excess of nine (9) inches above
the grade upon which placed, shall for the purpose of this Ordinance not be
considered to be a structure , and shall be permitted in any required yard .
SECTION 332   TEMPORARY USES AND SEASONAL OR SPECIAL EVENTS SALES (amended 2-
14-1996).
Temporary uses , temporary sales and seasonal or special events may be allowed
in any nonresidential district upon issuance of a permit, when providing the
following submittal information and meeting the standards of this Section.

of required parking based on the standards of
Article XXII, layout and materials for parking areas, proposed traffic
circulation, location of fire hydrants, location and size of any proposed
signs, and any other information deemed to be necessary by the Building and
Zoning Administrator .
      6.   The proprietor of the temporary use or seasonal event shall deposit
a performance guarantee or escrow, in an amount and form acceptable to the
Building and Zoning Administrator , prior to the issuance of a permit. The
performance guarantee shall be used by the City to pay the cost of returning
the property to its state prior to commencement of the event or refunded to the
proprietor upon compliance with the requirements of this and any other
applicable ordinances.
   b.   Standards and Procedures for Review: The review of proposed temporary
uses , temporary sales and seasonal  events shall be by the Building and Zoning
Administrator . The proposed use  or event shall not be approved unless all of
the following standards are met:
      1.   All required information has been submitted.

SECTION 333   MAINTENANCE OF COMMONLY OWNED PRIVATE FACILITIES.
The Planning Commission or City Council , as appropriate, may require documents
suitable to the City Attorney to insure the quality, construction, maintenance
and replacement of commonly owned private facilities and land whether improved
or unimproved. These facilities may include, but are not limited to detention
ponds, retention basins, lighting, open space , wetlands, signs, landscaping ,
fences, screen walls, drains, trails and sidewalks to which more than two
owners of lots or condominiums have rights of use or access or enjoyment; or
which are owned in common by an association of owners. Prior to approving such
commonly owned private facilities, the Planning Commission or City Council
 shall approve legal documents which assure the continuing maintenance, and
periodic replacement of any commonly-owned private facilities.
SECTION 334   REVIEW, CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATION
FACILITIES.
The regulations of this Section are intended to conform with federal laws and
administrative rules that authorize and govern facilities needed to operate
wireless communication systems, but to reasonably regulate the location and
design of such facilities to retain the integrity of neighborhoods and the
character, property values and aesthetic quality of the city. Given the
dramatic increase in the number of wireless communication facilities requested
as a result of the new technology and the Federal Telecommunications Act of
1996, being Pub. Law No. 104-104 (see § 1(a), 110 Stat. 56), it is the policy
of the city that all users should co-locate on Attached Wireless Communication
Facilities and Wireless Communication Support Structures in the interest of
achieving the purposes and intent of this section. In addition, in recognition
of the city’s concern that technological advances may render such visually
obtrusive towers unnecessary in the future, there are requirements to remove
unused or unnecessary facilities in a timely manner.
   a.   Definitions. The following definitions shall  apply in the
interpretation of this Section:
      1.   Wireless Communication Facilities. All structures and accessory
facilities relating to the use  of the radio frequency spectrum for the purpose
of transmitting or receiving radio signals. This may  include, but shall not be
limited to, radio towers, television towers, telephone devices and exchanges,
microwave relay towers, telephone transmission equipment building and
commercial mobile radio service facilities. This definition does not include
“reception antenna” for an individual lot as otherwise defined and regulated in
this zoning ordinance, or governmental facilities subject to state  or federal
law  or regulations which preempt municipal regulatory authority.
      2.   Attached Wireless Communication Facilities. Wireless communication
facilities affixed to existing structures, such as existing buildings, towers,
water tanks, or utility poles.
      3.   Wireless Communication Support Structures. Structures erected  or
modified to support wireless communication antennas. Support structures within
this definition include, but shall not be limited to, monopoles, lattice
towers, light poles, wood poles and guyed towers, or other structures which
appear to be something other than a mere support structure .
      4.   Colocation. Location by two (2) or more wireless communication
providers of wireless communication facilities on a common structure , tower,
or building, to reduce the overall number  of structures required to support
wireless communication antennas within the city.

      1.   Prior to issuing a building permit, a signed certification by a
State of Michigan licensed professional engineer shall be provided to the City
with regard to the manner in which the proposed structure will fall (i.e. “all
zone”), and that the setback area provided shall accommodate the structure
should it fall or break.
      2.   A description of performance guarantee , in a manner acceptable to
the City Attorney, to be posted at the time of receiving a building permit for
the facility to ensure removal of the facility when it has been abandoned or is
no longer needed, as provided in paragraph e below.
      In this regard, the security shall , at the election of the city
attorney, be in the form of: (1) cash; (2) security bond; (3) letter of credit;
or, (4) an agreement in a form approved by the City Attorney and recordable at
the office of the Register of Deeds, establishing a promise of the applicant
and owner of the property to remove the facility in a timely manner as required
under this section of the ordinance, with the further provision that the
applicant and owner shall be responsible for the payment of any costs or
attorneys fees incurred by the city in securing removal.
      3.   A map that illustrates existing and known proposed wireless
communication facilities within the city and township, which are relevant in
terms of potential co-location or to demonstrate the need for the proposed
facility. If and to the extent the information in question is on file with the
city, the applicant shall be required only to update as needed. Any such
information which is trade secret and/or other confidential commercial
information which, if released would result in commercial disadvantage to the
applicant, may be submitted with a request for confidentiality in connection
with the development of governmental policy, M.C.L.A. § 15.243(l)(f). This
ordinance shall serve as the promise to maintain confidentiality to the extent
permitted by law . The request for confidentiality must be prominently stated
in order to bring it to the attention of the community.
      4.   For all new facilities, in recognition of the city’s policy to
promote co-location, a written agreement in a format approved by the City
Attorney, transferable to all assessors and assigns, that the operator shall

engineering, maintenance and other notice purposes. This information shall be
continuously updated during all times the facility is on the premises .
   d.   Design Standards Applicable to All Facilities. In addition to the
Criteria of Site Plan Review listed in
Section 2405, all wireless communication facilities shall  be constructed and
maintained in accordance with the following standards:
      1.   Facilities shall be located and designed to be harmonious with the
surrounding areas. The City encourages unique design of the structure to either
diminish the visual impact or to create an architectural feature that will
contribute to or enhance community character.
      2.   A permit for the construction and use of a new wireless
communication facility shall not be granted until the applicant demonstrates a
feasible co-location is not available for the coverage area and capacity needs.
      3.   All new and modified wireless communication facilities shall be
designed and constructed to accommodate co-location.
      4.   Landscaping  shall be provided to screen the structure base,
accessory buildings and enclosure from adjacent properties and public rights-
of-way.
      5.   Elevations of the accessory buildings shall be provided. All
accessory buildings shall be constructed of brick, provided the City may waive
this requirement a building located in an I-1 or I-2 District that is not
visible from a public right-of-way or nonindustrial zoning district.
      6.   Fencing shall be provided for protection of the support structure
and security from children and other persons who may otherwise access
facilities.
      7.   Any nonconforming situations on the site, such as outdoor storage ,
signs, inadequate landscaping , unpaved parking, lack of a sidewalk , improper
lighting or similar conditions shall be brought into conformance prior to the
erection of the wireless communication facility. If existing buildings or
structures are not in conformance with the current zoning standards,
improvements shall be made to decrease the nonconformity or additional
landscaping shall be provided to reduce the impact of the nonconformity and the
wireless facility.
      8.   The operator shall comply with applicable federal and state
standards relative to the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions.
      9.   The applicant shall demonstrate that the requested height of the new
or modified support structure and antenna shall be the minimum height be
necessary for reasonable communication by the applicant, including additional
height to accommodate future co-location where appropriate.
      10.   Minimum required setbacks for new facility or support structure .
         (a)   From any residential district - the height of the structure ,
provided the engineering information required in c, 1 is provided. The person
or body with authority to approve the facility may decrease this setback to
that provided in (c) below upon a finding that no residential use exists or is
expected on the adjacent site.
         (b)   From any existing or proposed rights-of-way or other publicly
traveled roads or non-motorized improved pathways - half the height of the
structure , plus ten (10) feet, provided the engineering information required
in c, 1 is provided; otherwise the setback  shall be the height of the
facility.
         (c)   From non-residential district - one half the height of the
structure , provided the engineering information required in c, 1 above
demonstrates such setback is adequate.
      11.   Accessory buildings shall be a maximum of fourteen (14) feet high
and shall be setback in accordance with the requirements for principal
buildings in that zoning district .
      12.   There shall be unobstructed access to the support structure , for
operation, maintenance, repair and inspection purposes, which may be provided
through or over an easement . This access shall have a width and location
determined by such factors as: the location of adjacent thoroughfares and
traffic and circulation within the site; utilities needed to service the tower
and any attendant facilities; the location of buildings and parking facilities;
proximity to residential districts and minimizing disturbance to the natural
landscape; and the type of equipment which will need to access the site.
      13.   Where an attached wireless communication facility is proposed on
the roof of a building if the equipment enclosure is proposed as a roof
appliance or penthouse on the building, it shall be designed, constructed and
maintained to be architecturally compatible with the principal building . The
equipment enclosure may be located within the principal building or may be an
accessory building .
      14.   The support system shall be constructed in accordance with all
applicable building codes and shall include the submission of a soils report
from a geotechnical engineer, licensed in the State of Michigan. This soils
report shall include soil borings and statements confirming the suitability of

      15.   The requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration, Federal
Communication Commission, and Michigan Aeronautics Commission shall be noted.
Furthermore, the applicant shall provide the City with evidence of compliance
with the requirements of Bishop International Airport. If approval or
authorization is needed from the Joint Airport Zoning Board or another airport
authority, such approval or authorization shall be provided to the City in
writing prior to consideration of the application submittal.
      16.   A maintenance plan, and any applicable maintenance agreement, shall
be presented and approved as part of the site plan for the proposed facility.
Such plan shall be designed to ensure the long term, continuous maintenance to
a reasonably prudent standard.
      17.   Towers shall be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual
obtrusiveness or be constructed of galvanized steel.
      18.   Towers shall not be lit, unless required by the Federal Aviation
Administration or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the
lighting alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the
surrounding views.
      19.   No signs shall be allowed on an antenna or tower.
   e.   Removal. As a condition of every approval of a wireless communication
facility, adequate provision shall  be made for removal of the facility by
users and owners upon the occurrence of one or more of the following events:
      1.   When the facility has not been used for one hundred eighty (180)
days or more. For purposes of this section, the removal of antennas or other
equipment from the facility, or the cessation of operations (transmission and/
or reception of radio signals) shall be considered as the beginning of a period
of nonuse.
      2.   The situations in which removal of a facility is required, as set
forth in paragraph (1) above, may be applied and limited to portions of a
facility.
      3.   Upon the occurrence of one or more of the events requiring removal,
specified in paragraph (1) above, the property  owner or persons who had used
the facility shall immediately apply or secure the application for any required
demolition or removal permits, and immediately proceed with and complete the
demolition/removal, restoring the premises to an acceptable condition as
reasonably determined by the Building and Zoning Administrator .
      4.   If the required removal of a facility or a portion thereof has not
been lawfully completed within sixty (60) days of the applicable deadline, and
after at least thirty (30) days written notice, the City may remove or secure
the removal of the facility or required portions thereof, with its actual cost
and reasonable administrative charge to be drawn or collected and/or enforced
from or under the security posted at the time application was made for
establishing the facility.
   f.   Nonconforming facilities and penalties for not permitting collocation.
If a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication facility
shall  fail or refuse to alter a structure  to accommodate a proposed and
otherwise feasible co-location, such facility shall thereupon and thereafter be
deemed to be a nonconforming structure  and use , and shall not be altered,
expanded or extended in any respect. In addition, if a party refuses to allow
co-location in accordance with the intent of this Section, and this action
results in construction of a new tower, the city may  refuse to approve a new
wireless communication support structure  from that party for a period of up to
five (5) years. Such a party may  seek and obtain a variance  from the Zoning
Board of Appeals  if and to the limited extent the applicant demonstrates
entitlement to variance  relief which, in this context, shall mean a
demonstration that enforcement of the five (5) year prohibition would
unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent wireless
communication services, or that such enforcement would have the effect of
prohibiting the provision of personal wireless communication services.
   g.   Variances. The Zoning Board of Appeals  may  consider a variance  from
the standards of this Section, based upon a finding that one or more of the
following factors exist:
      1.   Location. The applicant has demonstrated that a location within a
district  in accordance with the standards of this Section can not reasonably
meet the coverage or capacity needs of the applicant.
      2.   No Co-location. The applicant has demonstrated that a feasible co-
location is not available for the coverage area and capacity needs because
existing structures can not support the facility, that co-location would result
in unreasonable interference, or that reasonable financial terms are not
available for co-location.
      3.   Tower Setback. The applicant has provided engineering information
documenting that the tower is self-collapsing and that the setback  area
provided shall  accommodate the structure  should it fall or break and provide
a reasonable buffer in the event the structure  fails.
      4.   Height. The height requested is due to signal interference due to
topography, tall buildings, masses of trees, or other obstructions, or would
reduce the number  of towers to the benefit of the City.
      5.   Mitigation. The applicant has proposed means to mitigate any
negative impacts through provision for future co-location, if found to be
appropriate by the City, and special design of the facility and site.
      6.   Design. The wireless communication and accessory facilities shall
be designed to be compatible with the existing character of the proposed site,
neighborhood and general area such as a steeple, bell tower, or similar form.

twenty-one (21) days. A given property  shall be allowed use of not more than
two (2) such containers in any given calendar  year.
   d.   Approval: Use of such containers shall  require approval from the
Building and Zoning Official (or his/her designee) prior to delivery of such
container to the subject property .
   e.   Maintenance: Such containers shall  be used and maintained in a manner
that does not disturb the public health, safety or welfare.
   f.   Exceptions/Modifications: Use of such containers for a period of no
more than forty-eight (48) hours shall not require City approval. Furthermore,
use  of such containers for a period exceeding that allowed above may  be
granted by the Planning Commission . The Commission may require safeguards
including, but not limited to, setbacks, screening and off-street parking  in
order to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
   g.   Violations: Non-compliance with any of the above regulations shall  be
considered violation of the City Zoning Ordinance Section 1101 Permitted Uses.
(Amended Ordinance 1411-02, passed 12-10-2014)

shall be subject to the same regulations as the building in terms of height
and setbacks . Solar panels may be attached to the roof or a building wall, but
not both.
      1.   Roof-mounted panels shall include solar panels integrated as the
surface layer of the roof structure with no additional apparent change in
relief or projection (the preferred installation), or separate flush-mounted
solar panels attached to the roof surface.
         (a)   Solar panels integrated as the surface layer of the roof
structure, as well as separate flush-mounted solar panels may be located on any
part of the roof.
         (b)   Separate flush-mounted solar panels shall be parallel with the
roofline, and shall not project more than 12 inches above the roof.
         (c)   Separate flush-mounted solar panels installed on a building or
structure with a sloped roof surface shall not project vertically above the
peak of the roof to which it is attached.
         (d)   Solar panels mounted on a flat roof shall not be subject to the
standards of paragraph (b) above. However, they shall not project vertically
higher than the height of the parapet wall surrounding the roof or shall be
screened by an architectural feature.
      2.   Flush-mounted solar panels on the building wall may only be attached
to one side or rear building facade and shall not face a street.
   b.   Glare. Solar panels shall be placed and arranged such that reflected
solar radiation or glare shall not be directed onto adjacent buildings,
properties  or roadways.
   c.   Building permit. Solar energy systems shall conform to applicable
industry standards. A building permit shall be obtained in accordance with the
Building and Electrical Codes.

Park s which are characterized by a relatively high density , transient
structures which are replaced periodically and dwelling units which are
permitted by State  law to exist without conforming to local codes and
ordinances applicable to all other dwelling units. Because the Mobile Home Park
further possesses site characteristics similar to multiple-family residential
development and because they typically develop with private streets and utility
systems, thereby creating an interruption in the continuity of the local
streets and utility systems, they are not compatible when located in an
otherwise single-family area. Therefore, in this Ordinance, Mobile Home Park s
are intended to be located so as to provide a transition of use between
extensive nonresidential districts, i.e. I-1 Light Industrial and I-2 General
Industrial and Multiple-Family Residential Districts.
SECTION 701   PRINCIPAL PERMITTED USES.

Sec. 1001   Permitted and Special Land Uses
Sec. 1002   Required Conditions
Sec. 1003   Additional Site Development Standards
SECTION 1000   INTENT.
The intent of the Central Business District (CBD) is to retain and create a
vibrant, attractive and cohesive center for the Grand Blanc community with a
variety of quality places to work, live shop, learn, recreate and be
entertained. This district is intended to recognize and support the Grand Blanc
central business district as both the prime retail center in the city and the
centerpiece of the greater Grand Blanc community.
These special regulations are intended to assist with the implementation of
goals and objectives contained in the Grand Blanc Downtown Strategic Vision
Plan. Among those goals are to eliminate single use zoning and promote
development of a compact, walkable, mixed-use district , consisting of a
variety of retail, entertainment, office , service, residential, cultural,
recreation and municipal uses. To provide for the desired traditional downtown
environment and accommodate the wide variety of permitted uses, this district
includes specific design standards for site layout, setback continuity,
building design, pedestrian amenities, parking arrangement, vehicular
circulation and coordination of site features between adjoining sites. One
intent of this district is that buildings be placed close to the street , with
parking in the side, or preferably, rear yard . Permitted uses shall be
designed and arranged to minimize any adverse impact on street capacity or
public services, and contribute to the overall image and function of the
district . A mixture of uses within a building, such as retail on the ground
floor and office on upper floors is permitted. It is the further intent of this
district to prohibit automotive related services and non-retail uses which tend
to disrupt the continuity of the retail frontage, as well as certain uses that
have been deemed contrary to this section. Such prohibited uses include adult
regulated uses and establishments that primarily sell tobacco and vape
products.
(Amended 2-14-1996; Ord. 2412-02, passed 1-8-2025)

satisfied by public parking. This may include on-street parking that is located
along the lot’s frontage and public off-street parking lot s that are located
within five hundred (500) feet of the site.
      4.   The parking requirement may be reduced by up to fifty percent (50%)
where the applicant can demonstrate, based on supporting documentation provided

required by this Ordinance or valet service to a satellite parking lot will be
provided.
      5.   Total parking requirements shall not be reduced by more than fifty
percent (50%) even where a site satisfies more than one (1) of the above
criteria.
   i.   Architectural standards: All new buildings, additions and significant
exterior changes or renovations shall  be found to be architecturally
compatible with the intent of the Central Business District. In making such a
determination, the following will be considered:

all building facades visible from the public street , parking lot or adjacent
residentially zoned land , exclusive of window areas, shall consist of the
following: brick, cut stone, field stone, cast stone or dimensional wood with
an opaque stain. Exterior Insulation and Finishing Systems (EIFS) materials
shall not be the primary building material. The remaining maximum twenty (20)
percent of the facade  may utilize other materials for architectural detailing
such as fiberglass reinforced concrete, polymer plastic (fypon) or EIFS. The
Planning Commission  may permit other materials for facades not visible from a
public street that are adequately screened from adjoining land uses.
      2.   Roof design shall be consistent with the overall architecture of the
building. Single story buildings shall be designed with pitched roofs or a
decorative cornice or parapet at least forty-two (42) inches high to screen
roof-top mechanical equipment. Such buildings shall provide a height of not
less than twenty-four (24) feet to the eave line for a pitched roof or to the
top line of the cornice or parapet for a flat roof.

      3.   Blank walls shall not face a public street . Walls facing a public
street  shall include windows and architectural features customarily found on
the front facade of a building, such as awnings, cornice work, edge detailing

the front building line .
      6.   Sites shall be designed at a pedestrian scale with relationship to
the street and sidewalk . Convenient and safe pedestrian access shall be
provided between the public sidewalk and the building entrance. Bicycle racks

side or rear of the building.
      8.   Building height may be increased to a maximum of fifty (50) feet for
a mixed use building with retail in the first floor and office and/or
residential use on the floors above the first floor. Parking structures
incorporated into the design of a mixed use building may also warrant the
aforementioned increase in building height .
(Amended 8-9-2006)
      9.   Building design, facades and materials shall be consistent with any
architectural guidelines published by the City or adopted by the Planning
Commission .
   j.   For buildings proposed for expansion or renovation that existed prior

Sec. 1802   Definitions
Sec. 1803   Eligibility
Sec. 1804   Submittal and Approval Process
Sec. 1805   Mixed Use Design and Review Standards
Sec. 1806   Open Space /Residential Design and Review Standards
Sec. 1807   Appeals, Violations, Variances and Expiration
SECTION 1801   INTENT.
The intent of the Planned Unit Development District, PUD, is to permit
flexibility in the regulations for development which either includes a mix of
land uses or is proposed for a site containing unique natural features which
the developer and City desire to preserve. The standards of this section are
intended to encourage innovative design and create opportunities which may not
be obtainable through the conventional standards of other articles of this
Zoning Ordinance.
The PUD standards are not intended to be used as a technique to circumvent the
intent of the Zoning Ordinance, to avoid imposition of specific Zoning
Ordinance standards, or the planning upon which it is based, unless there is a
clear public benefit consistent with the overall intent of the Zoning
Ordinance. Thus, the provisions of this section are designed to promote land
 use substantially consistent with the character of the surrounding area and
the City’s Master Plan , with modifications and departures from generally
applicable requirements made to provide the developer with flexibility in
design on the basis of the total PUD plan approved by the City.
SECTION 1802   DEFINITIONS.
Mixed Use PUD: A Mixed Use PUD is a unified development  project, comprised of
a variety of complimentary uses, located on a specific parcel  of land  or
several contiguous parcels of land , for which a comprehensive development
plan meeting the requirements of this Article is approved by the City Council .
Open Space/Residential PUD: An Open Space/Residential PUD is a residential
development  in which dwelling units are placed in a more compact arrangement
than is typical of a conventional subdivision, to preserve natural features
and provide open space /recreation areas.
SECTION 1803   ELIGIBILITY.
Planned unit developments may be allowed upon determination by the City Council
, following a recommendation by the Planning Commission , that the site and
proposed project meet the following eligibility criteria:
   a.   The subject site shall be a minimum size of five (5) acres of
contiguous land ; provided, the minimum site area may be waived by the Planning
Commission for previously developed sites that are proposed to be redeveloped
with a mixed-use PUD, or for PUD sites that will be an infill development
utilizing innovative design to achieve compatibility with surrounding land
uses.
   b.   The subject site shall be under the control of one owner or group of
owners operating collectively, and shall be capable of being planned and
developed as one integral unit. An approved PUD plan runs with the land , not
with the owner . If the land is sold or otherwise exchanged, the approved PUD
plan shall remain in effect unless the applicant submits a request to amend or
terminate the PUD plan.
   c.   The site shall have frontage along, and direct access to a street (s)
capable of accommodating anticipated traffic volumes. Any project over five
acres shall have direct access to a Major Street (per the Act 51 Map made
pursuant to Public Act 51 of 1951, State Trunk Line Highway System, being
M.C.L.A. §§ 247.651 et seq.) or an arterial or collector road as identified in
the City’s Master Plan .
   d.   The site contains significant natural or historic features which will
be preserved to a greater extent through development under the PUD standards
than if the site was developed under conventional zoning, or the PUD will
provide a complementary mixture of uses or housing types within a unique, high
quality design as determined by the Planning Commission .
   e.   The planned unit development offers higher design quality and/or
provides amenities that will result in a recognizable and substantial benefit
to the ultimate users of the project and to the City, where such benefit would
otherwise be unfeasible or unlikely to be achieved through conventional zoning.
These benefits shall be demonstrated in terms of preservation of natural
features , unique architecture, extensive landscaping , special sensitivity to
adjacent land uses, particularly well designed access and circulation systems,
integration of various site features into a unified development and/or
contribution to infrastructure and facility improvements to help offset the
impacts of the PUD project.
   f.   A finding that the proposed type and density of use shall not result in
an unreasonable increase in traffic or the use of public services, facilities
and utilities compared to permitted uses under conventional zoning.
   g.   The proposed development  shall be consistent with the City Master Plan
.
SECTION 1804   SUBMITTAL AND APPROVAL PROCESS.
A PUD may be designated by the City or may be requested by the applicant. If
the City initiated the PUD, and the site is already designated PUD on the City
Zoning Map, the applicant is still responsible for the submission of a PUD
preliminary plan and materials as described below, however the site shall
already be deemed as meeting the eligibility criteria of

   a.   Eligibility: The proposed Mixed Use PUD meets the eligibility criteria
of
Section 1803.
   b.   Uses Permitted: Any residential, office , commercial, or industrial use
may  be permitted upon a determination by the City that the uses would meet the
intent of this Article, the City’s Master Plan , and is compatible with
surrounding land  uses. Any proposed use  listed as a Special Land Use  in
Article XXI shall  meet the standards listed in
Section 2110.
   c.   Harmony with surrounding uses: The uses and design of the Mixed Use PUD
will be harmonious with the character of the surrounding area in terms of
density , intensity of use , size and height of buildings, architecture and
other impacts.
   d.   Dimensional Standards: The setbacks and other dimensional standards for
various uses shall  generally be consistent with the standards associated with
the most applicable district (s) for the various uses listed in
Article XX  - Schedule of Regulations. Where the proposed design deviates from
the typical standards, the applicant shall provide a table that clearly
compares each requested modification to the Ordinance standard and provides
justification for the modification for approval by the City Council . Unless
variations are specifically requested and approved by the City, the site plan
or subdivision plan shall comply with applicable City standards. In no case
shall the setbacks for buildings adjacent to existing single family  homes be
less than fifty (50) feet.
   e.   Architecture: Buildings shall  provide harmony with adjacent uses in
terms of texture, materials, peaked roof lines, scale and massing. However,
there shall be a variation of front facade  setbacks and architectural style to
avoid repetition along the street  edge. Nonresidential buildings shall utilize
brick as the primary material for all exterior walls that are visible from a
public road or a parking lot.    Other accent materials may  be used where the
materials are durable and compatible with the type of use  and development
proposed in keeping with the character of the city. Roofs shall be pitched with
architectural shingles. Unifying elements, accents, style, color, and materials

 shall  consider the following design elements as appropriate: perimeter
setback  and landscaping ; drainage and utility design; underground
installation of utilities; facilities for pedestrian circulation; internal
roadway design; and the achievement of an integrated development  with respect
to signs, lighting, landscaping  and building materials.
   j.   Design: The site design, site elements and architecture shall  be of
high quality, coordinated and consistent with the City’s design guidelines.
SECTION 1806   OPEN SPACE/RESIDENTIAL DESIGN AND REVIEW STANDARDS.
Any Open Space/Residential PUD shall comply with the following project design
standards:
   a.   Eligibility: The proposed Open Space/Residential PUD meets the
eligibility criteria of
Section 1803.
   b.   Uses Permitted: Only residential uses as listed in Articles
V,
VI, and
VIII are permitted. Attached residential units shall  be permitted only upon a
determination by the City when the following criteria are met.
      1.   Attached unit buildings shall meet the dimensional standards set
forth in
Article XX for either LDMF or HDMF Districts.
      2.   Attached unit buildings shall be arranged and designed to promote
compatibility with adjacent uses.
      3.   Attached unit buildings shall provide a variation in building height
, setbacks, rooflines, window, door openings, materials, and colors.
      4.   The units shall relate well to the streetscape and minimize the
visual dominance of garage doors in the front yard through the provision of
front porches, doors, windows, architectural details that face the street , and
a variation in garage door design and location (e.g. side entry, recessed from
front building line , limited projection beyond front building line ).
      5.   The arrangement of units maximizes the preservation of open space
and the protection of natural features .
      6.   The overall density is no greater than could be achieved through the
underlying zoning. See “d” below.
   c.   Harmony with surrounding uses: The uses and design of the Open Space/
Residential PUD will be harmonious with the character of the surrounding area
in terms of density , intensity of use , size and height of buildings,
architecture and other impacts.
   If the proposed units are to be developed as part of a golf course, the
arrangement of units should not unduly interfere with the operations of the
golf course. The City may require a review by an independent golf course design
professional.
   d.   Density Standards: The permitted density  within an Open Space/
Residential PUD shall not exceed the density  allowed by the underlying
residential zoning district  as described in
Article XX  Schedule of Regulations.
      1.   The maximum number of dwelling units permitted within an Open Space/
Residential PUD project shall be the number of units permitted under a
conventional plan. This shall be demonstrated through the preparation of a
comparison plan that illustrates how many dwelling units could feasibly and
practically be constructed on the subject site in accordance with all
dimensional requirements of the zoning district and design standards for
stormwater and public streets. Portions of a MDEQ regulated wetland shall not
be located within an individual lot. The lots on the comparison plan shall not
require exceptional or unusual engineering to accommodate residential
construction, as determined by the City.
      2.   The area used for density calculations shall not include public
street  rights-of-way , private road access easements, lakes, streams,
detention ponds, or submerged wetlands containing surface water or open water
ponds during at least one (1) month of the year.
   e.   Dimensional Standards: The setbacks and other dimensional standards for
various uses shall  be consistent with the standards associated with the
various uses listed in
Article XX  - Schedule of Regulations. Where the proposed design deviates from
the typical standards, the deviations shall meet the intent of this Article and
the applicant shall provide a table that clearly compares each requested
modification to the Ordinance standard. Unless variations are specifically
requested and approved by the City, the site plan  or subdivision plan shall
comply with applicable City standards. In no case shall the setbacks for
buildings adjacent to existing single family  homes be less than fifty (50)
feet.
   f.   Open Space
      1.   Area included in the open space calculations
         a.   At least twenty (20) percent of the sites gross area or two (2)
acres, whichever is greater, shall be dedicated open space and held in common
ownership.
         b.   The total area of dedicated open space  shall equal or exceed any
reduction in area for minimum lot sizes in the development based on the
parallel plan, except where a density bonus is approved as permitted herein.
         c.   The minimum size of an individual open space area shall be 20,000
square feet with a maximum width to depth ratio of 3:1. This standard is
intended to ensure open space is valuable and usable rather than scattered,
isolated, or remnant lands. The City may waive this standard for clearly
identified pathway corridors between a single row of lots intended to connect
open spaces, if such corridors are determined to be desirable.
         d.   At least 50% of the open space must be usable to the residents
for passive or active recreation, exclusive of permitted water bodies,
stormwater facilities, or other required site plan elements. At least one
active neighborhood park area shall be provided that includes facilities such
as playground equipment, picnic pavilions, soccer fields, ball fields or
similar facilities.
         e.   All natural land , including fairways, associated with golf
courses.
         f.   No more than twenty-five (25) percent of any required open space
 shall include detention ponds, surface water bodies, or wetlands regulated by
the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. Detention ponds that do not
provide a natural appearance and are not incorporated into the overall plan as
an amenity, as determined by the City, shall not be included as required open
space .
         g.   Any building or use accessory to recreation, conservation, or an
entryway may be erected within the dedicated open space , subject to the
approved open space plan. Accessory structures or uses of a significantly
different scale or character than the abutting residential districts shall not
be located near the boundary of the development if it may negatively impact the
residential use of adjacent lands, as determined by the City.
      2.   To be included in the calculations for the minimum open space area,
the following design standards must be met.
         a.   The open spaces shall be organized around the site’s most
important natural features on the site and link existing and planned greenways,
as illustrated on the City Pathways and Parks and Recreation Plans. A
preliminary meeting with City staff, consultants and/or the Planning Commission
to discuss the site analysis, natural feature priorities and development
concepts prior to preparation of plans is encouraged.
         b.   The open space  shall include pathways to link adjacent open
spaces, public parks, bike paths or non-motorized routes.
         c.   In addition to preservation of the most important natural
features , where possible additional open space  shall be located and designed
to achieve the following:
            1.   preserve or create a buffer from adjacent land uses where
appropriate;
            2.   maintain existing natural viewsheds; and
            3.   open space  shall be located within prominent and highly
visible areas of the development , such at the terminus of key views along
roads, at the intersection of arterial or collector streets, at high points or
centrally located within a residential area.
      3.   The following land areas shall not be included in calculations for
required open space :
         a.   the area within any existing or future public street  right-of-
way ;
         b.   the area within private road easements or other easements that
include roads, drives, or overhead utility lines;
         c.   the area located below the ordinary high water mark of an inland
lake, river or stream or any pond with standing water year round;
         d.   the required setback areas around, or minimum spacing between
buildings, except that the setback area around a permitted open space
 accessory building  may be considered open space ;
         e.   parking and loading areas, except those exclusively associated
with a recreation facility or common open space area; and
         f.   any other undeveloped areas not specifically addressed in this
Article, but determined by the Planning Commission to inadequately meet the
intent and standards for open space .
      4.   Protection of Open Space:
         The dedicated open space  shall be set aside by the developer through
an irrevocable conveyance and protected by a Maintenance Agreement, in a form
and manner acceptable to the City. Such conveyance shall assure the open space
will be protected from alteration and all forms of development , except as
shown on an approved site plan or subdivision plat . Said documents shall bind
all successors and future owners in fee title to commitments made as part of
the proposal, but shall allow transfer of ownership and control to a
subdivision or condominium association consisting of residents within the
development , provided notice of such transfer is provided to the City. Such
conveyance shall indicate the allowable use (s) within the dedicated open space
. Upon transfer to a successor of the developer, the open space shall be
maintained by the property owners association or condominium association. The
City may require the inclusion of open space restrictions to prohibit
activities such as the following:
         a.   dumping or storing of any material or refuse;
         b.   activity that may cause risk of soil erosion or threaten plant
material;
         c.   cutting or removal of plant material except for removal of dying
or diseased vegetation;
         d.   use of motorized off-road vehicles;
         e.   cutting, filling or removal of vegetation from wetland areas; and
         f.   use of pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers within or adjacent
to wetlands.
         g.   Infrastructure: The uses and design shall  be consistent with the
available capacity of the existing street  network and utility systems or the
applicant shall upgrade the infrastructure as required to accommodate the Open
Space/Residential PUD.
(Amended 2-14-1996)
         h.   Architecture: Typical elevations shall  be approved by the
planning commission as part of the final site plan  or, alternatively, design
guidelines or a “pattern book” or design code shall be included in the
Development Agreement. Identical or similar single family  buildings or
elevations may  not be repeated more frequently than every sixth house along
the same side of any street . Buildings shall be considered similar if they
have similar door and window configuration, direction of roof pitch, building
mass and building form. Attached unit buildings shall provide a variation in
building height , setbacks, rooflines, window, door openings, materials and
colors. Buildings shall relate well to the streetscape through the provision of
front porches, doors, windows and architectural details that face the street
and assist in minimizing the dominance of garages. For at least 50% of all
units, garages shall be side entry, rear entry or front entry with the garage
recessed a minimum of five (5) feet behind the front building line .
         i.   Additional Considerations: The Planning Commission  and City
Council  shall  consider the following design elements as appropriate:
perimeter setback  and landscaping ; drainage and utility design; underground
installation of utilities; facilities for pedestrian circulation; internal
roadway design; and the achievement of an integrated development  with respect
to signs, lighting, landscaping  and building materials.
SECTION 1807   APPEALS, VIOLATIONS, VARIANCES AND EXPIRATION.
   a.   The Board of Appeals  shall have the authority to hear and decide
appeal requests by property owners for variances from the Zoning Ordinance.
However, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall not have the authority to change
conditions or make interpretations to the PUD site plan or written agreement.
   b.   A violation of the PUD plan or agreement shall be considered a
violation of this Ordinance.
   c.   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not have authority to grant variances
from the approved PUD plan pertaining to uses, perimeter setbacks, perimeter
landscaping or setbacks. Such changes shall require an amendment to the PUD
plan.
   d.   Approval of the PUD rezoning and preliminary site plan by the City
Council  shall confer upon the applicant the right to proceed through the
subsequent planning phase for a period not to exceed two (2) years from date of
approval. If application for final site plan approval is not requested within
this time period, re-submittal of the application shall be required. The City
Council  may extend the period up to an additional two (2) years, if requested
in writing by the applicant prior to the expiration date.

Ord. 1710-01, passed 12-13-2017; Ord. 2412-05, passed 1-8-2025)
1   For property containing easements, floodplain or MDNR regulated wetlands
refer to the description of “lot area” in
Section 322.
2   Minimum lot width is measured at the required front yard setback distance
from right-of-way except corner lots and double frontage lots are considered to
have two front yards. Narrow deep lots shall be avoided. The depth of a lot
generally shall not exceed three (3) times the width as measured at the
building line for platted lots and four (4) times the width for unplatted lots.
3   See Article XXIII for landscaping, screening and buffering standards which
may increase the width of the required setback area.
4   Exceptions to front yard setback: Where fifty (50) percent or more of the
aggregate street frontage between two (2) successive intersecting streets is
occupied by buildings of the type and use permitted in the district before the
effective date of this Ordinance or any amendments thereto, with a front
yard setback less than required by this Ordinance, the minimum front yard for
new buildings shall be the average setback distance of existing buildings
located within two hundred (200) feet on either side of a given lot. However,
the depth of the front yard resulting therefrom shall not be less than one-half
(1/2) of the dimensions specified in the Schedule of Regulations.
5   Exceptions to height requirements: The following kinds of structural
appurtenances may be permitted to exceed the height limitations for authorized
use , upon approval of the Planning Commission.
   a.   Schools, churches and other similar institutional buildings may be
erected to a height not exceeding sixty (60) feet provided the front, side and
rear yards shall not be less than the height of the building abutting on such
yard.
   b.   Chimneys, church spires, cupolas, domes, towers, flag poles,
penthouses, water tanks, radio or television or cellular phone antennae,
monuments may be erected to a height not exceeding sixty (60) feet unless
approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Setbacks for television and cellular
phone antennae shall be equal to half the height of the structure, provided
that applicant demonstrates the design will protect adjacent uses and
structures if the structure collapses.
   c.   Mechanical equipment such as blowers, ventilating fans and air
conditioning units, shall be placed no closer than three (3) feet to any lot
line in commercial districts and no closer than twelve (12) feet to any lot
line in residential districts. Mechanical equipment in industrial districts
shall comply with all yard setbacks.
   d.   Any mechanical equipment located on the roof of any building shall not
exceed a height of ten (10) feet above the surrounding roof surface, and shall
occupy no more than fifteen percent (15%) of the total roof area. When roof-
mounted equipment is located on a building that is adjacent to a residential
use or is in view from the adjacent roadway, appropriate architectural
screening shall be required.
   e.   Structural extensions appropriate to the building design, such as
cornices, shall be limited to five feet above the stated height limit.
6   Where maximum height is described in both height and stories, the maximum
height shall be whichever is less.
7   Where the building is connected to building on an adjoining lot by an
approved fire wall, the required side yard on the common side may be reduced to
zero (0) feet if permitted by the building and fire codes, provided a ten (10)
foot setback shall be provided if the wall includes any windows or similar
openings.
8   The setback may be reduced to not less than twenty-five (25) feet by the
Planning Commission if a wall or landscaped berm is provided to screen loading
areas, and the rear of the building has the same architectural character and
materials as the front and side.
9   All outdoor storage and display areas shall be in the rear yard and shall
be completely screened with an obscuring wall as required in Section 2310. The
Planning Commission may require the wall be up to eight (8) feet high in
consideration of adjacent uses.
10   A greater or lesser distance may be required by the Planning Commission.
If a lesser setback is authorized, a corresponding width reduction to the
requirements of Section 2303 Required Landscaping Along Public Streets shall
also be permitted. The following criteria shall be employed by the Planning
Commission to determine the minimum and maximum setback for a specific site in
the Central Business District:
   (1)   Consistency with existing setbacks within one hundred fifty (150) feet
of the same blockface or area, as appropriate; or
   (2)   Consistency with site limitations and constraints; or
   (3)   For sites bound by vacant lots, consistency with existing or
historical setbacks within the same or opposite blockface or area; or
(Amended 2-14-1996)
   (4)   Avoidance of impacts upon recorded easements, rights-of-way, or sight
distances; or
   (5)   Other site-specific considerations that may warrant an increase or
decrease in setback.
   (6)   Parking shall be located behind the front building line and no closer
than 10 feet to a residential property line.
(Amended 7-14-2010)
SECTION 2000   AVERAGED LOT SIZE OPTION.
The intent of this Section is to permit the subdivider or developer to vary lot
sizes and lot widths to average the minimum size of lot per unit as required in
Article XX - Schedule of Regulations for each Single-Family Residential
District. If this option is selected, the following conditions shall be met:
   a.   In meeting the average minimum lot size, the Subdivision shall be
designed so that no lot has area or width reduced more than ten percent (10%)
than the minimum area or width required in the Schedule of Regulations and
shall not create an increase in the number of lots.
   b.   Each final plat submitted as part of a Preliminary Plat shall average
the minimum required for the district in which it is located. The dimensions
shall be illustrated on the plan or in tabular form.
SECTION 2001   SUBDIVISION OPEN SPACE OPTION.
   a.   Intent: The intent of the Subdivision Open Space Plan is to promote the
following objectives:
      1.   Provide a more desirable living environment by preserving the
natural features such as woodlands, steep topography, water bodies and
wetlands.
      2.   Encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the
development of residential areas.
      3.   Encourage a more efficient, aesthetic and desirable use of open area
while recognizing a reduction in development costs, and allowing the developer
to avoid natural obstacles on the site.
      4.   Encourage the provision of open space within reasonable distance to
lots in the subdivision and to further encourage the development of
recreational facilities, such as pathways which link up to the City’s sidewalk
system.
   b.   Modifications to the standards as outlined in
Article XX - Schedule of Regulations may be made in the R-1, R-2 and R-
3 Single-Family Residential Districts when the following conditions are met:
      1.   Individual lots in the R-1, R-2 and R-3 Single-Family Residential
Districts may be reduced up to twenty percent (20%). In the R-2 Districts, this
reduction may be accomplished in part by reducing lot widths up to five (5)
feet. In the R-1 Districts, this reduction may be accomplished in part by
reducing lot widths up to ten (10) feet. These lot-area reductions shall be
permitted, provided that the dwelling unit  density shall be no greater than if
the land area to be subdivided were developed in the minimum square-foot lot
areas as required for each Single-Family District under
Article XX - Schedule of Regulations. The area remaining through the reduction
of lot sizes shall be retained as permanent open space . The City may require
submission of a “parallel” plan to illustrate that the number of lots provided
under the Open Space option would be feasible with a traditional subdivision
layout (for example, each lot in the parallel plan must have buildable envelope
meeting setback requirements and not including ponds or wetlands regulated by
the MDNR).
      2.   The City may allow up to fifty percent (50%) of the area considered
not to be buildable under traditional subdivision practices (such as MDNR
regulated wetlands, non-regulated wetlands, floodplain, steep slopes, etc.) to
be used in the “parallel” plan for determining density if the City finds that
the project will result in a recognizable benefit to the City and the residents
of the proposed subdivision.
      3.   Rear yards  may be reduced to no less than thirty (30) feet when
such lots border land dedicated for park, recreation and/or open space
purposes, provided the width of the dedicated land shall not be less than one
hundred (100) feet measured at the point at which it abuts the rear yard of the
adjacent lot.
      4.   The area to be dedicated for subdivision open space purposes shall
in no instance be less than four (4) acres, and shall be in a location and
shape approved by the City Council .
      5.   This plan, for reduced lot sizes, shall be permitted only if it is
mutually agreeable to the City and the subdivider or developer.
      6.   This plan, for reduced lot sizes, shall be started within six (6)
months after having received approval of the final plat, and must be completed
in a reasonable time . Failure to start within this period shall void all
previous approval.

SECTION 2100   INTENT.
This Article is intended to regulate uses which may be compatible with uses in
some, but not all, locations within a particular zoning district . Among the
purposes of the Special Land Use standards of this Article are to accomplish
the following:
   a.   Provide a mechanism for public input on decisions involving more

potentially conflicting land uses.
   e.   Provide greater flexibility to integrate land uses within the City.
This Article provides both general standards for all Special Land Uses (
Section 2101) and specific location, site or operational standards for
particular Special Land Uses (
Section 2102). The process for a Special Land Use involves a Public Hearing
with the Planning Commission with final review on the use and site plan by the
City Council . Approval of any Special Land Use requires a Special Land Use
Permit.

   f.   The Special Land Use request and other pertinent information, together
with the recommendation of the Planning Commission , shall be placed on the
agenda of the next City Council meeting. The City Council shall either approve
or reject the request within sixty (60) days, unless an extension has been
agreed upon in writing by both the City Council and the Applicant.
SECTION 2102   GENERAL REVIEW STANDARDS FOR ALL SPECIAL LAND USES.
Prior to approving a Special Land Use application, the Planning Commission and
City Council  shall require the following general standards be satisfied for
the use at the proposed location. In addition to specific standards for
individual Special Land Uses listed in
Section 2110, the Planning Commission and City Council shall require
stipulation to ensure that the following are met:
   a.   The Special Land Use will be consistent with the goals, objectives and
future land use plan described in the Grand Blanc Community Master Plan .
   b.   The Special Land Use will be consistent with the stated Intent of the
zoning district .
   c.   The Special Land Use will be designed, constructed, operated and

   g.   The proposed use  shall be such that the location and height of
buildings or structures, and the location, nature and height of walls, fences,
and landscaping will not interfere with or discourage the appropriate
development and use of adjacent land and buildings or unreasonably affect their
value.
   h.   The proposed use  shall be designed, located, planned, and operated to
protect the public health, safety, and welfare.
SECTION 2103   CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL.
   a.   The City Council  may impose conditions of approval, which will help
ensure the Special Land Use meets the standards of this Ordinance provided that
the conditions:
      1.   protect the health, safety, and welfare of those affected;
      2.   are related to the valid exercise of the police power of the City;
      3.   are necessary to meet the intent and purpose of this Ordinance;
      4.   are related to the standards established in this Ordinance for the
land  use or activity under consideration and are necessary to ensure
compliance with those standards;
      5.   provide adequate protection to existing land uses so the proposed
land  use will not be detrimental or injuries to the surrounding neighborhood.
   b.   Approval of a Special Land Use , including conditions made part of the
approval, is attached to the property described in the application and not to
the owner of such property . A record of conditions imposed shall be made a

Administrator . The conditions shall remain unchanged unless an amendment to
the Special Land Use permit is approved by the City Council .
SECTION 2104   VALIDITY OF PERMIT.
   a.   Building Permit: The Building and Zoning Administrator  or Building
Inspector may  issue a building permit in conformity with the particular
Special Land Use  so approved. In all cases where a particular Special Land Use
has been granted as provided herein, application for a building permit must be
made and received by the City no later than one hundred twenty (120) days
thereafter, or such approval shall  automatically be revoked unless an
extension is granted. The City Council  may grant an extension of the first
approval for good causes shown under such terms and conditions for such a
period of time not to exceed six (6) months.
   b.   Performance Guarantee: The City Council  shall  require a performance
guarantee  to ensure completion of the improvements (excluding the building).
The performance guarantee  may  take the form of a cash deposit, surety bond,
certified check, or an irrevocable bank letter of credit.
   c.   Where actual physical construction of a substantial nature of
structures authorized by a Special Land Use permit has not commenced within one
(1) year of issuance, and a written application for extension of the approval
has not been filed as provided below, the permit shall become null and void and
all rights thereunder shall terminate (note: it is the responsibility of the
applicant to request such an extension).
   d.   Upon written application filed prior to the termination of the one (1)
year period as provided above, the City Council  may authorize a single
extension of the time limit for a further period of not more than one (1) year.
Such extension shall be granted only based on evidence from the applicant that
the development has a reasonable likelihood of commencing construction during
the one (1) year extension period.
   e.   Any approved Special Land Use  shall be deemed a use permitted in the
district in which it is located and is not to be considered a non-conforming
use.
   f.   If a use regulated as a Special Land Use which has not previously
received a Special Land Use permit ceases operations for more than one (1)
year, the Special Land Use permit shall become null and void, and a new Special
Land Use permit shall be required to reopen the use. The time frame shall be
extended to two (2) years for a use which was approved as a Special Land Use
under this Ordinance amendment (i.e. a Special Land Use Permit is on file).
   g.   The Building and Zoning Administrator  shall make periodic
investigations of development authorized by Special Land Use permit to
determine continued compliance with all requirements imposed by the Planning

continuously abide by its terms and conditions. The revocation procedure is as
follows:
   a.   The City Council , through its designated administrators, shall notify
the recipient, in writing, of any violations of City codes or provisions of the
Special Land Use .
   b.   The recipient shall have thirty (30) days to correct all deficiencies
to the satisfaction of the City Council .
   c.   If after thirty (30) days any deficiencies remain, the City Council
 may then revoke the Special Land Use , or if the conditions warrant, allow
additional time.
   d.   A repeat violation may cause immediate revocation of the Special Land
Use .
SECTION 2107   AMENDMENTS TO SPECIAL LAND USE PERMITS.
Any person or agency who has been granted a Special Land Use permit shall
notify the Building and Zoning Administrator of any proposed amendment to the
approved site plan of the Special Land Use permit. The Building and Zoning
Administrator  shall determine whether the proposed amendment constitutes a
minor or major amendment based on the determination standards for all site
plans in accordance with
Article XXIV. A major amendment to a Special Land Use permit shall comply with
the application and review procedures contained in this Article.
SECTION 2108   SPECIAL LAND USE EXPANSIONS.
The expansion, change in activity, reuse or redevelopment of any use requiring
a Special Land Use Permit shall require resubmittal in manner described in this

      5.   Adult Regulated Uses
         a.   Intent: In the development  and execution of these zoning
regulations, it is recognized there are some uses that, because of their very
nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational
characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under
certain circumstances, thereby causing a deleterious effect upon the adjacent
areas. The proximity of adult uses to certain uses considered particularly
susceptible to the negative impacts or the concentration of adult uses tends to
erode the quality of life, adversely affect property  values, disrupt business
investment, encourage residents and businesses to move or avoid the community,
increase crime and contribute a blighting affect on the surrounding area. This
subsection describes the uses regulated and the specific standards needed to
insure that the adverse effects of these uses will not contribute to the
deterioration of the surrounding neighborhood, to prevent undesirable
concentration of these uses and to require sufficient spacing from uses
considered most susceptible to negative impacts.
         b.   Uses Regulated: The following uses are regulated by this
subsection.

of landscaping in place of the wall.
            (6)   Access shall be from an arterial roadway.
         e.   Waivers:
         Upon denial of any application for a regulated use under this
subsection, the applicant may appeal for a waiver of the location provisions
above to the Board of Zoning Appeals consistent with the standards set forth
below. The Board of Zoning Appeals may waive the location provisions set forth

SECTION 2300   INTENT.
The intent of this Article is to establish minimum standards for the design,
installation and maintenance of landscaping along public streets, as buffer
areas between uses, on the interior of a site, within parking lots and adjacent
to buildings. Landscaping is viewed as a critical element contributing to the
aesthetics, development quality, stability of property values and the overall
character in the City. The standards of this Article area also intended to
provide incentives to preserve quality mature trees, screen headlights to
reduce glare, integrate various elements of a site, help ensure compatibility
between land uses, assist in directing safe and efficient traffic flow at
driveways and within parking lots, and minimize negative impacts of stormwater
runoff and salt spray.
The landscape standards of this section are considered the minimum necessary to
achieve the intent. In several instances, the standards are intentionally
flexible to encourage flexibility and creative design. Applicants are
encouraged to provide additional landscaping to improve the function,
appearance and value of their property .
SECTION 2301   REQUIREMENTS AND TIMING OF LANDSCAPING.
Landscaping  shall be illustrated on any site plan , sketch plan or plot plan
reviewed by the City. The landscape plan shall clearly describe the location,
type, size and spacing of all plant materials. Wherever the Zoning Ordinance
requires landscaping or plant materials, it shall be planted within six (6)
months from the date of issuance of a certificate of occupancy and shall
thereafter be reasonably maintained with permanent plant materials which may be
supplemented with other plantings. The Building and Zoning Administrator may
require a performance guarantee to cover the cost of landscaping prior to
issuing a Certificate of Occupancy,
SECTION 2302   SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR EXISTING SITES.
Special provision is made for applying these standards to developed sites which
existed prior to the City adopting landscaping requirements. Therefore, when an
existing site is undergoing improvement, a change in use or expansion, the
objective of these standards is to gradually bring the existing site into
compliance with the minimum standards of this Article in relation to the extent
of expansion or change on a site.
When reviewing plans for a change in use or expansion which requires site plan
or sketch plan review, the Building and Zoning Administrator or body reviewing
the plan shall require an upgrade in landscaping , using the following as
guidelines:

SECTION 2400   INTENT.
The intent of this article is to establish the procedures and consistent
standards for review and approval of site plans to ensure full compliance with
the regulations in this Ordinance and other applicable ordinances and state and
federal regulations of development proposals. Site plan review standards are
intended to encourage consultation and cooperation between the applicant and
the City to balance the property owners right to a reasonable rate of return on
investment with the City’s overall land  use goals and desire to minimize
adverse impacts on the investments of surrounding landowners. Therefore, these
site plan review standards insure a thorough evaluation of a development in
relation to the goals of the City of Grand Blanc Master Plan and the potential
impacts on the environment, drainage, utilities, traffic, aesthetics, property
values and other public health, safety and welfare issues.
This section also contains special provisions to evaluate impacts of particular
uses and to allow administrative approval in certain cases where there is a
change in use , a minor change to an existing site or a minor change determined
necessary in the field during construction.
SECTION 2401   RELATIONSHIP TO PLATTING AND LAND DIVISIONS OR COMBINATIONS.
The City Council  shall require the platting of parcels of property and/or the
approval of land divisions or land combinations prior to the consideration of
site plans where the City Council determines a site plan is needed to ensure
capability to comply with the standards of the Zoning Ordinance or other
ordinances.
SECTION 2402   USES REQUIRING SITE PLAN REVIEW.
Except as specifically provided in
Section 2403 and
Section 2404, the development of any new use , the construction of any new
structures, any change of an existing use of land or site, and all other
building or development activities shall require site plan approval pursuant to
this Article. For example, site plan review shall be required for, but not
limited to, the following:
   a.   Development of any non-single family  use or building in the R-1 thru
R-3 District.
   b.   Any residential development , except construction or expansion of one
single-family or two-family dwelling unit on an individual lot or parcel in the
R-1 through R-3 and the R-T zoning districts, or placement of dwelling units in
an approved mobile home park .
   c.   Development of any nonresidential use or building.
   d.   The erection, relocation, conversion or structural alteration to any
non single-family or two-family building, structure or site which results in
additional floor space.

the proposed use for the occupants of that property and the tenants, owners,
and occupants of surrounding properties.
   c.   There is a proper relationship between major thoroughfares and proposed
service drives, driveways, and parking areas to encourage the safety and
convenience of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The site plan includes the
minimum number of driveways required to provide reasonable access . Driveways
are spaced as far apart from intersections and other driveways as practical to
reduce accident and congestion potential. Sharing with adjacent uses is
encouraged. The Planning Commission  may require a traffic impact study as
outlined in Section 329.

SECTION 2600   INTENT.
It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit legal nonconforming lots,
structures, or uses to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage
their survival.
It is recognized that there exists within the districts established by this
Ordinance and subsequent amendments, lots, structures and uses of land and
structures which were lawful before this Ordinance was passed or amended which
would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance
or future amendments.
Such uses are declared by this Ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses
in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this Ordinance that
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used
as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district .
A nonconforming use of a structure , a nonconforming use of land , or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land  shall not be extended or enlarged
after passage of this Ordinance by attachment on a building or premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises , or by addition of
other uses of a nature which would not be permitted generally in the district
involved.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a
change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this Ordinance and upon which actual building construction has
been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined to include
the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of an existing
building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding such demolition
or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided work shall be
diligently carried on until completion of the building involved.
The following table summarizes the nonconforming regulations contained in this

SECTION 2601   DEFINITIONS.
For the purposes of this section, the following words and phrases shall have
the meaning ascribed to them:
   a.   Effective Date: Whenever this article refers to the “effective date,”
the reference shall  be deemed to include the effective date of any amendments
to this Ordinance if the amendments created a nonconforming situation.
   b.   Nonconforming Building: A building or portion thereof which was
lawfully in existence at the effective date of this Ordinance, or amendments
thereto, that does not meet the limitations on building size, location on a
lot, or other regulations for the district  in which such building is located.
   c.   Nonconforming Lot: A lot which was lawfully in existence at the
effective date of this Ordinance, or amendments thereto, that does not meet the
minimum area or lot dimensional requirements of the district  in which the lot
is located.
   d.   Nonconforming Use: A use  which was lawfully in existence at the
effective date of this Ordinance, or amendment thereto, and which does not now
conform to the use  regulations of this Ordinance for the zoning district  in
which it is now located.
   e.   Structural Nonconformity: A nonconformity that exists when the height,
size, or minimum floor space of a structure , or the relationship between an
existing building and other buildings or lot lines , does not conform to the
standards of the district  in which the property  is located. Also sometimes
referred to as a Dimensional Nonconformity.
SECTION 2602   NONCONFORMING LOTS.
Any nonconforming lot shall be used only for a use permitted in the district in
which it is located. In any district in which single-family dwellings are
permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this
Ordinance, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be
erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Ordinance. This provision shall apply even though such lot
fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally
applicable in the district ; provided that yard dimensions and other
requirements not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to
the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Yard requirement
variances may be obtained through approval of the Board of Appeals .
If two or more lots or combination of lots with contiguous frontage in single
ownership are of record at the time of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance,
and if all or part of the individual lots do not meet the requirements
established for lot width and area, the lots involved shall be considered to be
an individual parcel for the purposes of this Ordinance. No portion of said
parcel shall be used, occupied , or sold in a manner which diminishes
compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this Ordinance,
nor shall any division of an parcel be made which creates a lot with width or
area less than the requirements stated in this Ordinance. These provisions
shall not apply to contiguous lots in single ownership where each of the lots
is occupied by an dwelling unit .
Upon application, the Building and Zoning Administrator  may permit the
combination, in whole or in part, of nonconforming lots of record into building
sites less than the size requirements established by this Ordinance, provided
that the combination of lots reduces the degree of nonconformity and results in
a parcel which is capable of accommodating a structure that is in conformance
with the building area, setback , and side yard requirements of this Ordinance.
SECTION 2603   NONCONFORMING USE OF LAND.
Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, lawful
use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this
Ordinance as enacted or amended such use  may be continued, so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   a.   No such nonconforming use  shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Ordinance;
   b.   No such nonconforming use  shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel  occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance;
   c.   If such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of
more than thirty (30) days, any subsequent use of such land  shall conform to
the regulations specified by this Ordinance for the district in which such land
is located.
   d.   Where non-conforming off-street parking , landscaping , signage,
fences, and other similar land uses exist, those uses shall be made to conform
to the terms of this Ordinance when any use , principal or accessory, is
expanded either by expansion of the main building or the addition of an
accessory building , necessitating site plan changes.
SECTION 2604   NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this Ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this Ordinance by
reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage , height, yards , or other
characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure
 may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions:
   a.   No such structure  may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases
its nonconformity. Such structures may be enlarged or altered in a way which
does not increase it nonconformity.
   b.   Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more
than sixty (60) percent of its replacement costs, exclusive of the foundation,
it shall be reconstructed only in conformity with the provisions of this
Ordinance.
   c.   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatsoever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is removed.
   d.   Any nonconforming structure or any structure or portion thereof
containing a nonconforming use , may be altered if such alteration serves to
decrease the nonconforming nature of the structure or use . The Zoning Board of
Appeals  shall determine if a proposed alteration will decrease the degree of
nonconformity.
SECTION 2605   NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES AND LAND.
If a lawful use of a structure , or of structure and land in combination,
exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, that
would not be permitted in the district under the terms of this Ordinance, the
lawful use  may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
   a.   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Ordinance
in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
   b.   Any nonconforming use  may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use, and which
existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, but no such use
 shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
   c.   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure , or structure and land in combination, may be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same or a more restricted classification provided that
the Board of Appeals , either by general rule or by making findings in the
specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more
appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use . In permitting
such change, the Board of Appeals  may require conditions and safeguards in
accord with the purpose and intent of this Ordinance. Where a nonconforming use
of a structure , land , or structure and land in combination is hereafter
changed to a more conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed to a less
conforming use .
   d.   Any structure , or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use , shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the
nonconforming use  may not thereafter be resumed.
   e.   When a nonconforming use of a structure , or structures and land in
combination, is discontinued or ceases to exist for six (6) consecutive months
or for eighteen (18) months during any three-year (3-year) period, the
structure , or structure and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used
except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is
located. Structures occupied by seasonal uses shall be excepted from this
provision.
   f.   Where nonconformity use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land .
SECTION 2606   NONCONFORMING SITES.
The intent of this Section is to permit improvements and minor modifications,
as described in
Article XXIII, Landscape Standards and
Article XXIV, Site Plan Review, to a conforming use and building which does not
meet all of the various site improvement related regulations of this Zoning
Ordinance. The purpose is to allow gradual compliance with the site related
requirements for sites which predate the various Zoning Ordinance standards for
landscaping , paving and other non safety site related items.
Such improvements or expansions may be permitted without a complete upgrade of
all site elements under the following conditions:
   a.   The applicant is proposing reasonable site improvements in relation to
the scale and construction cost of the building improvements or expansion.
   b.   The applicant has addressed safety related site issues.
   c.   The applicant has upgraded the site landscaping consistent with Section
2302.

with site requirements.
   e.   A sketch plan shall be submitted in accordance with Section 2403.
SECTION 2607   REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use , work may
be done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or
on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to
an extent not exceeding fifty (50) percent of the assessed value of the
building, provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the
time of passage or amendment of this Ordinance shall not be increased.
Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
such official.
SECTION 2608   USES UNDER EXCEPTION PROVISIONS NOT NONCONFORMING USES.
Any use for which a special exception is permitted as provided in this
Ordinance shall not be deemed a nonconforming use , but shall , without further
action, be deemed a conforming use in such district .
SECTION 2609   CHANGE OF TENANCY OR OWNERSHIP.
There may be a change of tenancy, ownership, or management of any existing
nonconforming uses of land , structures and land in combination.
SECTION 2610   ACQUISITION OF NONCONFORMING USES.

property , or an interest in private property , for the purpose of removing
nonconforming uses. The cost and expense, or a portion thereof, of acquiring
the private property  may be paid from general funds or assessed to a special
district in accordance with the applicable statutory provisions relating to the
creation and operation of special assessment districts. The elimination of
nonconforming uses and structures in a zoned district as provided is declared
to be for a public purpose for a public use . The City Council  may institute
and prosecute proceedings for the condemnation of nonconforming uses and
structures under the power of eminent domain in accordance with the provisions
of the City Charter relative to condemnation, or in accordance with Public Act

SECTION 2903   JURISDICTION.
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not have the power to alter or change the
zoning district classification of any property , or to make any change in terms
of this Ordinance, but shall have power to act on those matters where this
Ordinance provides for an administrative review, interpretation, or exception
permit and to authorize a variance as defined in this Section and laws of the
State of Michigan. Said powers include:
   a.   Administrative Review: To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is error of law  in any order, requirement, decision or determination
made by the Building and Zoning Administrator  in the enforcement of the Zoning
Ordinance.
   b.   Variance: To authorize, upon an appeal, a variance  from the strict
application of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance where, by reason of
exceptional narrowness, shallowness, shape, or area of a specific piece of
property  at the time of enactment of this Ordinance, or by reason of
exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional
conditions of such property , the strict application of the regulations enacted
would result in peculiar or exceptional practical difficulties to or
exceptional undue hardship upon the owner  of such property , provided such
relief may  be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and
without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of the Zoning Ordinance.
In granting or denying a variance , the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach
thereto such conditions regarding the location, character, site design,
operations and other features of the proposed structure  or uses as it deems
reasonable in furtherance of the purpose of this Ordinance. In granting or
denying a variance , the Board of Zoning Appeals shall  state the grounds upon
which it justifies the granting or denying of a variance .
(Amended 2-14-1996; amended 6-10-1998)
SECTION 2904   STANDARDS FOR VARIANCES AND APPEALS.
Variances and appeals shall be granted only in accordance with Public Act 110
of 2006, the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, M.C.L.A. §§ 125.3101 et seq., as
amended, and based on the findings set forth in this section.
   a.   Criteria Applicable to Dimensional (area or non-use ) Variances. A
dimensional variance  is an approved deviation from any dimensional standard or
requirement of this Ordinance, such as, but not limited to, lot-area , lot
width , building or structure  height, building size, setback , parking,
lighting or landscaping . . The extent to which the following criteria apply to
a specific case shall  be determined by the Board of Zoning Appeals, however,
all elements of the practical difficulties test must be, found by the Board of
Zoning Appeals.
(Amended 6-10-1998)
      1.   Practical Difficulties: All of the following must be met for the
Board of Zoning Appeals to find there is a practical difficulty:
         (a)   Compliance with the strict letter of the restrictions governing
area, setbacks, frontage, height, bulk , density , or other dimensional
provisions would unreasonably prevent the use  of the property   for a
permitted purpose, or render conformity with such restrictions unnecessarily
burdensome. The showing of mere inconvenience is insufficient to justify a
variance .
         (b)   Granting of a requested variance or appeal would do substantial
justice to the applicant as well as to other property owners in the district;
or, as an alternative, granting of lesser variance than requested would give
substantial relief to the owner of the property involved and be more consistent
with justice to other property owners.
         (c)   There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or
conditions applicable to the property involved or to the intended use of the
property that do not apply generally to other properties or other similar uses
in the same zoning district.
         (d)   The conditions resulting in a variance request cannot be self-
created.
      2.   Public Safety and Welfare: The requested variance  or appeal can be
granted in such fashion that the spirit of these regulations will be observed
and public safety and welfare secured.
      3.   No Safety Hazard or Nuisance: The granting of a variance or appeal
will not increase the hazard of fire or otherwise endanger public safety or
create a public nuisance.
      4.   Relationship to Adjacent Land Uses: The development permitted upon
granting of a variance  shall relate harmoniously in a physical and economic
sense with adjacent land uses  and will not alter the essential character of
the neighborhood. In evaluating this criterion, consideration shall be given to
prevailing shopping patterns, convenience of access for patrons, continuity of
development, and the need for particular services and facilities in specific
areas of the City.
   b.   Criteria Applicable to Use Variances. A use  variance  is requested
when the use  proposed by an applicant is not listed as either permitted or as
a special land use  in the district  in which the property  is located. In
granting a use  variance , the Board of Zoning Appeals shall  determine that
all of the following factors are present, or require conditions to ensure the
criteria below are met.
(Amended 6-10-1998)
      1.   Criteria for Dimensional Variance. The request meets all of the
criteria for a dimensional variance  listed in
Section 2904, a.
(Amended 6-10-1998)
      2.   Conformance with Master Plan. The proposed use  is consistent with
the uses called for in the Master Plan  for the subject property , or that
conditions on site design and operations ensure such use  is compatible with
the planned uses in the vicinity.
(Amended 6-10-1998)
      3.   Compatibility with Surrounding Land Uses. The proposed use  is
compatible with existing or planned uses on surrounding properties. The Zoning
Board of Appeals  may  require a sketch plan or site plan , as applicable, and
may request a recommendation from the Planning Commission , to assist with this
finding.
(Amended 6-10-1998)
      4.   Unreasonable Current Zoning Designation. The applicant has
demonstrated that the site can not reasonably be used for any of the uses
allowed within the current zoning district  designation. The Zoning Board of
Appeals  may  require submission of documentation from real estate  or market
experts, or a certified appraiser, to substantiate this finding.
(Amended 6-10-1998)
      5.   Capacity of Roads, Infrastructure and Public Services. The capacity
and operations of public streets, utilities, other facilities and services will
not be significantly compromised.
(Amended 6-10-1998)
      6.   Unnecessary Hardship. An unnecessary hardship exists on the subject
site due to very unique circumstances.
(Amended 6-10-1998)
      7.   Minimum Variance Necessary. The variance  requested is the minimum
necessary to permit reasonable use  of the land .
(Amended 6-10-1998)
   c.   Criteria Applicable to Appeals: The Board of Zoning Appeals shall
reverse an order of an Enforcement Official only if it finds that the action or
decision appealed:
(Amended 6-10-1998)
      1.   was arbitrary or capricious, or
      2.   was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact, or
      3.   constituted an abuse of discretion, or
      4.   was based on erroneous interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance or
zoning law .
      5.   Appeals from Denial of Board of Zoning Appeals of Zoning Appeals may

authorizes the Board of Zoning Appeals to act. Any exception shall  be subject
to such conditions as the Board of Zoning Appeals may  require to preserve and
promote the character of the zoning district  in question and otherwise promote
the purpose of this Ordinance, including the following:
(Amended 6-10-1998)
      1.   Interpret the provisions of this ordinance in such a way as to carry
out the intent and purpose of the Master Plan . Interpret boundaries of the

where the zoning district boundary does not follow exact property lines .
(Amended 6-10-1998)
      2.   Permit the modification of the automobile  parking space or loading
space requirements where, in the particular instance, such modification will
not be inconsistent with the purpose and intent of such requirements.
      3.   Permit modification of obscuring wall requirements only when such
modification will not adversely affect or be detrimental to surrounding or
adjacent development .

      4.   Permit, upon proper application, a temporary use not otherwise

§ 1480.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The intent of this chapter is to regulate signs, to minimize outdoor
advertising, and to protect public safety, health and welfare; minimize
abundance and size of signs to reduce visual clutter, motorist distraction, and
loss of visibility; promote public convenience; preserve property values; and
enhance the aesthetic appearance and quality of life within the city. The
requirements contained herein are intended to be content neutral. The following
objectives are accomplished by establishing the minimum amount of regulations
necessary concerning the size, placement, construction, illumination and other
aspects of signs in the city in order to:
   (a)   Protect the public right to receive messages and other types of
information protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution;
   (b)   Maintain and improve the image of the city by encouraging signs of
consistent size and rigid materials which are compatible with and complementary
to related buildings and uses, and harmonious with their surroundings;
   (c)   Recognize that the proliferation of signs is unduly distracting to
motorists and non-motorized travelers, reduces the effectiveness of signs
directing and warning the public, causes confusion reduces desired uniform
traffic flow, and creates potential for accidents;
   (d)   Recognize that the principal intent of commercial signs, to meet the
purpose of these requirements and serve the public interest, should be for
identification of an establishment on the premises , and not for advertising
special events, brand names or off-premises activities, as these can be
advertised more appropriately by other methods;
   (e)   Eliminate potential conflicts between business signs and traffic
control signs, which could create confusion and hazardous consequences;
   (f)   Enable the public to locate goods, services and facilities without
excessive difficulty and confusion by restricting the number and placement of
signs;
   (g)   Prevent placement of signs which will conceal or obscure signs of
adjacent uses;
   (h)   Prevent off-premises signs from conflicting with other land uses;
   (i)   Prevent signs that are potentially dangerous to the public due to
structural deficiencies or disrepair; and
   (j)   Limit portable commercial signs in recognition of their significant
negative impact on traffic safety and aesthetics.

chapter.
   (b)   Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Committee may appeal to

decision, except in the case of an unsafe sign which presents an immediate and

modify the order or action of the Sign Review Committee.
   (d)   The following criteria shall be used to evaluate such requests:
      (1)   Variances may be granted for any one of the following conditions:
         A.   The applicant has demonstrated that a variance is needed due to a
practical difficulty on the site, such as varied topography, horizontal or
vertical road curvature, or the presence of structures or desired trees that
limit visibility of a sign on the premises compared to similar sites with
conforming signs in the same zoning district;
         B.   A variance is warranted due to the relatively large size of the
site, frontage or building in comparison to other establishments in the same
district; or
         C.   A variance would significantly improve the conformity of an
existing sign.
      (2)   Provided one of the conditions above is met, all of the following
criteria must be met to grant a variance:
         A.   The inability to conform to the provisions of this chapter is due
to a practical difficulty that includes more than mere inconvenience or mere
inability to attain a supposed higher financial return;
         B.   The variance granted is the minimum necessary to allow the
applicant to enjoy the same rights as other establishments in the same zoning
district, have a reasonable outlet for free speech and meet the intent of this
chapter; and
         C.   The variance will not adversely affect the health, safety and
welfare of the public.
