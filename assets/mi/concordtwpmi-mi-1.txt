will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance
included in the supplement.
   (B)   In preparing a supplement to this code, all portions of the code which

and other divisions of the code printed in the supplement, and make changes in

existing section or other division numbers;

may be, or to “sections _____ through _____” (inserting section numbers to
indicate the sections of the code which embody the substantive sections of the
ordinance incorporated into the code); and
      (5)   Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the
original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the code; but in no case
shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance
material included in the supplement or already embodied in the code.

this code, or any rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof,

by imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or by both the fine and
imprisonment; unless there is a fine or penalty specifically set forth in the

penalty shall control. Each act of violation and every day upon which any such
violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided
by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to

FUND BALANCE
§ 32.205  FUND BALANCE.
   (A)   Generally. The Township Board believes that sound financial management
principles require that sufficient funds be retained by the township to provide
a stable financial base at all times. In order to do so, the township needs to
maintain a fund balance sufficient to fund all cash flows of the township, to
provide for financial reserves for unanticipated one-time expenditures, revenue
shortfalls and/or emergency needs.
   (B)   Policy. The purpose of this policy is to identify the size and
composition of the township’s desired fund balance for governmental funds and
to identify certain requirements for classifying fund balance in accordance
with Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 54, Fund Balance
Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions.
      (1)   Classifications.
         (a)   Generally. The following individual components shall constitute
the fund balance for all of the township’s governmental funds:
 
Classification                       Definition                                                                       Examples
                                     Amounts that cannot be spent because they are either:                            • Inventories
Non-spendable                        (a) not in spendable form; or                                                    • Prepaid items
                                     (b) legally or contractually required to be maintained intact                    • Long-term receivables

                                     through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.                       • Revenues restricted by enabling legislation
                                     Used for specific purposes pursuant to constraints imposed by formal action of

                                     Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification for the General Fund; this is fund balance that has not been reported in any other classification;
                          Unassigned the General Fund is the only fund that can report a positive unassigned fund balance; other governmental funds would report deficit fund balances as
                                     unassigned
 
         (b)   Committing fund balance. In order to commit fund balance, the
Township Board, as the highest level of decision-making authority, must pass a
resolution to commit funds for a specific purpose. These funds must be fully
expended for their committed purpose. To make committed funds uncommitted, a
new resolution must be passed by the Board. Action must be taken before the
last day of the fiscal year to commit funds for that year.
         (c)   Assigning fund balance. In order to assign fund balance, the
Township Board designates the Supervisor or his or her designee as the
authority to assign fund balance.
      (2)   Levels of fund balance. The township will establish and maintain
levels of fund balance for the General Fund as follows.
         (a)   The goal of the Township Board shall be to maintain a minimum
unassigned fund balance of no less than 25% of General Fund expenditures. For
purposes of this calculation, “expenditures” will be the annual budgeted
expenditures amount less non-recurring capital expenditures. If unassigned fund
balance levels fall below 25% of expenditures, the General Fund budget for the
following year will be adjusted to restore fund balance to the 25% level.
         (b)   If unassigned fund balance approaches a level that greatly
exceeds 50% of expenditures, the Township Board will consider using unassigned
fund balance for the following purposes: pay down future debt (drains/bonds);
transfer funds to capital projects fund for future capital improvements; and
other future obligations of the township.
         (c)   Fund balance levels will be analyzed each fiscal year after the
financial statement audit (typically in August).

§ 32.436  RED FLAGS RULE POLICY; PROGRAM UPDATES.
   This program shall be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect changes
in risks to customers and the soundness of the township from identity theft.
The Supervisor shall consider the township’s experiences with identity theft
situation, changes in identity theft methods, changes in identity theft
detection and prevention methods, changes in types of accounts the township
maintains and changes in the township’s business arrangements with other
entities. After considering these factors, the Supervisor shall determine
whether changes to the program, including the listing of red flags, are
warranted. If warranted, the Supervisor shall present the Township Board with
his or her recommended changes and the Board shall make a determination of
whether to accept, modify or reject those changes to the program.
(Board and Administrative Policies Manual, § 4.80)
§ 32.437  RED FLAGS RULE POLICY; PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.
   Responsibility for developing, implementing and updating this program lies
with an Identity Theft Committee for the township. The Committee is headed by
the Supervisor, with the Clerk and Treasurer comprising the remainder of the
Committee membership. The Supervisor will be responsible for the program
administration, for ensuring appropriate training of township staff on the
program, for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of red flags
and the steps for preventing and mitigating identity theft, determining which
steps of prevention and mitigation should be taken in particular circumstances,
and considering periodic changes to the program.
(Board and Administrative Policies Manual, § 4.81)
§ 32.438  RED FLAGS RULE POLICY; STAFF TRAINING AND REPORTS.
   Township personnel responsible for implementing the program shall be trained
either by or under the direction of the Supervisor in the detection of red

Township personnel shall provide reports to the program administrator on
incidents of identity theft, the township’s compliance with the program and the
effectiveness of the program.
(Board and Administrative Policies Manual, § 4.82)
§ 32.439  RED FLAGS RULE POLICY; SPECIFIC PROGRAM ELEMENTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY.
   For the effectiveness of identity theft prevention programs, the red flags
rule envision a degree of confidentiality regarding the township’s specific
practices relating to identity theft detection, prevention and mitigation.
Therefore, under this program, knowledge of such specific practices are to be
limited to the Identity Theft Committee and those employees who need to know
them for purposes of preventing identity theft. Because this program is to be
adopted by a public body and thus publicly available, it would be
counterproductive to list these specific practices here. Therefore, only the
program’s general red flag detection, implementation and prevention practices
are listed in this document.
(Board and Administrative Policies Manual, § 4.83)
EXPENDITURE AUTHORIZATION

§ 32.826  E-MAIL USE.
   Some employees may have access to the township’s e-mail system for township-

(Board and Administrative Policies Manual, § 8.36)
§ 32.828  ONLINE FORUMS.
   The township recognizes that participation in some forums might be important
to the performance of an employee’s job. For instance, an employee might find
the answer to a technical problem by consulting members of a news group devoted

provided facilities to one or more individuals via an electronic network—for
example, internet mailing lists, bulletin boards and online services—are
statements identifiable and attributable to the township. The public may have a
right to request a record of messages or information sent on township-provided
facilities.
(Board and Administrative Policies Manual, § 8.37)
§ 32.829  PERSONAL USE.
   (A)   Limited, occasional or incidental use of township computer systems for

understandable and acceptable, but such personal use shall be kept to a minimum
and shall not interfere with work responsibilities or work time.

keep private.

potentially subject to Freedom of Information Act, being 5 U.S.C. § 552
requests.

township policies or engaging in illegal activity.
      (3)   The township reserves the right, at its discretion, to review any
employee’s electronic files and messages to the extent necessary to ensure
electronic media and services are being used in compliance with the law, this
policy and other township policies.
   (C)   Employees should not assume electronic communications are completely
private. Accordingly, if they have sensitive information to transmit, they
should use other means.
(Board and Administrative Policies Manual, § 8.39)
§ 32.831  SOFTWARE.
   The unauthorized use of township software is prohibited. Employees shall not
make or use unauthorized copies of software programs. Employees shall not

Supervisor for purposes of safeguarding sensitive or confidential business
information. Employees who use encryption on files stored on a township
computer must provide the Supervisor with a sealed hard copy record to be
retained off-premises in a secure location of all of the passwords and/or
encryption keys necessary to access the files.
(Board and Administrative Policies Manual, § 8.41)
§ 32.833  PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING ABUSE OF COMPUTER PRIVILEGES OR VIOLATION OF

(Board and Administrative Policies Manual, § 8.44)
TOWNSHIP HARASSMENT PREVENTION POLICY AND COMPLAINT PROCEDURE
§ 32.860  OBJECTIVE.
   (A)   The township strives to create and maintain a work environment in
which people are treated with dignity, decency and respect. The environment of
the township should be characterized by mutual trust and the absence of
intimidation, oppression and exploitation. The township will not tolerate
unlawful discrimination or harassment of any kind. Through enforcement of this
policy and by education of employees, the township will seek to prevent,
correct and discipline behavior that violates this policy.
   (B)   All employees, regardless of their positions, are covered by and are
expected to comply with this policy and to take appropriate measures to ensure
that prohibited conduct does not occur. Appropriate disciplinary action will be
taken against any employee who violates this policy. Based on the seriousness
of the offense, disciplinary action may include verbal or written reprimand,
suspension or termination of employment; or, in the case of an elected
official, official Board sanction or possible criminal prosecution.
   (C)   Managers and supervisors who knowingly allow or tolerate
discrimination, harassment or retaliation, including the failure to immediately
report such misconduct, are in violation of this policy and subject to
discipline.
(Board and Administrative Policies Manual, § 9.1)
§ 32.861  PROHIBITED CONDUCT UNDER THIS POLICY.
   The township, in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local
anti-discrimination and harassment laws and regulations, enforces this policy
in accordance with the following definitions and guidelines.
(Board and Administrative Policies Manual, § 9.2)
§ 32.862  DISCRIMINATION.
   (A)   It is a violation of the township’s policy to discriminate in the
provision of employment opportunities, benefits or privileges; to create
discriminatory work conditions; or to use discriminatory evaluative standards
in employment if the basis of that discriminatory treatment is, in whole or in
part, the person’s race, color, national origin, age, religion, military
service or veteran status, disability status, gender, sexual orientation,
gender identity, genetic information or marital status.
   (B)   Discrimination of this kind may also be strictly prohibited by a
variety of federal, state and local laws, including Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 (P.L. 88-352), the Age Discrimination Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C.
§§ 621 et seq.) and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. §§
12101 et seq.) This policy is intended to comply with the prohibitions stated
in these anti-discrimination laws.
   (C)   Discrimination in violation of this policy will be subject to
disciplinary measures up to and including criminal prosecution.
(Board and Administrative Policies Manual, § 9.3)
§ 32.863  HARASSMENT.
   (A)   The township prohibits harassment of any kind, including sexual
harassment, and will take appropriate and immediate action in response to
complaints or knowledge of violations of this policy. For purposes of this
policy, HARASSMENT is any verbal or physical conduct designed to threaten,
intimidate or coerce an employee, co-worker or any person working for or on
behalf of the township.
   (B)   The following examples of harassment are intended to be guidelines and
are not exclusive when determining whether there has been a violation of this
policy.
      (1)   Verbal harassment includes comments that are offensive or unwelcome
regarding a person’s national origin, race, color, religion, gender, sexual
orientation, age, body, disability or appearance, including epithets, slurs and
negative stereotyping.
      (2)   Nonverbal harassment includes distribution, display or discussion
of any written or graphic material that ridicules, denigrates, insults,
belittles or shows hostility, aversion or disrespect toward an individual or
group because of national origin, race, color, religion, age, gender, sexual
orientation, pregnancy, appearance, disability, sexual identity, marital status
or other protected status.
(Board and Administrative Policies Manual, § 9.4)
§ 32.864  SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   Sexual harassment is a form of unlawful employment discrimination
under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, being 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et
seq. and is prohibited under the township’s anti-harassment policy. According
to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), SEXUAL HARASSMENT is
defined as “unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other
verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature ... when ... submission to or
rejection of such conduct is used as the basis for employment decisions ... or
such conduct has the purpose or effect of ... creating an intimidating, hostile
or offensive working environment.”
   (B)   Sexual harassment occurs when unsolicited and unwelcome sexual
advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a
sexual nature:
      (1)   Is made explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment;
      (2)   Is used as a basis for an employment decision; and
      (3)   Unreasonably interferes with an employee’s work performance or
creates an intimidating, hostile or otherwise offensive environment.
   (C)   Sexual harassment may take different forms. The following examples of
sexual harassment are intended to be guidelines and are not exclusive when
determining whether there has been a violation of this policy:
      (1)   Verbal sexual harassment includes innuendoes, suggestive comments,
jokes of a sexual nature, sexual propositions, lewd remarks and threats;
requests for any type of sexual favor (this includes repeated, unwelcome
requests for dates); and verbal abuse or “kidding” that is oriented toward a
prohibitive form of harassment, including that which is sexual in nature and
unwelcome;
      (2)   Nonverbal sexual harassment includes the distribution, display or
discussion of any written or graphic material, including calendars, posters and
cartoons that are sexually suggestive or show hostility toward an individual or
group because of sex; suggestive or insulting sounds; leering; staring;
whistling; obscene gestures; content in letters, notes, facsimiles, e-mails,
photos, text messages, tweets and internet postings; or other forms of
communication that are sexual in nature and offensive; and
      (3)   Physical sexual harassment includes unwelcome, unwanted physical
contact, including touching, tickling, pinching, patting, brushing up against,
hugging, cornering, kissing, fondling and forced sexual intercourse or assault.
   (D)   Courteous, mutually respectful, pleasant, noncoercive interactions
between employees that are appropriate in the workplace and acceptable to and
welcomed by both parties are not considered to be harassment, including sexual
harassment.
   (E)   Consensual romantic or sexual relationships.
      (1)   The township strongly discourages romantic or sexual relationships
between a manager or other supervisory employee and his or her staff (an
employee who reports directly or indirectly to that person) because such
relationships tend to create compromising conflicts of interest or the
appearance of such conflicts. In addition, such a relationship may give rise to
the perception by others that there is favoritism or bias in employment
decisions affecting the staff employee. Moreover, given the uneven balance of
power within such relationships, consent by the staff member is suspect and may
be viewed by others, or at a later date by the staff member, as having been
given as the result of coercion or intimidation. The atmosphere created by such
appearances of bias, favoritism, intimidation, coercion or exploitation
undermines the spirit of trust and mutual respect that is essential to a
healthy work environment. If there is such a relationship, the parties need to
be aware that one or both may be moved to a different department or other
actions may be taken.
      (2)   If any employee of the township enters into a consensual
relationship that is romantic or sexual in nature with a member of his or her
staff (an employee who reports directly or indirectly to him or her), or if one
of the parties is in a supervisory capacity in the same department in which the
other party works, the parties must notify an appropriate township officer.
Because of potential issues regarding quid pro quo harassment, the township has
made reporting mandatory. This requirement does not apply to employees who do
not work in the same department or to parties where neither one supervises or
otherwise manages responsibilities over the other.
      (3)   Once the relationship is made known to the township, the township
will review the situation in light of all the facts (reporting relationship
between the parties, effect on co-workers, job titles of the parties and the
like) and will determine whether one or both parties need to be moved to
another job or department. If it is determined that one party must be moved,
and there are jobs in other departments available for both, the parties may
decide who will be the one to apply for a new position. If the parties cannot
amicably come to a decision, or the party is not chosen for the position to
which he or she applied, the Supervisor will decide which party will be moved.
That decision will be based on which move will be least disruptive to the
organization as a whole. If no other jobs are available for either party, the
parties will be given the option of terminating their relationship or
resigning.

the investigation, and the Supervisor will take adequate steps to ensure that
the complainant is protected from retaliation during and after the
investigation. All information pertaining to a complaint or investigation under
this policy will be maintained in secure files.

manager that violation of this policy may be occurring, the person receiving
the complaint will notify senior administration and review the complaint with
the township’s legal counsel.
      (3)   The appropriate officer will initiate an investigation to determine
whether there is a reasonable basis for believing that the alleged violation of
this policy occurred.
      (4)   If necessary, the complainant and the respondent will be separated
during the course of the investigation, by whatever means are necessary.
      (5)   During the investigation, administration, together with legal
counsel or other management employees, will interview the complainant, the
respondent and any witnesses to determine whether the alleged conduct occurred.
      (6)   (a)   Upon conclusion of an investigation, investigator will submit
a written report of his or her findings to the township. If it is determined
that a violation of this policy has occurred, the investigator will recommend
appropriate disciplinary action.
         (b)   The appropriate action will depend on the following factors:
            1.   The severity, frequency and pervasiveness of the conduct;
            2.   Prior complaints made by the complainant;
            3.   Prior complaints made against the respondent; and
            4.   The quality of the evidence (e.g., firsthand knowledge,
credible corroboration).
         (c)   If the investigation is inconclusive or if it is determined that

have occurred, appropriate preventive action may be recommended.

administrator will meet with the complainant and the respondent separately and

be taken, the respondent will be informed of the nature of the discipline and
how it will be executed.

§ 33.06  ESTABLISHMENT, LOCATION AND PERSONNEL OF THE MUNICIPAL ORDINANCE
VIOLATIONS BUREAU.
   (A)   The township hereby establishes a Municipal Ordinance Violations
Bureau to accept admissions of responsibility for municipal civil infractions
in response to municipal civil infraction violation notices issued and served
by authorized township officials, and to collect and retain civil fines and
costs as prescribed by this chapter and any related ordinance.
   (B)   The Bureau shall be located at the township hall, and shall be under
the direct supervision and control of the Township Clerk. The Township Clerk,
subject to the approval of the Township Board, may adopt rules and regulations
for the operation of the Bureau and appoint the Township Treasurer or any other
necessary qualified township employees to administer the Bureau.
   (C)   The Bureau may dispose only of municipal civil infraction violations
for which a fine has been scheduled and for which a municipal civil infraction
violation notice (as compared to a citation) has been issued. The fact that a
fine has been scheduled for a particular violation shall not entitle any person
to dispose of the violation at the Bureau. Nothing in this chapter shall
prevent or restrict the township from issuing a municipal civil infraction
citation for any violation or from prosecuting any violation in a court of
competent jurisdiction. No person shall be required to dispose of a municipal
civil infraction violation at the Bureau, and instead may choose to have the
violation processed before a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The
unwillingness of any person to dispose of any violation at the Bureau shall not
prejudice the person or in any way diminish the person’s rights, privileges and
protection accorded by law.
   (D)   The scope of the Bureau’s authority shall be limited to accepting
admissions of responsibility for municipal civil infractions arising out of
municipal civil infraction violation notices and collecting and retaining civil
fines and costs as a result of those admissions. The Bureau shall not accept
payment of a fee from any person who denies having committed the offense or who
admits responsibility only with explanation, and in no event shall the Bureau
determine, or attempt to determine, the veracity of any fact or matter relating
to an alleged violation.
   (E)   Municipal civil infraction violation notices shall be issued and
served by authorized township officials under the same circumstances and upon
the same persons as provided for citations as prescribed in this chapter. In
addition to any other information required by this code of ordinances, the
notice of violation shall indicate the time by which the alleged violator must
appear at the Bureau, the methods by which an appearance may be made, the
address and telephone number of the Bureau, the hours during which the Bureau
is open, the amount of the fine scheduled for the alleged violation, and the
consequences for failure to appear and pay the required fine within the
required time.
   (F)   An alleged violator receiving a municipal civil infraction violation
notice shall appear at the Bureau and pay the specified fine and costs at or by
the time specified for appearance in the municipal civil infraction violation
notice. An appearance may be made by mail, in person or by representation.
   (G)   If an authorized township official issues and serves a municipal
ordinance violation notice, and if an admission of responsibility is not made
and the civil fine and costs, if any, prescribed by the schedule of fines for
the violation are not paid at the Bureau, a municipal civil infraction citation
may be filed with the District Court and a copy of the citation may be served
by first class mail upon the alleged violator at the alleged violator’s last
known address. The citation filed with the District Court does not need to
comply in all particulars with the requirements for citations as provided by
this chapter, but shall consist of a sworn complaint containing the allegations
stated in the municipal ordinance violation notice and shall fairly inform the
alleged violator how to respond to the citation.
(Ord. 32, passed 7-9-2018)
§ 33.07  SCHEDULE OF CIVIL FINES/COSTS.
   Unless a different schedule of civil fines is provided for by an applicable
ordinance, the civil fines payable to the Bureau upon admissions of
responsibility by persons served with municipal ordinance violation notices
shall not exceed $500 per violation. In addition to the civil fines, costs in
the amount of $10 shall be assessed by the Bureau if the fine and costs are
paid within ten days of the date of service of the municipal ordinance
violation notice. Otherwise, costs of $20 shall be assessed by the Bureau. On
matters that proceed in District Court, attorney fees may be assessed in an
amount of up to $500 per violation.
(Ord. 32, passed 7-9-2018)
§ 33.08  RECORDS AND ACCOUNTING.
   The Bureau Clerk or other designated township official/employee shall retain
a copy of all municipal ordinance violation notices, and shall account to the
Township Board once a month or at such other intervals as the Township Board
may require concerning the number of admissions and denials of responsibility
for ordinance violations within the jurisdiction of the Bureau and the amount
of fines/costs collected with respect to such violations. The civil fines/costs
collected shall be delivered to the Township Treasurer at such intervals as the
Treasurer shall require, and shall be deposited in the general fund of the
township.
(Ord. 32, passed 7-9-2018)
§ 33.09  AVAILABILITY OF OTHER ENFORCEMENT OPTIONS.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require the township to initiate
its municipal civil infraction ordinance enforcement activity through the
issuance of an ordinance violation notice. As to each ordinance violation
designated as a municipal civil infraction, the township may, at its sole
discretion, proceed directly with the issuance of a municipal civil infraction
citation or take such other enforcement action as is authorized by law,
including, without limitation, injunctive relief or criminal enforcement.

decision that results in information being withheld. If the cable operator

denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the information will be stayed
pending review.
   (B)   Any interested party may file a request to inspect material withheld
as proprietary with the township. The township shall weigh the policy
considerations favoring non-disclosure against the reasons cited for permitting
inspection in light of the facts of the particular case. It will then promptly
notify the requesting entity and the cable operator that submitted the
information as to the disposition of the request. It may grant, deny or
condition a request. The requesting party or the cable operator may seek review
of the decision by filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Disclosure will
be stayed pending resolution of any appeal.

severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood, or
an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding, as defined in paragraph (a) of this definition.
      FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). An official map of community, issued by
the FEMA, where the boundaries of the flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) related
erosion areas having special hazards have been designated as Zone A, M and/or
E. (This is to be included only if the FEMA has issued a FHBM for the
community).
      FLOODPLAIN. Any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from
any source. (See definition of FLOODING.)

   (A)   Statement of purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of this district is to preserve, for agricultural
activity, to the greatest extent possible those areas in the township which
have been designated as essential agricultural lands in the township’s land use
plan, while allowing a limited amount of non-farm housing. To this end the
number of non-farm dwellings allowed on a parcel of land, which is a parcel of
record at the time this chapter is adopted, shall be based on a schedule of
density contained in §
154.044. However, it should be noted that the primary intended use of this
district is agricultural activities and that there may be odors, dust and noise
associated with these activities which are not compatible with residences.
      (2)   It is recognized that the public health and welfare of the citizens
of the township and the United States are greatly dependent upon the sustenance
and economic benefits provided by a viable agricultural industry. This district
is intended to ensure that land areas within the township which are well suited
for production of food and fiber are retained for such production, unimpeded by
the establishment of incompatible uses which would hinder agricultural
practices and irretrievably deplete agricultural lands.
      (3)   The Essential Agricultural District has the following specific
purposes and objectives:
         (a)   Protect prime farmland from speculative increases in land
values;
         (b)   Prevent fragmentation of farmlands by division into small
parcels;
         (c)   Prevent loss of prime farmland;
         (d)   Prevent conflicts between agricultural activities and
residences;
         (e)   Prevent encroachment of urban and suburban services into
agricultural areas;
         (f)   Minimize cost of providing services to rural areas;
         (g)   Encourage long-term investment in improvements needed to
maintain and expand agricultural production by creating a stable environment
for such production;
         (h)   Reduce the amount of land consumed in rural areas for
nonagricultural use;
         (i)   Prevent intrusion of uses into farm areas which are incompatible
with general farming activities; and
         (j)   Permit services which are necessary to support farming
activities.
      (4)   The Agricultural District is intended to be used in those parts of
the township which are designated for permanent agricultural use in the
township’s land use plan.

§ 154.038  SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT (R-1).
   (A)   Statement of purpose. The Single-Family Residential District is
established as a district in which the principal use is for single-family
dwellings. For the Single-Family Residential District, in promoting the general
purpose of this chapter, the specific intent is:
      (1)   To encourage the construction of, and the continued use of the land
for single-family dwellings;
      (2)   To prohibit business, commercial or industrial use of the land, and
to prohibit any other use which would substantially interfere with development
or continuation of single-family dwellings in the district;
      (3)   To encourage the discontinuance of existing uses that would not be
permitted as new uses under the provisions of this chapter;
      (4)   To discourage any land use which would generate traffic on minor or
local streets other than normal traffic to serve the residences on those
streets;
      (5)   To discourage any use which, because of its character or size,
would create requirements and costs for public services, such as fire and
police protection, water supply and sewage, substantially in excess of such
requirements and costs if the district were developed only for single-family
dwellings; and

(Ord. 1, passed 11-13-2000, § 3.10; Ord. 22, passed 7-13-2015)
§ 154.045  SPECIAL LAND USES.
   (A)   Intent. The formulation and enactment of this chapter is based upon
the division of the township into districts in each of which are permitted
specified uses which are mutually compatible. In addition to such permitted
compatible uses however, there are certain other uses which may be necessary or
desirable to allow in certain locations in certain districts, but because of
their actual or potential impact on neighboring uses or public facilities, need
to be carefully regulated with respect to their location and operation for the
protection of the township. Such uses, on account of their peculiar location
need or the nature of the service offered, cannot be reasonably allowed as a
permitted use, but are permitted as special land uses in accordance with this
section.
   (B)   Authority to grant permits. The Planning Commission as hereinafter
provided, shall have the authority to recommend to the Township Board to grant
special land use permits, subject to such conditions of design operation, and
safeguards as the Township Board may determine for all special land uses
specified in the various districts provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   Application and fee. Application for any special land use permit
permissible under the provisions of this chapter shall be made to the Planning
Commission through the Township Clerk by completion of an official special land
use permit application form, submitting a site plan in accordance with §§
154.100 through
154.108, submitting required data, exhibits and information and depositing the
required fee as established by resolution by the Township Board. No part of
such fee shall be returnable to the applicant.
   (D)   Data, exhibits and information required in application. An application
for a special land use permit shall contain the applicant’s name and address in
full, a statement that the applicant is the owner involved or is acting on the
owner’s behalf, the address of the property involved; an accurate survey
drawing of said property showing the existing and proposed location of all
structures thereon, the types thereof and their uses; and a statement of
supporting data, site plan, exhibits, information and evidence regarding the
required findings set forth in this chapter.
   (E)   Public hearings. After a preliminary review of the site plan and
application for a special land use permit, the Planning Commission shall hold a
public hearing. Notice of the public hearing shall be given by one publication
in a newspaper of general circulation in the township within 15 days, but not
less than five days next preceding the date of said hearing. Notice of public
hearing shall be sent at least ten days prior to the hearing to the owner of
the property in question, to all persons to whom any real property within 300
feet of the premises in question is assessed, and to occupants of all single-
and two-family dwellings within 300 feet. The property in question shall also
be conspicuously posted at least ten days prior to the hearing.
   (F)   Required standards and findings for making determination. The Planning
Commission shall review the site plan and the particular circumstances and
facts of each proposed use in terms of the following standards and required
findings, and shall find and record adequate data, information and evidence to
determine if such a use on the proposed site, lot or parcel meets the following
requirements:
      (1)   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general
objectives, intent and purposes of this chapter;
      (2)   Will be designed, constructed, operated, maintained and managed so
as to be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with existing or intended
character of the general vicinity;
      (3)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services, such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal or that the persons or agencies responsible for the
establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide adequately any such
service;
      (4)   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future
neighboring uses;
      (5)   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost
for public facilities and services; and
      (6)   All standard specific and applicable to special land uses
identified in other sections of this chapter shall apply.
   (G)   Determination and imposition of conditions. If the facts presented in
the application, and the review and hearing procedures established herein do no
reasonably establish that the findings and standards set forth in the chapter
will apply to the proposed use, the Planning Commission shall not recommend to
the Township Board that said Township Board grant a special land use permit. In
recommending that a special land use permit be granted, the Planning Commission
shall recommend such conditions of use as it deems necessary and reasonable,
and the reasons therefore to protect the best interest of the township and the
surrounding property owners and occupants to achieve the objectives of this
chapter. These conditions may include conditions necessary to ensure that
public services and facilities affected by proposed land use or activity will
be capable of accommodating increased service and facility loads caused by the
land use or activity, to protect the natural environment and conserve natural
resources and energy, to ensure compatibility with adjacent uses of land and to
promote the use of land in a socially and economically desirable manner.
   (H)   Approval, grant or permit.
      (1)   Upon holding a public hearing and the finding that the requirements
of divisions (A) through (F) above have been satisfactorily met by the
applicant, the Planning Commission shall, within 30 days, recommend approval,
approval with conditions or disapproval to the Township Board. When the Board
gives final approval, a special land use permit shall be issued to the
applicant.
      (2)   The Township Board shall, within 60 days, approve, approve with
condition or disapprove or such permit, and if approved, it shall forward
copies of this permit to the applicant, Clerk, Zoning Inspector and Planning
Commission.
      (3)   Approval and issuance of a special land use permit by the Township
Board shall signify prior approval of the application and site plan, therefore
including any modification and any conditions imposed where necessary to comply
with this chapter. The site plan, as approved, and any statements of conditions
and modifications shall become part of the special land use permit and shall be
enforceable as such.
      (4)   The decision to approve or disapprove a request for a special land
use permit shall be retained as a part of the record of action on the request
and shall incorporate a statement of conclusions which specify: the basis for
the decision; any changes to the originally submitted application and site plan
necessary to ensure compliance with the chapter; and any conditions imposed
with approval. Once a special land use permit is issued, all site development
and use of land on the property affected shall be consistent with the approved
special land use permit, unless a change conforming to chapter requirements
receives the mutual agreement of the landowner and the Township Board upon
recommendation of the Planning Commission and is documented as such. The
developer/owner shall agree in writing to the conditions set forth as
recommended to and approved by the Township Board by the Planning Commission.
Then, the Zoning Administrator shall not issue a zoning compliance permit until
he or she has received a copy of the special land use permit approved by the
Township Board and has determined that the stipulated conditions have been met.
   (I)   Voiding of special land use permit.
      (1)   Any special land use permit granted under this chapter shall become
null and void and fees forfeited unless construction and/or use is commenced
within a period of not more than 210 days and completed within a period of not
more than 575 days of the date of issuance. The period for initiating and
completion of said special land use shall be determined at the time that the
special land use permit is granted. No use provided for under the special land
use granted shall be initiated until all the terms and conditions of the
special land use permit are met.
      (2)   A violation of a requirement, condition or safeguard shall be
considered a violation of this chapter and grounds for the Township Board to
terminate and cancel such special land use permit.
   (J)   Performance guarantee. In authorizing a special land use permit, the
Township Board may require that a cash deposit, certified check, irrevocable
bank letter of credit, or surety bond be furnished by the developer to ensure
compliance with an approved site plan and the special land use permit
requirements. Such guarantee shall be deposited with the Township Clerk at the
time of the issuance of the special land use permit. In fixing the amount of
such performance guarantee, the Township Board shall limit the amount to
reasonable improvements required to meet the standards of this chapter and to
protect the natural resources or the health, safety and welfare of the
residents of the township and future users or inhabitants of the proposed
project or project area. These improvements may include, but are not limited to
roadways, lighting, utilities, sewer, water, screening and drainage. The term
“improvements” does not include the entire project which is the subject of
special land use permit approval not to improvements for which a performance
guarantee has been deposited pursuant to Public Act 288 of 1967, being M.C.L.A.
§§ 560.101 through 560.293, as amended. The Township Board and the project
developer shall establish an agreeable procedure for the rebate of any cash
deposits required under this section, in reasonable proportion to the ratio of
the work completed on the required improvements as work progresses. Said
agreement shall be written as an element of the conditions surround the
approval of the special land use permit.
(Ord. 1, passed 11-13-2000, § 3.11)
OUTDOOR SIGN REGULATIONS
§ 154.060  INTENT.
   (A)   The intent of this subchapter is to regulate the location, size,
construction and manner of display of signs and outdoor advertising in order to
minimize their harmful effects on the public health, safety and welfare. While
these regulations recognize that signs and outdoor advertising are necessary to
promote commerce and public information, failure to regulate them may lead to
poor identification of individual businesses, deterioration and blight of the
business and residential areas of the township, conflicts between different
types of land use, and reduction in traffic safety to pedestrians and
motorists.
   (B)   To achieve its intended purpose, this subchapter has the following
objectives:
      (1)   To prevent the placement of signs in a manner that will conceal or
obscure other signs or adjacent businesses;
      (2)   To keep the number of signs and sign messages at the level
reasonably necessary to identify a business and its products or services;
      (3)   To keep signs within a reasonable scale with respect to the
buildings they identify;
      (4)   To reduce visual distraction and obstructions to motorists
traveling along, entering or leaving streets;
      (5)   To promote a quality manner of display which enhances the character
of the township; and
      (6)   To prevent the proliferation of temporary signs which might promote
visual blight.

(Ord. 1, passed 11-13-2000, § 4.3)
§ 154.063  GENERAL CONDITIONS.

free ingress to or egress from any door, window or fire escape or prevent
ventilation.
      (4)   No signor associated landscaping shall be erected, placed or
allowed to grown on corner lots so as to impede the vision between a height of

the strict applications of the provisions of this chapter where by reason of
exceptional narrowness, shallowness, shape or contour of a specific tract of
land at the time of enactment of this chapter or by reason of exceptional
conditions of such property, the strict application of the regulations enacted

excluded or for which a conditional use permit is required
   (B)   A variance from terms of this chapter shall not be granted by the
Board of Appeals unless and until:

the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other
lands, structure or buildings in the same district;

the same district under the terms of this chapter;
         (c)   The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant;
         (d)   Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant

variance.
      (2)   The Board of Appeals shall determine that the requirements of the
chapter have been met by the applicant for a variance;
      (3)   The Board of Appeals shall determine that the reasons set forth in
the application justify the granting of the variance, and the variance is the
minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land,
building or structure;
      (4)   The Board of Appeals shall determine that the granting of the
variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this
chapter, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise
detrimental to public welfare;
      (5)   In granting any variance, the Board of Appeals may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.
Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter; and
      (6)   Each variance granted under the provisions of this chapter shall
become null and void unless:
         (a)   The construction authorized by such variance or permit has been

SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC
§ 157.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose and intent of this subchapter is to promote the use of solar
energy within the township as a clean, alternative energy source, and to
provide regulations that will protect public health, safety and welfare. Small
scale residential, industrial installations and large scale solar farms are
included in this subchapter.
(Ord. 30.0, passed 1-8-2017)
§ 157.02  RESIDENTIAL SOLAR INSTALLATIONS.
   (A)   Code compliance.  All solar energy installations shall be in
compliance with applicable building codes and the National Electric Code (NEC)
Article 690.
   (B)   Certified components. All components of a solar energy installation
shall be certified as Underwriter’s Laboratory (UL) listed, Electrical Testing
Laboratories (ETL) listed or certified by a similar certification organization
acceptable to the township.
   (C)   Application for zoning compliance permit of residential solar.
Residential solar installations require a zoning compliance permit. An
application for a zoning compliance permit shall include the following:
      (1)   Photographs of the property’s existing conditions;
      (2)   Renderings or catalog cuts of the proposed solar energy system;
      (3)   Plot/sketch plan to indicate where the solar energy system is to be
installed on the property (or, if building-mounted, the system’s location on
the permanent building), including property setbacks and the total solar
collector surface area;
      (4)   Elevations showing the height of the solar energy system:
         (a)   For ground-mounted solar systems, the height of the system above
ground;
         (b)   For pitched roof-mounted solar systems, the elevation must show
the highest finished height of the system and the height of the finished roof
surface on which it is mounted; and
         (c)   For flat roof-mounted solar energy systems, the elevations shall
show the highest finished height of the system and the highest point of the
roof, including any parapets on the building.
      (5)   Description of the screening to be provided for ground or building-
mounted solar energy equipment;
      (6)   Any solid and hazardous waste generated during installation or
removal of the PV system, shall be disposed of in accordance with local, state
and federal waste disposal regulations; and
      (7)   The PV panels shall be located to minimize reflected glare on
adjacent properties and roadways.
   (D)   Exclusions from zoning compliance permit. The following situation does
not require a zoning compliance permit, but shall still comply with all other
standards of this subchapter: repair and replacement of existing solar energy
equipment, provided that there is no expansion of the size or coverage area of
the solar energy system.
   (E)   Ground-mounted solar array. Ground-mounted solar arrays shall be
subject to the following additional standards:
      (1)   Setbacks. In all zoning districts, ground-mounted solar energy

least ten feet from the property line.
      (2)   Height. Ground-mounted solar energy systems shall not exceed 15
feet in height, measured from the ground at the base of such equipment to the
highest point of the system
      (3)   Wires. Wires shall be run underground from the array.
   (F)   Residential solar; property tax exclusion. Adding PV panels to a home
could be considered to increase the value of the house and hence increase the
property taxes. However, homeowners can be discouraged from installing PV due
to the long payback time. To combat this problem, homeowners will not be taxed
by the township for the installed costs of solar PV.
(Ord. 30.0, passed 1-8-2017)

§ 157.35  LIABILITY INSURANCE.
   The owner or operator of the private or commercial turbine project shall
maintain a current insurance policy with a bond rating acceptable to the
township to cover installation and operation of the turbine project. The amount
of the policy shall be established as a condition of conditional use permit
approval. For a private turbine project accessory to a principal residence,
proof of homeowners insurance with specific coverage for the turbine shall
satisfy this requirement.
(Ord. 30.2, passed 9-10-2018)
§ 157.36  ADDITIONAL STANDARDS FOR COMMERCIAL TURBINE PROJECTS.
   The following additional standards shall apply to all commercial wind energy
conversion systems in the township: towers and blades shall be painted any
neutral color that is acceptable to the township or otherwise required by law.
In compliance with FAA, it shall be the responsibility of the person in charge
of the commercial turbine project to complete the proper FAA applications and
obtain the proper permits for the turbine project. It shall also be the
responsibility of the person in charge of the commercial turbine project to
obtain a determination of no significant impact to air navigation from the FAA.
(Ord. 30.2, passed 9-10-2018)
§ 157.37  WARNINGS.
   A visible warning sign of “high voltage” may be required to be placed at the
base of all commercial turbine projects. The sign must have at a minimum six-
inch letters with 3/4-inch stroke. Such signs shall be located a maximum of 300
feet apart and at all points of site ingress and egress.
(Ord. 30.2, passed 9-10-2018)
§ 157.38  ANNUAL INSPECTION.
   Every commercial turbine project must be inspected annually by an authorized
factory representative or professional engineer to certify that it is in good
working condition and not a hazard to the public. Such records shall be
submitted to the township and considered a part of the continuing conditional
use permit.
(Ord. 30.2, passed 9-10-2018)
§ 157.39  COMPLIANCE WITH ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS.
   It shall be the responsibility of the person in charge of the commercial
turbine project to contact the FCC and FAA regarding additional permits
necessary, or any other applicable federal or state regulations for the
installation, prior to the township granting a conditional use permit.
(Ord. 30.2, passed 9-10-2018)
§ 157.40  MIGRATORY BIRDS.
   The township may require an avian study conducted by a qualified
professional to determine any potential impacts the commercial turbine project
may present to migratory birds. The study as part of the conditional use permit
must provide assurances that the turbine project does not negatively affect the
path of migratory birds.
(Ord. 30.2, passed 9-10-2018)
§ 157.41  DECOMMISSIONING PLAN AND ESCROW.
   The commercial turbine project must contain a decommissioning plan to ensure
it is properly decommissioned upon the end of the project life or facility
abandonment. Decommissioning shall include: removal of all structures
(including transmission equipment and fencing) and debris to a depth of four
feet, restoration of the soil, and restoration of vegetation within six months
of the end of project life or facility abandonment. The decommissioning plan
shall state how the facility will be decommissioned, the professional
engineer’s estimated cost of decommissioning, the financial resources to be
used to accomplish decommissioning, and the escrow agent with which the
resources shall be deposited. The decommissioning plan shall also include an
agreement between the applicant and the township that the financial resources
for decommissioning shall be in the form of a surety bond, or shall be
deposited in an escrow account with an escrow agent acceptable to the township.
The township shall have access to the escrow account funds for the expressed
purpose of completing decommissioning if decommissioning is not completed by
the applicant within six months of the end of project life or facility
abandonment. The township is granted the right of entry onto the site, pursuant
to reasonable notice, to effect or complete decommissioning. The township is
granted the right to seek injunctive relief to effect or complete
decommissioning, as well as the township’s right to seek reimbursement from
applicant or applicant successor for decommissioning costs in excess of the
amount deposited in escrow, and to file a lien against any real estate owned by
applicant or applicant’s successor, or in which they have an interest, for the
amount of the excess, and to take all steps allowed by law to enforce said
lien. Financial provisions shall not be so onerous as to make wind power
projects unfeasible.
