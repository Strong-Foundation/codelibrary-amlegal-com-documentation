   (a)    Any vacancy which occurs in the Council more than ninety days before

vote of the remaining members of the Council, said appointee to hold office
until the Monday following such election. At such election such vacancy shall
be filled for any balance of the unexpired original term.
   (b)   Any vacancy which occurs in the Council ninety days or less before the
next regular City election shall not be filled until on or after the Monday
next following such election and shall be then filled by the Council with like
effect as though it had occurred more than ninety days before a regular City
election.
   (c)   If any vacancy in the office of Councilman is not filled by the
Council as required by subsections (a) and (b) hereof, or if the number of
vacancies existing on the Council is such as to reduce the membership below a
quorum, the Clerk shall, forthwith, call a special City election for the
purpose of filling such vacancy or vacancies for the balance of the term or
terms thereof. Such election shall be held not less than forty-five days nor
more than sixty days after the date of the call thereof by the Clerk. Each such
election shall be governed by the provisions of Chapter 4 of this Charter,
except that no primary election shall be held in connection therewith and the
last day and time for filing nominating petitions in connection therewith shall
be at 5:00 P.M on the 30th day before the date of such election. The qualified
person or persons receiving the highest number of votes cast at such election
shall be deemed to have been elected to fill the vacancy or vacancies, as the
case may be, to be filled at such election and, upon canvass of the votes cast
at such election, shall be certified as such, subject to the provisions of law.
In the event that a special election cannot be held, as herein set forth and
required, because of the previous exhaustion of the number of special City
elections permitted by law, the Governor of the State of Michigan is hereby
authorized to and shall fill such vacancy or vacancies, as the case may be, for
a term of office expiring on the Monday following the next regular City
election. At such election, each such vacancy shall be filled for any balance
of the unexpired original term.

occurred.

vacancies resulting from recall.

the office or employment concerned. All officers and employees who receive,
distribute, or are responsible for City funds or investments shall be bonded.

thereof shall be paid by the City. No official bonds shall be issued for a term
exceeding three years, except bonds which are required of officers serving

except that the Clerk's bond, unless he is covered within the scope of a
blanket surety bond, shall be filed with the Treasurer.

of the City are to be served by the waiving of any such prohibition. No officer

organized and conducted for the purpose of developing any such code or
technical regulations, by reference thereto in an adopting ordinance and

codification available for public inspection and for distribution to the public
at a reasonable charge therefor and shall publish notice of the printing and

class mail, a notice of any increase over the previous year in the assessed
value over three hundred dollars of any property or of the addition of any

electors of the City but not City officers or employees and are to be appointed
annually by the City Council. The Assessor is to be Clerk of the Board of

shall have the same powers and perform like duties in all respects as are
confered by law upon and required of boards of review in townships, except as
otherwise provided in this Charter. It shall hear the complaints of all persons
considering themselves aggrieved by assessments, and, if it shall appear that
any person or property has been wrongfully assessed or omitted from the roll,
the Board shall correct the roll in such manner as it deems just. In all cases,
the roll shall be reviewed according to the facts existing on tax day and no
change in the status of any property after that day shall be considered by the
Board in making its decisions. Except as otherwise provided by law, no person,
other than the Board of Review, shall make or authorize any change upon, or
addition or corrections to, the assessment roll. It shall be the duty of the
Assessor to keep a permanent record of all proceedings of the Board and to

The omission of such endorsement shall not affect the validity of such roll.
CLERK TO CERTIFY TAX LEVY:
Section 10.12.
Within three days after the Council has adopted the budget for the ensuing
year, the Clerk shall certify to the Assessor the total amount which the
Council determines shall be raised by general ad valorem tax. He shall also
certify all amounts of current or delinquent special assessments and all other
amounts which the Council requires or orders to be assessed, reassessed, or
charged upon the said roll against any property or any person in accordance
with the provisions of this Charter or any ordinance of the City.
CITY TAX ROLL:
Section 10.13.
After the Board of Review has completed its review of the assessment roll, the
Assessor shall prepare a copy of the assessment roll, to be known as the "City
Tax Roll." Upon receiving the certification of the several amounts to be
raised, as provided in Section 10.12, the Assessor shall spread upon said tax
roll the several amounts determined by the Council to be charged, assessed, or
reassessed against persons or property. He shall also spread thereon the
amounts of the general ad valorem City tax, county tax, and school tax,
according to and in proportion to the several valuations set forth in said
assessment roll. To avoid fractions in computation of any tax roll, the
Assessor may add to the amount of the several taxes to be raised not more than
the amount prescribed by law. Any excess created thereby on any tax roll shall
belong to the City.
TAX ROLL CERTIFIED FOR COLLECTION:
Section 10.14.
After spreading the taxes the Assessor shall certify the tax roll, and shall
annex his warrant thereto directing and requiring the Treasurer to collect,
prior to March first of the following year, from the several persons named in
said roll the several sums mentioned therein opposite their respective names as
a tax, charge, or assessment, and granting to him, for the purpose of
collecting the taxes, assessments, and charges on such roll, all the statutory
powers and immunities possessed by township treasurers for the collection of
taxes. On or before June fifteenth, the roll shall be delivered to the
Treasurer for collection.
TAX LIEN ON PROPERTY:
Section 10.15.
On July first the taxes thus assessed shall become a debt due to the City from
the persons to whom they are assessed, and the amounts assessed on any interest
in real property shall become a lien upon such real property for such amounts
and for all interest and charges thereon, and all personal taxes shall become a
debt of, and first lien on all personal property of, such persons so assessed.
Such lien shall take precedence over all other claims, encumbrances, and liens
to the extent provided by law and shall continue until such taxes, interest,
and charges are paid.
TAXES DUE: NOTIFICATION THEREOF:
Section 10.16.
City taxes shall be due on July first of each year. The Treasurer shall not be
required to call upon the persons named in the City tax roll, nor to make
personal demand for the payment of taxes, but he shall (a) publish, between
June fifteenth and July first, notice of the time when said taxes will be due
for collection and the penalties and fees for late payment of same, and (b)
mail a bill to each person named in said roll, but in cases of multiple
ownership of property only one bill need be mailed.
   Failure on the part of the Treasurer to publish said notice or mail such
bills shall not invalidate the taxes on said tax roll nor release the person or
property assessed from the penalties and fees provided in this chapter in case
of late payment or non-payment of the same.
COLLECTION FEES AND INTEREST:
Section 10.17.
All taxes paid on or before October first of each year shall be collected by
the Treasurer without additional charge. On October first he shall add to all
the taxes paid thereafter a collection fee equal to one-half of one per cent of
the amount of said taxes, and on the first of each succeeding month he shall
add an additional one-half of one per cent of said taxes as a collection fee.

shall be a lien against the property to which the taxes themselves apply,
collectible in the same manner as the taxes to which they are added.
STATE, COUNTY, AND SCHOOL TAXES:
Section 10.18.
For the purpose of assessing and collecting taxes for State, county, and school
purposes, the City shall be considered the same as a township, and all
provisions of law relative to the collection of and accounting for such taxes
shall apply. For these purposes the Treasurer shall perform the same duties and
have the same powers as are granted and imposed upon township treasurers by
law.
PROTECTION OF CITY LIEN:
Section 10.19.
The City shall have power, insofar as the exercise thereof shall not conflict
with or contravene the provisions of law, to acquire such an interest in any
premises within the City, by purchase at any tax or other public sale, or by
direct purchase from or negotiation with the State of Michigan or the fee
owner, as may be necessary to assure to the City the collection of its taxes,
special assessments or charges which are levied against any lot or parcel of
real property or to protect the lien of the City therefor, and may hold, lease,
sell, or exchange the same. Any such procedure exercised by the City to assure
the collection of its taxes or the protection of its tax or other liens shall
be deemed to be for a public purpose. The Council may adopt any ordinance which
may be necessary to make this section effective.
DISPOSITION OF REAL PROPERTY HELD BY CITY:
Section 10.20.
The Council shall pass an ordinance providing for the care, custody, and
disposition of real property, or any interest therein, which it shall hereafter
acquire by reason of any action taken to protect the City's tax lien thereon.

property on the tax roll, remaining uncollected by the Treasurer on the first
day of March following the date when the roll was received by him shall be
returned to the County Treasurer, to the extent and in the same manner and with
like effect as provided by law for returns by township treasurers of township
and county taxes. Such returns shall include all the additional assessments,
charges, fees, penalties, and interest hereinbefore provided, which shall be
added to the amount assessed in said tax roll against each property or person.
The taxes, assessments, and charges thus returned shall be collected in the
same manner as other taxes returned to the County Treasurer are collected in
accordance with law, and shall be and remain a lien upon the property against
which they are assessed until paid.
CHAPTER 11

improvement, or in anticipation of the payment of any combination of such
special assessments, and to issue bonds therefor. Such special assessment bonds
may be solely an obligation of the special assessment district or districts or
may be both an obligation of the special assessment district or districts and a
general obligation of the City. All collections on each special assessment roll
or combination of rolls shall be set apart in a separate fund for the payment
of the principal and interest of the bonds issued in anticipation of the
payment of such special assessments, and shall be used for no other purpose.

taxation as shown by the last preceding assessment roll of the City: Provided,
however, that in the case of fire, flood or other calamity requiring an
emergency fund for the relief of the inhabitants of the City or for the
repairing or rebuilding of any Municipal buildings, works, bridges or streets,
the legislative body of the City may borrow money due in not more than five
years and in the amount not exceeding three-eighths of one per cent of the
assessed valuation of all the real and personal property in the City,
notwithstanding such loan may increase the indebtedness of the City beyond the
limitation fixed in this Charter: Provided, further, that in computing the net
bonded indebtedness for the purposes hereof, bonds issued in anticipation of
the payment of special assessments, even though they are also a general

publication or by registered mail addressed to the last known address of the
owner or owners of the land upon which such nuisance exists, or to the owner of
the building or structure itself, specifying the nature of the nuisance and
requiring such owner to abate or remove the nuisance promptly and within a time
to be specified by the Council, which shall be commensurate with the nature of
the nuisance. If at the expiration of the time limit in said notice, the owner
has not complied with the requirements thereof, or in any case where the owner
of the land or of the building or structure itself is not known, the Council
may order such hazard or nuisance abated by the proper department or agency of
the City, or may do the work by contract or by hire, and the cost of such
abatement shall be assessed against the lot, premises, or description of real
property upon which such hazard or nuisance is located by special assessment.
   The Council shall determine what amount or part of each such expense shall
be charged, and the person, if known, against whom, the premises upon which the
same shall be levied as a special assessment; and as often as the Council shall
deem it expedient, it shall require notice of all of the several amounts so
reported and determined to be given by the Clerk either by registered mail sent
to their last known address as shown on the assessment roll of the City, or by
publication. Such notice shall state the basis of the assessment, the cost
thereof and shall give a reasonable time, which shall not be less than thirty
days, in which payment shall be made. In all cases where payment is not made
within the time limit, the same shall be reported by the Clerk to the Assessor
who shall spread such amounts against the several persons or descriptions of
real property chargeable therewith on the next roll for the collection of City
taxes.
SIDEWALKS:

ordinance.

assessments levied shall be in proportion to the benefits derived from the
improvement.
PROCEDURE TO BE FIXED BY ORDINANCE:
Section 12.5.
The Council shall prescribe by ordinance the complete special assessment

any other matters concerning the making of improvement by the special
assessment method, subject to the provisions of this chapter.

fifty per cent of the number of owners of privately owned real property to be
assessed for any improvement, or in case of paving or similar improvements more
than fifty per cent of the number of owners of frontage to be assessed for any
such improvement, shall object in writing to the proposed improvement, the
improvement shall not be made by proceedings authorized by this chapter without
a five-seventh vote of the members of the Council, provided that this section
shall not apply to sidewalk construction.
INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS OF ASSESSMENTS:
Section 12.7.
The Council may provide for the payment of special assessments in annual
installments, not to exceed thirty in number, the first installment being due
upon confirmation of the roll and the deferred installments being due annually
thereafter or, in the discretion of the Council, may be spread upon and made a
part of each annual City tax roll thereafter until all are paid. Interest may
be charged upon deferred installments at a rate not to exceed six per cent per
year payable annually. Under any installment plan adopted, the whole or any
deferred installments with accrued interest to date of payment may be paid in
advance of the due dates established.
ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENT:
Section 12.8.
When any special assessment roll shall prove insufficient to meet the costs of
the improvements for which it was made, the Council may make an additional pro
rata assessment, but the total amount assessed against any one parcel of land
shall not exceed the value benefits received by said lot or parcel of land.
REFUNDS OF ASSESSMENTS:
Section 12.9.
The City Manager shall, within sixty days after the completion of each local or
special public improvement, compile the actual cost thereof and certify the
same to the Assessor who shall adjust the special assessment roll to correspond
therewith. Should the assessment prove larger than necessary by five per cent
or less, the same shall be reported to the Council which may place the excess
in the City treasury or make a refund thereof pro rata according to assessment.
If the assessment exceeds the amount necessary by more than five per cent, the
entire excess shall be credited to owners of property as shown by the City
assessment roll upon which such assessment has been levied, pro rata according

thirty days after the date of the meeting of the Council at which it is finally
determined to proceed with the making of the improvement in question, which
notice shall state the grounds on which the proceedings are to be contested, no
suit or action of any kind shall be instituted or maintained for the purpose of
contesting or enjoining the collection of such special assessments; and
regardless of whether or not any public improvement is completed in any special
district, no owner of real property located in such district shall be entitled
to commence any suit or action for the purpose of contesting or enjoining the
collection of any such special assessments after he has received the benefits
from the substantial completion of that portion of such public improvement for
which he is assessed.
REASSESSMENTS FOR BENEFITS:
Section 12.12.
Whenever the Council shall deem any special assessment invalid or defective for
any reason whatever, or if any court of competent jurisdiction shall have
adjudged such assessment to be illegal for any reason whatever, in whole or in
part, the Council shall have power to cause a new assessment to be made for the
same purpose for which the former assessment was made, whether the improvement
or any part thereof has been completed or not, and whether any part of the
assessment has been collected or not. All proceedings on such reassessment and
for the collection thereof shall be made in the same manner as provided for in
an original assessment. If any portion of the original assessment shall have
been collected and not refunded, it shall be applied upon the reassessment and
the reassessment shall to that extent be deemed satisfied. If more than the
amount reassessed shall have been collected, the balance shall be refunded to
the persons making such payments.
DELINQUENT SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS:
Section 12.13.
Special assessments and all interest and charges thereon, from the date of
confirmation of the roll, shall be and remain a lien upon the property assessed
of the same character and effect as the lien created by general law for State
and County taxes, and by this Charter for City taxes, until paid. From such
date and after confirmation as shall be fixed by the Council, the same
collection fees shall be collected on delinquent special assessments and upon
delinquent installments of such special assessments beginning on the following
October first of each year, as are provided by this Charter to be collected on
delinquent City taxes. Such delinquent special assessments shall be subject to
the same penalties, and the lands upon which the same are a lien shall be
subject to sale therefor, the same as are delinquent City taxes and the lands
upon which they constitute a lien.
LIEN NOT DESTROYED BY JUDGMENT:
Section 12.14.
No judgment or decree, or any act of the Council vacating a special assessment
shall destroy or impair the lien of the City upon the premises assessed, for

shall comply with the requirements of Section 13.2. No sale or purchase shall
be divided for the purpose of circumventing the dollar value limitation
contained in this section. The Council may authorize the making of public
improvements or the performance of any City work by any City agency, without
competitive bidding.
   (d)   Purchases shall be made from the lowest qualified bidder meeting
specifications, unless the Council shall determine that the public interest
will be better served by accepting a higher bid, sales shall be made to the

other than the lowest, is accepted, the Council shall set forth its reasons
therefor in its resolution accepting such bid.

Council may accept any part or parts which are not rejected. If, after two or
more opportunities for competitive bidding have been had, with like notice and
opportunity for bidding in each case, no bids have been received or the bids
that have been received were not satisfactory to the Council and were rejected
by it, the Council may endeavor to obtain new bids or may authorize the
Purchasing Officer or proper official of the City to negotiate in the open

lowest bid according to specifications, the reason for such action shall be set
forth in the resolution accepting such bid.

cover those payments which will be due in future fiscal years, but this
exception shall not apply to a contract for the purchase or construction of a
public improvement. Certification by the accounting officer of the City shall
be endorsed on each contract, agreement or purchase order requiring same or
shall be filed as an attachment or rider thereto.

the method of determining the persons to be laid off and in every case of
layoff for more than two weeks duration the appointing authority shall, not
less than fifteen days before the effective date thereof, give to the employee
a written statement of the reasons for such action and shall at the same time
file a copy thereof with the Personnel Director. In the case of layoffs of more
than two weeks duration the Personnel Board shall, upon the written request of
the laid-off employee made within ten days after the effective date of such
layoff, investigate such layoff. If it shall find as result of such
investigation that the layoff was made for reasons other than a material change
in duties or organization or a shortage or stoppage of work or a lack of funds,
or was not made in accordance with the method prescribed by the rules and
regulations for determining persons to be laid off, it shall so report to the
appointing authority, and the person so laid off shall thereupon be entitled to

by means of a provisional appointment. Such appointment shall expire when an
eligible list is prepared for the position or four months after it has been in

because of non-availability of eligibles for temporary work, the Personnel
Director may authorize the temporary appointment of any qualified individual to
be designated by the appointing authority. Successive temporary appointments of
the same person to the same position shall not total more than one year. The
acceptance or refusal by an eligible of a temporary appointment shall not
affect his standing on the list.

may either sustain or reverse such action and provided further, that the
transferee shall be required to pass a qualifying examination for his new
position.

deducted from the pension reserve covering the said pensions payable from funds
provided by the City and such pensions as may be provided by the pension
reserve so reduced shall be payable under the provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   In the event a person becomes entitled to pension benefits as the
result of accident or injury caused by the act of a third party, the City shall
be subrogated to the rights of the said person against such third party to the
extent of benefits which the City pays or becomes liable to pay.
RE-EXAMINATION OF DISABILITY BENEFICIARIES: (Nov. 8, 1977)
Section 19.29.
   (a)    At least once each year during the first five years following the
retirement of a member with a disability pension, and at least once in every
three year period thereafter, the Board may, and upon the disability
beneficiary's application shall, require any disability beneficiary who has not
attained his voluntary retirement age, to undergo a medical examination to be
made by or under the direction of the medical director. Should any disability
beneficiary, who has not attained his voluntary retirement age, refuse to
submit to such medical examination in any such period, his disability pension
may be discontinued by the Board and should such refusal continue for one year,
all his rights in and to his disability pension may be revoked by the Board. If
upon such medical examination of a disability beneficiary, the medical director
reports to the Board that the said beneficiary is physically able and capable
of resuming employment in the City service in his own department or, at his
option, in another department if a position be available at prevailing pay
scale of the position he held when disability incurred, he shall be returned to
such service and his disability retirement pension shall terminate: Provided,
that the report of the medical director is concurred in by the Board.
   (b)   A disability beneficiary who has been or shall be returned to active
service with the City as provided in this section, shall from the date of his
return again become a member of the retirement system and he shall contribute
to the retirement system thereafter in the same manner as he paid prior to his
disability retirement. Any prior service and membership service credited to him
at the date of his disability retirement shall be restored to full force and
effect. He shall be given membership service credit for the period he was
receiving a disability pension provided for in Section 19.24(a) of this
chapter. He shall not be given service credit for the period he was receiving a
disability retirement allowance provided for in Section 19.26 of this chapter.
   (c)   In the event a disability beneficiary engages in gainful occupation,
business, or employment prior to his attainment of voluntary retirement age and
the sum of his pay or earning from such occupation, business or employment and
his disability pension provided by this chapter, exceed the earnings limitation
amount specified in the next sentence then the amount of his disability pension
shall be reduced by the Board so that the sum of his disability pension and the
amount earned by him shall not exceed the earnings limitation amount. The
earnings limitation amount shall be equal to his final pay multiplied by the
following percentage: 100 per cent, plus two per cent for each full year,
excluding any fraction of a year, in the period from the effective date of his
retirement to the current July first. The earnings limitation amount shall be
recomputed each July first until the disability beneficiary attains voluntary
retirement age, after which it shall not apply.
   (d)   The benefits herein provided shall also apply to present disability
retirees.
REFUND OF ACCUMULATED CONTRIBUTIONS:
Section 19.30.
   (a)    Should any member cease to be an employee of the City (1) before
attaining his voluntary retirement age for reasons other than becoming a
beneficiary or dying, or (2) after attaining his voluntary retirement age and
not being entitled to a pension, he shall be paid all or part of the
accumulated contributions standing to his credit in the annuity savings fund as
he shall demand in writing.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, should any member die,
the amount of his accumulated contributions standing to his credit in the
annuity savings fund, at the date of his death, shall be paid to such person or
persons, having an insurable interest in his life, as he shall have nominated
by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board. If there be no
such designated person or persons surviving, his accumulated contributions
shall be paid to his legal representative.
   (c)   If any member dies intestate, without heirs, and without having
nominated a beneficiary, as provided in Paragraph (b) of this section, the
amount of his accumulated contributions standing to his credit in the annuity
savings fund, at the date of his death, may be used to pay his burial expense,
not to exceed a reasonable sum to be determined by the Board: Provided, that
the said deceased member leaves no other estate sufficient for such purpose.
   (d)   Payments of such refunds of accumulated contributions may be made in
monthly installments according to such rules and regulations as the Board shall
adopt.
ANNUITY SAVINGS FUND: (Nov. 5, 1974; Nov. 8, 1977)
Section 19.31.
   (a)    The annuity savings fund is hereby created. It shall be the fund in
which shall be accumulated, at regular interest, the contributions deducted
from the salaries or wages of members, and from which shall be paid refunds of
accumulated contributions as provided in this chapter.
   (b)   The contributions of a member to the annuity savings fund shall be
seven per cent of the salary or wages paid him by the City.
   (c)   The officer or officers responsible for making up the payroll shall
cause the contributions provided for in Paragraph (b) of this section to be
deducted from the salary or wages of each member on each and every payroll, for
each and every payroll period, so long as he remains a member in the employ of
the City. The members' contributions provided for herein shall be made
notwithstanding that the minimum pay provided by law for any member shall be
changed thereby. Each member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the
deductions made and provided for herein and payment of his salary or wages,
less said deductions or deduction, shall be a full and complete discharge and
acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for the services rendered by
the said member during the period covered by such payment. The officer or
officers responsible for making up the payroll shall certify to the City
Treasurer the amount of the contribution to be deducted from the salary or
wages of each member, for each and every payroll, and each of said amounts,
when deducted, shall be credited to the individual annuity savings fund account
of the member from whose salary or wages the said deduction was made.
   (d)   In addition to the contributions of a member, as hereinbefore
provided, a member may deposit in the annuity savings fund, by a single
conribution or by an increased rate of contribution as approved by the Board,
the amounts he may have withdrawn from and not repaid to the annuity savings
fund, together with regular interest from the date of withdrawal to the date of
repayment. In no case shall any member be given credit for service rendered
prior to the date he withdrew his accumulated contributions until he repays to
the annuity savings fund all amounts due said fund by him.
   (e)   Upon the retirement of a member, his accumulated contributions
standing to his credit in the annuity savings fund at the date of his
retirement shall be transferred to the annuity reserve fund. Except as
otherwise provided in this chapter, at the expiration of a period of four years
from and after the date an employee ceases to be a member, any balance of
accumulated contributions standing to his credit in the annuity savings fund,
unclaimed by the said member or his legal representative shall be transferred
to the pension reserve fund.
ANNUITY RESERVE FUND:
Section 19.32.
The annuity reserve fund is hereby created. The annuity reserve fund shall be
the fund from which shall be paid all annuities, and benefits in lieu of
annuities, payable as provided by the provisions of this chapter. Should any
disability beneficiary be returned to active service with the City, his annuity
reserve at the time shall be transferred from the annuity reserve fund to the
annuity savings fund and shall be credited to his individual account in the
said annuity savings fund.
PENSION RESERVE FUND: (April 16, 1966)
Section 19.33.
   (a)    The pension reserve fund is hereby created. The pension reserve fund
shall be the fund in which shall be accumulated reserves for the payment of all
pensions and other benefits payable from contributions made by the City, and
from which shall be paid all pensions, and benefits in lieu of pensions, to
members and beneficiaries of the retirement system. Contributions by the City
to the retirement system shall be made according to the provisions of
Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
   (b)   City's Contributions for New Members. Upon the basis of such mortality
tables, regular interest and other tables as the Board shall adopt, the actuary
shall annually compute the amount of the contributions which if paid annually
by the City during the prospective service of new members, will be sufficient
to provide the pension reserves required, at the time of their discontinuance
from City service, for the pensions to which they might be entitled or which
might be payable on their account. The Board shall report to the Council on or
before the first day of March of each year the amount of contributions to be
paid by the City during the ensuing fiscal year and the Council shall
appropriate and the City shall pay such amounts of contributions to the
retirement system during the ensuing fiscal year. When so paid, the amounts of
such contributions shall be credited to the pension reserve fund.
   (c)   City's Contributions For Original Members. Upon the basis of such
mortality tables, regular interest, and other tables as the Board shall adopt,
the actuary shall annually compute (1) the pension reserve liabilities for
pensions payable or which might be payable on account of service rendered or to
be rendered by original members, and (2) pensions payable to beneficiaries who
were original members and to the dependents of original members. The amount of
the pension liabilities so computed shall be amortized in such manner as the
Board shall determine, subject to the approval of the Council. The Board shall
report to the Council on or before the first day of March of each year, the
amount of contributions to be paid by the City during the ensuing fiscal year
and the Council shall appropriate and the City shall pay such amounts of
contributions to the retirement system during the ensuing fiscal year. When so
paid, the amounts of such contributions shall be credited to the pension
reserve fund.
   (d)   Deficiency Appropriations. If the amounts appropriated to the budget
in any year, as hereinbefore provided, be insufficient to pay in full the
amounts due in the said year to all beneficiaries of the retirement system, the
amount of such insufficiency shall thereupon be provided by the appropriating
authorities of the City: Provided, however, that in no event shall the City's
contribution in any fiscal year exceed fifteen per cent of the total
compensations paid to all officers and employees of the City during the
preceding fiscal year. In the event the total of the pensions payable from
funds provided by the City exceeds, in any fiscal year, the sum of the assets
credited to the pension reserve fund, and an amount which is fifteen per cent
of the total compensations paid to all officers and employees of the City
during the preceding fiscal year, the pension payable to each beneficiary
during the fiscal year shall be reduced on a pro rata basis, so that the total
of the pensions so reduced, payable in the said fiscal year, shall not exceed
the sum of assets credited to the pension reserve fund, and an amount which is
fifteen per cent of the total compensations paid to all officers and employees
of the City during the preceding fiscal year.
EXPENSE FUND:
Section 19.34.
The expense fund is hereby created. The expense fund shall be the fund to which
shall be credited all money provided by the City to pay the administrative
expenses of the retirement system, and from which shall be paid all expenses
necessary in connection with the administration of the retirement system.
INVESTMENT OF FUNDS:
Section 19.35.
   (a)    The Board shall be the trustees of the retirement system and shall
have full power to invest and reinvest such funds, subject to all terms,
conditions, limitations and restrictions imposed by the State of Michigan upon
life insurance companies in the making and disposing of their investments,
except that notes, bonds, or obligations of the City of Wayne, shall not be
subject to said conditions, limitations and restrictions, and except that no
funds of the retirement system shall be invested in the stock of any company,
association or corporation. The Board shall have full power to purchase notes,
bonds, or other obligations of the City of Wayne, at any legally conducted
public or private sale. The Board shall have full power to hold, purchase,
sell, assign, transfer and dispose of any securities and investments in which
any of the funds of the retirement system have been invested, as well as the
proceeds of the said investments and any moneys belonging to the retirement
system.
   (b)   There shall be kept on deposit, available cash not exceeding ten per
cent of the total assets of the retirement system. All funds of the retirement
system shall be held for the sole purpose of meeting disbursements for
pensions, annuities, and other payments authorized by the provisions of this
chapter and shall be used for no other purpose. The description of the various
funds of the retirement system shall be interpreted to refer to the accounting
records of the retirement system and not to the segregation of moneys in the
various funds of the retirement system.
ALLOWANCE OF REGULAR INTEREST:
Section 19.36.
At the end of each fiscal year, the Board shall allow regular interest (1) on
the mean amount of assets credited to the annuity reserve fund, and (2) on the
balance standing to each member's credit in the annuity savings fund at the
beginning of the said fiscal year. The amounts of interest so allowed and
credited by the Board shall be payable from interest and other earnings on the
funds of the retirement system. Any additional amounts required to credit
regular interest as provided herein shall be charged to the pension reserve
fund, and all interest and other earnings on the funds of the retirement system
in excess of such requirements shall be credited to the pension reserve fund.
METHOD OF MAKING PAYMENTS:
Section 19.37.
All payments from the funds of the retirement system shall be made according to
the provisions of Charter and ordinance governing the disbursements of moneys
from the City's General Fund: Provided, that no such payment shall be made from
the funds of the retirement system unless such payment has been previously
authorized by a resolution adopted by the Board.
ASSIGNMENTS PROHIBITED:
Section 19.38.
The right of a person to an annuity, a pension, a retirement allowance, to the
return of accumulated contributions, the annuity, the pension, or the
retirement allowance itself, any optional benefit, any other right accrued or
accruing to any member or beneficiary under the provisions of this chapter and
the moneys belonging to the retirement system, shall be un-assignable and shall
not be subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, the operation of
bankruptcy or insolvency law, or any other process of law whatsoever, except as
is specifically provided by the provisions of this chapter: Provided, that the
City shall have the right of setoff for any claim arising from embezzlement or
by fraud of a member.
ERRORS:
Section 19.39.
Should any change or error in the records result in any member or beneficiary
receiving from the retirement system more or less than he would have been
entitled to receive had the records been correct, the Board shall correct such
error and as far as practicable shall adjust the payment of the benefit in such
a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the said member
or beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid.
SOCIAL SECURITY LAW:
Section 19.40.
In the event the employees, or any group of employees, in the employ of the
City become covered under the Federal social security old age, survivors, and
disability insurance program on account of their City employment, the
provisions of this chapter with respect to conditions affecting coverage,
benefits, and financing may be modified in such manner as the Council shall
determine by ordinance, providing that such coverage and benefits are not less
than presently in force.
SUCCESSION:
Section 19.41.
The retirement system of the City of Wayne and the trustees thereof shall
succeed to all rights, duties and obligations, and the members thereof shall be
entitled to credit for all rights and benefits accrued, now or hereafter
existing by virtue of the retirement system of the Village of Wayne.

ownership interest in the property where the emergency response occurred. The
City shall also have the right to bring an action in the appropriate court to
collect such costs if it deems such action to be necessary.

proximity thereto, large groups of persons engaged in rioting, looting and the

groups of persons is likely to require extraordinary measures to quell, subdue
or control the same, including an appeal to the civil authority of the
surrounding communities for additional police personnel to meet such
conditions. Having received such report from the Deputy Director, the Mayor, or
in his or her absence, the Mayor Pro-Tempore, is hereby authorized to proclaim

(Ord. 6. Passed 4-17-62.)
218.03 IMPROVEMENT PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Initiatory Resolution. When, by the provisions of the City Charter and
the laws of the State, Council has power to make a public improvement by
special assessment, it shall, by resolution, set forth the improvement intended
to be made and direct the City Manager to prepare a report, with the assistance
of the City Engineer, containing any information it may request concerning such
improvement.
   (b)   Plans and Specifications. The City Manager shall request the Engineer
to prepare, or cause to be prepared, plans and specifications of the
improvement to be made, an estimate of the life of the improvement and of the
cost thereof, plats of the lands affected thereby, and such other information
as Council may request.
   (c)   Manager's Report. The Manager shall prepare his or her report and
include in it a schedule of all property affected by the proposed improvement,
listing the assessed valuation, tax delinquencies, whether land is vacant or
improved, pertinent information on such parcels as are owned by public
authorities, and such other information as Council may request. The Manager
shall then present such report to Council along with the plans and
specifications of the Engineer, together with his or her recommendation as to
what proportion of the cost should be paid by special assessment and what part,
if any, should be a general obligation of the City, the number of installments
in which the assessment should be spread and the lands which should be included
in the special assessment district.
   (d)   Notice of Hearing. After the filing of the report and plans and
specifications referred to herein, Council shall, by resolution, order the same
filed with the Clerk and provide for a public hearing before Council on the
improvement to be made, which hearing shall be not held less than one week
after notice thereof has been given by first class mail to the owner of each
lot or parcel of land affected thereby at his or her address or the address
shown on the last tax roll of the City or by publication at least once in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City, to be designated by Council, or
by posting notices thereof for the same length of time in three public places
within the City.
   (e)   Public Hearing; Objections and Changes. At the time and place
specified in such notice for the public hearing, Council shall meet and hear
any person to be affected by the proposed public improvement. The hearing may
be adjourned from time to time by Council and Council may make such changes in
the proposed work or assessment which seem reasonable or proper in view of any
objections, or for any other reason which may appear to be for the best
interests of the City. However, if the improvements intended to be made are
enlarged upon or additions made to the district to be assessed, the same shall
not be done until after another hearing is held pursuant to notice as required
for original hearings.
   (f)   Resolution of Determination. After the public hearing, Council may, by
resolution, determine to make the improvement and defray the whole or any part
of the cost of the improvement by special assessment upon the property
especially benefited in proportion to the benefits derived, or to be derived,
and designate whether it is to be assessed according to frontage or on another
basis. By such resolution, Council shall approve the plans and specifications
for the improvements, determine the number of installments in which assessments
may be paid, determine the rate of interest to be charged on installments, not
to exceed six percent per year, designate the district or land and premises
upon which special assessments shall be levied, direct the Assessor to prepare
a special assessment roll in accordance with Council's determination, and
designate the name by which the assessment roll shall be known and referred to.
   (g)   Special Assessment Roll. The Assessor shall thereupon prepare a
special assessment roll, including all lots and parcels of land within the
special assessment district designated by Council, and shall assess to each
such lot or parcel of land such relative portion of the whole sum to be levied
against all the lands in the special assessment district as the benefit to such
lot or parcel of land bears to the total benefits to all lands in such
district. There shall also be entered upon such roll the amount which has been
assessed to the City at large.
   (h)   Certificate of Assessor. When the Assessor has completed such
assessment roll, he or she shall attach thereto, or endorse thereon, his or her
certificate to the effect that the roll has been made by him or her pursuant to
a resolution of Council (giving the date of adoption of the same) and that in
making the assessments therein, he or she has, as near as may be, according to
his or her best judgment, conformed in all respects to the directions contained
in such resolution, to the City Charter and to the provisions of this chapter.
Thereupon, the Assessor shall file the special assessment roll with the Clerk
who shall present the same to Council.
   (i)   Notice of Hearing on Roll. Upon receipt of such special assessment
roll, Council shall order it filed in the office of the Clerk for public
examination and shall, by resolution, fix the time and place when Council will
meet and review such roll, which meeting shall be held not less than one week
after notice thereof, specifying the purpose, time and place, has been given by
first class mail to the owner of each lot or parcel of land affected thereby at
his or her address or the address shown on the last tax roll of the City, or by
publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City, to

assessment roll at the time and place appointed or at an adjourned date
therefor and shall consider any written objections thereto.
   (l)   Objection to Improvement. If, at or prior to final confirmation of any
special assessment, more than fifty percent of the number of owners of
privately owned real property to be assessed for any improvement, or, in the
case of paving or similar improvements, more than fifty percent of the number

confirmation upon each special assessment roll and upon confirmation such roll
shall be final and conclusive.
   (p)   Contractual Provisions. If all persons or property owners to be
affected by any proposed improvement agree that such proposed improvement be
made and that a special assessment be levied in connection therewith, the City
may, in lieu of the foregoing procedure, enter into a written contract with all

(Ord. 6. Passed 4-17-62; Ord. 2009-06. Passed 4-21-09.)
218.04 HAZARD OR NUISANCE PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Resolution and Notice. When any lot, parcel of land, building or
structure within the City, because of the accumulation of refuse or debris, the
uncontrolled growing of noxious weeds, or age or dilapidation, or because of
any other condition or happening, becomes, in the opinion of Council, a public
hazard or nuisance, which is dangerous to the health, safety or welfare of the
inhabitants of the City or of those residing or habitually going near such lot,
parcel of land, building or structure, Council may, after investigation, by
resolution, determine that a hazard or nuisance exists, prescribe a form of
notice and direct the Clerk to give such notice by first class mail addressed
to the owner of the land upon which such nuisance exists or to the owner of the
building or structure itself at his or her address or the address shown on the
last tax roll of the City or by publication at least once in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City, to be designated by Council, or by posting
notice thereof for the same length of time in three public places within the
City, to abate such nuisance or remove such hazard.
   (b)   Contents of Notice. The notice to abate or remove the hazard or
nuisance shall specify the nature of the hazard or nuisance, describe the
property on which the same is located, require the owner to abate or remove the
hazard or nuisance promptly and designate a time within which the same shall be
abated or removed, which time shall be commensurate with the nature of the
hazard or nuisance.
   (c)   Removal by City. If, at the expiration of the time limit specified in
the notice to abate or remove the hazard or nuisance, the owner has not
complied with the requirements thereof, or in any case where the owner of the
land or of the building or structure itself is not known, Council may, by
resolution, order such hazard removed or nuisance abated under the direction of
the City Manager by the proper department or agency of the City, or may cause
the work to be done by contract or by hire.
   (d)   Manager's Duties. The City Manager shall take all steps necessary to
carry out the directions of Council in removing a hazard or abating a nuisance,
shall keep or cause to be kept an accurate record of all expense in connection
therewith and, upon completion of the work to be performed, shall submit a
report of the work done, and of all expenses in connection therewith, to
Council.
   (e)   Assessment of Costs. Council shall, by resolution, after examination
of the Manager's report, determine what amount or part of each such expense
shall be charged, the person, if known, against whom the charge shall be
assessed, and the premises upon which the same shall be levied as a special
assessment, and shall require notice of all the amounts so reported and
determined to be given by the Clerk by first class mail to the owner of each
lot or parcel of land at his or her address or the address shown on the last
tax roll of the City, or by publication at least once in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City, or by posting notice thereof for the same length of
time in three public places within the City, to be designated by Council. Such
notice shall state the basis of the assessment and the cost thereof and shall
give a reasonable time, which shall not be less than thirty days, within which
payment shall be made. In all cases where payment is not made within the time
limit, the same shall be reported by the Clerk to the Assessor who shall spread
such amounts against the several persons or descriptions of real property
chargeable therewith on the next roll for the collection of City taxes.
   (f)   Certificate of Assessor. When the Assessor has completed such
assessment roll, he or she shall attach thereto and endorse thereon his or her
certificate to the effect that the roll has been made by him or her pursuant to
a resolution of Council, giving the date of adoption of the same, and that in
making the assessments therein, the Assessor has, as near as may be, according
to his or her best judgment, conformed in all respects to the directions
contained in such resolution and the City Charter. The Assessor shall thereupon
file such special assessment roll with the Clerk.
   (g)   Corrections and Confirmation of Roll. Council may correct the roll as
to any assessment or description of any lot or parcel of land or other errors
appearing therein. Any changes made in the roll shall be noted in the Council
minutes. Council shall thereupon confirm such special assessment roll with such
corrections as may have been made and the Clerk shall endorse the date of
confirmation thereon. Upon confirmation, such roll shall be final and
conclusive.
(Ord. 6. Passed 4-17-62; Ord. 2009-06. Passed 4-21-09.)
218.05 SIDEWALK AND DRIVEWAY APPROACH PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Construction. Sidewalks, except crosswalks, and driveway approaches
shall be built and maintained by the owners of platted lands within the City in
the public streets adjacent to and abutting upon such lots and premises
according to plans and specifications approved by the City Engineer.
   (b)   Initiatory Resolution. When, in the opinion of Council, any sidewalk
or driveway approach needs to be constructed, rebuilt or repaired, it shall, by
resolution, direct the Manager to prepare a report, with the assistance of the
Engineer, containing any information Council may request concerning such work.
   (c)   Plans and Specifications. The Manager shall request the Engineer to
prepare or cause to be prepared plans and specifications of the work to be
done, a schedule of the lands affected and such other information as Council
may have requested.
   (d)   Report of Manager. The Manager shall prepare his or her report and
include in it a schedule of all property affected by the work proposed to be
done, pertinent information on such parcels as are owned by public authorities,
and such other information as Council may have requested, and shall present it
to Council along with the plans and specifications of the Engineer, together
with his or her recommendation as to what part, if any, should be a general
obligation of the City, the number of installments in which the assessment
should be spread and the lands which should be included in the special
assessment district.
   (e)   Alternate Procedure. When, in the opinion of the Manager, any sidewalk
or driveway approach needs to be constructed, rebuilt or repaired, he or she
may request the Engineer to prepare or cause to be prepared plans and
specifications of the work needed to be done and a schedule of the lands
affected and the Manager shall submit such information, along with his or her
report and recommendations, to Council, in the same manner as though Council
had requested it.
   (f)   Resolution of Determination. After reviewing the plans and
specifications and the report of the Manager, Council shall, if it so desires,
determine, by resolution, that the work be done, setting forth the details
concerning it, prescribe a form of notice and direct the Clerk to give such
notice by first class mail to the owner of each lot or parcel of land affected
thereby at his or her address or the address shown on the last tax roll of the
City or by publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in
the City, to be designated by Council or by posting notice thereof for the same
length of time in three public places within the City.
   (g)   Contents of Notice. The notice shall specify the extent of the work to
be done, describe the property affected by the work, require the owner to
perform the work promptly in accordance with the plans and specifications of
the Engineer and designate a time within which the same shall be done.
   (h)   Work Done by City. If, at the expiration of the time limit specified
in the notice, within which the work must be done, the owner has not complied
with the requirements thereof, Council shall, by resolution, order such
sidewalk or driveway approach to be constructed, rebuilt or repaired under the
direction of the Manager by the proper department or agency of the City, or may
do the work by contract or by hire.
   (i)   Manager's Duties. The Manager shall take all steps necessary to carry
out the direction of Council in performing the work ordered, shall keep, or
cause to be kept, an accurate record of all expense in connection therewith
and, upon completion of the work to be performed, shall submit a report of the
work done, and of all expenses in connection therewith, to Council.
   (j)   Assessment of Costs. Council shall, by resolution, after examination
of the Manager's report, determine what amount or part of each such expense
shall be charged, the person, if known, against whom such charge shall be
assessed, and the premises upon which the same shall be levied as a special
assessment. By such resolution, Council shall determine the number of
installments in which the assessment may be paid, determine the rate of
interest to be charged on installments, not to exceed six percent per year,
designate the district or land and premises upon which special assessments
shall be levied, direct the Assessor to prepare a special assessment roll in
accordance with Council's determination, and designate the name by which the
assessment roll shall be known and referred to.
   (k)   Special Assessment Roll. The Assessor shall thereupon prepare a
special assessment roll including all lots and parcels of land within the
special assessment district designated by Council and shall assess to each such
lot or parcel of land such sums as may have been directed by Council.
   (l)   Certificate of Assessor. When the Assessor has completed such
assessment roll, he or she shall attach thereto and endorse thereon his or her
certificate to the effect that such roll has been made by him or her pursuant
to a resolution of Council, giving the date of adoption of the same, and that
in making the assessments therein the Assessor has, as near as may be,
according to his or her best judgment, conformed in all respects to the
directions contained in such resolution, the City Charter and this chapter.
Thereupon, the Assessor shall file the special assessment roll with the Clerk
who shall present the same to Council.
   (m)   Notice of Hearing on Roll. Upon receipt of such special assessment
roll, Council shall order it filed in the office of the Clerk for public
examination and shall, by resolution, fix the time and place when Council will
meet and review such roll, which meeting shall be held not less than one week
after notice thereof, specifying the purpose, time and place, has been given by
first class mail to the owner of each lot or parcel of land affected thereby at
his or her address or the address shown on the last tax roll of the City, or by
publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City, to
be designated by Council, or by posting notice thereof for the same length of
time in three public places within the City.
   (n)   Hearing on Objections. Council shall meet and review the special
assessment roll at the time and place appointed or at an adjourned date
therefor and shall consider any written objections thereto.
   (o)   Corrections and Changes. Council may correct the roll as to any
assessment or description of any lot or parcel of land or other errors
appearing therein. Any changes made in such roll shall be noted in the Council
minutes.
   (p)   Confirmation of Roll. After such hearing, Council shall confirm such
special assessment roll with such corrections as may have been made and the
Clerk shall endorse the date of confirmation thereon. Upon confirmation, such
roll shall be final and conclusive.
   (q)   Alternate Proceeding Under Improvement Procedure. Council may, if it
so desires, disregard the proceedings under this section and proceed entirely
under Section 218.03, either as an individual improvement program or in
conjunction with any other improvement program.
(Ord. 6-A-1. Passed 6-15-65; Ord. 2009-06. Passed 4-21-09.)
218.06 SINGLE LOT PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Report of Manager. When any expense has been incurred by the City upon
or with respect to any single lot or parcel of land, which expense is
chargeable against such lot or parcel of land and the owner thereof by any City
Charter provision or ordinance of the City or the laws of the State, and is not
of that class required to be prorated among several lots or parcels of land in
a special assessment district, the amount of labor and material or any other
expense or service for which such expense was incurred, with a description of
the lot or parcel of land upon or with respect to which the expense was
incurred, and the name of the owner, if known, shall be reported by the City
Manager to Council.
   (b)   Resolution of Determination. After reviewing the report of the
Manager, Council may, if it so desires, determine by resolution what amount or
part of each such expense shall be charged, and the person, if known, against
whom, and the premises upon which, the same shall be levied as a special
assessment. By such resolution, Council shall determine the number of
installments in which the assessment may be paid, determine the rate of
interest to be charged on installments, not to exceed six percent per year,
designate the land and premises upon which the special assessment shall be
levied, direct the Assessor to prepare a special assessment roll in accordance
with Council's determination, designate the name by which the assessment roll
shall be known and referred to, and, as often as Council deems expedient,
require notice of the several amounts so reported and determined to be given by
the Clerk, by first class mail sent to the last known address of the owner as
shown on the assessment roll of the City, or by publication or by posting
notice thereof for the same length of time in three public places within the
City.
   (c)   Special Assessment Roll. The Assessor shall thereupon prepare a
special assessment roll, including all lots and parcels of land within the
special assessment district designated by Council, and shall assess to each
such lot or parcel of land such sums as may have been directed by Council.
   (d)   Certificate of Assessor. When the Assessor has completed such
assessment roll, he or she shall attach thereto and endorse thereon his or her
certificate to the effect that the roll has been made by him or her pursuant to
a resolution of Council (giving the date of adoption of the same) and that in
making the assessments therein the Assessor has, as near as may be, according
to his or her best judgment, conformed in all respects to the directions
contained in such resolution, the City Charter and this chapter. Thereupon, the
Assessor shall file the special assessment roll with the Clerk who shall
present the same to Council.
   (e)   Notice of Hearing on Roll. Upon receipt of such special assessment
roll, Council shall order it filed in the office of the Clerk for public
examination and shall, by resolution, fix the time and place when Council will
meet and review such roll, which meeting shall be held not less than one week
after notice thereof, specifying the purpose, time and place, has been given by
first class mail to the owner of each lot or parcel of land affected thereby at
his or her address or the address shown on the last tax roll of the City, and
by publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City,
to be designated by Council, or by posting notice thereof for the same period
of time in three public places within the City.

assessment roll at the time and place appointed or at an adjourned date
therefor and shall consider any written objections thereto.

assessment or description of any lot or parcel of land or other errors
appearing therein. Any changes made in such roll shall be noted in the Council
minutes.

special assessment roll, with such corrections as may have been made, and the
Clerk shall endorse the date of confirmation thereon. Upon confirmation, such
roll shall be final and conclusive.
(Ord. 6. Passed 4-17-62; Ord. 2009-06. Passed 4-21-09.)
218.07 SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS AS LIENS.
   (a)   Lien Established. Special assessments and all interest and charges
thereon, from the date of confirmation of the roll, shall be and remain a lien
upon the property assessed of the same character and effect as the lien created
by general law for State and County taxes or by the City Charter for City
taxes, until paid.
   (b)   Character of Lien. All liens above referred to shall be of the same
character and effect as the lien created by the City Charter for taxes and
shall include accrued interest and penalties.
   (c)   Destruction or Impairment of Lien. No judgment or decree, nor any
action of Council vacating a special assessment, shall destroy or impair the
lien of the City upon the premises assessed for such amount of the assessment
as may be equitably charged against the same or as by regular mode of
proceeding might have been lawfully assessed thereon.
   (d)   Failure to Receive Notice. Failure of any owner to receive any notice
required to be sent under the provisions of the City Charter and this chapter
shall not invalidate any special assessment or special assessment roll.
   (e)   Personal Liability of Owner. In addition to the property tax lien
created hereunder, any special assessment levied by the City shall constitute a
debt owed to the City from the owner of the lot or parcel of land assessed and
may be collected in the same manner as any contracted debt or in the manner
provided by law for the collection of personal property taxes.
(Ord. 6. Passed 4-17-62.)
218.08 INSTALLMENTS AND COLLECTION OF LIEN.
   (a)   Installments. Annual installments shall not exceed thirty in number,
as Council may determine at the time of confirmation of the roll, and if a
division of the assessment operates to make any installment less than ten
dollars ($10.00), the Assessor shall reduce the number of installments so that
each installment is above and as near to ten dollars ($10.00) as possible.
   (b)   Due Date. All special assessments levied under this chapter shall
become due upon confirmation of the special assessment roll. If payment is to
be made in annual installments, Council shall determine the first installment
to be due upon confirmation of the roll, and deferred installments to be due
annually thereafter or, at the discretion of Council, they may be spread upon
and made a part of each annual City tax roll thereafter until all are paid.
   (c)   First Installment Spread. The first installment of any special
assessment shall be spread upon a special City tax roll in a column headed
"Special Assessment," or upon the next annual tax roll at the direction of
Council. If spread upon a special tax roll, the assessment may be paid at any
time, without penalties, within three months from the date of confirmation. If
unpaid on or before the three-month period, it shall be added to and made a
part of the following July 1 tax roll, together with interest as provided
thereon.
   (d)   Annual Installment Spread. Annual installments shall be spread
thereafter either on a special assessment roll or on the annual City tax roll,
as may have been directed by Council, in the same manner and subject to the
same provisions as provided for first installments.
   (e)   Publication of Notice to Pay. The assessment roll shall be transmitted
by the Clerk to the Treasurer for collection immediately after confirmation,
and if it is not a part of the annual tax roll, the Treasurer may give notice
by publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation that such
special assessment roll (describing it) has been filed in the Treasurer's
office and specifying when and where payments may be made thereon.
   (f)   Notice by Mail. As an alternative to subsection (e) herein, the
Treasurer may mail statements of the seveal assessments to the respective
owners, as indicated by the records of the Assessor, of the several lots or
parcels of land assessed, stating the amount of the assessment and the manner
in which it may be paid. However, failure to mail any such statement shall not
invalidate the assessment or entitle the owner to an extension of time within
which to pay the assessment.
   (g)   Collection Fees and Penalties. After the confirmation of any special
assessment roll, the same collection fees shall be collected on delinquent
special assessments and upon delinquent installments of such special
assessments, beginning on the first day of the fourth month following the due
date, as are provided by the City Charter for the collection of delinquent City
taxes.
   (h)   Contested Assessments. Except and unless notice is given to Council in
writing of an intention to contest or enjoin the collection of any special
assessment for the construction of any pavement, sewer or other public
improvement, the construction of any sidewalk, or the removal or abatement of
any public hazard or nuisance, within thirty days after the date of the meeting
of Council at which it is finally determined to proceed with the making of the
improvement in question, which notice shall state the grounds on which the
proceedings are to be contested, no suit or action of any kind shall be
instituted or maintained for the purpose of contesting or enjoining the
collection of such special assessments, and regardless of whether or not any
public improvement is completed in any special assessment district, no owner of
real property located in such district shall be entitled to commence any suit
or action for the purpose of contesting or enjoining the collection of any such
special assessments after he or she has received the benefits from the
substantial completion of that portion of such public improvement for which he
or she is assessed.
(Ord. 6. Passed 4-17-62; Ord. 2009-06. Passed 4-21-09.)
218.09 REBATES, REASSESSMENTS AND ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS.
   (a)   Certification. The Manager shall, within sixty days after the
completion of each local or special public improvement, compile the actual cost
thereof and certify the same to the Assessor who shall adjust the special
assessment roll to correspond therewith.
   (b)   Additional Assessments. When any special assessment roll proves
insufficient to pay the cost of the improvement for which it was made, Council
may make an additional pro rata assessment, but the total amount assessed
against any one parcel of land shall not exceed the value benefits received by
such lot or parcel of land.
   (c)   Assessment Refunds. Should the assessment prove larger than necessary
by five percent or less, the same shall be reported to Council which may place
the excess in the City Treasury or make a refund thereof pro rata according to
assessment. If the assessment exceeds the amount necessary by more than five
percent, the entire excess shall be credited to owners of property, as shown by
the City assessment roll, upon which the assessment has been levied, pro rata
according to assessment.
   (d)   Refund Procedure on Installments. Any excess refund, where payment in
full has not been received, shall be made by credit against future unpaid
installments in the inverse order in which they are payable, to the extent that
such installments exist, and the balance of such refund shall be made in cash.
   (e)   Restriction Against Refund. No refund of a special assessment shall be
made which impairs or contravenes the provisions of any outstanding obligation
or bond secured in whole or in part by such special assessment.
   (f)   Illegal or Invalid Assessments. Whenever Council deems that any
special assessment is invalid or defective for any reason whatsoever, or if any
court of competent jurisdiction has adjudged such assessment to be illegal, for
any reason whatsoever, in whole or in part, Council may cause a new assessment
to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was made,
whether the improvement or any part thereof has been completed or not, and
whether any part of the assessment has been collected or not.
   (g)   Proceedings on Reassessment. All proceedings on reassessments and for
the collection thereof shall be made in the same manner as provided in an
original assessment and if any portion of the original assessment has been
collected and not refunded, it shall be applied upon the reassessment and the
reassessment shall to that extent be deemed satisfied. If more than the amount
reassessed has been collected, the balance shall be refunded to the persons
making such payments.
(Ord. 6. Passed 4-17-62.)
218.10 RESTRICTIONS.
   (a)   Assessment Limited to Value of Benefits. The total amount assessed
against any lot or parcel of land shall not exceed the value of the benefits
received from the improvement.
   (b)   Special Fund. Except as otherwise provided in the City Charter and
this chapter, moneys raised by special assessments to pay the cost of any local
improvement shall be held in a special fund to pay such cost or to repay any
moneys borrowed therefor.
   (c)   Restricted Use of Funds. Each special assessment account must be used
only for the improvement project for which the assessment was levied, except as
otherwise provided in Chapter 12 of the City Charter.

      (3)   A peace officer who has reasonable cause to believe that a person
was operating a vehicle upon a public highway or other place open to the public
or generally accessible to motor vehicles, including an area designated for the
parking of vehicles, within this City, and that the person, by the consumption
of alcoholic liquor, may have been affected in his or her ability to operate a

breath analysis:
         A.   The amount of alcohol or presence of a controlled substance or
both in a driver's blood at the time alleged as shown by chemical analysis of

hereof shall be advised of all of the following:
            1.   That if the person takes a chemical test of his or her blood,
urine, or breath administered at the request of a peace officer, he or she has
the right to demand that a person of his or her own choosing administer one of
the chemical tests; that the results of the test are admissible in judicial
proceedings as provided under this section and will be considered with other
admissible evidence in determining the innocence or guilt of the defendant; and
that he or she is responsible for obtaining a chemical analysis of a test
sample obtained pursuant to his or her own request.

333.16215, qualified to withdraw blood and acting in a medical environment, at
the request of a peace officer, may withdraw blood to determine the amount of
alcohol or presence of a controlled substance or both in the person's blood, as
provided in this subsection. Liability for a crime or civil damages predicated
on the act of withdrawing or analyzing blood and related procedures shall not
attach to a licensed physician or individual operating under the delegation of
licensed physician who withdraws or analyzes blood or assists in the withdrawal
or analysis in accordance with this section unless the withdrawal or analysis
is performed in a negligent manner.
         D.   A chemical test described in this subsection shall be
administered at the request of a peace officer having reasonable grounds to
believe the person has committed a crime described in paragraph (c)(1) hereof.
A person who takes a chemical test administered at the request of a peace
officer, as provided in this subsection, shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to have a person of his or her own choosing administer one of the
chemical tests described in this subsection within a reasonable time after his
or her detention, and the results of the test shall be admissible and shall be
considered with other admissible evidence in determining the innocence or guilt
of the defendant. If the person charged is administered a chemical test by a
person of his or her own choosing, the person charged shall be responsible for
obtaining a chemical analysis of the test sample.
         E.   If, after an accident, the driver of a vehicle involved in the

results of a chemical analysis of that sample shall be admissible in any civil
or criminal proceeding to show the amount of alcohol or presence of a
controlled substance or both in the person's blood at the time alleged,
regardless of whether the person had been offered or had refused a chemical
test. The medical facility or person performing the chemical analysis shall
disclose the results of the analysis to a prosecuting attorney who requests the
results for use in a criminal prosecution as provided in this subsection. A
medical facility or person disclosing information in compliance with this
subsection shall not be civilly or criminally liable for making the disclosure.
         F.   If, after an accident, the driver of a vehicle involved in the
accident is deceased, a sample of the decedent's blood shall be withdrawn in a
manner directed by the medical examiner for the purpose of determining the
amount of alcohol or the presence of a controlled substance, or both, in the
decedent's blood. The medical examiner shall give the results of the chemical
analysis of the sample to the law enforcement agency investigating the
accident, and that agency shall forward the results to the Department of State
Police.
         G.   The Department of State Police shall promulgate uniform rules in
compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act of 1969, M.C.L.A. 24.201 to

to rules promulgated by the department of state police.
      (5)    The provisions of paragraph (b)(3) hereof relating to chemical
testing do not limit the introduction of any other admissible evidence bearing
upon the question of whether a person was impaired by, or under the influence
of, alcoholic liquor or a controlled substance, or a combination of alcoholic
liquor and a controlled substance, or whether the person had an alcohol content
of 0.08 grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath,

administered, the results of the test shall be made available to the person
charged or the person's attorney upon written request to the prosecution, with
a copy of the request filed with the court. The prosecution shall furnish the
results at least two days before the date of the trial. The results of the test
shall be offered as evidence by the prosecution in that trial. Failure to fully
comply with the request shall bar the admission of the results into evidence by
the prosecution.

the court in which the petition was filed, not less than ten days before the
matter is set for review, the original or a certified copy of the official
record of the proceedings. Proceedings at which evidence was presented need not
be transcribed and transmitted if the sole reason for review is to determine

         A.   Except as provided in section (7), a violation or attempted
violation of any of the following:
            1.   This section.
            2.   M.C.L.A. 257.625, except a violation of M.C.L.A. 257.625(2),

local ordinance substantially corresponding to M.C.L.A. 625(6), or a law of
another state substantially corresponding to M.C.L.A. 257.625(6) may be used as
a prior conviction.
      (8)   If two or more convictions described in subsection (6) are
convictions for violations arising out of the same transaction, only one
conviction shall be used to determine whether the person has a prior
conviction.
   (i)   Vehicle Forfeitures; Distribution of Proceeds.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and in addition to
any other penalty provided for in this subsection, the judgment of sentence for
a conviction for a violation of paragraph (a)(1) hereof may require one of the
following with regard to the vehicle used in the offense if the defendant owns
the vehicle in whole or in part or leases the vehicle:
         A.   Forfeiture of the vehicle if the defendant owns the vehicle in
whole or in part.
         B.   Return of the vehicle to the lessor if the defendant leases the
vehicle.
      (2)   The vehicle may be seized pursuant to an order of seizure issued by
the court having jurisdiction upon a showing of probable cause that the vehicle
is subject to forfeiture or return to the lessor.
      (3)   The forfeiture of a vehicle is subject to the interest of the
holder of a security interest who did not have prior knowledge of or consent to
the violation.
      (4)   Within fourteen days after the defendant's conviction for a
violation described in paragraph (a)(1) hereof, the prosecuting attorney may
file a petition with the court for the forfeiture of the vehicle or to have the
court order return of a leased vehicle to the lessor. The prosecuting attorney
shall give notice by first-class mail or other process to the defendant and his
or her attorney, to all owners of the vehicle and any person holding a security
interest in the vehicle that the court may require forfeiture or return of the
vehicle.
      (5)   If a vehicle is seized before disposition of the criminal
proceedings, a defendant who is an owner or lessee of the vehicle may move the
court having jurisdiction over the proceedings to require the seizing agency to
file a lien against the vehicle and to return the vehicle to the owner or
lessee pending disposition of the criminal proceedings. The court shall hear
the motion within seven days after the motion is filed. If the defendant
establishes at the hearing that he or she holds the legal title to the vehicle
or that he or she has a leasehold interest and that it is necessary for him or
her or a member of his or her family to use the vehicle pending the outcome of
the forfeiture action, the court may order the seizing agency to return the
vehicle to the owner or lessee. If the court orders the return of the vehicle
to the owner or lessee, the court shall order the defendant to post a bond in
an amount equal to the retail value of the vehicle and shall also order the
seizing agency to file a lien against the vehicle.
      (6)   Within fourteen days after notice by the prosecuting attorney is
given under paragraph (i)(4) hereof, the defendant, an owner, lessee, or holder
of a security interest may file a claim of interest in the vehicle with the
court. Within twenty-one days after the expiration of the period for filing
claims, but before sentencing, the court shall hold a hearing to determine the
legitimacy of any claim, the extent of any co-owner's equity interest, the
liability of the defendant to any co-lessee, and whether to order the vehicle
forfeited or returned to the lessor. In considering whether to order
forfeiture, the court shall review the defendant's driving record to determine
whether the defendant has multiple convictions under M.C.L.A. 257.625 or a
local ordinance substantially corresponding to M.C.L.A. 257.625, or multiple
suspensions, restrictions, or denials under M.C.L.A. 257.904, or both. If the
defendant has multiple convictions under M.C.L.A. 257.625, or multiple
suspensions, restrictions, or denials under M.C.L.A. 257.904, or both, that
factor shall weigh heavily in favor of forfeiture.
      (7)   If a vehicle is forfeited under this subsection, the unit of
government that seized the vehicle shall sell the vehicle and dispose of the
proceeds in the following order of priority:
         A.   Pay any outstanding security interest of a secured party who did
not have prior knowledge of or consent to the commission of the violation.
         B.   Pay the equity interest of a co-owner who did not have prior
knowledge of or consent to the commission of the violation.
         C.   Satisfy any order of restitution entered in the prosecution for
the violation.
         D.   Pay the claim of each person who shows that he or she is a victim
of the violation to the extent that the claim is not covered by an order of
restitution.
         E.   Pay any outstanding lien against the property that has been
imposed by a governmental unit.
         F.   Pay the proper expenses of the proceedings for forfeiture and
sale, including, but not limited to, expenses incurred during the seizure
process and expenses for maintaining custody of the property, advertising and
court costs.
         G.   The balance remaining after the payment pursuant to paragraphs
(i)(7)A. to F. hereof, shall be distributed by the court having jurisdiction
over the forfeiture proceedings to the unit or units of government
substantially involved in effecting the forfeiture. Seventy-five percent of the
money received by a unit of government under this subdivision shall be used to
enhance enforcement of the criminal laws and 25% of the money shall be used to
implement the Crime Victim's Rights Act, Act No. 87 of the Public Acts of 1985,
being M.C.L.A. 780.751 to 780.834. A unit of government receiving money under
this subsection shall report annually to the Department of Management and
Budget the amount of money received under this subsection that was used to
enhance enforcement of the criminal laws and the amount that was used to
implement the Crime Victim's Rights Act.
      (8)   The court may order the defendant to pay to a co-lessee any
liability determined under paragraph (i)(6) hereof. The order may be enforced
in the same manner as a civil judgment.
      (9)   The return of a vehicle to the lessor under this subsection does
not affect or impair the lessor's rights or the defendant's obligations under
the lease.
      (10)   If the prosecuting attorney intends to seek a sanction under this
subsection based upon the defendant having one or more prior convictions, the
prosecuting attorney shall include on the complaint and information, or an
amended complaint and information, filed in the district court, a statement
listing the defendant's prior convictions.
      (11)   The failure of the court or prosecutor to comply with any time
limit specified in this subsection does not preclude the court from ordering
forfeiture of a vehicle or its return to a lessor, unless the court finds that
the owner or claimant suffered substantial prejudice as a result of that
failure.
      (12)   The forfeiture provisions of this subsection do not preclude the
prosecuting attorney from pursuing a forfeiture proceeding under any other law
of this State or any other provision under this section.

suspended.
      (5)   If a defendant is ordered imprisoned for the violation for which
immobilization is ordered, the period of immobilization shall begin at the end
of the period of imprisonment.
      (6)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   Subject to paragraph (j)(7) hereof, "prior conviction" means a
conviction for any of the following, whether under a law of this State, a local
ordinance substantially corresponding to a law of this State, or a law of
another state substantially corresponding to a law of this State:
            1.   Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, a violation or

regularly employed driver of an intrastate motor carrier of property for a

continues to be a regularly employed driver of that motor carrier. Such a
driver is qualified to drive a motor vehicle if he or she fulfills the
requirements of section 2d(2)(a) to (i). (FN1)
   (b)   The provisions in the Act pertaining to an intrastate driver's medical
qualifications do not apply to any driver who:
      (1)   Has been a regularly employed driver of the motor carrier for a
continuous period which began on or before June 10, 1984.

condition after being issued a grandfather card must return the grandfather
card to the appeal board.
   (f)   The provisions of 49 C.F.R. 391.23(a)(2) and (c) relating to the

      (1)   When the axle spacing is nine feet or more between axles, the
maximum axle load shall not exceed 18,000 pounds for vehicles equipped with
high pressure pneumatic or balloon tires.
      (2)   When the axle spacing is less than nine feet between two axles but
more than three and one-half feet, the maximum axle load shall not exceed
13,000 pounds for high pressure pneumatic or balloon tires.
      (3)   When axles are spaced less than three and one-half feet apart, the
maximum axle load shall not exceed 9,000 pounds per axle.
      (4)   Paragraphs (a)(1) to (3) hereof shall be known as the normal
loading maximum.
   (b)   When normal loading is in effect, the State Transportation Department
and local authorities with respect to highways under their jurisdiction may
designate certain highways, or sections of those highways, where bridges and
road surfaces are adequate for heavier loading, which designation may be
revised as needed, on which the maximum tandem axle assembly loading shall not
exceed 16,000 pounds for any axle of the assembly, if there is no other axle
within nine feet of any axle of the assembly.
   (c)   Except as provided in subsection (h) hereof, on a legal combination of
vehicles, only one tandem axle assembly shall be permitted on the designated
highways at the gross permissible weight of 16,000 pounds per axle, if there is
no other axle within nine feet of any axle of the assembly, and if no other
tandem axle assembly in the combination of vehicles exceeds a gross weight of
13,000 pounds per axle. When the maximum gross weight of a combination of
vehicles with load does not exceed 73,280 pounds, two tandem axle assemblies
shall be permitted on the designated highways at a gross permissible weight of
16,000 pounds per axle, if there is no other axle within nine feet of any axle

other time that the conditions of the highway may require.
   (g)   For the purpose of enforcement of the Act, the gross vehicle weight of
a single vehicle and load or a combination of vehicles and loads, shall be
determined by weighing individual axles or groups of axles, and the total
weight on all the axles shall be the gross vehicle weight. In addition, the
gross axle weight shall be determined by weighing individual axles or by
weighing a group of axles and dividing the gross weight of the group of axles
by the number of axles in the group. Pursuant to subsection (h) hereof, the
overall gross weight on a group of two or more axles shall be determined by
weighing individual axles or several axles, and the total weight of all the
axles in the group shall be the overall gross weight of the group.
   (h)   The loading maximum in this subsection shall apply to interstate
highways, and the State Transportation Department, or a local authority with
respect to highways under its jurisdiction, may designate a highway, or a
section of a highway, for the operation of vehicles having a gross vehicle
weight of not more than 80,000 pounds which are subject to the following load
maximums:
      (1)   20,000 pounds on any one axle, including all enforcement
tolerances.

tolerances.
      (3)   An overall gross weight on a group of two or more consecutive axles
equaling:
   W = 500((LN/(N-1)) k 12N k 36)
   where W = overall gross weight on a group of two or more consecutive axles
to the nearest 500 pounds; L = distance in feet between the extreme of a group
of two or more consecutive axles; and N = number of axles in the group under
consideration; except that two consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a
gross load of 34,000 pounds each if the first and last axles of the consecutive
sets of tandem axles are not less than thirty-six feet apart. The gross vehicle
weight shall not exceed 80,000 pounds, including all enforcement tolerances.
Except for a five-axle truck tractor or semitrailer combinations having two
consecutive sets of tandem axles, vehicles having a gross weight in excess of
80,000 pounds or in excess of the vehicle gross weight determined by
application of the formula in this subsection shall be subject to the maximum
axle loads of subsections (a) to (c) hereof. As used in this subsection,
"tandem axle weight" means the total weight transmitted to the road by two or
more consecutive axles, the centers of which may be included between parallel
transverse vertical planes spaced more than forty inches, but not more than
ninety-six inches, apart, extending across the full width of the vehicle.

416.25 STOPPING VEHICLES FOR WEIGHING.
   (a)   Submission to a Weighing. A police officer or a duly authorized agent
of the State Transportation Department or a county road commission having
reason to believe that the weight of a vehicle and load is unlawful may require
the driver to stop and submit to a weighing of the vehicle by either portable
or stationary scales approved and sealed by the Department of Agriculture as a
legal weighing device, and may require that the vehicle be driven to the
nearest weighing station of the State Transportation Department for the purpose
of allowing an officer or agent of the State Transportation Department or
county road commission to determine whether the conveyance is loaded in
conformity with this chapter.
   (b)   Overweight Vehicle; Unloading; Bond; Impounding. When the officer or
agent, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that the weight is
unlawful, the officer or agent may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a
suitable place and remain standing until that portion of the load is shifted or
removed as necessary to reduce the gross axle load weight of the vehicle to the
limit permitted under this chapter. All material unloaded as provided under
this subsection shall be cared for by the owner or operator of the vehicle at
the risk of the owner or operator. A judge or magistrate imposing a civil fine
and costs under this section which are not paid in full immediately or for
which a bond is not immediately posted in double the amount of the civil fine
and costs shall order the driver or owner to move the vehicle at the driver's
own risk to a place of safekeeping within the jurisdiction of the judge or
magistrate, inform the judge or magistrate in writing of the place of
safekeeping, and keep the vehicle until the fine and costs are paid or
sufficient bond is furnished or until the judge or magistrate is satisfied that
the fine and costs will be paid. The officer or agent who has determined, after
weighing a vehicle and load, that the weight is unlawful may require the driver
to proceed to a judge or magistrate within the county. If the judge or
magistrate is satisfied that the probable civil fine and costs will be paid by
the owner or lessee, the judge or magistrate may allow the driver to proceed,
after the load is made legal. If the judge or magistrate is not satisfied that
the owner or lessee, after a notice and a right to be heard on the merits is
given, will pay the amount of the probable civil fine and costs, the judge or
magistrate may order the vehicle to be impounded until trial on the merits is
completed under conditions set forth in this section for the impounding of
vehicles after the civil fine and costs have been imposed. Removal of the
vehicle, and the forwarding, care, or preservation of the load, shall be under
the control of and at the risk of the owner or driver. Vehicles impounded shall
be subject to a lien, subject to a prior valid bona fide lien of prior record,
in the amount of the civil fine and costs and if the civil fine and costs are
not paid within ninety days after the seizure, the judge or magistrate shall
certify the unpaid judgment to the prosecuting attorney of the county in which
the violation occurred, who shall proceed to enforce the lien by foreclosure
sale in accordance with procedure authorized in the case of chattel mortgage
foreclosures. When the duly authorized agent of the State Transportation
Department or county road commission is performing duties under this chapter,
the agent shall have all the powers conferred upon peace officers by the
general laws of this State.
   (c)   Fines for Excess Weight; Discretionary Power. An owner of a vehicle or
a lessee of the vehicle of an owner-operator, or other person, who causes or
allows a vehicle to be loaded and driven or moved on a highway, when the weight
of that vehicle violates section 722 of the Motor Vehicle Code, MCLA 257.722,
as amended, is responsible for a civil infraction and shall pay a civil fine in
an amount equal to three cents ($.03) per pound for each pound of excess load
over 1,000 pounds when the excess is 2,000 pounds or less; six cents ($.06) per
pound of excess load when the excess is over 2,000 pounds but not over 31,000
pounds; nine cents ($.09) per pound for each pound of excess load when the
excess is over 3,000 pounds but not over 4,000 pounds; twelve cents ($.12) per
pound for each pound of excess load when the excess is over 4,000 pounds but
not over 5,000 pounds; fifteen cents ($.15) per pound for each pound of excess
load when the excess is over 5,000 pounds but not over 10,000 pounds; and
twenty cents ($.20) per pound for each pound of excess load when the excess is
over 10,000 pounds. However, the court shall have discretionary power as to the
amount of the civil fine within the schedule provided by this subsection and
may impose the civil fine provided in section 907(3) (FN2) for a civil
infraction where, at the time of the violation, either the motor vehicle, motor
vehicle and semitrailer, or trailer did not exceed the total weight which would
be lawful for each unit by a proper distribution of the load upon the various
axles supporting each unit.
   (d)   Bypass of Scales or Weighing Station. A driver or owner of a vehicle,
truck or truck tractor, truck or truck tractor with other vehicles in
combination, or special mobile equipment, who knowingly fails to stop at or who
knowingly bypasses any scales or weighing station is guilty of a misdemeanor.
   (e)   Marked Vehicles of Officers. An agent or authorized representative of
the State Transportation Department or a county road commission shall not stop
a truck or vehicle in movement upon a road or highway within the State for any
purpose, unless the agent or authorized representative is driving a duly marked
vehicle, clearly showing and denoting the branch of government represented.
   (f)   Failure to Stop on Request of Authorized Person. A driver or owner of
a vehicle who knowingly fails to stop when requested or ordered to do so by a
police officer, a duly authorized agent of the State Transportation Department,
or a representative or agent of a county road commission, authorized to require
the driver to stop and submit to a weighing of the vehicle and load by means of
a portable scale, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
   It is unlawful and prohibited for any driver or owner to perform, allow to
be performed or allow to exist any of the following conditions.

416.35 GENERAL RULES FOR PROTECTION AGAINST SHIFTING OR FALLING CARGO.
   (a)   Application and Scope. This section applies to trucks, truck tractors,
semitrailers, full trailers, and pole trailers. Each of those motor vehicles
must, when transporting cargo, be loaded and equipped to prevent the shifting
or falling of the cargo in the manner prescribed by the rules in subsection (b)
hereof. In addition, each cargo-carrying motor vehicle must conform to the
applicable rules in CFR 393.102, 393.104, and 393.106.
   (b)   Basic Protection Components. Each cargo-carrying motor vehicle must be
equipped with devices providing protection against shifting or falling cargo
that meet the requirements of either paragraph (b)(1), (2), (3), or (4) hereof.
      (1)   Option A. The vehicle must have sides, sideboards, or stakes, and a
rear endgate, endboard, or stakes. Those devices must be strong enough and high
enough to assure that cargo will not shift upon, or fall from the vehicle.
Those devices must have no aperture large enough to permit cargo in contact
with one or more of the devices to pass through it.
      (2)   Option B. The vehicle must have at least one tiedown assembly that
meets the requirements of CFR 393.102 for each ten linear feet of lading or
fraction thereof. (However, a pole trailer or an expandable trailer
transporting metal articles under the special rules in subsection (c) hereof is
required only to have two or more of those tiedown assemblies at each end of
the trailer.) In addition, the vehicle must have as many additional tiedown
assemblies meeting the requirements of CFR 393.102 as are necessary to secure
all cargo being transported either by direct contact between the cargo and the
tiedown assemblies or by dunnage which is in contact with the cargo and is
secured by tiedown assemblies.
      (3)   Option C (for vehicles transporting metal articles only). A vehicle
transporting cargo which consists of metal articles must conform to either the
rules in paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (4) hereof, or the special rules for
transportation of metal articles set forth in subsection (c) hereof.

inches or more and a length which is at least seventy-five percent of the width
of the coil or row of coils, tightly placed against both the front and rear
sides of the coil or row of coils and restrained to prevent movement of the
coil or coils in the forward and rearward directions.
         C.   If coils are loaded to contact each other in the longitudinal
direction, and relative motion between coils, and between coils and the
vehicle, is prevented by tiedown assemblies and timbers:
            1.   Only the foremost and rearmost coils must be secured with
timbers; and
            2.   A single tiedown assembly, restricting against forward motion,
may be used to secure any coil except the rearmost one, which must be
restrained against rearward motion.
         D.   Coils with eyes lengthwise. A coil or transverse row of coils
having approximately equal outside diameters and loaded side by side, or a
longitudinal row of coils having approximately equal outside diameters and
loaded end to end, must be secured as follows:
            1.   The coil or coils must be restrained against side by side and
fore-and-aft movement by:
               a.   One or more tiedown assemblies over the top of each coil or
transverse row;

coils in a transverse row.
            2.   Timbers having nominal cross-sections of four inches by four
inches or more must be tightly placed against the sides of each coil or against
the outboard sides of each transverse row of coils which are loaded side by
side so that the timbers restrain against side-to-side movement.
            3.   If, in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)D.1.a. hereof, only one
tiedown assembly over the top of each coil or transverse row of coils is used
to restrain against side-to-side movement and fore-and-aft movement, timbers
having a nominal cross-section of two inches by four inches increase or more
and which are firmly secured to longitudinal blocking must be tightly placed
against the front and back of each coil, each longitudinal row of coils, and
each transverse row of coils, in a manner which restricts forward and rearward
movement.
         E.   Soundness of timber. Timber which is used for blocking must be
sound lumber which is free of defects (such as knots or cracks) that materially
reduce its strength.
         F.   Timbers not required. Timber need not be used on vehicles which
have depressions in the floor or are equipped with other restraining devices
which perform the functions specified for timbers by the rules in this section.
         G.   Nominal defined. As used in this section, the term "nominal",
when used to describe timber, means commercially dressed sizes generally
designated by the dimensions indicated.
      (4)   Miscellaneous metal articles. Except as provided in paragraph (c)
(4)D. hereof, whenever a motor carrier transports metal articles consisting of
cut-to-length bars, plates, rods, sheet and tin mill products, billets, blooms,
ingots, slabs, structural shapes, or pipe and other tubular products, and those
articles, either individually or as a combination of articles banded or boxed
together and handled as a single unit, weigh more than 2,000 pounds, the
articles shall be secured in the following manner:

articles loaded side by side across the width of the vehicle must be secured by
at least one tiedown assembly over its top for at least every eight feet of its
length and at least two tiedown assemblies securing each individual article or
combination of articles banded or otherwise secured together and handled as a
single unit. However, articles which individually have a length of eight feet
or less and which are securely butted against each other in the fore-and-aft
direction may be secured by tiedown assemblies, or they may be secured by a
timber having a nominal cross section of four inches by four inches or more
placed longitudinally over the articles and secured by tiedown assemblies.
Tiedown assemblies may not be located beyond the ends of the articles which
they secure.
         B.   If articles are tiered and each tiered article rests securely on
the one beneath it, the tier may be secured in the same manner as a single
level of those articles is secured in accordance with the rules in this
section.
         C.   Pole trailers must either comply with the requirements of
paragraphs (c)(4)A. and B. hereof or have at least two tiedown assemblies
securing the load to the forward bolster and at least two tiedown assemblies
securing the load to the rear bolster.

606.01 ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE DEFINED.
   As used in this chapter, "alcoholic beverage" means alcoholic liquor, beer,
wine and spirits, as defined in Section 2 of Act 8 of the Public Acts of 1933,
Extra Session, as amended.
(Ord. 26. Passed 6-2-67.)
606.02 PUBLIC CONSUMPTION; POSSESSION OF OPEN CONTAINERS.
   No person shall drink or consume alcoholic beverages except on his or her
own private property or as an invitee on private property, duly licensed
establishments or where permitted by law in public places. No person shall have
in his or her possession an open or unsealed container containing an alcoholic
beverage except on his or her own private property or as an invitee on private
property, duly licensed establishments or where permitted by law in public
places.
(Ord. 26. Passed 6-20-67.)
606.03 LIQUOR LICENSES AND PERMITS.
   (a)   Council shall not approve any new license or permit for which it has
statutory authority, or authority delegated by the Michigan Liquor Control
Commission, to act, nor shall it approve any renewal or transfer of such a
license or permit, for the following persons, individuals, corporations or
partnerships:
      (1)   A person who has been convicted of a felony or is disqualified to
receive such a license or permit by reason of any matter or thing contained in
the laws of the State;
      (2)   A person whose license or permit has been revoked for cause;
      (3)   In the case of renewal, upon a proper showing that the previous
operation of the establishment has been deleterious to the health, safety or
morals of the public at large or of the residents of the City in particular; or
      (4)   Unless the issuance of such a license or permit is in the best
interest of the City and is necessary for the needs and convenience of its
residents.

license shall be approved by Council unless and until all the City's zoning
ordinances, building codes and ordinances and site plan requirements have been
complied with.
   (c)   No entertainment permit shall be issued in conjunction with any liquor
license. This time-honored policy is based upon clear and competent factual
evidence that such activity in conjunction with on-premises sale of alcoholic
beverages is contrary to the good morals, health and safety of the general
public and specifically of the residents of the City and does not inure to the
benefit or best interest and convenience of such residents. Clear and
convincing evidence has shown that such activities place an undue burden on
public safety personnel, tend to detract from property values in and around the
vicinity of the establishment, tend to create nuisances and disturbances and
tend to detract from the public tranquility.
   (d)   Applicants for a new liquor license or permit, or for the renewal or
transfer of such a license or permit, shall submit to the City such information
as is necessary for the City to make a determination of the applicant's
qualifications to obtain a license or permit hereunder.
   (e)   Prior to the decision of Council with regard to the approval or
disapproval of an application for a renewed or transferred license or permit
issued by the Michigan Liquor Control Commission, such applicant shall have an
opportunity to be heard before Council to present proofs, evidence and
information concerning his or her qualifications to obtain a license or permit.
(Res. Unno. Passed 2-5-85.)

transport or possess alcoholic liquor in a container that is open or uncapped
or upon which the seal is broken within the passenger compartment of a vehicle
upon a highway, or within the passenger compartment of a moving vehicle in any
place open to the general public or generally accessible to motor vehicles,
including an area designated for the parking of vehicles in this City.
   (b)   A person may transport or possess alcoholic liquor in a container that
is open or uncapped or upon which the seal is broken within the passenger
compartment of a vehicle upon a highway or other place open to the general
public or generally accessible to motor vehicles, including an area designated
for the parking of vehicles in this City, if the vehicle does not have a trunk
or compartment separate from the passenger compartment, if the container is
enclosed or encased, and if the container is not readily accessible to the
occupants of the vehicle.

authorized to operate by the Michigan Department of Transportation.

610.08 VICIOUS ANIMAL; RABID ANIMALS.
   (a)   Determination of a Vicious Animal. The animal control officer or any
public safety officer shall investigate all complaints of a vicious animal. If
the animal control officer or any public safety officer has reasonable cause to
believe that an animal is vicious, he or she shall institute proceedings in the
29th District Court requesting the court to conduct a hearing on whether or not
the animal should be declared vicious under this section. The issue of whether
the animal is a vicious animal within the meaning of this section shall be
decided based upon the preponderance of the evidence. If the court rules the
animal to be vicious, it may order that the animal be confined to the owner’s
premises or euthanized. The court may establish a time schedule to ensure
compliance with this section, but in no case shall such time exceed 30 days
after the date of the court’s determination. Court costs for such action shall
be taxed against the owner of the animal. The court may decide all issues for
or against the owner of the animal regardless of the fact that the owner fails
to appear at the hearing, and the determination of the court shall be final and
conclusive upon all parties thereto. If the animal control officer or any
public safety officer has probable cause to believe that the animal in question
is vicious and may pose a threat of serious harm to human beings or other
domestic animals, the animal control officer or public safety officer may seize
and impound the animal pending the hearing. The owner of the animal shall be
liable to the city for the costs and expenses of keeping such animal.
   (b)   Possession of Certain Animals Prohibited. It is unlawful for any
person to possess, harbor, breed, exchange, buy or sell any of the following
exotic or wild animals:
      (1)   Poisonous or venomous reptiles, spiders and insects.
      (2)   Cats from the wild family, including, but not limited to, bobcats,
cheetahs, cougars, jaguars, leopards, lions, lynxes, mountain lions, panthers,
pumas, or tigers.
      (3)   Crocodilian reptiles, including, but not limited to, crocodiles and
alligators.
      (4)   Bears.
      (5)   Any other dangerous animal.
   (c)   Requirements for Registration. Upon a finding by the court that an
animal is vicious, its owner shall comply with the following requirements for
licensing:
      (1)   License application. The owner shall apply to the City Clerk for a
vicious animal license which shall be valid for one year from the date of its
approval provided all conditions of this section and applicable court orders
have been met. The license shall be renewable for successive one-year periods
provided that the animal is to be kept on the same premises under the same
conditions and its owner has not violated any conditions of this section or any
court order during the previous 12-month period. No such license shall be
transferable to a new owner of the animal or to a new location or address where
the animal will be kept.
      (2)   Insurance. Prior to the receipt of a license, the owner shall
present to the City Clerk proof that the owner has procured liability insurance
in the amount of at least one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) covering
any damage or injury which may be caused by such vicious animal during the 12-
month period for which licensing is sought, which policy shall contain a
provision naming the city as an additional insured and shall provide that the
city shall be notified by the insurance company of any cancellation,
termination or expiration of the liability insurance policy. In addition, the
owner shall sign a statement attesting that the owner shall maintain and not
voluntarily cancel the liability insurance during the 12-month period for which
licensing is sought, unless the owner shall cease to keep or harbor the vicious
animal prior to expiration of such licenses.
      (3)   Signs. Prior to the receipt of a license, the owner shall display a
sign in a prominent place on his or her premises warning of a vicious animal on
the premises. Said sign shall be visible and capable of being read from any
adjacent public right-of-way.
      (4)   Confinement of vicious animal. Prior to the receipt of a license,
the owner shall provide for the confinement of the vicious animal. If the
vicious animal is to be confined outdoors, the animal shall be confined to a
pen or structure with secure sides and top attached to the sides. The structure
shall have a secure bottom or floor attached to the sides of the pen or the
structure shall be embedded in the ground no less than two feet. The structure
shall be constructed in accordance with standards set forth in
Chapter 5 and shall be constructed of materials and be designed so as to
prevent any escape of the animal or entry of young children. In addition, the
size and location of the structure shall comply with the provisions of the
zoning ordinance of the city including lot coverage and setback requirements,
applicable to accessory structures. The owner shall keep the structure locked
with a padlock or keylock at all times that the vicious animal is kept inside
the structure, and shall keep the structure adequately lit and in a clean and
sanitary condition. If the vicious animal is to be confined indoors, the
vicious animal shall not be kept on a porch or patio or in any other part of a
house or structure that would allow the animal to exit of its own volition. In
addition, no such animal may be kept in a house or structure when the windows
are open or when screen windows or screen doors are the only obstacle
preventing the animal from exiting.
      (5)   Proximity to schools. If the court rules an animal to be vicious,
and the owner of the animal lives within 500 feet of a school, the court may
impose additional regulations to safeguard the public, up to and including
ordering the animal permanently removed from the area.
      (6)   Control of vicious animals. All vicious animals shall be confined
as previously described in this section. It shall be unlawful for any owner to
maintain a vicious animal upon any premises which does not have a locked
enclosure, unless such vicious animal is at all times maintained in the owner’s
dwelling. It shall be unlawful for any owner to allow any vicious animal to be
outside of the dwelling of the owner or outside of the enclosure unless it is
necessary for the owner to obtain veterinary care for the vicious animal or to
sell or give away the vicious animal or to comply with commands or directions
of the court, the animal control office or any public safety officer with
respect to the vicious animal, or to comply with licensing provisions of this
section. In such event, the vicious animal shall be securely muzzled and
restrained with a choker chain and leash having a minimum tensile strength of
300 pounds and not exceeding three feet in length. The muzzle shall be made and
fitted in a manner that will not cause injury to the animal or interfere with
its vision or respiration, but shall prevent it from biting any human or
animal. The animal shall be under the direct control and supervision of the
owner of a vicious animal or his agent, either of whom shall be, in any event,
a person of 18 years of age and physically capable of restraining the animal.
      (7)   Reporting requirements. An owner shall notify the City Police
Department immediately upon discovery that a vicious animal is on the loose, is
unconfined, has attacked another animal or human being, or has been stolen. An
owner shall notify the City Clerk in writing within one day if the vicious
animal has been sold or given away or has died, and, if the vicious animal has
been sold or given away to a new owner residing within the city, the owner
shall also provide the City Clerk with the name, address and telephone number
of the new owner of the vicious animal.
      (8)   Penalties for violation.

comply with any condition in the court order finding an animal to be vicious,
the animal control officer or any public safety officer shall confiscate the
animal and impound same pending a hearing requiring the owner of the animal to
show cause why the animal should not be immediately destroyed. The owner of the

   (b)   "Paraphernalia" means any empty gelatin capsule, hypodermic syringe or
needle, cocaine spoon, marijuana pipe, hashish pipe or another instrument or
device which is primarily adapted or designed for the administration or use of
any controlled substance. Cigarette paper, scissors, or other products or

conjunction with other items or instruments which are primarily adapted or
designed for the administration or use of a controlled substance.
   (c)   "Cocaine spoon" means a spoon with a bowl so small that the primary
use for which it is reasonably adapted or designed is to hold or administer
cocaine, and which is so small as to be unsuited for the typical, lawful use of
a spoon. A cocaine spoon may be merchandised on a chain and may or may not be
labeled as a "cocaine" spoon or "coke" spoon.
   (d)   "Marijuana, hashish or hash pipe" means a pipe characterized by a bowl
which is so small that the primary use for which it is reasonably adapted or

State does not reveal ownership, the Police Department or Building Department
may sell the vehicle at public sale pursuant to M.C.L.A. 257.252(g), as
amended, not less than thirty days after public notice of the sale has been

(Ord. 1995-30. Passed 12-19-95.)
652.05 MUNICIPAL CIVIL INFRACTIONS BUREAU.
   (a)   Establishment. The City hereby establishes a Municipal Civil
Infractions Bureau (the "Bureau"), as authorized under Section 8396 of the Act,
to accept admissions of responsibility for Municipal civil infractions in
response to Municipal civil infraction violation notices issued and served by
authorized City officials, and to collect and retain civil fines and costs as
prescribed by these Codified Ordinances or any ordinance.
   (b)   Location; Supervision; Employees; Rules and Regulations. The Bureau
shall be located at Wayne City Hall and shall be under the supervision and
control of the City Treasurer. The City Treasurer, subject to the approval of
the City Council, shall adopt rules and regulations for the operation of the
Bureau and appoint any necessary qualified City employees to administer the
Bureau.
   (c)   Disposition of Violations. The Bureau may dispose only of Municipal
civil infraction violations for which a fine has been scheduled and for which a
Municipal civil infraction violation notice (as compared with a citation) has
been issued. The fact that a fine has been scheduled for a particular violation
shall not entitle any person to dispose of the violation at the Bureau. Nothing
in this chapter shall prevent or restrict the City from issuing a Municipal
civil infraction citation for any violation or from prosecuting any violation
in a court of competent jurisdiction. No person shall be required to dispose of
a Municipal civil infraction violation at the Bureau. Any person may have the
violation processed before a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The
unwillingness of any person to dispose of any violation at the Bureau shall not
prejudice the person or in any way diminish the person's rights, privileges and
protection accorded by law.
   (d)   Bureau Limited to Accepting Admissions of Responsibility. The scope of
the Bureau's authority shall be limited to accepting admissions of
responsibility for Municipal civil infractions and collecting and retaining
civil fines and costs as a result of those admissions. The Bureau shall not
accept payment of a fine from any person who denies having committed the
offense or who admits responsibility only with explanation, and in no event
shall the Bureau determine, or attempt to determine, the truth or falsity of
any fact or matter relating to an alleged violation. 
   (e)   Municipal Civil Infraction Violation Notices. Municipal civil
infraction violation notices shall be issued and served by authorized City
officials under the same circumstances and upon the same persons as provided
for citations in Section 652.03(f) and (g). In addition to any other
information required by these Codified Ordinances or other ordinance, the
notice of violation shall indicate the time by which the alleged violator must
appear at the Bureau, the methods by which an appearance may be made, the
address and telephone number of the Bureau, the hours during which the Bureau
is open, the amount of the fine scheduled for the alleged violation and the
consequences for failure to appear and pay the required fine within the
required time.
   (f)   Appearance; Payment of Fines and Cost. An alleged violator receiving a
Municipal civil infraction violation notice shall appear at the Bureau and pay
the specified fine and costs at or by the time specified for appearance in the
Municipal civil infraction violation notice. An appearance may be made by mail,
in person or by representation.
   (g)   Procedure Where Admission of Responsibility Not Made or Fine Not Paid.
If an authorized City official issues and serves a Municipal civil infraction
violation notice and if an admission of responsibility is not made and the
civil fine and costs, if any, prescribed by the schedule of fines for the
violation are not paid at the Bureau, a Municipal civil infraction citation may
be filed with the District Court and a copy of the citation may be served by
first-class mail upon the alleged violator at the alleged violator's last known
address. The citation filed with the court does not need to comply in all
particulars with the requirements for citations as provided by Section 8705 and
8709 of the Act, but shall consist of a sworn complaint containing the
allegations stated in the Municipal civil infraction violation notice and shall
fairly inform the alleged violator how to respond to the citation.

802.04   Prohibited acts.
802.05   Enforcement of provisions.
802.06   Appeals.
802.01 INTENT AND DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   Intent. The Police Alarm Ordinance is intended to be a regulatory
ordinance in the public's health, safety and welfare for the protection of all
citizens. The intent of this chapter is to establish reasonable expectations of
alarm users and to ensure that alarm users are held responsible for their use
of alarms systems.
   (b)   Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this
chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them, except where the context
clearly indicates a different meaning:
      (1)   “Alarm Administrator” means a person or persons designated by the
City to administer, control and review false alarm reduction efforts and
administer the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   “Alarm company” means a person and/or company subject to licensing
or registration requirements as specified below for an entity engaged in
selling, leasing, installing, servicing or monitoring electronic security alarm
system(s). The applicable Michigan statutes for an electronic security alarm
entity are as follows:
         A.   PA 330 1968; and
         B.   PA 580 2012.
      (3)   “Alarm signal” means a detectable signal; audible or visual,
generated by an alarm system, to which law enforcement is requested to respond.
      (4)   “Alarm system” means any single device or assembly of equipment
designed to signal the occurrence of an illegal or unauthorized entry or other
illegal activity requiring immediate attention and to which law enforcement is
requested to respond, but does not include motor vehicle or boat alarms, fire
alarms, domestic violence alarms, or alarms designed to elicit a medical
response.
      (5)   “Alarm user” means any person, corporation, partnership,
proprietorship, governmental or educational entity or any other entity owning,
leasing or operating an alarm system, or on whose premises an alarm system is
maintained for the protection of such premises.
      (6)   “Automatic dial protection device” means an automatic dialing
device or an automatic telephone dialing alarm system and shall include any
system which, upon being activated, automatically initiates to the Police
Department a recorded message or code signal indicating a new for law
enforcement response.
      (7)   “Cancellation” means the process where response is terminated when
the alarm company designated by the alarm user notifies the Police Department
that there is not an existing situation at the alarm site requiring police
response after an alarm dispatch request. If cancellation occurs prior to
police arriving at the scene, this is not a false alarm for the purpose of a
civil penalty, and no penalty will be assessed.
      (8)   “City” means the City of Wayne or its agent.
      (9)   “False alarm” means the activation of an alarm system through
mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the
negligence of the alarm user, his/her employees or agents, and signals
activated to summon law enforcement personnel unless law enforcement response
was cancelled by the user's alarm company before law enforcement personnel
arrive at the alarm location. An alarm is false within the meaning of this
article when, upon inspection by the Police Department, evidence indicates that
no unauthorized entry, robbery, or other such crime was committed or attempted
in or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm
system. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a false alarm shall not include an alarm
which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated by
unusually violent conditions of nature nor does it include other extraordinary
circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm user.
      (10)   “Local alarm” means an alarm system that emits a signal at an
alarm site that is audible or visible from the exterior of a structure and is
not monitored by a remote monitoring facility, whether installed by an alarm
company or user.
      (11)   “One-year period” means 12 consecutive months beginning on January
31st and ending December 31st of the same calendar year.
      (12)   “Person” means any person, corporation, partnership,
proprietorship, governmental or educational entity or any other entity.
      (13)   “Police Department” means the Wayne Police Department or its
agent.
      (14)   “Runaway alarm” means an electronic security alarm system that
produces repeated alarm signals that do not appear to be caused by separate
human action. The Police Department may, in its discretion, discontinue police
response to alarm signals from what appear to be a runaway alarm in excess of
three alarm activations per 24-hour arming period.
      (15)   “SIA Control Panel Standard CP-01" means the American National
Standard Institute (ANSI) approved Security Industry Association (SIA) CP-01
Control Panel Standard, as may be updated from time to time, that details
recommended design features for security system control panels and their
associated arming and disarming devices to reduce false alarms. Control panels
built and tested to this standard by a nationally recognized testing
organization, will be marked to state: "Design evaluated in accordance with SIA
CP-01 Control Panel Standard Features for False Alarm Reduction".
      (16)   “Verify” means an attempt by the monitoring company, or its
representative, to contact the alarm site and/or alarm user by telephone and/or
other electronic means, whether or not actual contact with a person is made, to
attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law
enforcement dispatch, in an attempt to avoid an unnecessary alarm dispatch
request. For the purpose of this chapter, telephone verification shall require,
as a minimum that a second call be made to a different number if the first
attempt fails to reach an alarm user who can properly identify themselves to
attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law
enforcement dispatch.
(Ord. 2017-04. Passed 11-7-17.)

      (3)   Provide the most current contact information for the alarm user.
   (b)   Control panels. Ninety calendar days after enactment of this chapter,

telephone, to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting

alarm user who can properly identify themselves to attempt to determine whether
an alarm signal is valid, EXCEPT in the case of a panic or robbery-in-progress
alarm, or in cases where a crime-in-progress has been verified by video and/or
audible means.

period shall constitute a waiver of the right to contest the assessment of

administrative process established by the City. The hearing officer's decision
is subject to review in the district court by proceedings in the nature of
certiorari.
   (b)   Appeal Standard. The hearing officer shall review an appeal from the
assessment of civil penalty(ies) or other enforcement decisions using a

809.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the construction, maintenance and
operation of cable systems in the City and to provide for the granting of
franchises for the construction, maintenance and operation of cable systems.
(Ord. 1996-17. Passed 5-21-96.)
809.02 FRANCHISE REQUIRED.
   No person shall install, construct, maintain or otherwise operate a cable
system without a franchise.
(Ord. 1996-17. Passed 5-21-96.)
809.03 FRANCHISE ISSUANCE.
   (a)   The City may grant one or more franchises for the construction and
operation of a cable system after consideration of applications for franchises.
All franchises are subject to the terms of this chapter.
   (b)   The City specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time,
additional franchises for a cable system as it deems appropriate. Additional
franchises shall not be deemed to modify, revoke, terminate or damage any
rights previously granted to any other grantee.
   (c)   Applications for a new, transferred or amended franchise shall be made
in such form as the City may prescribe and shall be accompanied by a non-
refundable application review fee set by resolution of the City Council which
is reasonably related to the City's costs.
   (d)   Any franchise transfer, modification or extension, and the rights,
privileges, authority and responsibilities established, shall take effect and
be in force from and after final acceptance by a grantee and shall continue in
force and effect for a period established by the franchise, not to exceed
fifteen years from the date of acceptance, but only if, within sixty days after
the date of the granting of a franchise, the grantee files with the Council its
unconditional acceptance of the franchise and all required corporate
guaranties, letters of credit, construction bonds and insurance certificates.
   (e)   A grantee shall, within sixty days after the acceptance of a
franchise, apply to the Federal Communications Commission, any State agency and
any appropriate utility companies, for all necessary pole line agreements,
authorizations or registrations for the construction of a cable system and for
all permits then normally required.
(Ord. 1996-17. Passed 5-21-96.)
809.04 CONSTRUCTION TIMETABLE.
   A grantee shall ensure that all of the homes in the City are capable of
receiving the services of the cable system within twenty-four months from the
acceptance of the franchise in accordance with the terms of the application
submitted by the grantee. If, for any reason, a grantee shall fail or neglect
to complete the required installation and be unprepared to furnish cable
service by the specified date, the franchise shall be null and void and have no
force and effect.
(Ord. 1996-17. Passed 5-21-96.)
809.05 RATES AND CHARGES.
   (a)   A grantee may impose rate or service charge increases at any time,
subject to the requirements of all applicable State and Federal laws. With
respect to rates and service charges, the grantee and the City shall abide by
State and Federal law and FCC regulations.
   (b)   Subscribers, users and the City shall be notified of all increases in
rates and service charges at least thirty days before the proposed effective
dates.
   (c)   A grantee shall not discriminate in the assessment, levy, charge,
imposition or collection of rates and service charges on the basis of age,
race, creed, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status. Nothing
in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit the reduction or waiver of
charges in conjunction with community promotional campaigns for the purpose of
attracting subscribers or users.
   (d)   A grantee shall provide subscribers with itemized monthly bills. A
grantee may not require subscribers to pay for any cable service more than one
month in advance. A grantee shall require no other advance payment except
security deposits as provided for in subsection (f) hereof. This subsection
shall not be construed to prohibit voluntary advance payments or an advance
payment for installation of services.
   (e)   In the event that a subscriber terminates any cable service prior to
the end of a pre-paid period, the immediately effective pro-rata portion of any
pre-paid rate which represents payment for services which are no longer to be
rendered shall be refunded promptly.
   (f)   A grantee shall keep all security deposits received from customers in
non-interest-bearing accounts. The grantee shall return a security deposit for
equipment after the equipment is satisfactorily returned in as good condition
as when provided to the customer, taking into account normal wear and tear. The
grantee shall return a security deposit for service after the subscriber
maintains a satisfactory payment history (which is determined as no payment
delinquencies within the preceding twelve-month period). A grantee shall not
charge a security deposit greater than the equipment's actual cost to the
grantee.
(Ord. 1996-17. Passed 5-21-96.)
809.06 FRANCHISE FEE PAYMENTS BY GRANTEE.
   (a)   A grantee shall pay to the City for use of its streets, public places
and other facilities, as well as for their maintenance, improvement and
supervision, a franchise fee in an amount equal to five percent of the gross
receipts received by the grantee.
   (b)   Late payments shall accrue interest at the highest legal rate.
   (c)   Franchise fee payments shall be in addition to any other tax, charge,
fee or payment due to the City from a grantee to the extent consistent with
Federal law.
   (d)   Franchise fees shall be disbursed and appropriated by the City
Council. The City budget shall include a program or activity line for cable
television expenditures. Amounts appropriated by the City for the development
of the use of public channels, for production, for the purchase and maintenance
of equipment not required to be provided by the grantee, and to cover overhead
and other expenses with respect to the regulation of cable television or any
franchises granted pursuant to this chapter, shall be included in the program
or activity line.
(Ord. 1996-17. Passed 5-21-96.)
809.07 NEW SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENTS; CONFLICTS OF LAWS; MODIFICATIONS OF
FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in a separate agreement with a grantee,
the City may amend this chapter from time to time to allow grantees to innovate
and implement new services and developments allowed by law.
   (b)   A grantee may provide cable television services as defined by the
Federal Cable Act.
   (c)   A grantee may at all times comply with all laws and regulations of the
State and Federal Government or any administrative agency. However, if any such
State or Federal law or regulation shall require a grantee to perform any
service, or shall permit a grantee to perform any service, or shall prohibit a
grantee from performing any service, in conflict with the terms of the
franchise or of any law or regulation, then, as soon as possible, a grantee
shall notify the City of the point of conflict believed to exist between such
regulation or law and the terms of the franchise.
   (d)   If any provision of the franchise is held by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid as conflicting with any Federal or State law, rule
or regulation now or hereafter in effect, or is held by such court to be
modified in any way in order to conform to the requirements of any law, rule or
regulation, said provision may be considered a separate, distinct and
independent part of the franchise, and such holding shall not affect the
validity and enforceability of all other provisions. In the event that such
law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or
otherwise changed, so that the provision which had been held invalid or
modified is no longer in conflict with the law, rules or regulations, such
provision shall return to full force and effect and shall be binding on the
parties.
   (e)   The Council and a grantee shall have the right to modify any of the
provisions of the franchise agreement to such reasonable extent as may be
necessary to carry out the full intent and purpose of the law. The City Council
shall not reasonably withhold its approval of such modification.
(Ord. 1996-17. Passed 5-21-96.)
809.08 LIABILITY; INSURANCE.
   (a)   A grantee shall indemnify and hold harmless the City at all times
during the life of a franchise and will pay all damages and penalties which the
City may be required to pay as a result of the grantee's actions or omissions,
as set forth in an indemnity agreement.
   (b)   A grantee shall at all times during the life of a franchise carry and
require its contractors and subcontractors to carry public liability, property
damage, worker's disability and vehicle insurance in such form and amount as
shall be reasonably required by the City.
   (c)   All required insurance coverage shall provide for thirty days notice
to the City in the event of material alteration or cancellation of such
coverage prior to the effective date of such material alteration or
cancellation.
   (d)   Failure of a grantee to provide appropriate insurance certificates to
the City within sixty days after the execution of a franchise shall render the
franchise subject to termination pursuant to the terms of the franchise.
(Ord. 1996-17. Passed 5-21-96.)
809.09 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO FRANCHISEES; EMERGENCIES.
   A franchise granted by the City shall incorporate the following
requirements:
   (a)   In furtherance of the general policy that the services provided be
innovative and modern, a grantee will consider from time to time the
incorporation of new technical developments into the system based on technical
and economic feasibility.
   (b)   Should a grantee, its parent, its subsidiary or a related company
provide cable service, as defined by 47 USC 522(s), to another community within
Wayne County, the cable service shall be offered in the City.
   (c)   In the event of an emergency or other urgent community need, a grantee
shall, upon request, make available its facilities to the City for the duration
of the emergency. The cable system shall include an emergency alert capability
which will permit the City, in times of emergency, to override the video of all
channels in the City simultaneously. Each cable system shall include the
capability to cable-cast from the City's headquarters for civil defense,
disaster and emergency services. In the event of any such use by the City of
the emergency override system, the City will hold the grantee harmless from any
damages or penalties resulting from such use of the system and will indemnify
the grantee for the same.
   (d)   A grantee shall establish reasonable rules and procedures designed to
promote the utilization of public, educational and governmental access
programming, subject to the approval of the City.
   (e)   A grantee shall use its best efforts to interconnect with neighboring
cable systems and with other cable systems within the service area so as to
enable each cable system to carry and cable-cast the public, educational and
governmental access programming of the other cable systems. Interconnection of
cable systems may be done by direct cable connection, microwave link, satellite
or other appropriate method.
(Ord. 1996-17. Passed 5-21-96.)
809.10 CUSTOMER SERVICE STANDARDS.
   (a)   Nothing in this chapter is intended to prevent or prohibit:
      (1)   The City and a grantee from agreeing to customer service
requirements that exceed the standards set forth in this chapter;
      (2)   The City from enforcing through the end of the franchise term pre-
existing customer service requirements that exceed the standards set forth in
this chapter and are contained in current franchise agreements;
      (3)   The City from enacting or enforcing any consumer protection law; or
      (4)   The establishment or enforcement of any ordinance or regulation
concerning customer service that imposes customer service requirements that
exceed, or address matters not addressed by, the standards set forth in this
chapter.
   (b)   A grantee is subject to the following customer service standards:
      (1)   The grantee will maintain a local, toll-free, 1-800 or collect call
telephone access line which will be available to subscribers twenty-four hours
a day, seven days a week. Trained company representatives shall be available to
respond to customer telephone inquiries during normal business hours. After
normal business hours, the access line may be answered by a service or an
automated response system, including an answering machine. Inquiries received
after normal business hours must be responded to by a trained company
representative on the next business day.
      (2)   Under normal operating conditions, telephone answer time by a
company representative, including wait time, shall not exceed thirty seconds
when the connection is made. If the call needs to be transferred, transfer time
shall not exceed thirty seconds. These standards shall be met no less than
ninety percent of the time under normal operating conditions measured on a
quarterly basis. The operator may be required to acquire equipment or perform
surveys to measure compliance with these telephone answering standards if
complaints indicate a failure to comply.
      (3)   Under normal operating conditions, the customers may receive a busy
signal less than three percent of the time measured on a quarterly basis.
      (4)   A grantee shall arrange to have one or more convenient locations
available within eight miles of the City (in facilities operated either by
grantee or by unrelated third parties retained by the grantee for such purpose)
where customers will be allowed to pay their cable bills in person. A grantee
shall further arrange to have service technicians available to pick up set-top
boxes from subscribers within twenty-four hours of the grantee's receipt of the
subscribers' request.
      (5)   Under normal operating conditions, each of the following five
standards will be met no less than ninety-five percent of the time measured on
a quarterly basis:
         A.   Standard installations will be performed seven business days
after an order has been placed. Standard installations are those that are
located not more than 125 feet from the existing distribution system; they do
not include commercial or multiple-dwelling unit building ("MDU")
installations, nor inside "wall-fish" installations.
         B.   Excluding conditions beyond the control of the operator, a
grantee shall begin working on service interruptions promptly and in no event
later than twenty-four hours after the interruption becomes known. The grantee
must begin actions to correct other service problems the next business day
after notification of the service problem.
         C.   The appointment window for installations, service calls and other
installation activities will be either a specific time or, at maximum, a four-
hour block during normal business hours. The operator may schedule service
calls and other installation activities outside of normal business hours for
the express convenience of the customer.
         D.   A grantee may not cancel an appointment with a customer after the
close of business on the business day prior to the scheduled appointment.
         E.   If a grantee representative is running late for an appointment
and will not be able to keep the appointment as scheduled, the customer will be
contacted. The appointment will be rescheduled, as necessary, at a time which
is convenient for the customer.
      (6)   A grantee shall provide written information on each of the
following areas at the time of installation of service, at least annually, to
all subscribers, and at any time upon request:
         A.   Products and services offered;
         B.   Prices and options for programming services and conditions of
subscription to programming and other services;

         F.   Billing and complaint procedures, including the address and
telephone number of the grantee and of the City.
      (7)   Bills shall be clear, concise and understandable. Bills must be
fully itemized, with itemizations including, but not limited to, basic and
premium service charges and equipment charges. Bills shall clearly delineate
all activity during the billing period, including operational charges, rebates
and credits. Customer service standards which exceed Federal standards may be
treated as external costs under Federal rate regulations. In case of a billing
dispute, a grantee must respond to a written complaint from a subscriber within
thirty days.
      (8)   Where applicable, refund checks will be issued within sixty days
of:
         A.   The resolution of any billing inquiry;
         B.   The return of the equipment supplied by the grantee if service is
terminated; or
         C.   The termination of service, when a refund is due.
      (9)   Credits will be issued no later than the customer's next billing
cycle following the determination that a credit is warranted.

day. Interruptions of service shall be for the shortest possible time.
   (b)   A written log shall be maintained throughout the term of the franchise
by a grantee listing all service interruptions affecting ten percent of the
system subscribers. Said log shall be available for inspection by the public
upon reasonable notice.
   (c)   Upon request, a grantee shall provide a subscriber with credit or a
rebate for a service outage exceeding six hours in duration beyond the time
that the subscriber notified the grantee of such outage. No credit or rebate
shall be required where the outage was due to matters beyond the immediate
control of the grantee, such as (by way of example and not limitation) service
outages caused by storms or other natural disasters. In no event shall the
subscriber incur a charge for any outage exceeding forty-eight hours.
   (d)   A grantee shall not deny, delay or otherwise burden cable service or
use of access facilities, or otherwise discriminate against subscribers or
users, on the basis of age, race, creed, color, sex, national origin or marital
status.
   (e)   Any change made by a grantee in its programming (channels carried),
except those of an emergency nature beyond the grantee's control, shall not
become effective until the grantee has notified its subscribers at least thirty
days in advance. Notification must be made in writing to each subscriber and to
the City.
(Ord. 1996-17. Passed 5-21-96.)
809.13 "PARENTAL GUIDANCE" OR "LOCK-OUT" DEVICES.
   A grantee shall make available to all subscribers, upon written request, a
"parental guidance" or "lock-out" device which shall permit the subscriber, at
his or her option, to eliminate comprehensible video and audio reception of any
premium or pay-per-view channel.

places and to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of
adjoining property owners.

public way or other public property, a grantee shall, at its own expense,
promptly and in an acceptable manner, replace, repair and otherwise restore
such disturbance or damage.
   (e)   If, at any time during the term of a franchise, the City shall
properly elect to undertake public building or construction, altering the

grantee shall promptly, upon reasonable notice from the City, remove and
relocate its facilities, subject to the same terms as public utilities.
   (f)   A grantee shall at all times employ ordinary care and shall install
and maintain industry standards and services for preventing failures and

      (3)   During the review period described in paragraph (a)(2) hereof, the
City may advise the grantee that a public hearing is deemed necessary to
evaluate any potential adverse effects of the sale or transfer upon the

bond shall be for the purpose of allowing recovery of any and all damages,
losses or costs suffered as a result of the failure of a grantee to
satisfactorily complete and fully activate the cable system.
   (b)   At that point in time when the grantee can show to the City that
energized trunk cable passes all homes in accordance with Section
809.04, the performance bond shall be terminated.
   (c)   The corporate surety bond (if used) shall contain the following
endorsement:
      "It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled by
the surety nor the intention not to renew be exercised by the surety until
sixty days after receipt by the City, by registered mail, of a written notice
of such intent to cancel or not to renew."

of flexibility in the cable system and to achieve a continuing, advanced,
modern system, a grantee shall comply with the following review provisions:
   (a)   The Council shall hold a regular review hearing within thirty days of
the third anniversary date of the execution of the franchise. Subsequent review
hearings shall be scheduled every third year. All such review hearings shall be
open to the public and notice shall be given by advertisement twice in a
newspaper of general circulation at least one week before each session.
      In addition, the grantee shall announce the date and time of each such
session on each of at least five days immediately preceding each session at a
minimum of six regularly scheduled intervals daily on the cable system.
   (b)   Topics for discussion and review at both the regular and special

809.20 REMOVAL OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   Upon expiration and non-renewal, termination or revocation of a
franchise, and if neither the City nor an assignee purchases the cable system,
a grantee may remove any underground cable from the streets if such cable has
been installed in such a manner that it can be removed without trenching or
other opening of the streets along the extension of cable to be removed. The
grantee may remove any underground cable or conduit which requires trenching or
other opening of the streets along the extension of cable to be removed only
upon posting a bond for the reasonable cost of street restoration with the
City, as determined by the City Engineer. The grantee shall remove, at its sole
cost and expense, any underground cable or conduit by trenching or opening of
the streets along the extension thereof, or otherwise, which cable or conduit
is ordered to be removed based upon a determination that removal is required in
order to eliminate or prevent a hazardous condition or promote future
utilization of the streets for public purposes. Any order to remove cable or
conduit shall be mailed to the grantee not later than thirty calendar days
following the date of expiration of the franchise. Not later than thirty
calendar days following the date of expiration, termination or revocation of
the franchise, a grantee shall file written notice of its intention to remove
cable intended to be removed and a schedule for removal by location. The
schedule and timing of removal shall be subject to approval and regulation by
the City. Removal shall be completed not later than twelve months following the
date of expiration of the franchise. Underground cable and conduit in the
streets which is not removed within said twelve-month period shall be deemed
abandoned and title shall be vested in the City.
   (b)   Upon expiration and non-renewal, termination or revocation of a
franchise, a grantee, at its sole expense, shall, unless relieved of the
obligation, remove from the streets all above-ground elements of the cable
system, including, but not limited to, amplifier boxes, pedestal-mounted
terminal boxes, and cable attached to or suspended from poles.
   (c)   A grantee shall apply for and obtain such encroachment permits,
licenses, authorizations or other approvals, and pay such fees and deposit such
security, as required by applicable ordinance. The grantee shall conduct and
complete the work of removal in compliance with all such applicable ordinances
and shall restore the streets to the same condition they were in before the
work of removal commenced. The work of removal shall be completed not later
than one year from commencement thereof.
(Ord. 1996-17. Passed 5-21-96.)
809.21 CONTINUITY OF SERVICE.
   (a)   It shall be the right of all subscribers to receive all available
services insofar as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are
honored. In the event that the grantee elects to overbuild, rebuild, modify or
sell the cable system, or if the Council terminates, revokes or fails to renew
the franchise within a reasonable time, or if the Council elects to purchase
the cable system, the grantee shall do everything in its power to ensure that
all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service.
   (b)   In the event of purchase by the City or a change of grantee, the
current grantee shall cooperate with the City in maintaining continuity of
service to all subscribers. In the event that interruption of service is
required by the grantee for modification, repairs or the like, the interruption
shall be as brief as possible and at times when the viewing audience is at a
minimum. Records of such interruptions shall be kept.

conditions. The grantee also agrees to provide all services set forth in its
application and proposal, if any, to provide cable services within the confines
of the City and, by its acceptance of the franchise, the grantee specifically
agrees that its application and proposal, if any, are incorporated by reference
and made a part of the franchise.

State or local law, or the failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee to
perform its obligations under the terms and conditions of a franchise, except
that any delay, preemption or other failure to perform, including, but not
limited to, system construction, caused by factors beyond the parties'
reasonable control, such as an act of God, labor dispute, non-delivery by

818.01 GRANT OF NON-EXCLUSIVE RIGHT.
   (a)   Term. The City of Wayne (hereinafter the "City") will grant to a
franchisee (hereinafter the "grantee"), subject to the terms and conditions set
forth below, the non-exclusive right, power and authority to use electric lines
consisting of towers, masts, poles, cross-arms, guys, braces, feeders,
transmission and distribution wires, transformers and other electrical
appliances (hereinafter "electric system") that are owned either by Detroit
Edison or by any other electric utility which has the necessary authority from
the Michigan Public Service Commission and a valid franchise from the City,
which electric system exists on, along, across and under the highways, streets,
alleys and bridges of the City (hereinafter "public ways") and to do local
electric business in the City of Wayne, Wayne County, Michigan, for a period of
five years, but ending no later than March 1, 2007.
   (b)   Expansion of System. After first obtaining approval from the City of
the route and placement of the electric system components, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, the grantee may expand its use of the public ways
by constructing and maintaining its own towers, masts, poles, cross-arms, guys,
braces, feeders, transmission and distribution wires, transformers and other
electric appliances. Any expansion of the electric system by the grantee as
approved by the City shall be subject to all terms and conditions of this
chapter, including the requirements of Section
818.03(l) related to the expansion of the electric system.
   (c)   Location in Public Ways. To the maximum extent possible, the grantee
shall place its electric system on, within and along existing utility
facilities in the public ways.
   (d)   Lease. The grantee shall not lease or sublease any portion of its
electric system within the City to a person who by law is required to obtain
the City's permission or consent to transact business in the City and who lacks
such permission or consent. The grantee shall not allow the property of a third
party or non-electric system wires or any other facilities to be overlashed,
affixed or attached to any portion of its electric system or allow other
actions with a similar result without the written consent of the chief
executive officer or that person's designee.
(Ord. 2000-02. Passed 1-18-00.)
818.02 CONSIDERATION; COSTS; RIGHT-OF-WAY FEES.
   (a)   In consideration of the rights, power and authority granted by the
City, the grantee shall faithfully perform all duties required by the terms of
this chapter.
   (b)   In further consideration of the rights, power and authority granted by
the City, the grantee agrees:
      (1)   To pay to the City a non-refundable application fee in the amount
of five thousand dollars ($5,000);
      (2)   To pay an annual franchise fee to the City. Said fee shall be paid
upon the execution of a contract to operate an electrical utility franchise,
which shall be executed by the grantee prior to conducting business in the
City. To the greatest extent possible, the City will execute similar franchise
agreements with each applicant that applies to operate an electrical utility
franchise within the City. The City reserves the right to modify said agreement
to reflect the uniqueness or particular needs of a particular franchisee and
its relationship with the City. If the City deems it necessary to protect the
public health, safety, or welfare of its citizens, the City may, in its sole
and uncontrolled discretion, modify the uniform contract as it deems
appropriate.
      (3)   The franchisee (grantee) shall pay an annual franchise fee in
accordance with the following schedule.
         A.   For the servicing of one customer, seven hundred fifty dollars
($750.00).
         B.   For the serving of no less than two and no more nine customers,
one thousand dollars ($1,000).
         C.   For the servicing of ten or more customers, one thousand, five
hundred dollars ($1,500).
   (c)   In the event that the grantee, or any company which is a subsidiary,
affiliate or other related company to the grantee, pays a fee, charge or other
payment of any kind on a periodic basis (such as monthly, quarterly, annually)
to any municipality in the State of Michigan as a condition, or in
consideration for the right to transact a local utility business in that
municipality, the grantee shall notify the City, in writing, of the details of
the fee or periodic charge.
   (d)   The grantee agrees to abide by any future ordinance(s) of the City, if
and when formally adopted, which may require the payment by the grantee of a
fee, charge or other payment on a periodic basis (such as monthly, quarterly,
annually), provided that any such future ordinance(s) apply equally to all
electric franchise holders. The City shall notify the grantee within sixty days
of the formal adoption of such an ordinance by the City, at which time the
franchise granted by this chapter shall be automatically revoked. Any new
franchise granted by the City to the grantee shall be subject to the provisions
of such future ordinance(s), and shall require payment of a fee or periodic
charge as a condition of the new franchise.
(Ord. 2000-02. Passed 1-18-00.)
818.03 USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY BY GRANTEE.
   (a)   No Burden on Public Ways. The grantee and its contractors,
subcontractors and the grantee's electric system shall not unduly burden or
interfere with the present or future use of any of the public ways within the
City of Wayne. The grantee shall erect and maintain its electric system so as
to cause minimum interference with the use of the public ways and with the
rights or reasonable convenience of property owners. No public way shall be
obstructed longer than necessary during the work of construction or repair to
the electric system. The grantee's cable, wires, structures and equipment shall
be suspended or buried so as to not endanger or injure persons or property in
the public ways. If the City in its reasonable judgment determines that any
portion of the electric system constitutes an undue burden or interference, the
grantee at its expense shall modify its electric system or take such other
actions as the City may determine is in the public interest to remove or
alleviate the burden, and the grantee shall do so within the time period
established by the City.

subcontractors shall immediately restore, at the grantee's sole cost and
expense and in a manner approved by the City, any portion of the public ways
that is in any way disturbed, damaged, or injured by the construction,
operation, maintenance or removal of the electric system to as good or better
condition than that which existed prior to the disturbance. In the event that
the grantee, its contractor or subcontractors fail to make such repair within
the time specified by the City, the City shall be entitled to complete the
repair and the grantee shall pay the costs of the City for such repair.
   (c)   Easements. Any easements over or under private property necessary for
the construction or operation of the electric system shall be arranged and paid
for by the grantee. Any use or intrusion on private property without an
easement or other instrument evidencing permission of the property owner shall
constitute a trespass by the grantee and a violation of this chapter. Any
easements over or under property owned by the City other than the public ways
shall be separately negotiated with the City.
   (d)   Tree Trimming. The grantee may trim trees upon and overhanging the
public ways so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming into

previously informing the City.

to this end.
   The goals of such coordination shall be to require the grantee to conduct
all known work in the public ways in conjunction with or immediately prior to
any street resurfacing planned by the City, and to prevent the public ways from
being disturbed by the grantee for a period of years after such street
resurfacing.
   In addition to any other fees or payments required by this chapter, the
grantee shall pay to the City the sum of ten dollars ($10.00) for each foot cut
into or excavation of any public way, or portion thereof, which was subject to
street resurfacing within eighteen months prior to such cut or excavation. This
fee is in addition to and not in lieu of the obligation to restore the public
ways and is in addition to all other fees required by this chapter or any other
ordinances of the City.

portions of the electric system shall be marked with a marker on its lines on
alternate poles which shall state the grantee's name and provide a toll-free
number to call for assistance. Direct buried underground portions of the
electric system shall have (1) a conducting wire placed in the ground at least
several inches above the grantees's cable or wire (if such cable or wire is
non-conductive); (2) at least several inches above that a continuous colored
tape with the grantee's name and a toll-free number and a statement to the
effect that there is buried cable beneath; and (3) stakes or other appropriate
aboveground markers with the grantee's name and a toll-free number indicating
that there is buried cable below.
   (g)   Compliance With Laws. The grantee shall comply with all laws,
statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations regarding the installation,
construction, ownership or use of its electric system, whether Federal, State
or local, now in force or which hereafter may be promulgated (including,
without limitation, any ordinance requiring the installation of additional
conduit when the grantee installs underground conduit for its electric system).
Before any installation is commenced, the grantee shall secure all necessary
permits, licenses and approvals from all appropriate departments, agencies,
boards or commissions of the City or other governmental entity as may be
required by law, including, without limitation, all utility line permits and
highway permits. The grantee shall comply in all respects with applicable codes

Safety Code (latest edition) and the National Electrical Code (latest edition).
The grantee shall comply with all zoning and land use ordinances and historic
preservation ordinances as may exist or may hereafter be amended.
   (h)   Street Vacation. If the City vacates or consents to the vacation of a
street or alley within its jurisdiction, and such vacation necessitates the
removal and relocation of the grantee's facilities in the vacated public way,
the grantee agrees, as a condition of this chapter, to consent to the vacation
and to move its facilities at its sole cost and expense when asked to do so by
the City or a court of competent jurisdiction. The grantee shall relocate its
facilities to such alternative route as the City, acting reasonably and in good
faith, shall designate.
   (i)   Relocation. If the City requests the grantee to relocate, protect,
support, disconnect, or remove its facilities because of street or utility
work, the grantee shall relocate, protect, support, disconnect, or remove its
facilities, at its sole expense, to such alternate route as City, acting
reasonably and in good faith, shall designate.
   (j)   Public Emergency. The City shall have the right to sever, disrupt, dig
up or otherwise destroy facilities of the grantee, without any prior notice, if
such action is deemed necessary because of a public emergency. Public emergency
shall be any condition which, in the opinion of any of the officials named,
poses an immediate threat to the lives or property of the citizens of the City,
caused by any natural or man-made disaster, including, but not limited to,
storms, floods, fire, accidents, explosions, major water main breaks, hazardous
material spills, etc., the grantee shall be responsible for repair at its sole
expense of any of its facilities damaged pursuant to any such action taken by
the City.
   (k)   MISS DIG. If eligible to join, the grantee shall subscribe to and be a
member of "MISS DIG", the association of utilities formed pursuant to Act 53 of
the Public Acts of 1974, as amended, MCL 460.701 et seq., and shall conduct its
business in conformance with the statutory provisions and regulations
promulgated thereunder.
   (l)   Use of Existing Facilities; Compensation to City. The grantee shall
utilize existing poles, conduits, and other facilities wherever practicable,
and shall not construct or install any new, different, or additional poles, or
other facilities unless expressly authorized by the City. Where existing
utility wiring is located underground, either at the time of initial
construction or subsequent thereto, the grantee's electric system shall also be
located underground unless otherwise expressly authorized by the City. In the
event the grantee desires to utilize existing poles, conduits or other
facilities owned by the City, the grantee shall be obligated to pay the
existing standard charge for attachment to, placement in, or other use of those
facilities.
   To the extent that the grantee chooses to construct its own utility wiring
or other new facilities, the grantee agrees to compensate the City for use of
the public rights-of-way. Unless otherwise agreed by the City and the grantee,
the compensation shall be paid at the same rate per linear foot of wiring or
other facilities installed as that rate which is charged to telecommunications
providers under the then-current City ordinance regulating telecommunications
systems.
   (m)   Underground Relocation. If the grantee has its facilities on Detroit
Edison or any other public utility company's above-ground utility poles and the
owner of said poles relocates its facilities to an underground conduit, the
grantee shall relocate its facilities underground in the same location.

824.01 GAS STATION DEFINED.
   As used in this chapter, "gas station" means a building or premises, or
portions thereof, arranged or designed to be used for the retail sale of oil,
gasoline or other fuel for the propulsion or lubrication of motor vehicles,
including facilities for changing and repairing tires, polishing, greasing,
washing, repairing, storage, bumping, painting and body repairing of motor
vehicles, including motorcycles and other motor vehicles having fewer than four
wheels, but excluding so-called high-speed automatic washing and steam
cleaning.
(Ord. 59. Passed 3-16-82.)
824.02 APPLICATION OF CHAPTER.
   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, this chapter shall apply to
gas stations existing and hereafter erected and constructed in the City.
(Ord. 59. Passed 3-16-82.)
824.03 DECLARATION OF NECESSITY; FINDINGS.
   Council hereby determines that it is necessary, in order to provide for the
health, safety and welfare of the people of the City, to establish uniform
rules for the location, equipment and operation of gas stations in the City and
to regulate the same, including their number. After extensive hearings, a
review of complaints and a complete study, the following determinations were
made:
   (a)   That the operation of gas stations is in need of regulation in order
to ensure the quiet, peaceful enjoyment of the areas adjacent to such stations
by the residents of the City;
   (b)   That the unrestricted and unregulated operation of gas stations can
lead to abuse and to the creation of a nuisance;
   (c)   That the regulation of the location, the construction, the activities
and the equipment of gas stations are necessary in order to compromise the
conflict which can arise between the operation of such business and the
enjoyment of the adjacent residential areas; and
   (d)   That among other things, the noise and traffic problems occasioned by
the constant ingress and egress of motor vehicles, the lights, vibration, dust,
danger of fire and/or explosions, and the necessity of curb cuts incidental to
the operation of gas stations, are factors peculiar to such business which
warrant its being the subject of regulations as set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 59. Passed 3-16-82.)
824.04 COMPLIANCE WITH BUILDING AND ZONING CODES; AUTHORIZATION BY BOARD OF
ZONING APPEALS REQUIRED; LOCATION.
   (a)   Compliance with Building Code. No gas station shall hereafter be
erected unless the building, structure or premises to be used for such business
conforms and complies with the Building and Zoning Codes of the City.
   (b)   Board of Zoning Appeals Authorization. Gas stations shall hereafter be
erected or constructed only in those districts provided by the Zoning Code of
the City, and then only upon authorization by the Board of Zoning Appeals after
public notice and a hearing as provided in Section
824.05.
   (c)   Location. No gas station shall be erected or located within 300 yards
of a church, hospital, school or other institution where large numbers of
pedestrians congregate.
(Ord. 59. Passed 3-16-82.)
824.05 HEARINGS BEFORE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   (a)   Notice. When an application is made for a permit to construct and
establish a gas station, such application shall be filed in proper form with
the City Clerk, together with a request for a hearing thereon. The Clerk shall
immediately place the request for a hearing upon the calendar for hearings and
shall cause notices, stating the time, place and object of the hearing, to be

service island attendant shall be in constant attendance at the control console
at all times.
   (i)   Fuel dispensing nozzles on self-service dispensing devices shall only

dispensers, underground fillpipe opening and lubrication or service room.
   (k)   Metal warning signs, printed in not less than three-inch block
letters, shall be conspicuously posted in the dispensing area incorporating the

shall be in conformity with the Zoning Code.
   (q)   Any gas station that has self-service motor fuel dispensing devices
shall provide an Underwriter's Laboratory-approved fixed-pipe dry chemical fire
extinguishing system, provided with combined manual and automatic controls,
which shall be installed in a manner to cover the area of all self-service
dispensing devices of all Class I flammable liquids. Manual control shall be

accessories for motor vehicles. The sale of liquid beverages, candy and
cigarettes shall not constitute a violation of this subsection.
   (t)   At least one qualified self-service island attendant shall be on duty
at all times while a self-service operation is available to the public. A self-
service attendant's primary function shall be to supervise, observe and control
the dispensing of motor fuel while it is being dispensed. It is the
responsibility of the self-service island attendant to prevent the dispensing
of gasoline into unapproved portable containers, to control sources of
ignition, to handle accidental spills, to monitor the control console, to
ensure that an unobstructed view of the self-service island pumps is
maintained, and to make certain that all required safety procedures are
followed.
   (u)   No person shall operate or monitor the self-service control console
equipment without first having been examined for proficiency and knowledge of
the appropriate self-service safety precautions and procedures by the Fire
Chief or his or her designate. Persons passing the examination shall be
qualified self-service island attendants and shall be issued a certificate
indicating the same. There shall be a five dollar ($5.00) fee charged for the
taking of the examination. A qualified self-service island attendant shall keep
this certificate in his or her possession at all times while on duty.
   (v)   The Fire Chief shall promulgate a standard form examination to carry
out the provisions of subsection (u) hereof. The examination shall be given by
Fire Division personnel at Fire Division headquarters between the hours of 9:00
a.m. and 7:00 p.m.
   The applicant shall possess a valid State of Michigan driver's license or a
State of Michigan identification card, in addition to a Social Security card.
   (w)   All self-service attendant certificates shall remain in effect for as
long as the bearer maintains continuous employment with the same employer that
he or she was employed by at the time of issue, unless such certificate is
revoked by the Fire Chief. This certificate shall be available for viewing at
the place of employment anytime the attendant is dispensing a product at a
service station. Failure to produce a valid self-service attendant certificate
to a member of the Fire Division requesting such shall be cause for immediate
shutdown of all self-service operations. Once a certificate has been revoked
for any reason, the applicant is required to re-test before another certificate
will be issued to said person.

   (a)   Each gas station shall have an area designated for the parking of
motor vehicles of customers availing themselves of services and/or products of
the gas station other than the obtaining of motor fuel. Such area may be used
to facilitate outside storage of vehicles disabled or in need of repair or
which are in the process of repair. No such disabled vehicle shall remain in

   (b)   No motor vehicle in outside storage shall be on the premises of any

inoperative gas station constitutes a danger to the public health, safety,
comfort and welfare, in that such conditions lead to unsightliness, blight,
fire hazards, infestation, decrease of values to surrounding property and
vandalism, and that such abuses of property entitle the City to exercise its
police powers to protect the health, safety, comfort and welfare of the
community. The purpose of this section, therefore, is to provide for the
orderly abatement of closed, vacant and inoperative gas stations.

previously contained any flammable substance, and all paving placed in
connection with the gas station.
      (3)   "Conditions of non-use" refers to the following:
         A.   When all of the subsurface tanks used for storage of flammable
substances at a gas station site have been permanently filled or removed,
Council may, upon making a finding that the site can no longer be used for a
gas station, declare the site and all buildings therein and thereon to be
closed, vacant and inoperative.
         B.   After a voluntary discontinuance of a gas station as a
nonconforming use, Council may find that such discontinuance constitutes non-
use.
      (4)   "Enforcement authority" means the Building Official of the City.
   (c)   Regulations. At an abandoned gas station, the owner shall:
      (1)   Post signs on the premises stating that vehicular parking is
prohibited;
      (2)   Keep the premises neat and free of rubbish and debris; the area
shall be cleaned not less often than once per week;

and the making of reports to enforcement officers; and to prescribe penalties
for the violation of this chapter.

870.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   The City of Wayne has the authority to grant licenses and franchises for
telecommunications systems offering public or private line video, data or voice
services using or crossing streets, highways, rights-of-way or easements in the
City. This chapter is intended to minimize the disruption to the streets,
highways, rights-of-way and easements and to require those who seek to
construct a telecommunication system to cooperate in the construction and the
restoration of streets, highways, rights-of-way and easements of both overhead
and underground lines. The City finds that it has too many unsightly overhead
lines and poles in some sections of the City. They are proliferating, adversely
affecting the public safety, detracting from property values and reaching
maximum safe capacity of poles and underground spaces. The City further finds
that public health, safety and welfare is better served by requiring
installation of new utility lines and wires in underground conduit wherever
practical.
(Ord. 99-07. Passed 3-2-99.)
870.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the granting of licenses and
franchises for telecommunication systems other than cable television systems
which provide only cable television services.
(Ord. 99-07. Passed 3-2-99.)
870.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless the context specifically indicates otherwise, the meaning of the
terms used in this chapter shall be as follows:
      (1)   "City" means the City of Wayne, Michigan.
      (2)   "Telecommunication services" includes regulated and unregulated
services, offering to customers the transmission of two-way interactive
communication and associated usage.
      (3)   "Telecommunication system" is a system used or to be used to
provide telecommunication service including public or private line video, data
or voice service to another person, using or crossing streets, highways,
rights-of-way or easements in the City other than cable television service
offered pursuant to a franchise granted under
Chapter 809 of the City Code, as amended.
      (4)   "Franchise" is a non-exclusive, limited authorization to transact
local business for title construction, maintenance and operation of a
telecommunication system in the City awarded by ordinance in the form of a
contract and accepted by the grantee.
      (5)   "Grantee" is any holder of a telecommunication system license or
franchise granted pursuant to this chapter.
      (6)   "Gross revenue" shall mean all receipts collected by the grantee
for all telecommunication and related operations and services within the
corporate limits of the City as well as any other revenue arising from
operation or possession of this franchise regardless of where billed. "Gross
revenue" shall also include:
         A.   Access charges paid to the grantee by other carriers.
         B.   The leases or re-sales of lines or circuit paths to third
parties.
         C.   All telecommunication services revenues charged on a flat rate
basis.
         D.   All telecommunication services charges on a usage sensitive or
mileage basis.
         E.   All revenues from local service.
         F.   All revenues from authorized rental of conduit space.
         G.   All revenues from authorized rentals of any portion of grantee's
system, including plants, facilities, or capacity leased to others.
         H.   All other revenues collected from the grantee's telecommunication
business pursued within the City, excluding third party billing arrangements
not related to the grantee's telecommunication business.
         I.   Recoveries of bad debts previously written off and revenues from
the sale or assignment of bad debts. Unrecovered bad debts charged off after
diligent but unsuccessful efforts to collect are excludable from gross revenues
from telecommunication business. "Gross revenue" does not include revenue
uncollected from customers (bad debts) and sale or lease of customer service
equipment, taxes, interconnection fees paid by the grantee to other
telecommunications carriers, or other similar types of pass-through charges for
which the grantee merely acts as a collecting agent and derives no economic
benefit or "markup."
      (7)   "License" is a written agreement granted by resolution for a
telecommunication system to use the rights-of-way, easements, highways,
streets, alleys, and other places in the City for wires, poles, pipes, conduits
or other public utility facilities, but not to transact local business with
another person.
      (8)   "Person" is any individual, firm, partnership, association,
corporation, company or organization.
      (9)   "Subscriber" is any person who contracts with the grantee for, or
is in any manner provided with, telecommunication services.
(Ord. 99-07. Passed 3-2-99.)
870.04 LICENSE AND FRANCHISE REQUIRED; APPLICATION OF CHAPTER; QUALIFICATIONS
OF GRANTEES; INTERPRETATION; FEES.
   (a)   No person shall install, construct, maintain or otherwise operate a
telecommunication system in the City without a telecommunication license and no
person shall transact local business on a telecommunication system in the City
without a franchise.
   (b)   This chapter shall apply to any existing cable television system
operating pursuant to a franchise awarded by the City, which the franchisee
uses to transact local business operating a telecommunication system. However,
this chapter exempts any existing institutional network operated by MediaOne
and Ameritech (SBS Communications) until the original terms of their franchises
expire, except to the extent that MediaOne and Ameritech (SBS Communications)
or any other entity uses such network for commercial non-cable services.
   (c)   Before offering or providing any telecommunication services, the
grantee shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations
or licenses for the offering or provision of such telecommunication services
from the appropriate Federal, State and local authorities, if required, and
shall submit to the City, upon the written request of the City, evidence of all
such approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses.
   (d)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as a waiver of any codes,
ordinances or regulations of the City or the City's right to require the
grantee or persons utilizing the telecommunication services to secure
appropriate permits or authorizations for such use. No fee or charge may be
imposed upon a grantee for any such permit or authorization, other than the
standard fees or charges generally applicable to all persons for such permits
or authorizations. Such standard fee or charge shall not be offset against the
annual license fee or franchise fee that the grantee is required to pay to the
City under Section
870.08.
(Ord. 99-07. Passed 3-2-99.)
870.05 ISSUANCE OF LICENSE AND FRANCHISE.
   (a)   The City may grant one or more licenses and franchises for a
telecommunication system in the City subject to this chapter.
   (b)   The City specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such
additional licenses and franchises for a telecommunication system as it deems
appropriate. Additional licenses and franchises shall not be deemed to modify,
revoke, terminate or damage any rights previously granted to any other grantee.
   (c)   In the event a license application is filed proposing to install
facilities within a franchise territory which overlaps in whole or in part an
existing area, a copy shall be served by the applicant by certified mail upon
the current grantee(s). The applicant shall notify the grantee of existing
overlapping territory. Proof that a copy of the application has been served
upon the current grantee(s) shall be provided to the City. No application for
overlapping territory shall be processed until proof of service has been
furnished to the City. It is not the intent of this chapter to either require
or prohibit overlapping.
   (d)   Applications for a new, renewed or amended franchise shall be made in
such form as the City may prescribe by resolution. New, renewed or amended
franchises which expand the scope of service shall be accompanied by a non-
refundable five thousand dollars ($5,000) partial prepayment of the franchise
formation fee.
(Ord. 99-07. Passed 3-2-99.)
870.06 DURATION OF LICENSE AND FRANCHISE.
   Any license or franchise and the rights, privileges, authority, and
responsibilities established, shall take effect and be in force from and after
final acceptance. It shall continue in force and effect for a period
established by the license or franchise, not exceeding fifteen years, provided
that within thirty days after the date of the City's final acceptance of a
license or franchise, the grantee files with the City Clerk its unconditional
acceptance of the license or franchise, all required letters of credit,
construction surety and insurance certificates, and pays to the City Clerk all
reasonable costs actually incurred by the City in preparing, considering and
awarding the license or franchise, including legal, engineering, technical,
publication and other expenses (the franchise formation fee described in
Section
870.09). If a grantee fails to timely comply with this section, it shall
acquire no rights, privileges, or authority whatsoever from the City. The City
Manager may extend the term of a license or franchise for a period not
exceeding one year by written agreement with a grantee on reasonable and
necessary terms.
(Ord. 99-07. Passed 3-2-99.)
870.07 RATE REGULATION.
   The rates and charges of a grantee subject to a franchise for the provision
of telecommunication services and for related services (such as equipment
rental, deposits, disconnect fees, and late payment fees) shall be subject to
regulation by the City to the full extent authorized by Federal or State law.
The City may from time to time elect not to regulate a grantee's rates and
charges, and any such election shall not waive the City's rights to regulate in
the future. Changes to rates and charges shall only be made after notice,
hearing and other requirements provided by law.
(Ord. 99-07. Passed 3-2-99.)
870.08 FRANCHISE FORMATION FEE AND ANNUAL FEE PAYMENTS BY GRANTEE.
   (a)   For the reason that the streets, highways and rights-of-way or
easements to be used by a grantee in the operation of its telecommunication
system within the boundaries of the City are valuable public properties, some
of which are acquired and maintained by the City at great expense to its
taxpayers, and that the grant to a grantee of the use of said streets,
highways, rights-of-way or easements is a valuable property right without which
a grantee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs
and acquisitions, a grantee shall pay:
      (1)   A franchise formation fee:
         A.   For franchises, ten thousand dollars ($10,000); or
         B.   For licenses, two thousand dollars ($2,000); and
      (2)   An annual fee equal to the lesser of five percent of its gross
revenue, or an amount determined as set forth in subsection (b) hereof.
   (b)   The fee to be charged to a grantee under paragraph (a)(2) hereof shall
be the grantee's allocated share of the following amounts:
      (1)   The estimated actual cost (excluding acquisition costs) incurred by
the City as a consequence of permitting a grantee to occupy a portion of the
public rights-of-way and in mediating disputes between the citizens of the City
and the grantee.
      (2)   The estimated actual costs referred to in paragraph (b)(1) hereof
shall be calculated every three years by the City Finance Director and shall be
subject to approval by the City Council following a public hearing. The costs
referred to in paragraph (b)(1) hereof shall be allocated among all of the
grantees based on their per-linear foot (not number of lines or capacity) of
the telecommunication system located upon, over, across or under the roads,
bridges, streets, rights-of-way and easements in the City.
      (3)   The annual fee required by paragraph (a)(2) hereof may be
determined using:
         A.   A percentage of gross revenues not exceeding five percent; or
         B.   $0.40 per linear foot of underground and $0.25 per linear foot of
overhead lines, wires, cables, poles, conduits and like structures, erections
and fixtures upon, over, across, or under the roads, bridges, streets, public
rights-of-way and easements in the City.
   (c)   Miscellaneous fee considerations shall include the following:
      (1)   Grantees sharing the same conduit shall each pay a full fee.
      (2)   Grantees sending signals over another grantee's existing line or a
line that is leased to another and upon which fees are already paid are not
subject to additional fees.
      (3)   Grantees using the same line to provide cable television service
and to provide telecommunication services shall be subject to both a cable
television franchise fee and all fees set by this chapter.
   (d)   A grantee shall pay to the City for each quarter an amount equal to
one-fourth of the minimum annual fee, calculated on the basis of a twelve-month
compensation year. A grantee shall forward by check or money order an amount
equal to the quarterly payment by noon of the twenty-fifth day of the calendar
month immediately following the close of the calendar quarter for which the
payment is calculated. Any necessary prorations shall be made.
   (e)   In the event any quarterly payment is made after noon on the date due,
a grantee shall pay a late payment penalty of the greater of one hundred
dollars ($100.00) or simple interest at ten percent annual percentage rate of
the total amount past due. Acceptance of money under this section shall not in
any way limit or inhibit any of the privileges or rights of the City, whether
under this chapter or otherwise.
   (f)   In the event the five percent of gross revenue option is utilized, a
grantee shall file annually with the City Manager no later than ninety days
after the end of the grantee's fiscal year, a statement of revenues (for that
year) attributable to the operations of the grantee's telecommunication system
within the City. Said statement shall be prepared in compliance with generally
accepted accounting practices and auditing standards. This statement of
revenues shall present a detailed breakdown of gross revenues and uncollectible
accounts for the year. This statement of revenues shall be certified by an
officer of the grantee, whose statement shall accompany the statement of
revenues.
   Any transactions which have the effect of circumventing payment of required
franchise fees and/or evasion of payment of franchise fees by non-collection or
non-reporting of gross revenues, bartering, or any other means which evade the
actual collection of revenues for business pursued by a grantee are prohibited.
   (g)   License and franchise fees shall be in addition to any other tax,
charge, fee, or payment due the City by a grantee.
(Ord. 99-07. Passed 3-2-99.)
870.09 NEW SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENTS; ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS; INTERPRETATION;
MODIFICATIONS OF LICENSES AND FRANCHISES.
   (a)   A grantee may, from time to time, implement new services and
developments, provided that they comply with all Federal, State and local laws.
   (b)   In addition to those matters required in a franchise, the grantees
shall make the following express acknowledgments:
      (1)   That the City has the right to make reasonable amendments to this
chapter which do not materially increase any financial, economic or performance
burden to the detriment of a grantee during the term of the license or
franchise upon ninety days' notice to the grantee, or without notice with
respect to an emergency amendment. It further recognizes and agrees that the
City shall in no way be bound to renew or extend the license or franchise at
the end of any license or franchise term and that it may be deemed a mere
licensee.
      (2)   That a grantee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the City
for any loss, expense or damage arising out of the failure of the City to have
the authority to grant all or any part of a license or franchise. A grantee
expressly acknowledges that on accepting a license or franchise, it does so
relying on its own investigation and understanding of the power and authority
of the City.
      (3)   By acceptance of a license or franchise, a grantee acknowledges
that it has not been induced to enter into a license or franchise by any
understanding or promise or other statement, whether verbal or written, by or
on behalf of the City or by any other third person concerning any term or
condition of a license or franchise not expressed in this chapter.
      (4)   A grantee further acknowledges by the acceptance of a license or
franchise that it has carefully read its terms and conditions, and does accept
all of the risks of the meaning of such terms and conditions.
         However, if any such State or Federal law or regulation shall require
a grantee to perform any service, or shall allow a grantee to perform any
service, in conflict with the terms of the license or franchise or of any law
or regulation of the City, then as soon as possible, a grantee shall notify the
City of the point of conflict believed to exist between such regulation or law
and the laws and regulations of the City or the license and franchise.
Notwithstanding such conflict, the grantee shall comply with the terms of the
license franchise unless released by the City.
   (c)   If any provision of a license or franchise is held by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid as conflicting with any Federal or State
law, rule or regulation now or hereafter in effect, or is held by such court to
be modified in any way in order to conform to the requirements of any law, rule
or regulation, said provision may be considered a separate, distinct and
independent part of the license or franchise, and such holding shall not affect
the validity and enforceability of all other provisions herein if the City so
determines. In the event that such law, rule or regulation is subsequently
repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed, so that the provision which
has been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with the law, rules
or regulations, said provision shall return to full force and effect and shall
be binding on the parties.
   (d)   If the parties determine that a material provision of a license or
franchise is affected by action of a court or of the State or Federal
government, the parties shall have the right to modify any of the provisions to
such reasonable extent as may be necessary to carry out the full intent and
purpose of the license and franchise.
(Ord. 99-07. Passed 3-2-99.)
870.10 LIABILITY.
   (a)   A grantee shall indemnify and hold harmless the City as set forth in
the license or franchise at all times during the life of a license or franchise
and will pay all damages and penalties which the City may be required to pay as
a result of granting a license or franchise to a grantee.
   (b)   A grantee shall at all times during the life of a license or franchise
carry and require its contractors and subcontractors to carry out public
liability, property damage, worker's disability, and vehicle insurance in such
form and amount as shall be determined by the City as set forth in the license
or franchise. All required insurance coverage shall provide for thirty day
notice to the City in the event of material alteration or cancellation of such
coverage prior to the effective date of such material alteration or
cancellation. Failure of the grantee to provide appropriate insurance
certificates to the City within sixty days after the execution of a license or
franchise shall render the license or franchise null and void.
(Ord. 99-07. Passed 3-2-99.)
870.11 RESPONSIBILITIES OF GRANTEES.
   (a)   If the grantee of a franchise provides a new service, facility,
equipment, fee or grant to any other community which it serves within the State
of Michigan, the same shall be provided in or to the City. The City shall waive
this requirement in a franchise upon an affirmative demonstration that such
service would be undesirable, impractical, infeasible or uneconomical in the
City due to population, density or other relevant factors.
   (b)   The grantee of a franchise shall allow the City to access the
telecommunication system from any City building, police station, fire station,
other public building, each school licensed by the State of Michigan, and each
public library within 500 feet of the telecommunication system on fees, terms
and conditions set forth in the franchise.
   (c)   Only in the event of a State or national emergency or other urgent
community need, a grantee of a franchise shall, upon request of the City, make
available its facilities to the City for the duration of the emergency.
   (d)   To the extent feasible, and subject to reasonable availability and
agreement among the franchisees concerning maintenance, access and security, a
telecommunication system shall be interconnected with other telecommunication
system within the City for the purpose of facilitation of the provision of
universal service in the City. Interconnecting may be done by direct cable or
fiber optical connection, microwave link, satellite, or other appropriate
method. The cost of such interconnection shall be equally shared by each
grantee. A grantee shall not impose any discriminatory or punitive
interconnection fee on a non-subscriber. A grantee shall not refuse or delay
access service or be unreasonable in connecting another grantee to the
telecommunication system or refuse or delay access service or be unreasonable
in connecting another grantee to the telecommunication system or refuse or
delay access service by any person to another telecommunication system.
(Ord. 99-07. Passed 3-2-99.)
870.12 CONDITIONS OF STREET OCCUPANCY.
   A grantee shall not commence construction upon, over, across, or under the
roads, bridges, streets, rights-of-way or easements in the City without first
obtaining a construction permit as required under Part Fourteen of the Codified
Ordinances - the Building and Housing Code, as amended, which shall apply to
the construction of a telecommunication system.
(Ord. 99-07. Passed 3-2-99.)
870.13 TECHNICAL AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (a)   Each grantee shall construct, install and maintain its
telecommunication system in a manner consistent and in compliance with all
applicable laws, ordinances, construction standards, governmental requirements,
and technical standards established by the Federal Communications Commission or
State agency.
   (b)   In any event, the telecommunication system shall not endanger or
interfere with the safety of persons or property within the City or other areas
where the grantee may have equipment.
   (c)   All working facilities, conditions, and procedures used or occurring
during construction of the system shall comply with the standards of the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
   (d)   Construction, installation and maintenance of a telecommunication
system shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner, and in close
coordination with public and private utilities serving the City following
accepted industry construction procedures and practices and working through
existing committees and organizations.
   (e)   All cable and wires shall be installed, where possible, parallel with
electric and telephone lines, and multiple cable configurations shall be
arranged in parallel and bundled with due respect for engineering
consideration.
   (f)   A grantee shall join the Miss Dig Program.
   (g)   When a grantee meets recognized engineering standards and the City, at
its option, requests additional linear footage, then the grantee shall not be
subject to the linear foot fee for such additional footage.
(Ord. 99-07. Passed 3-2-99.)
870.14 MAPS, RECORDS AND REPORTS.
   (a)   A grantee shall annually provide the City with current maps of its
existing and proposed installations in a standardized format for use with the
City's G.I.S. data system unless no changes have occurred in the previously
submitted material.
   (b)   The grantee of a franchise shall annually file with the City Clerk
fifteen copies of its annual financial reports, including its annual income
statement, a balance sheet, and a statement of its properties devoted to

information as may be requested by the City with respect to its property and
revenues, expenses or operations within the City. All information provided to
the City shall be maintained by the City as proprietary and confidential.
   (c)   An accurate and comprehensive file shall be kept by a franchise
grantee of all subscriber and user complaints regarding the telecommunication
system. A procedure shall be established by the grantee by the time of
installation of the system to quickly and reasonably remedy complaints to the
satisfaction of the City. Complete records of a grantee's actions in response
to all complaints shall be kept. These files and records shall remain open to
the public during normal business hours.
   (d)   A grantee shall submit to the City such other reasonable information
or reports in such form and at such times as the City may request.
   (e)   In the event the five percent of gross revenue option is utilized,
subject to the privacy rights of a grantee, this chapter, Federal and State
laws and regulations, a franchise grantee shall keep open books and records
relating to the financial operations of the telecommunication system provided
to the City. The City shall have the right to inspect, during normal business
hours, upon a two-day notice, all books, records, maps, plans, service
complaint logs, performance test results and other like materials of the
grantee which relate to the financial operation of the telecommunication
system. Access to the aforementioned records shall not be denied by the grantee
on the basis that the records contain proprietary information, provided that
the City maintains such information as proprietary and confidential.
   (f)   The City shall have the right to inspect the records of the grantee.
      (1)   Subject to the privacy rights of the grantee and this chapter and
to Federal and State laws and regulations, a franchise grantee shall keep open
all non-financial books and records relating to the operations of the
telecommunication system provided to the City. The City shall have the right to
inspect, during normal business hours, upon a two-day notice, all books,
records, maps, plans, service complaint logs, performance test results and
other like materials of the grantee which relate to the operation of the
telecommunication system. Access to the aforementioned records shall not be
denied by the grantee on the basis that the records contain proprietary
information, provided that the City maintains such information as proprietary
and confidential.
      (2)   A grantee shall allow the City to make inspections of any of the
grantee's telecommunication system within the City's boundaries at any time
upon one day notice or, in case of emergency, upon demand without notice.
   (g)   The refusal of the grantee to file any of the records or reports and
inspections required to be provided to the City under this section shall be
deemed a material breach, and shall subject the grantee to all penalties and
remedies, legal or equitable, which are available to the City.
   (h)   Any material, false or misleading statement or representation
knowingly made by the grantee in any report shall be deemed a material breech
of the license or franchise, and shall subject the grantee to all penalties and
remedies, legal or equitable, which are available to the City.
(Ord. 99-07. Passed 3-2-99.)
870.15 WAIVER.
   A grantee agrees not to oppose intervention by the City in any suit or
proceeding to which the grantee is a party relating to the City's franchise or
license. A grantee agrees to abide by all provisions of this chapter and its
license and franchise.
(Ord. 99-07. Passed 3-2-99.)
870.16 SALE OR TRANSFER OF RIGHTS OF FRANCHISES.
   (a)   Neither the franchise nor any of a grantee's interest therein or in
the facilities shall be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, leased, sublet,
hypothecated or mortgaged in any manner, in whole or in part, to any person or
entity, nor shall title thereto, either legal or equitable, or any right or
interest therein, or any property or assets relating to this franchise or the
facilities, pass to or vest in any person or entity, without the prior written
consent of the City, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. A Grantee shall not otherwise provide service to a person or entity
who or which the City contends is required to obtain a franchise from the City
and who or which lacks such franchise. Nothing herein shall prevent a grantee
from assigning its rights and obligations to an affiliate (defined as any
entity directly owned by a grantee or a parent entity of a grantee) or
subsidiary of a grantee upon notice to the City. Any assignment or transfer to
a subsidiary or affiliate of a grantee shall not relieve a grantee of its
liability hereunder. Further, nothing herein shall prevent or prohibit a
grantee or any of its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates, from granting a
security interest in the franchise or the facilities arising from a financing
transaction. The grant or waiver of any one or more of said consents shall not
render unnecessary any subsequent consent or consents, nor shall the grant of
any said consent constitute a waiver of any other rights of the City.
In the event of a foreclosure proceeding pursuant to the enforcement of a
security interest granted by a grantee, or any parent or subsidiary of a
grantee, the City shall have the right to approve the purchaser of the
franchise and/or the facilities at a foreclosure sale, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld or unduly delayed. The prohibition against sales,
assignments, transfers and similar actions shall also fully apply to any
transfer of control of grantee ("control") and such transfer of control shall
also require the prior written approval of the City, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld or unduly delayed.
   (b)   No franchise nor any part or portion of an interest in the franchise
may be sold, transferred or assigned until the facilities, equipment and
personnel which the grantee has proposed in the current franchise application
to provide and install pursuant to the franchise are 100 percent completed and
operational for a minimum period of three years, except to a grantee's parent,
affiliate or subsidiary.
   (c)   Any attempted transfer of the franchise, facilities, control or
similar action by a grantee in violation of this section shall be ineffective
and void and shall constitute a material event of default by a grantee.
(Ord. 99-07. Passed 3-2-99.)
870.17 CONSTRUCTION AND PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE AND LETTER OF CREDIT.
   A grantee shall, prior to construction and within thirty days of the
execution of a license or franchise, file with the City Clerk a letter of
credit or cash deposit in a reasonable amount set by the terms of the license
or franchise based upon the construction cost of the lines to be installed
upon, over, across, or under the roads, bridges, streets, rights-of-way or
easements in the City. The grantee and the City Engineer may make arrangements
for the periodic release of the cash deposit or letter of credit in
proportionate amounts as progress is made.
(Ord. 99-07. Passed 3-2-99.)
870.18 TERMINATION OF LICENSE OR FRANCHISE.
   (a)   In addition to all other rights and powers reserved or pertaining to
the City, the City reserves as an additional and as a separate and distinct
remedy the right to terminate a license or franchise and all rights and
privileges of a grantee in any of the following events or for any of the
following reasons:
      (1)   A grantee fails after thirty days prior written notice to comply
with any of the provisions of the license or franchise or has, by act or
omission, violated any term or condition thereof;
      (2)   A grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its debts,
or is adjudged bankrupt;
      (3)   All or part of a grantee's facilities are sold under an instrument

Ch. 1060
882.01 PURPOSE.
   It is found and declared in the areas of the City that are or may become
blighted with the resulting impairment of taxable values upon which, in large
part, municipal revenues depend, that such blighted areas are detrimental to
the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens and to the economic
welfare of the Municipality; that in order to improve and maintain the general
character of the Municipality it is necessary to rehabilitate such blighted
area; that the conditions found in blighted areas cannot be remedied by the
ordinary operations of private enterprise with due regard to the general
welfare of the public, without public participation. The purposes of this
chapter are to rehabilitate such areas by eliminating blight and blight factors
within all areas of the City for the protection of the health, safety, morals
and general welfare of the Municipality, to preserve existing values of other
properties within or adjacent to such areas and all other areas of the City,
and to preserve the taxable value of the property within such areas and all
other areas of the City. It is expressly recognized that blight is observable
at different stages of severity, and that moderate blight unremedied creates a
strong probability that severe blight will follow. Therefore, the conditions
that constitute blight are to be broadly construed to permit a municipality to
make an early identification of problems and to take early remedial action to
correct a demonstrated pattern of deterioration and to prevent worsening of
blight conditions.
(Ord. 2001-15. Passed 6-5-01.)

WAYNE TOWERS SENIOR CITIZEN HIGH-RISE
894.20 TITLE.
   This article shall be known and cited as the “City of Wayne Tax Exemption
Ordinance-Wayne Towers Senior Citizen High-Rise.”
(Ord. 2020-02. Passed 6-16-20.)
894.21 PREAMBLE.
   (a)   It is acknowledged that it is a proper public purpose of the State of
Michigan and its political subdivisions to provide housing for its low income
persons and families and to encourage the development of such housing by
providing for a service charge in lieu of property taxes in accordance with the
Act. The City is authorized by this Act to establish or change the service
charge to be paid in lieu of taxes by any or all classes of housing exempt from
taxation under this Act at any amount it chooses, not to exceed the taxes that
would be paid but for this Act. It is further acknowledged that such housing
for low income persons and families is a public necessity, and as the City will
be benefited and improved by such housing, the encouragement of the same by
providing real estate tax exemption for such housing is a valid public purpose.
It is further acknowledged that the continuance of the provisions of this
article for tax exemption and the service charge in lieu of all ad valorem
taxes during the period contemplated in this article are essential to the
determination of economic feasibility of the housing projects that is
constructed or rehabilitated with financing extended in reliance on such tax
exemption.
   (b)   The City acknowledges that the Sponsor (as defined below) owns and
operates a housing project identified as Wayne Towers Senior Citizen High-Rise
(the “Development”) on certain premises which are legally described as set
forth in Exhibit A attached to Ordinance No. 2020-02 and by reference made a
part hereof in the City and has offered to pay the City on account of the
development an annual service charge for public services in lieu of all ad
valorem property taxes.
(Ord. 2020-02. Passed 6-16-20.)
894.22 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   “Authority” means the Michigan State Housing Development Authority.
   (b)   “Low Income Persons” means persons eligible to move into a housing
project.
   (c)   “Sponsor” means Wayne Win Limited Dividend Housing Association Limited
Partnership, a Michigan limited partnership and any successor owner of the
development.
   (d)   “Low Income Persons” means persons eligible to move into a housing
project.

administered by the Authority under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended.
(Ord. 2020-02. Passed 6-16-20.)
894.23 CLASS OF HOUSING PROJECTS.
   It is determined that the class of housing projects to which the tax
exemption shall apply and for which a service charge shall be paid in lieu of
such taxes shall be housing projects for low income persons. It is further
determined that Wayne Towers Senior Citizen High-Rise is of this class.
(Ord. 2020-02. Passed 6-16-20.)
894.24 ESTABLISHMENT OF ANNUAL CHARGE.
   The housing project identified as Wayne Towers Senior Citizen High-Rise and
the property on which it is located shall be exempt from all ad valorem
property taxes from and after the effective date of this article. The City
acknowledges that the Sponsor and its lender has established that the continued
economic feasibility of development is reliant upon the enactment and
continuing effect of this article, and the qualification of the housing project
for exemption from all ad valorem property taxes and a payment in lieu of taxes
as established in this. Therefore, in consideration of the Sponsor’s offer to
continue to operate the development as an affordable housing project, the City
agrees to accept payment of an annual service charge for public services in
lieu of all ad valorem property taxes. The annual service charge shall be equal
to 10% of 95% of the total rental or occupancy charges collected or to be
collected by the Sponsor as to each of the living units within the development
during the then-current calendar year.
(Ord. 2020-02. Passed 6-16-20.)
894.25 CONTRACTUAL EFFECT OF ORDINANCE.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 15(a)(5) of the Act to the
contrary, a contract between the City and the Sponsor with the Authority as
third party beneficiary under the contract, to provide tax exemption and accept
payments in lieu of taxes, as previously described, is effectuated by enactment
of this article.
(Ord. 2020-02. Passed 6-16-20.)
894.26 LIMITATION ON THE PAYMENT OF ANNUAL SERVICE CHARGE.
   Notwithstanding Section
894.24, the service charge to be paid each year in lieu of taxes for the part
of the housing project that is tax exempt but which is occupied by other than
low income persons or families shall be equal to the full amount of the taxes
which would be paid on that portion of the housing project if the housing
project were not tax exempt.
(Ord. 2020-02. Passed 6-16-20.)
894.27 PAYMENT OF SERVICE CHARGE.
   The annual service charge in lieu of taxes as determined under this article
shall be payable in the same manner as general property taxes are payable to
the City and distributed to the several units levying the general property tax
in the same proportion as prevailed with the general property tax in the
previous calendar year. The annual payment for each operating year shall be
paid on or before August 15 of the following year. Collection procedures shall
be in accordance with the provisions of the General Property Tax Act (1893 PA
206, as amended; MCL 211.1 et seq.).

894.28 DURATION.
   This article shall remain in effect and shall not terminate for the longer

   (a)   Thirty-five years;
   (b)   So long as the Authority has any interest in the development; or

   (c)   The Building Official, or his or her designee, shall have the right to
enter, at any reasonable time, any property served by a connection to the
public water supply system of the City for the purpose of inspecting the piping
system or systems thereof for cross-connections. On request, the owner, lessees
or occupants of any property so served shall furnish to the inspection agency
any pertinent information regarding the piping system or systems on such
property. The refusal of access, when requested, shall be deemed evidence of
the presence of cross-connections.
(Ord. 1990-01. Passed 1-2-90.)
   (d)   The Department of Water and Sewers is hereby authorized and directed
to discontinue water service after reasonable notice to any property wherein
any connection in violation of this chapter exists, and to take such other
precautionary measures deemed necessary to eliminate any danger of
contamination of the public water supply system. Water service to such property
shall not be restored until all cross-connections have been eliminated in
compliance with this chapter.
   (e)   The potable water supply made available on the properties served by
the public water supply shall be protected from possible contamination as
specified by this chapter and by the State and City Plumbing Codes. Any water
outlet which could be used for potable or domestic purposes and which is not
supplied by the potable system must be labeled in a conspicuous manner as:

   (f)   This section shall not be construed as superseding the State and City
Plumbing Codes but as being supplementary to them.
   (g)   For the purpose of this section, a cross-connection is defined as a
connection or arrangement of piping or appurtenances through which water of
questionable quality, wastes or other contaminants are able to enter the public
water supply system.
(Ord. 54. Passed 10-21-80.)
1040.28 PRIVATE FIRE SERVICE PROTECTION.
   (a)   Scope. Whenever the City provides private fire protection, any
installation pertaining to the same shall be made and controlled under the
provisions of this section.
(Ord. 5. Passed 6-17-52.)
   (b)   Installation and Specifications. All private fire service
installations shall be made in accordance with specifications, rules and
regulations as may be prescribed by the Department and in accordance with
Chapter 1610 of these Codified Ordinances. Such installations shall be subject
to the approval of the Building Official.
(Ord. 1990-01. Passed 1-2-90.)
   (c)   Use of Installations. No private fire service shall be used for any
other purpose than the extinguishment of fires, or be connected in any manner
with any tap that may be used for other than fire purposes.
(Ord. 5. Passed 6-17-52.)
   (d)   Limitations on Connections. Because of the danger of pollution, no
fire service shall have any connection with any other source of supply unless
check valves are installed and approved as being adequate to prevent unsafe
water from running back into City mains. Such inspection and approval shall be
by the Superintendent or such other agency of competent jurisdiction as he or
she may designate.
(Ord. 1990-01. Passed 1-2-90.)

(Ord. 5. Passed 6-17-52.)
1040.29 WATER AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL RATES AND CHARGES.
   (a)   Rates and charges for the use of the water and wastewater system of
the City shall be based upon the user charge system methodology which complies
with applicable Federal and State regulations and which, from time to time,
shall be approved by Council. Revisions to the rates for water and sewer
service charges are to be established by resolution of Council, which shall be
enacted apart from the published ordinances as necessary to ensure sufficiency
of revenues in meeting operation, maintenance and replacement costs, as well as
debt service.
(Ord. 1992-32. Passed 11-2-92.)
   The purpose of the water and sewer charges established by the Council is to
provide for the payments heretofore noted for the purposes of preserving and
maintaining said system in good repair and in working order and further to
provide for the payment of interest upon and the principal upon all bonds which
may become due and payable.
   Said rating structure may further be used for the creation of a reserve
which may be required by other provisions of this chapter or other regulatory
agents and further to provide for the funds necessary for the expenditures as
may be otherwise required of the City in this chapter or by other regulatory
agencies.
   The City shall, not less than annually, review and revise, if necessary,
such rates as may be necessary to produce sufficient funds to provide for the
foregoing expenditures as may be determined in an annual audit.
   (b)   The City shall bill and collect from all users, as defined in this
chapter, not less than quarterly, the sums of money necessary to pay for those
expenditures alluded to in this chapter.
   (c)   All users, as defined in this chapter, of the City's water and/or
sewer system shall receive an annual notification either printed on the bill or
enclosed in a separate envelope which will show the breakdown of the sewer
service charge into its components for the following:
      (1)   Administration;
      (2)   Operation, maintenance and replacement; and
      (3)   The debt service charge.
   (d)   Other charges and fees in connection with the water and sewer system
shall be as provided in
Chapter 210 of the Administration Code.
(Ord. 1992-10. Passed 1-21-92.)
1040.30 DELINQUENCY; COLLECTIONS; DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE.
   The charges for water and sewer services which are, under the provisions of
Section 21 of Act 94 of the Public Acts of 1933, as amended, made a lien on all
premises served thereby, unless notice is given that a tenant is responsible,
are hereby recognized to constitute such lien, and whenever any such charge
against any piece of property shall be delinquent for six months, the City
official or officials in charge of the collection thereof shall certify
annually, as to each such delinquent account, to the tax assessing officer of
the City, the fact of such delinquency, whereupon such charge, together with a
delinquency charge of twenty-five percent, shall be by such tax assessing
officer entered upon the next tax roll as a charge against such premises and
shall be collected and the lien thereof enforced in the same manner as general
City taxes against such premises are collected and the lien thereof enforced.
At the time of such certification, notice shall be given to the person
responsible for such delinquent account of the fact of the certification and of
the delinquency charge. Where notice is given that a tenant is responsible for
water and sewer charges and services as provided by said Section 21 of Act 94,
no further service shall be rendered to such premises until a cash deposit of
not less than a sum equal to the estimated billing for such premises for two
billing periods shall have been made as security for payment of such charges
and services.
   In addition to other remedies provided, the City shall have the right to
shut off and discontinue the supply of water to any premises for the nonpayment
of water or sewer rates when due. If such charges are not paid within thirty
days after the due date thereof, then water service to such premises shall be
discontinued. Water service so discontinued shall not be restored until all
sums then due and owing shall be paid.
(Ord. 7-A-25. Passed 9-20-83.)
1040.31 DELINQUENCY; SURCHARGES.
   All bills and charges provided by Council shall be payable to the City
Treasurer on or before the due date established. Failure of payment as required
shall result in such account being classified as delinquent and ten percent of
the amount due shall immediately be added thereto and thereafter the account
shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter governing delinquent
accounts. An additional one-half percent of the total unpaid delinquent
balance, including penalty amounts, shall be added for every month the account
remains delinquent.
(Ord. 7-A-22. Passed 6-1-82.)
1040.32 OFFENSIVE SEWAGE; ADDITIONAL CHARGES, PRETREATMENT OR REFUSAL.
   If the character of sewage from any manufacturing or industrial plant or any
other building or premises is such as to impose an unreasonable additional
burden upon the Municipal sewerage system, then an additional charge may be
made over and above the regular rates, or it may be required that such sewage
be treated by the person responsible therefor before being emptied into the
sewer, or the right to empty such sewage may be denied if necessary for the
protection of the sewers and the sewage disposal facilities of the system or
the public health or safety.
(Ord. 7. Passed 4-9-63.)
1040.33 COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL WASTE POLLUTANT STRENGTH SURCHARGE.
   (a)   This section is adopted to comply with applicable Federal law and
regulations and the requirements of the settlement agreement in United States
of America vs City of Detroit, et al., Civil Action No. 771100, United States
District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, and, further,
to require users of the public wastewater system to pay a surcharge that
reflects the commercial and industrial users equitable share of the cost of
wastewater treatment in excess of the strength of domestic sewage, and,
further, has as its purpose the protection of public health and safety. Because
of the widely varying quality characteristics of the sewage discharged by
different users of the public sewer and the publicly owned treatment works, it
is the objective of this section, further, to impose sewage charges that
reflect the cost of treating sewage strength factors as well as sewage volume.
These charges to commercial and industrial users will be in the form of a
payment called a surcharge and will reflect industries' equitable costs of
wastewater treatment in excess of the strength of domestic sewage. Sewage
charges will be based on a volume rate and the surcharge will be based on
volume of discharge and the strength of BOD, suspended solids and phosphorus or
other pollutants present in the wastewater. If other pollutants are required to
be surcharged under this chapter, under authorized variances or by special
arrangement with the owner of the publicly owned treatment works, the rules and
regulations adopted herein will apply, such rules and regulations being on file
with the City Clerk.

      (4)   "Indirect discharge" means the discharge or the introduction of
nondomestic pollutants from any source regulated under Section 307(b) or (c) of
the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, P.L. 92-500, as amended, into the
public waste treatment system.
      (5)   "Industrial user" means a user whose premises are privately owned
and are used for manufacturing a product from raw or purchased material and
which discharge wastewater used in any way in the manufacturing process in
addition to domestic sewage.
      (6)   "Industrial waste" means any liquid, solid or gaseous waste or form
of energy, or combination thereof, resulting from any process of industry,
manufacturing, business, trade or research, including the development, recovery
or processing of natural resources.
      (7)   "Institutional user" means a user whose premises are owned by a
non-profit organization pursuant to Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (e.g. churches and hospitals) and discharge primarily domestic
sewage.
      (8)   "P" means phosphorus in the waste expressed in terms of milligrams
per liter.
      (9)   "Pollutant" means any dredged spoil, solid waste, incinerator
residue, sewage, garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, chemical waste, biological

the surface of, or is suspended in, water, wastewater or other liquids, and
which is removable by laboratory filtering as measured according to standard
methods.
      (13)   "User charge" means a charge based on units levied on a user of
the system for the user's proportionate share of the cost of operation and
maintenance (including replacement) of the system.
      (14)   "User surcharge" means a charge imposed on a user of the system
who discharge sewage or wastes in excess of normal strength.
      (15)   "Wastewater" or "sewage" means spent water which may be a
combination of the liquid and water-carried wastes from residences, commercial
buildings, industrial plants, institutions or other land uses, including
drainage water inadvertently present in such waste.
      (16)   "Wastewater system" or "sewer system" means any part or all of the
property, structures, equipment, sewers, materials and/or appurtenances used in
conjunction with the collection and disposal of wastewater, including the
publicly owned treatment work (POTW).
   (c)   The Schedule of Industrial Waste Pollutant Strength Surcharges is
hereby adopted and made effective for users of the wastewater system of the
City. Such surcharges shall be computed as follows:
COMPUTATION OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE
POLLUTANT STRENGTH SURCHARGE
The industrial waste pollutant strength surcharge shall be computed in
accordance with the following formula:
   SC=0.0624 V [a (BOD-275) + b (TSS-350) + c (P-12)]
WHERE:
SC   =   Pollutant strength surcharge fee in dollars for the billing period.
V   =   Volume of waste discharged in the billing period in Mcf (1,000 cubic
feet).
"BOD"   =    Five-day biochemical oxygen demand of the waste expressed in
milligrams per liter.
"TSS"   =    Total suspended solids in the waste expressed in milligrams per
liter.
"P"   =   Phosphorus in the waste expressed in milligrams per liter.
a,b,c   =   Surcharge rates, $/pound for treating BOD, TSS and P, respectively.
0.0624 =   Factor which converts Mcf to MM lbs.
         a   =   $   0.082/pound
         b   =      0.083/pound
         c   =      1.321/pound
For purposes of surcharge computation, the values of pollutant strength shall
not be less than the allowable values. The allowable values are:
               BOD - 275
               TSS - 350
               P - 12
The total sewerage charge for a particular industry would be the sum of the
base flow charge and the surcharge would be calculated from the following
formula:
         UC = V (R) + SC
WHERE:
UC   =         Total sewerage charge for the billing period in dollars.
V   =         Volume of waste discharged in billing period of Mcf.
R   =         Basic flow sewage rate as provided from time to time by Council.
SC   =         Surcharge in dollars as computed above.
(Ord. 1992-10. Passed 1-21-92.)
1040.34 COUNTY STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS.
   In accordance with the basic service agreement between the City, the County

County named pursuant to Act 342 of the Public Acts of 1939, as amended, and
Act 185 of the Public Acts of 1957, as amended, any person discharging
wastewater into the publicly owned sewer system shall comply with the
standards, rules and regulations controlling the quality or quantity of
discharge of wastewater into such system, as the same are established from time
to time by the County and/or its designated agent.
(Ord. 7-A-20. Passed 2-17-81.)
1040.35 FREE SERVICE.
   No free service shall be furnished by the Municipal water and sewer system

(Ord. 7. Passed 4-9-63.)
1040.36 PURPOSES OF RATES AND CHARGES; REVISION. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section 1040.36 was repealed by Ordinance 1992-10, passed
January 1, 1992.)
1040.37 OPERATING YEAR.
   The Municipal water and sewer system shall be operated on the basis of an
operating year commencing on July 1 and ending on June 30.
(Ord. 7. Passed 4-9-63.)
1040.38 USE OF MONEYS; FUNDS.
   From and after June 1, 1963, the revenues of the Municipal water and sewer
system are hereby ordered to be set aside, as collected, and deposited in the
National Bank of Detroit, Wayne, Michigan, a bank duly qualified to do business
in the State, in an account to be designated Water Supply and Sewage Disposal
System Receiving Fund (hereinafter referred to as the "Receiving Fund"), and
such revenues so deposited are hereby pledged for the purpose of the following
funds and shall be transferred from the Receiving Fund periodically in the
manner and at the times hereinafter specified:
   (a)   Operation and Maintenance Fund. Out of the revenues in the Receiving
Fund there shall be first set aside, monthly, into a separate depositary
account designated as the Operation and Maintenance Fund, a sum sufficient to
provide for the payment of the next month's current expenses of administration
and operation of the Municipal water and sewer system and such current expenses
for the maintenance thereof as may be necessary to preserve the same in good
repair and working order.
      Council, prior to the commencement of each operating year, shall adopt a
budget covering the foregoing expenses for each year, and such total expenses
shall not exceed the total amount specified in such budget, except by a vote of
five-sevenths of the members of the Council.
   (b)   Bond and Interest Redemption Fund. There shall next be established and
maintained a separate depositary account designated as the Bond and Interest
Redemption Fund, which shall be used solely for the purpose of paying the
principal of and interest on the bonds hereby authorized. The moneys in the
Bond and Interest Redemption Fund (including the Bond Reserve Account
hereinafter established) shall be kept on deposit with the bank or trust
company where the principal and interest on the bonds herein authorized are
currently payable.
      Out of the revenues remaining in the Receiving Fund after provision has
been made for expenses of operation and maintenance of the system, there shall
next be set aside, monthly, in the Bond and Interest Redemption Fund, a sum
proportionately sufficient to provide for the payment of the principal of and
interest on all outstanding bonds payable from the revenues of the system, as
and when the same become due and payable. Commencing June 1, 1963, the amount
so set aside for interest each month shall be not less than one-sixth of the
total amount of interest becoming due on such bonds on the next interest
payment date, and commencing June 1, 1967, the amount so set aside for
principal each month shall be not less than one-twelfth of the total amount of
principal becoming due on the next principal payment date. If there is any
deficiency in the amount previously required to be set aside, then the amount
of such deficiency shall be added to the current requirements.
      There is hereby established in the Bond and Interest Redemption Fund a
separate account to be known as the Bond Reserve Account, into which there
shall be paid, in equal monthly installments, from the revenues of the system,
after provision has been made for the Operation and Maintenance Fund and the
Bond and Interest Redemption Fund, the sum of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000)
during each of the operating years commencing July 1, 1963, to July 1, 1967,
inclusive, so that there has been accumulated in such Bond Reserve Account the
sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) by the end of the operating year
commencing July 1, 1967. The moneys from time to time in such Bond Reserve
Account shall be used solely for the payment of principal of and interest on
such bonds as to which there would otherwise be default.
      If, at any time, it is necessary to use moneys in the Bond Reserve
Account for such payment, then the moneys so used shall be replaced from the
net revenues first received thereafter which are not required by this chapter
to be used for operation and maintenance or for current principal and interest
requirements. However, such Bond Reserve Account shall not be regarded as
moneys otherwise appropriated or pledged for the purpose of determining the
sufficiency of funds available for redemption of callable bonds.
      No further payments need be made into the Bond and Interest Redemption
Fund after enough of the bonds have been retired so that the amount then held
in such Fund (including the Bond Reserve Account) is equal to the entire amount
of principal and interest which will be payable at the time of maturity of all
the bonds then remaining outstanding.
   (c)   Replacement Fund. There shall next be established and maintained a
separate depositary account designated as the Replacement Fund, the moneys from
time to time on deposit therein to be used solely for the purpose of making
major repairs and replacements to the system. There shall be deposited into
such Fund, in equal monthly installments, after providing for the current
requirements of the Operation and Maintenance Fund and the Bond and Interest
Redemption Fund (including the Bond Reserve Account), the sum of five thousand
dollars ($5,000) during each of the operating years commencing July 1, 1964, to
July 1, 1968, inclusive, so that such Fund shall total twenty-five thousand
dollars ($25,000) by the end of the operating year commencing July 1, 1968. If,
at any time it is necessary to use moneys in such Fund for such purpose, the
moneys so used shall be replaced from the net revenues in the Receiving Fund
which are not required by this chapter to be used for the Operation and
Maintenance Fund or the Bond and Interest Redemption Fund (including the Bond
Reserve Account).
   (d)   Improvement Fund. There shall next be established and maintained a
separate depositary account designated as the Improvement Fund, the moneys from
time to time on deposit therein to be used solely for the purpose of acquiring
and constructing additions, extensions and improvements to the system. There
shall be deposited into such Fund, monthly, such sum as may be determined by
Council, after meeting the priority requirements of the Operation and
Maintenance Fund, the Bond and Interest Redemption Fund (including the Bond
Reserve Account), the Replacement Fund and the General Obligation Bond and
Contract Payment Fund.
   (e)   General Obligation Bond and Contract Payment Fund. There shall next be
established and maintained a separate depositary account designated as the
General Obligation Bond and Contract Payment Fund, the moneys from time to time
on deposit therein to be used solely for the purpose of paying principal and
interest on general obligation bonds of the City heretofore or hereafter issued
for the purpose of acquiring and constructing water and sanitary sewer
improvements and for the payment of contractual obligations required to be paid
by the City pursuant to the provisions of contracts of the City heretofore or
hereafter entered into for the purpose of acquiring and constructing water or
sewer improvements. There shall be deposited into such Fund, monthly, such sum
as may be determined by Council, after meeting the priority requirements of the
Operation and Maintenance Fund, the Bond and Interest Redemption Fund
(including the Bond Reserve Account) and the Replacement Fund. The moneys in
such Fund shall be used solely and only for the payment of principal and
interest on general obligation bonds of the City heretofore or hereafter issued
for the purpose of acquiring and constructing water and sanitary sewer
improvements and for the payment of contractual obligations required to be paid
by the City pursuant to the provisions of contracts of the City heretofore or
hereafter entered into for the purpose of acquiring and constructing water and
sewer improvements.
   (f)   Surplus Moneys. Moneys remaining in the Receiving Fund at the end of
any operating year, after full satisfaction of the requirements of the
foregoing Funds, may, at the option of Council, be either:
      (1)   Transferred to the Bond and Interest Redemption Fund and used for
calling bonds for redemption in the manner herein specified; or
      (2)   Transferred to either the General Obligation Bond and Contract
Payment Fund or the Improvement Fund and used for the purposes for which such
Funds are established.
(Ord. 7. Passed 4-9-63.)
1040.39 TRANSFER OF MONEYS; INVESTMENTS.
   (a)   If the moneys in the Water Supply and Sewage Disposal Receiving Fund
are insufficient to provide for the current requirements of the Operation and
Maintenance Fund or the Bond and Interest Redemption Fund, any moneys and/or
securities in other funds of the Municipal water and sewer system shall be
transferred, first, to the Operation and Maintenance Fund, and second, to the
Bond and Interest Redemption Fund, to the extent of any deficit therein.
   (b)   All cash on hand as of June 1, 1963, in any of the funds of the
present water and sanitary sewer facilities of the City, after making the
transfers specified in Section
1040.38(a), shall be transferred to the Receiving Fund at that time.
   (c)   The moneys in funds or accounts of the system may be invested in
United States Government obligations, subject to the limitations provided in
Act 94 of the Public Acts of 1933, as amended, and the income derived from such
investments shall be credited to the fund from which such investments were
made. In the case of such an investment, the securities representing the same
shall be kept on deposit with the bank having the deposit of the fund or funds
from which the purchase was made.
   (d)   Such bonds shall be sold and the proceeds applied in accordance with
the provisions of Act 94 of the Public Acts of 1933, as amended.
   (e)   The proceeds of sale of the bonds herein authorized to be issued shall
be deposited in the National Bank of Detroit, Wayne, Michigan, a bank insured
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. From the proceeds of sale of the
bonds there shall be immediately transferred to the Bond and Interest
Redemption Fund any premium and accrued interest paid on the bonds. There shall
also be immediately deposited in trust, with The Detroit Bank and Trust
Company, paying agent for the outstanding water and sewer revenue bonds dated
March 1, 1941, the sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), representing the
principal amount of such bonds presently outstanding which will be redeemed on
September 1, 1963, such sum to be held by such paying agent bank in trust and
used for the purpose of redeeming such bonds on such call date. The balance of
such proceeds shall be applied solely in payment of the cost of the public
improvements and any engineering, legal or other expenses incident thereto and
to the financing thereof. Payments for construction, either on account or
otherwise, shall not be made unless the registered engineer in charge of such
work files with Council a signed statement to the effect that work has been
completed in accordance with the plans and specifications therefor, that it was
done pursuant to and in accordance with the contract therefor, and that such
work is entirely satisfactory.
   Any unexpended balance of the proceeds of sale remaining after completion of
the public improvements may, at the discretion of Council and to the extent of
fifteen percent of the amount of bonds herein authorized, be used for further
improvements, enlargements and extensions to the system, provided that at the
time of such expenditure, such use is approved by the Municipal Finance
Commission. Any remaining balance after such expenditure shall be paid into the
Bond and Interest Redemption Fund and shall be used for the redemption of
callable bonds or for purchasing bonds on the open market at not more than the
fair market value thereof.
   (f)   The City covenants and agrees with the successive holders of the bonds
and coupons that so long as any of the bonds remain outstanding and unpaid as
to either principal or interest:
      (1)   The City will maintain the system in good repair and working order,
will operate the same efficiently and will faithfully and punctually perform
all duties with reference to the system required by the Constitution and laws
of the State, including the making and collecting of sufficient rates for water
and sewage disposal services rendered by the system and the segregation and
application of the revenues of the system in the manner provided in this
section.
      (2)   Council will cause to be maintained and kept proper books of record
and account, separate from all other records and accounts, in which shall be
made full and correct entries of all transactions relating to the system. Not
later than three months after the close of each year, Council will cause to be
prepared on forms furnished by the Municipal Finance Commission, if such forms
are available, a statement in reasonable detail, sworn to by its Chief
Accounting Officer, showing the cash income and disbursements of the system
during each operating year, the assets and liabilities of the system at the
beginning and close of the operating year and such other information as is
necessary to enable any taxpayer of the City, user of the service furnished,
holder or owner of the bonds, or anyone acting in their behalf, to be fully
informed as to all matters pertaining to the financial operation of the system
during such year. A certified copy of such statement shall be filed with the
Municipal Finance Commission and such statement and books of record and account
shall at all reasonable times be open to inspection by any taxpayer of the
City, user of the service, holder or owner of the bonds, or anyone acting in
their behalf. Council will also cause an annual audit of such books of record
and account for the preceding operating year to be made by a recognized
independent certified public accountant and will make such audit available to
the holders of any of the bonds. Such audit shall be completed and so made
available not later than three months after the close of each operating year.
      (3)   The City will maintain and carry sufficient insurance covering the
system and the operation thereof in order to adequately protect the system
against loss or damage and will apply proceeds of any insurance received to the
restoration of the property destroyed or damaged and, to the extent that
insurance proceeds are not used for such purpose, will deposit the same in the
Bond and Interest Redemption Fund.
      (4)   The City will not sell, lease or dispose of the system, or any
substantial part thereof, until all of the bonds have been paid in full, both
as to principal and interest. The City, further, will cause the operation of
the system to be carried on as economically as possible, will cause to be made
to the system all repairs and replacements necessary to keep the same in good
repair and working order and will not do or suffer to be done any act which
would affect the system in such a way as to impair or affect unfavorably the
security of the bonds. The City will not grant any franchise or right to any
person, public or private, to operate a sewage disposal system or a water
supply system that will in any way compete with the system. The City will cause
the public improvements to be acquired promptly and in accordance with the
engineer's plans and specifications therefor.
   (g)   The right is reserved, in accordance with the provisions of Act 94 of
the Public Acts of 1933, as amended, to issue additional bonds payable from the
revenues of the system, which shall be of equal standing with the bonds herein
authorized, but only such bonds, for such purposes and with such conditions as
are herein provided for.
      (1)   Bonds to complete the public improvements in accordance with the
plans and specifications therefor are hereby authorized, but such bonds shall
not be authorized unless the consulting engineers or the successor engineers in
charge of construction execute a certificate evidencing the fact that
additional funds are needed to complete the public improvements in accordance
with the plans and specifications therefor. If such certificate is so executed
and filed with the City Clerk, it shall be the duty of Council to provide for
and issue additional revenue bonds in the amount stated in such certificate to
be necessary to complete the public improvements in accordance with the plans
and specifications.
      (2)   Bonds in the aggregate principal sum of not to exceed two hundred
seven thousand dollars ($207,000), to be issued for the purpose of paying all
or part of the cost of acquiring and constructing a trunk sanitary sewer, are
hereby authorized, which bonds shall mature serially in amounts not exceeding
the following:
         $90,000 June 1 of each of the years 1994 and 1995; and
         $27,000 June 1, 1996.
         Such bonds shall be delivered to the purchaser thereof not later than
three years from the date of the bonds authorized by the provisions of this
chapter; if not so delivered the authority to issue such bonds shall cease.
Bonds issued in accordance with this paragraph shall not be subject to the
limitations provided in paragraph (g)(3) hereof.
      (3)   After three years from the date of the bonds authorized by the
provisions of this chapter for subsequent additions, extensions and
improvements to the system, other than those specified in paragraph (g)(2)
hereof, additional bonds are authorized, provided that no such additional bonds
shall be issued in accordance with this paragraph unless the average annual net
revenues for the last two preceding completed operating years of the system, or
the net revenues for the last completed operating year, whichever is lower, are
equal to at least one and one-half times the largest annual principal and
interest requirements thereafter maturing on the bonds herein authorized, on
any then previously issued bonds of equal standing with the bonds herein
authorized, and on such additional bonds then being issued. For the purpose of
determining net revenues under the above requirements, if the City raises the
water and/or sewer rates at the time of authorizing such additional bonds, then
the net revenues of the system for each of the last two preceding operating
years, or the net revenues of the last preceding fiscal year, as the case may
be, shall be augmented to an amount reflecting the effect of such increase had
the City's water and/or sewer billings during such years been at the increased
rates. Prior to the issuance of any additional bonds pursuant to this
paragraph, there shall be filed with the City Clerk a statement showing the
average annual net revenues for the two preceding completed operating years,
the additional or augmented revenues reflecting the application of the
increased rates and the annual principal and interest requirements on all
outstanding bonds payable from revenues of the system and the bonds proposed to
be issued. Such statement shall be executed by a registered engineer appointed
by the City. Permission of the Municipal Finance Commission (or such other
State body having jurisdiction over the issuance of municipal bonds) to issue
such additional bonds shall constitute a conclusive presumption of the
existence of conditions permitting the issuance thereof.
         Except as herein authorized, no additional bonds having equal standing
with the bonds of this issue shall be authorized or issued.
   (h)   Such bonds and coupons shall be in substantially the following form:

that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately-owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 2019-03. Passed 4-2-19.)
1040.62 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or water of the U.S. said
person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and
cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials
said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the
occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-
hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency
in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the City Engineer within three business days of the
phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for
at least three years.

deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said
notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or
restore within the established deadline, the work will be done by the City of
Wayne or its designee at the violator's expense.
(Ord. 2019-03. Passed 4-2-19.)

1042.06 DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   General Pollutant Prohibitions. No user shall discharge or cause to be
discharged into the POTW, directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater
which will cause interference or pass through. These general discharge
prohibitions shall apply to all users of the POTW whether or not the user is
subject to national categorical pretreatment standards or to any other Federal,
State, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. In addition, it shall
be unlawful for a user to discharge into the POTW:
      (1)   Any liquid, solid or gas, which by reason of its nature or
quantity, is sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to
create a fire or explosion hazard or to be injurious in any other way to
persons, to the POTW, or to the operations of the POTW. Pollutants, which
create a fire or explosion hazard in a POTW, include, but are not limited to,
wastestreams with a closed cup flash point of less than 140°F or 60°C using the
test methods specified in 40 C.F.R. § 261.21; or
      (2)   Any solid or viscous substance in concentrations or quantities,
which are sufficient to cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other
encumbrances to the operation of the POTW, including, but not limited to,
grease, animal guts or tissues, bones, hair, hides or fleshing, entrails, whole
blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, cement, spent lime, stone or marble

to cause interference, or pass through, or constitute a hazard to humans or
animals; or
      (5)   Any liquid, gas, solid or form of energy, which either singly or by
interaction with other waste is sufficient to create toxic gas, vapor, or fume
within the POTW in quantities that may cause acute worker health and safety
problems, or may cause a public nuisance or hazard to life, or are sufficient
to prevent entry into the sewers for their maintenance and repair; or
      (6)   Any substance which is sufficient to cause the POTW’s effluent or
any other product of the POTW, such as residue, sludge, or scum to be
unsuitable for reclamation processing where the POTW is pursuing a reuse and
reclamation program. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause
the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria guidelines
or regulations developed under 33 U.S.C. § 1345, with any criteria, guidelines,
or developed and promulgated regulations affecting sludge use or disposal
developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Federal Clean Air Act,

consent judgment in U.S. EPA v. City of Detroit et al., Federal District Court
for the Eastern District of Michigan Case No. 77-1100, or the City of Detroit’s
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit; or
      (8)   Any discharge having a color uncharacteristic of the wastewater
being discharged; or
      (9)   Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological
activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case
wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into a public sewer which
exceeds 150°F or which will cause the influent at the wastewater treatment
plant to rise above 104°F (40°C); or
      (10)   Any pollutant discharge which constitutes a slug; or
      (11)   Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of
such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established in compliance
with applicable Federal or State regulations; or
      (12)   Any floating fats, oil or grease which are sufficient to cause
interference with or pass through the POTW; or
      (13)   Any solid materials having a specific gravity greater than 1.2 or
a cross section dimension of ½ inch or greater which are sufficient to cause
interference with the POTW.
   (b)   Specific Pollutant Prohibitions. No user shall discharge wastewater
containing in excess of the following limitations:
      (1)   Compatible pollutants. See
Appendix C.
      (2)   Non-compatible pollutants. No user shall discharge wastewater
containing in excess of:

or See
Appendix B
 
         All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating
period representative of an industrial user’s discharge, and in accordance with
40 C.F.R. Part 136.
         A.   The limitation for total PCB is non-detect. Total PCB shall not
be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 608, and the
quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 ugm/l, unless a higher level is
appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one or
more samples indicate detectable levels of total PCB, the user shall be
required to demonstrate compliance. For purposes of this section, this
demonstration may be made using analytical data showing that the total PCB
concentration is below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in
accordance with Section
1042.13.
         B.   The limitation of mercury (Hg) is non-detect. Mercury (Hg) shall
not be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 245.1, and
the quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 ugm/l, unless a higher level is
appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one or
more samples indicate detectable levels of mercury, the user shall be required
to demonstrate compliance. For the purposes of this section, this demonstration
may be made using analytical data showing that the mercury concentration is
below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in accordance with Section
1042.13(d).
         All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating
period representative of an industrial user’s discharge, and in accordance 40
C.F.R. Part 136.
      (3)   Compliance period. Within 30 days of the effective date of this
ordinance, the Department shall notify all industrial users operating under an
effective wastewater discharge permit of the requirement to submit a compliance
report within 180 days after the effective date of this section. The compliance
report shall demonstrate the user’s compliance or non-compliance with these
limitations, and, in the event of non-compliance, include the submission of a
plan and schedule for achieving compliance with the stated limitation. In no
event shall a compliance schedule exceed 18 months from the effective date of
this section. An industrial user who does not demonstrate compliance may
petition the Department for a second extension as part of an administrative
consent order. The Department shall include appropriate monitoring, reporting,
and penalties into an administrative consent order that relates to a second
extension, and shall enter into such an agreement only upon a good-faith
showing by the industrial user of the actions taken to achieve compliance with
this provision.
   (c)   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. All users shall comply
with the applicable national categorical pretreatment standards and
requirements promulgated pursuant to the Act as set forth in 40 C.F.R.
Subchapter N, Effluent Guidelines and Standards, which are hereby incorporated
by reference, and with all other applicable standards and requirements,
provided, that where a more stringent standard or requirement is applicable
pursuant to State law or regulation, or to this chapter, then the more
stringent standard or requirement shall be controlling. Affected dischargers
shall comply with applicable reporting requirements under 40 C.F.R. Part 403
and as established by the Department. The national categorical pretreatment
standards which have been promulgated as of the effective date of this section
are delineated in
Appendix A.
      (1)   Intake water adjustment. Industrial users seeking adjustment of
national categorical pretreatment standards to reflect the presence of
pollutants in their intake water must comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R.
§ 403.15. Upon notification of approval by the Department, the adjustment shall
be applied by modifying the permit accordingly. Intake water adjustments are
not effective until incorporated into an industrial user’s permit.
      (2)   Modification of national categorical pretreatment standards. The
Department may apply to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or to the
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, whichever is appropriate, for
authorization to grant removal credits in accordance with the requirements and
procedures in 40 C.F.R. § 403.7. Such authorization may be granted only when
the POTW treatment plant can achieve consistent removal for each pollutant for
which a removal credit is being sought, provided, that any limitation of such
pollutant(s) in the NPDES permit neither are being exceeded nor pose the
prospect of being exceeded as a result of the removal credit being granted.
Where such authorization is given to the Department, any industrial user
desiring to obtain such credit shall make an application to the Department,
consistent with the provisions of 40 C.F.R. § 403.7 and of this chapter. Any
credits which may be granted under this section may be subject to modification
or revocation as specified in 40 C.F.R. § 403.7, or as determined by the
Department. A requisite to the granting of any removal credit may be that the
industrial user pay a surcharge based upon the amounts of such pollutants
removed by the POTW, such surcharge being based upon fees or rates which the
Board may establish and, when appropriate, revise from time to time. Permits
shall reflect, or be modified to reflect, any credit granted pursuant to this
section.
      (3)   New sources. Industrial users who meet the new sources criteria
shall install, maintain in operating condition, and “start-up” all pollution
control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before
beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time and not to exceed 90
days, new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards.
      (4)   Concentration and mass limits. When limits in a categorical
pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit
of production, the Department may convert the limits to equivalent limitations
expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent
concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to
individual industrial users. Equivalent limitations shall be calculated in
accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c)(3) and/or 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c)(4) and
shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of 33 U.S.C. § 1317(d)
and of this chapter. Industrial users will be required to comply with the
equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from
which the equivalent limitations were derived.
      (5)   Reporting requirements for industrial users upon effective date of
categorical pretreatment standards-baseline report. Within 180 days after the
effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the
final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission
under 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users
subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging
into or scheduled to discharge into the Detroit POTW shall submit to the
Department a report containing the information listed in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)
(1)–(7). Where reports containing this information have already been submitted
to the Director or Regional Administrator in compliance with the requirement of
40 C.F.R. § 128.140(b), the industrial user will not be required to resubmit
this information. At least 90 days before commencement of any discharge, each
new source and any existing sources that become industrial users after the
promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall submit to
the Department a report which contains the information listed in 40 C.F.R. §
403.12(b)(1)–(5). In such report, new sources shall include information
concerning the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet
applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall provide estimates of the
information requested in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)(4) and (5).
   (d)   Dilution Prohibited. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an
applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no user shall increase the use
of process water, or in any way dilute or attempt to dilute a discharge as a
partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance
with the limitations contained in the national categorical pretreatment
standards, or in any other pollutant specific limitation or requirement imposed
by the City of Wayne, the City of Detroit or by the State of Michigan.
   (e)   Hauled in Wastewater. Any waste material or wastewater which is hauled
into or within the service region for discharge to the POTW is subject to the
requirements of this chapter including, but not limited to, permits,
inspection, monitoring and enforcement. Unloading liquid or solid waste from
hauling vehicles, directly or indirectly, into the POTW, with or without the
benefit of pretreatment, is prohibited unless the person proposing to unload
such waste has applied for and received a permit from the Department for
unloading such waste in accordance with the Board’s rules pertaining thereto.
The discharger shall be subject to applicable terms and conditions, surcharges,
fees or rates as established by the Board. Hauled in wastewater shall only be
discharged at points designated by the POTW after authorization or approval
issued pursuant to the general permit requirements specified in Section
1042.08 of this Code. The Department may establish specific limitations for
sludge from Municipally owned or operated POTW treatment plants which are
different than the specific limitations in this chapter.
   (f)   Centralized Waste Treatment. It is unlawful for a centralized waste
treatment (CWT) facility to discharge any industrial waste or wastewater into
the POTW without a wastewater discharge permit from the Department. Any
authorization granted, or permit issued, by the Department to a centralized
waste treatment (CWT) facility shall specify the type of wastewater for which
treatment is provided, and discharge approval is sought, from the POTW. Unless
such industrial waste or wastewater is determined by the Department to require
further authorization, a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility that has
submitted an application to, and received previous approval from, the
Department to discharge wastewater is not required to obtain further
authorization from the Department before discharging such wastewater. An
industrial user, that provides centralized waste treatment services and files
an application for the treatment and discharge of such types of wastewater to
the POTW, shall provide the following minimum information in support thereof:
      (1)   The general nature, source and process(es) generating the type of
wastewater. Any wastewater, which is generated from those processes and is
subject to national categorical pretreatment standards as delineated in
Appendix A, shall be so designated;
      (2)   The identity of the toxic pollutants known or suspected to be
present in the wastewater;
      (3)   At least one sample report showing the results of an analysis for
the EPA priority pollutants for each type of wastewater for which application
is made in subsection (f)(1) of this section;
      (4)   A statement, that is certified by a professional engineer, which
addresses the treatability and compatibility of the wastewater, received or
collected by the facility’s treatment process(es);
      (5)   The identity of the materials and/or pollutants whose transport or
treatment are regulated by the EPA, by the State, or by any other governmental
agency. Upon request, the centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall
provide a copy of its permit and/or license to the Department; and
      (6)   Other information requested by the Department including, but not
limited to, information required by Section
1042.08(c)(1) through (18) of this Code, or by rules adopted by the Board. The
discharge from a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility will be deemed
approved for those specific types of wastewater delineated in a permit and,
upon issuance of such permit in accordance with the procedures contained in
Section
1042.08 of this Code, will be deemed approved for discharge into the POTW. The
centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall comply with all applicable
provisions contained in Section
1042.08 of this Code regarding permits. In furtherance of its obligations as
control authority, the Department may include in the permit a requirement to
report at selected intervals the information mandated in subsections (1)
through (6) of this section. All users granted a permit under this section
shall maintain records which, at a minimum, identify the source, volume,
character, and constituents of the wastewater accepted for treatment and
disposal. These records may be reviewed at any time by the Department.
   (g)   Groundwater Discharges. Unless authorization has been granted by the
Department, the discharge of any groundwater into the POTW is prohibited. The
Department may authorize the discharge of groundwater resulting from
maintenance and related activities of gas, steam, or electrical utilities
through the use of general permits. Subject to appropriate reporting
requirements, the general permit shall authorize discharge in accordance with
the terms of the permit. Utilities shall comply with this provision within 180
days after its enactment. If a person, who proposes to discharge groundwater
resulting from purge, response activity, or UST projects, has applied for and
received a permit from the Department, the Department may authorize the
discharge of such wastewater. Permits shall be issued in accordance with the
procedures contained in Section
1042.08 of this Code, or in accordance with any rules adopted by the Board.
   (h)   City of Wayne Right of Revision. The City of Detroit and the City of
Wayne reserve the right to establish rules or regulations adopted by the Board,
additional or more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the
POTW. These rules and regulations shall be adopted in accordance with the rule-
making procedures section 2-111 of the 1997 Detroit City Charter, 90 days after
adoption by the Board, industrial users shall comply with such rules and
regulations.
   (i)   Accidental Discharges.
      (1)   Each industrial user, which does not currently have an approved
spill prevention plan or slug control plan, shall provide protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by
this chapter, and all significant industrial users shall submit to the
Department detailed plans which show facilities and operating procedures to be
implemented to provide protection against such accidental discharges.
Facilities and measures to prevent and abate accidental discharges shall be
implemented, provided, and maintained at the owner’s or industrial user’s cost
or expense. Unless the significant industrial user has an approved spill
prevention or slug control plan, all existing significant industrial users
shall complete and submit such a plan within 60 days of the original effective
date of this chapter [November 19, 1986]. New significant industrial users
shall submit such a plan prior to the time they commence discharging.
            For purposes of this section, the information provided shall
include the approximate average and maximum quantities of such prohibited
materials or substances kept on the premises in the form of raw materials,
chemicals and/or waste therefrom and the containment capacity for each. Only
substances that are in a form which could readily be carried into the POTW and
constitute a concentration of five percent or greater in the raw material,
chemical solution or waste material, are required to be reported. Volumes of
less than 55 gallons, or the equivalent thereof, need not be reported unless
lesser quantities could cause pass through or cause interference with the POTW.
The industrial user shall promptly notify the Department of any significant
changes or modifications to the plan including, but not limited to, a change in
the contact person, or substance inventory.
      (2)   At least once every two years, the Department shall evaluate
whether a significant industrial user needs a plan to control slug discharges,
as defined by 40 C.F.R. § 403.8(f)(2)(v). Unless otherwise provided, all
significant users shall complete, implement, and submit such a plan within 30
days of notification by the Department.
   (j)   Notification Requirements. Unless a different notice is provided by
this chapter or applicable law, within one hour of becoming aware of a
discharge into the POTW which exceeds or does not conform with Federal, State
or City of Wayne laws, rules, regulations or permit requirements, or which
could cause problems to the POTW, or which has the potential to cause the
industrial user to implement its plan prepared in accordance with subsection
(1) of this section, the industrial user shall telephone the Department at its
control center and notify the Department of the discharge. The notification
shall include the name of the caller, the location and time of discharge, the
type of wastewater, the estimated concentration of excessive or prohibited
pollutants and estimated volume, and the measures taken, or being taken, to
abate the discharge into the POTW. Within five calendar days after the
discharge, the industrial user shall submit a detailed written report
describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user
to prevent similar future occurrences and when required by the Department, the
industrial user’s wastewater discharge permit may be modified to include
additional measures to prevent such future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve the industrial user of any expense, cost of treatment, loss,
damages or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, fish kills, or any other environmental impairment or any other damage to
person or property.
   (k)   Notice to Employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
industrial user’s bulletin board, or other prominent place, advising employees
whom to contact in the Department in the event of an actual or excessive or
prohibited discharge.
   (l)   Recovery of Costs. Any user discharging in violation of any of the
provisions of this chapter, which produces a deposit or obstruction, or causes
damage to or impairs the Department’s POTW, or causes the Department to violate
its NPDES permit, shall be liable to the Department for any expense, loss,
damage, penalty or fine incurred by the Department because of said violation or
discharge. Prior to assessing such costs, the Department shall notify the user
of its determination that the user’s discharge was the proximate cause of such
damage, obstruction, impairment, or violation of the City’s NPDES permit and
the Department’s intent to assess such costs to the user. Any such notice shall
include written documentation which substantiates the determination of
proximate cause and a breakdown of cost estimates. Failure to pay the assessed
costs shall constitute a violation of this chapter. Such charge shall be in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any penalties or remedies provided under this
chapter, or this Code, or other statutes and regulations, or at law or in
equity.
   (m)   Hazardous Waste Notification. All industrial users, who discharge into
the City of Wayne Collection System, shall notify the Department in writing of
any discharge of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261. Such notification must
comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(p).
   (n)   Authorized Representative. The authorized representative, as defined
in Section
1042.03(a)(2) of this Code, may designate a duly authorized representative of
the individual designated in Section
1042.03(a)(2)A. or B. where:
      (1)   The authorization is made in writing by the individual defined in
Section
1042.03(a)(2)A. or B.;
      (2)   The authorization specifies either an individual or a position
having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility where the
industrial discharge originates, such as the position of plant manager,
operator of a well or well field superintendent, or a position of equivalent
responsibility, or having overall responsibility for environmental matters for
the company; and
      (3)   The written authorization is submitted to the Department.
   (o)   Pollution Prevention. The Department shall encourage and support
industrial users to develop and implement pollution prevention programs that
are designed to eliminate or reduce pollutant contributions beyond the levels
required by this chapter. The Department may require an industrial user to
implement pollution prevention initiatives or BMP, as part of an enforcement
response, or as necessary to comply with its NPDES permit.

different individual or position has responsibility for the overall operation
of the facility, or overall responsibility for environmental matters for the
company, a new authorization satisfying the requirements of the authorized
representative definition must be submitted to the Department prior to, or
together with, any reports to be signed by an authorized representative.
         F.   If sampling performed by a permittee indicates a violation, the
user shall notify the Department within 24 hours of the time such user becomes,
or should have become, aware of the violation. In addition, the user shall
repeat the sampling and analysis, and submit the results of the repeat analysis
to the Department within 30 days after such user becomes, or should have
become, aware of the violation.
      (9)   In the event the Director determines that an industrial user is
discharging substances in quality, quantity or at locations which may cause
problems to the POTW, or the receiving stream, the Department has the authority
to develop and enforce effluent limits applicable to the user. To the extent
the Department seeks to impose restrictions in a permit which are more
restrictive than established in this chapter, the Department shall provide
written documentation to explain the greater restriction for protection against
pass-through, interference, or violation of the NPDES permit.
      (10)   Requirement for pollution prevention initiatives.
      (11)   Other requirements reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with
this chapter.
   (f)   Permit Duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time period.
Except as deemed necessary by the Department, or as otherwise provided for
under this chapter, permits shall be issued for a specified period of not more
than five years nor less than one year. The existing permit for significant
industrial users, who timely submit an application for permit reissuance to the
Department, shall be automatically extended until a permit is issued as final.
   (g)   Permit Modification. The terms and conditions of the permit may be
subject to modification by the Department during the term of the permit as
limitations or pretreatment standards and requirements identified in Section
1042.06 of this Code are amended, or other just cause exists. Just cause for a
permit modification includes, but shall not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   Material or substantial changes to an industrial user’s facility or

pretreatment standards or requirements including 40 C.F.R. Part 403 and those
delineated in
Appendix A of this chapter. Permittees shall request an application form and
apply to the Department for a modified permit within 90 days after the
promulgation of a new or revised national categorical pretreatment standard to
which the industrial user shall be subject. Information submitted pursuant to
this subsection shall be confined to that information related to the newly
promulgated or amended national categorical pretreatment standard or
requirement. However, information previously submitted need not be duplicated,
insofar as the previously submitted information continues to be current and
applicable. In addition, the Department may initiate this action.
      (9)   Changes in the monitoring location. (See Section
1042.09 of this Code.)
      (10)   Typographical errors or omissions in permits.
      (11)   The Department may modify the permit on its own initiative based
on its findings or reasonable belief of the above.
      (12)   The user may request a modification of the permit.
   When initiated by the Department, the industrial user shall be informed of
any proposed change in its permit. The Department will issue a draft permit and
an industrial user has 30 days to file a response to the draft modified permit.
Thereafter, the Department will issue a final permit and, unless appealed in
accordance with the procedures contained in Section
1042.99 of this Code, the permit will become effective 20 days after issuance.
   (h)   Permit Custody and Transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued
to a specific person as defined herein for a specific discharge. A wastewater
discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a different
person, new owner, new industrial user, different premises, or a new or changed
operation without notice to and written approval of the Department, and
providing a copy of the existing permit to the new owner or operator. It shall
be the permit holder’s duty to notify the Department of any such change at
least 30 days before the date of the change. Wastewater discharge permits,
which do not receive the written approval of the Department prior to the
change, shall be null and void regardless of reassignment, or transfer, or
sale. If it has occurred, the Department may revoke a permit. If a change takes
place, the Department may require the application for a new or modified permit.
Any succeeding person shall comply with the terms and conditions of any
existing permit which the Department allows to be retained.
   (i)   Permit Notification Requirements. All industrial users shall promptly
notify the Department in advance of any substantial change in the volume or
character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or
characteristic hazardous waste for which initial notification under 40 C.F.R. §
403.12(p) has been made, request a permit application form, and apply for a
modification of the permit at least 30 calendar days prior to the change.
Failure of the industrial user to so apply shall be considered a violation of
this chapter.
(Ord. 2013-05. Passed 6-18-13.)
1042.09 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (a)   Significant industrial users shall provide, operate and maintain at
their own expense a sampling manhole or special structure to facilitate
monitoring, inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of their discharge by
the Department and the industrial user, and to enable the Department to conduct
such other monitoring and sampling as required for determining compliance with
discharge requirements, limits and standards as provided for in this chapter.
In the event the Department determines that the monitoring facility identified
in the permit application is inadequate, a new monitoring facility must be
identified, or provided, which shall allow for collection of a representative
sample of the wastewater discharged from the facility. Unless otherwise
determined at the discretion of the Department, such facility shall be provided
within 90 days of receipt of notification by the Department. The industrial
user shall provide the Department with:
      (1)   A drawing showing all sewer connections and sampling manholes by
the size, location, elevation, and points or places of discharges into the
POTW;
      (2)   A flow schematic showing:
         A.   Which connections receive each national categorical process
wastestream;
         B.   Which connections receive storm water, sanitary water or cooling
water; and
         C.   Which lines handle each combined wastestream. This report shall
be certified by a professional engineer. If a significant industrial user fails
to install the monitoring facilities within the prescribed time limits, then
the Department may install such structure or device and the significant user
shall reimburse the Department for any costs incurred therein.
   (b)   The sampling manhole should be situated on the industrial user’s
premises in a location readily accessible to the Department. When such a
location would be impractical or cause undue hardship to the industrial user,
the Department may allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or
sidewalk area when there is room and the location will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles. It shall be the responsibility of the
industrial user to obtain any necessary approvals which may be required from
other government agencies for the location and construction of monitoring
facilities. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling or monitoring
manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis. The facility and any permanently installed sampling and measuring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition at the expense of the industrial user. Whether constructed upon
public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be
provided in accordance with the Department’s requirements and all applicable
local construction standards and specifications. (See Section
1042.08(g).)
(Ord. 2013-05. Passed 6-18-13.)

   (a)   For purposes of administering and enforcing this chapter, any other
applicable provisions of the City of Wayne Code, or applicable State or Federal
laws and regulations, the Department may inspect the establishment, facility or
other premises of the industrial user. The Department’s employees or authorized
representative shall have access to the industrial user’s premises for purposes
of inspection, sampling, compliance monitoring and/or mending activities.
   (b)   Each such inspection or sampling activity shall be commenced and
completed at reasonable times, and in a reasonable manner. Upon arrival at the
industrial user’s premises, the Department shall inform the industrial user, or
the industrial user’s employees, that sampling and/or inspection is commencing,
and that the facility’s authorized representative has the right to observe the
inspection and/or sampling. The Department shall neither refrain from, nor be
prevented or delayed from, carrying out its inspection or sampling duties due
to the unavailability of the authorized representative of the facility to
observe or participate in the inspection or sampling activity.
   (c)   While performing work on private property, employees or authorized
representatives of the Department shall observe all reasonable safety, security
and other reasonable rules applicable to the premises as established by the
industrial user. Duly authorized employees or representatives of the Department
shall bear proper credentials and identification, and at the industrial user’s
option may be accompanied by a duly authorized representative of the industrial
user. Duly authorized Department representatives shall not be restricted from
viewing any of the facility site. Department employees or representatives may
take photographs of facilities subject to this chapter, which shall be
maintained by the Department as confidential in accordance with Section
1042.11.
   (d)   Where an industrial user has security measures in force, the
industrial user shall make prompt and necessary arrangements with the security
personnel so that, upon presentation of appropriate credentials, personnel from
the Department will be permitted to enter for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.
   (e)   Significant industrial users shall sample and analyze their discharge
in accordance with the provisions of their permit. The Department may require
such samples to be split with the Department for the Department’s independent
analysis.
   (f)   Industrial users shall maintain records of all information from
monitoring activities required by this chapter, or by 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(n).
Industrial users shall maintain the records for no less than three years. This
period of record retention shall be extended during the course of any
unresolved litigation regarding the discharge of pollutants by the industrial
user, or the operation of the City of Detroit’s Industrial Waste Program, or
when requested by the Department, by the State, or by the EPA.
   (g)   Upon the request of the Department, industrial users shall furnish
information and records relating to discharges into the POTW. Industrial users
shall make such records readily accessible to the Department at all reasonable
times, and allow the Department to copy such records.
   (h)   In the event the Department obtains samples, and analyses are made of
such samples, a copy of the results of such analyses shall be promptly
furnished upon written request by the industrial user’s authorized
representative. When requested by the industrial user, the Department employee
or representative shall leave with the user, a portion of any sample of the
user’s discharge taken from any sampling point on or adjacent to the premises
for the user’s independent analysis. In cases of disputes arising over shared
samples, the portion taken and analyzed by the Department shall be controlling
unless proven invalid.
   (i)   In addition to any other violation caused by the discharge described
herein, in the event a single grab sample of the industrial user’s discharge is
obtained by the Department, and then analyzed in accordance with 40 C.F.R. Part
136, and found to contain concentrations of pollutants which are two or more
times greater than the numeric limitations as listed in Section
1042.06 of this Code, or as contained in the facility’s wastewater discharge
permit, the industrial user shall implement its slug control plan, and shall
provide a written report to the Department within 14 days, which describes the
cause of greater concentration and provides a description of the means by which
future discharge concentrations will be held to values of less than two times
the limitation in the future.

   (a)   Information and data on an industrial user obtained from written
reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs,
and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental
agencies without restriction unless the industrial user specifically requests
and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department that the
release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the industrial user. When
submitted to the Department, all information claimed to be confidential must be
clearly marked “confidential.” When requested by the person furnishing the
report, the portions of a report determined by the Department to disclose trade
secrets or trade secret processes, and which are clearly labeled as
confidential, shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but
shall be made available upon request to governmental agencies for uses related
to this chapter, to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit, and to the State disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment
programs, provided, however that information shall be treated as confidential
by the governmental agency, until such time as the information has been
determined to be nonconfidential by the governmental agency. Confidential
information on industrial users, which the Department releases pursuant to a
request of another governmental agency, should be handled by the other
governmental agency pursuant to its own confidentiality procedures. The
Department cannot control how another governmental agency handles such
confidential information, and assumes no responsibility for the disposition of
the information released to the governmental agency. The Department will use
sufficient care to inform the other governmental agency of the existence of the
industrial user’s confidentiality claim. The Department shall determine whether
the information requested to be treated as confidential, in fact, satisfies the
requirements of confidential information as defined herein. The decision of the
Department shall be made in writing. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.
   (b)   Except as otherwise determined by the Department or provided for by
applicable law, all information with respect to an industrial user on file with
the City shall be made available upon request by such user or the user’s
authorized representative during normal business hours.

1042.12 STATUTES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
   The national categorical pretreatment standards defined in 40 C.F.R. Chapter
I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471, shall be and are incorporated by reference
herein and made a part hereof. Unless otherwise provided, any reference in this
chapter to a code, standard, rule, regulation, or law enacted, adopted,
established, or promulgated by any private organization, or by any element or
organization of government other than the City of Wayne shall be construed to
apply to such code, standard, rule, regulation, or law in effect or as amended
or promulgated, from the date of enactment of this chapter.
(Ord. 2013-05. Passed 6-18-13.)
1042.13 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Violations. It shall be a violation of this chapter for any user to:
      (1)   Fail to completely and/or accurately report the wastewater
constituents and/or characteristics of the industrial user’s discharge;
      (2)   Fail to report significant changes in the industrial user’s
operations or wastewater constituents and/or characteristics within the time
frames provided in Section
1042.08(g)(1) of this Code;
      (3)   Refuse reasonable access to the industrial user’s premises, waste
discharge, or sample location for the purpose of inspection or monitoring;
      (4)   Restrict, lockout or prevent, directly or indirectly, access to any
monitoring facilities constructed on public or private property. The locking or
securing of the monitoring facility shall not constitute a violation pursuant
to this subsection, provided, that upon request reasonable access to the
facility is promptly provided to the Department;
      (5)   Restrict, interfere, tamper with, or render inaccurate any of the
Department’s monitoring devices including, but not limited to, samplers;
      (6)   Fail to comply with any condition or requirement of the industrial
user’s wastewater discharge permit;
      (7)   Fail to comply with any limitation, prohibition, or requirement of
this chapter including any rule, regulation, or order issued hereunder.
Industrial users acting in full compliance with wastewater discharge permits
issued prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be deemed to be in
compliance with the requirements of this chapter, and such permits shall remain
in effect and be enforceable under this chapter until a superseding permit is
effective. Industrial users shall comply with applicable national categorical
pretreatment standards and requirements on the date specified in the Federal
Regulations, regardless of compliance schedules.
   (b)   Upsets. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with national categorical pretreatment standards
where the requirements of subsection (1) of this section are met.
      (1)   An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence, that:
         A.   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause
(s) of the upset;
         B.   At the time, the facility was being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
         C.   The industrial user has submitted the following information to
the Department, orally or in writing, within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
upset and where this information is provided orally, a written submission must
be provided within five days:
            1.   A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (2)   In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof;
      (3)   The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to
the extent necessary to maintain compliance with this chapter upon reduction,
loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   (c)   Bypass. Bypasses are prohibited unless the bypass does not cause a
violation of pretreatment standards or requirements, but only if it is for
essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the treatment system.
These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of
this section.
      (1)   Notice of anticipated bypass. Industrial users anticipating a
bypass shall submit notice to the Department at least ten days in advance.
      (2)   Notice of unanticipated bypass. An industrial user shall submit
oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes or should
have become aware of the bypass. A written submission shall be provided within
five days of the time the industrial user becomes or should have become aware
of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass
including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
      (3)   Prohibition of bypass and enforcement. Bypass is prohibited, and
the Department may take enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         A.   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
         B.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated waste, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
         C.   The industrial user properly notified the Department as described
in subsection (c)(2) of this section.
      (4)   Bypass approval. Where it meets all conditions in subsection (c)(3)
of this section, the Department may approve an anticipated bypass.
   (d)   Where one or more of the measurements taken for any pollutant defined
in Section
1042.06(b) of this Code during a six-month period exceed by any magnitude the
daily maximum non-detect limit for the same parameter, the industrial user may
develop and implement pollution prevention initiatives, or a BMP, as part of
its response. The Department may, as part of an administrative order, also
require development of a BMP as a part of the Department’s enforcement
response. Upon approval of the Department, these pollution prevention
initiative, or BMPs shall be made an enforceable part of the wastewater
discharge permit. Industrial users shall provide, at six-month intervals,
analytical results and certifications in support of its implementation of an
approved pollution prevention initiative or BMPs. Upon demonstration of
compliance, the industrial user may request to be relieved of this
implementation requirement.
   (e)   Emergency Suspensions and Orders. The Department may order suspension
of the sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge
permit where, in the opinion of the Department, such suspension is necessary to
stop any actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an
imminent or significant hazard to the health or welfare of persons or to the
environment, interferes or may interfere with the POTW, or causes or may cause
the City of Detroit to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. Any person
notified of a suspension of the sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or
the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. In the event the Department provides informal notification under
this section, written confirmation and an order shall be provided within 24
hours. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with any
suspension or revocation order, the Department shall take such steps as deemed
necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection or services,
to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or danger to any individual or
the environment. In the event such steps are taken, the Director shall notify
the industrial user within 24 hours in writing of such action and order, and
the specific recourse available. In any event, the Department shall provide the
industrial user with an opportunity for a hearing before the Director, or his
designated representative, within ten days of such action. The industrial user
shall submit a detailed written statement to the Department within 15 days of
the occurrence describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence. Upon proof of elimination of
the noncomplying discharge, the Department shall reinstate the wastewater
discharge permit and/or the sewer or wastewater treatment service.
   (f)   Notice of Violation. Except in the case of an actual or threatened
discharge as specified in subsection (e) of this section, whenever the
Department has reason to believe that any industrial user has violated or is
violating this chapter, the Department shall serve a written notice stating the
nature of the violation upon such industrial user. Where applicable, the
Department shall pursue appropriate escalating enforcement action as defined
within its approved enforcement response plan. The failure of the Department to
issue a notice of violation shall not preclude the Department from escalating
its enforcement response.
   (g)   Administrative Actions. Whenever the Department has reasonable grounds
to believe that a user is violating, or has violated, a provision of its
wastewater discharge permit, or a pretreatment standard or requirement or any
prohibition of this chapter, the Department may initiate appropriate
administrative enforcement action, except in the case of emergency or flagrant
violation, in order to compel the industrial user to eliminate or to remedy
such violation as soon as possible.
      (1)   A.   Conferences. The Department may order any person, who violates
this chapter, to attend a conference wherein the Department may endeavor to
cause the user to eliminate or remedy the violation by establishing an
enforceable compliance schedule. The notice of violation shall be served at
least ten days before the scheduled conference and shall set forth the date,
time, and place thereof. The conference shall be conducted by a representative
of the Department. The industrial user shall present a plan and schedule for
achieving compliance with this chapter. Nothing contained herein shall require
the Department to accept or agree to any proposed plan or schedule, or to
prevent the Department from proceeding with a show cause hearing as set forth
in subsection (2) of this section. If the attendees agree upon a compliance
schedule, the user and the Department’s duly authorized representative may
enter, by consent, into a compliance agreement or an administrative order
setting forth the terms of such agreement. An industrial user must exhibit good
faith and expeditious efforts to comply with this chapter and any procedures,
requirements, and agreements hereunder.
         B.   Compliance schedules. The user and the Department may agree upon
a schedule which sets forth the terms and conditions, and time periods or
schedules for completion of actions to remedy or to eliminate the causes of
violation. These schedules may be developed as part of a compliance agreement,
administrative consent order. Schedules developed under this subsection shall
adhere to the following conditions:
            1.   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form
of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of upgraded or additional pretreatment facilities,
or to the implementation of additional operation and maintenance procedures
required for the industrial user to meet the applicable pretreatment
requirements and standards including, but not limited to, hiring an engineer,
completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contracts for
major components, commencing construction, and completing construction;
            2.   No single increment referred to in subsection 1. of this
section shall exceed nine months;
            3.   Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and
the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress
report to the Department including, at a minimum, whether it complied with the
increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date which it
expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason(s) for delay, and
the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the established
schedule; and
            4.   Any deviations from the compliance schedule may result in the
industrial user being found in violation of this chapter.
         C.   Administrative orders. The Department may order any industrial
user, who violates or continues to violate this chapter or a duly issued
permit, to install and to properly operate devices, treatment facilities, or
other related appurtenances. In addition, orders may contain such other
requirements as might reasonably be necessary and appropriate to address the
violation including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional
self-monitoring and management practices, implementation of a waste
minimization assessment to identify and implement feasible source reduction,
and recycling practices to reduce the generation or release of pollutants at
the facility. An order may be either an administrative consent order, which is
the result of an agreement, or a unilateral administrative order.
      (2)   Show cause hearing. The Department may order any industrial user,
who violates this chapter or allows such violation to occur, to show cause
before the Department why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A
notice shall be served upon the industrial user specifying the time and place
of a hearing before the Department regarding the violation, the reason(s) why
the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the
industrial user to show cause before the Department why any proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be
served personally, or by registered or certified mail with return receipt
requested, at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made upon any
agent or officer of a corporation, or its authorized representative.
         A.   Hearing proceeding. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance
with the procedures adopted by the Board. A hearings officer shall conduct the
show cause hearing and take the evidence, and may:
            1.   In the name of the Board, issue notices of hearing requesting
the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence
relevant to any matter involved in such hearing;
            2.   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the Director
for action thereon.
         B.   Transcript. At any show cause hearing held pursuant to this
chapter, testimony shall be recorded by a court reporter.
      (3)   Actions. After a show cause hearing has been conducted, the
hearings officer shall issue an order to the industrial user directing any of
the following actions:
         A.   Immediate compliance with the industrial user’s wastewater
discharge permit or with any applicable limitation, condition, restriction or
requirement of this chapter, or applicable local, State or Federal law or
regulation;
         B.   Pretreatment of waste by installation of adequate treatment
equipment or proper operation and maintenance of existing treatment equipment
be accomplished within a specified time period;
         C.   Submission of compliance reports on effluent quality and quantity
as determined by self-monitoring and analysis during a specified time period;
         D.   Submission of periodic reports on effluent quality and quantity
determined by self-monitoring analysis throughout the final period set by a
compliance date;
         E.   Control of discharge quantities;
         F.   Payment of costs for reasonable and necessary inspection,
monitoring, and administration of the industrial user’s activities by the
Department during compliance efforts; and/or
         G.   Any such other orders as are appropriate including, but not
limited to, immediate termination of sewer or wastewater treatment services, or
revocation of a wastewater discharge permit, or orders directing that following
a specified time period sewer or wastewater treatment service will be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or operation and
maintenance practices have been employed.
         H.   A finding the user has demonstrated by a preponderance of the
evidence that a violation either of this chapter or of a duly issued permit did
not occur.
      (4)   Public notification of significant noncompliance. The Department
shall publish in the largest daily newspaper published in the City of Detroit
and the City of Wayne a list of all industrial users which were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment requirements at any time during the
previous 12 months. All industrial users identified in a proposed publication
shall be provided with a copy of the proposed notice at least 30 days before
publication and allowed an opportunity to comment as to its accuracy.
   (h)   Legal Actions.
      (1)   Criminal action. Any user, who violates any provision of this
chapter including the failure to pay any fees, fines, charges or surcharges
imposed hereby, or any condition or limitation of a permit issued pursuant
thereto, or who knowingly makes any false statements, representations or
certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed
or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter or wastewater discharge
permit, or who tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring
device required under this chapter, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon
conviction, shall be punished by a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars
($500.00) for each violation per day, or by imprisonment for not more than 90
days, or by both.
      (2)   Civil action. Whenever the Department has reasonable grounds to
believe that a user is violating, or has violated, a provision of its
wastewater discharge permit, a pretreatment standard or requirement or any
requirement of this chapter, the Director may commence a civil action to compel
compliance in a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin the user from
discharging, and/or to obtain appropriate relief to remedy the violations. The
Department or Board may also seek additional legal and/or equitable relief. The
commencement of suit neither constitutes an exclusive election of remedies nor
prohibits the Department, Director, Board, or City of Detroit or the City of
Wayne from commencing action in Federal Court for discharges believed to be in
violation of this chapter, State and Federal requirements contained in the
Clean Water Act, the City of Detroit’s NPDES permit, or other applicable laws
or requirements. In addition, the City of Detroit may recover the reasonable
attorney fees, court costs, court reporters’ fees, and other unusual expenses
related to enforcement activities or litigation against the person found to
have violated this chapter, or the orders, rules, regulations and permits
issued hereunder.
      (3)   All fines, costs, and penalties which are imposed by any court of
competent jurisdiction shall be payable to the City of Detroit Water and
Sewerage Department.

electrical energy service, shall put up a deposit as determined by the Village
Administrator, if, in the opinion of such Administrator, the same is necessary.
With the exception of those renters whose landlords pay the light bill, no
property owner's signature for his or her tenant shall be accepted. Any deposit
shall be returned to the consumer upon termination of service after all unpaid
bills or other indebtedness to the Village Administrator has been paid.
   (b)   The Village Administrator is hereby authorized and directed to receive
applications for electrical energy service from consumers who can be supplied
from the lines of the Village and is hereby charged with the responsibility of
enforcing these rules and regulations.
   (c)   No connection shall be made until the consumer has brought out his or
her service wires eighteen inches beyond the walls of his or her building in
such manner as to be readily accessible from the lines of the Village.

any material change to be made in his or her installation and shall not make
any material addition to or reduction from the connected lead at the time the
service is installed without first having the written consent of the
Administrator or his or her designee.
   (h)   Consumers' meters and other appliances shall be provided with suitable
devices so that the Village can interrupt service and/or disconnect lines if a
consumer's use of electrical energy is detrimental to the Village's supply of
electrical energy in general or in the consumer's locality.
   (i)   All charges for electrical energy furnished consumers in the Village
shall be due on the twentieth day of each month, and if such charges are not
paid when due, a ten percent penalty shall be added upon such charges. Upon
failure to pay the charge assessed against a consumer on the due date or within
ten days thereafter, the electrical energy being furnished to the consumer, or
to the property on which the consumer resides, shall be stopped until the
accrued charges are paid in full. However, any consumer who is delinquent in
the payment of electrical energy charges may, upon application made to the
Village Administrator, pay such delinquent charges in installments, as
determined by the Administrator.
   (j)   Any consumer whose electric service has been discontinued for
nonpayment for such service shall pay a fee of ten dollars ($10.00) to the
Village before the meter will be reinstalled.
   (k)   The Village Administrator shall, upon a deposit of ten dollars
($10.00), test a meter, subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   If a meter is found to over-register by an amount exceeding two
percent, another meter will be furnished and proper reduction shall be made on
the electric bill.
      (2)   If a meter does not over-register by an amount exceeding two
percent, the ten-dollar ($10.00) deposit will not be refunded and the bill must
be paid as rendered.
   (l)   In case of a violation of any rule or regulation herein provided, the
Village Administrator may discontinue service to the consumer violating the
same, and in such case service shall not be again furnished to such consumer
until a fee of ten dollars ($10.00) is paid for making reconnections.

1050.01   PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general
health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in the City of Wayne and the
watersheds to which it drains and to comply with the City’s National Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit and other applicable federal and
State regulations.
   (b)   This chapter seeks to meet that purpose by minimizing the negative
impacts of increased stormwater discharges from new land development and
redevelopment through the following objectives:
      (1)   To minimize increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes from
identified land development and redevelopment.
      (2)   To minimize nonpoint source pollution.
      (3)   To minimize the deterioration of existing watercourses, culverts
and bridges, and other structures.
      (4)   To encourage water recharge where geologically favorable conditions
exist.
      (5)   To maintain the ecological integrity of stream channels.
      (6)   To minimize the negative impacts of development on downstream
channel stability.
      (7)   To preserve and protect water supply facilities and water resources
by controlling increased flood discharges, stream erosion, and runoff
pollution.
      (8)   To reduce the adverse impact of changing land use on water bodies
and, to that end, this chapter establishes minimum standards to protect water
bodies from degradation resulting from changing land use where stormwater
management controls are insufficient to meet water quantity and quality goals.
      (9)   To ensure that storm drains and stormwater BMPs are adequate to
address stormwater management needs within a proposed development, and for
protecting downstream landowners from flooding and degradation of water
quality. The procedures, standards, and recommendations set forth in this
chapter and the current Wayne County Stormwater Control Program are designed
for these purposes.
      (10)   To ensure that all stormwater facilities necessary for a proposed
development will have an appropriate governmental unit responsible in
perpetuity for performing maintenance or for overseeing the performance of
maintenance by a private entity.
      (11)   To facilitate the integration of stormwater management and
pollution control with other ordinances, programs, policies, and the
comprehensive plans of the City of Wayne.
      (12)   To establish legal authority to carry out all of the inspection
and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.

(Ord. 2022-02. Passed 5-3-22)
1050.08   STANDARDS FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN
(STORMWATER PLAN) APPROVAL.
   (a)   All developments requiring a stormwater plan shall be designed,
constructed, and maintained to prevent flooding, minimize stream channel
impacts, protect water quality, and achieve the purposes of this chapter, as
stated above. The City of Wayne has adopted performance standards to meet the
objectives of managing the quantity and quality of stormwater runoff from a
site as described below and in the current Wayne County Stormwater Control
Program.
   (b)   Designers may select any combination of stormwater BMPs which meet the
performance standards provided the selections:
      (1)   Comply with the requirements identified in this chapter and the
current Wayne County Stormwater Control Program;
      (2)   Comply with all other local, County, State, or federal
requirements; and
      (3)   Do not conflict with the existing local stormwater management and
watershed plans.
   (c)   The particular facilities and measures required on-site shall take
into consideration the natural features, upland areas, wetlands, and
watercourses on the site; the potential for on-site and offsite adverse
stormwater impacts, water pollution, and erosion; and the size of the site.
   (d)   The following on-site stormwater management concepts must be followed:
      (1)   Natural topography and site drainage shall be preserved and site
grading shall be minimized to the maximum extent reasonably achievable
considering the nature of the development.
      (2)   The preferred conveyance strategy is to transport, wherever
possible, untreated and treated runoff in conveyance facilities open to the
atmosphere (e.g., swales, vegetated buffer strips, energy-dissipating
structures, etc.), rather than through enclosed pipes, so as to decrease runoff
velocity, allow for natural infiltration, allow suspended sediment particles to
settle, and to remove pollutants.
      (3)   Watercourses shall not be deepened, widened, dredged, cleared of
vegetation, straightened, stabilized, or otherwise altered without applicable
permits or approvals from the City Engineer, relevant County agencies and the
applicable State of Michigan department(s).
      (4)   The stormwater plan and associated BMPs must demonstrate compliance
with required channel protection/volume criteria by providing retention as
necessary to meet volume and peak flow limits consistent with the requirements
of the design manual. Specific details for achieving compliance with the
volume/channel protection criteria are outlined in the design manual.
      (5)   The stormwater plan and associated BMPs must demonstrate compliance
with required water quality criteria by providing treatment of total suspended
solids (TSS) or by providing retention to achieve the same criteria for maximum
TSS concentrations in the stormwater discharge from the site with either
approach being consistent with the requirements of the design manual. Specific
details for achieving compliance with the water quality criteria are outlined
in the design manual.
      (6)   The stormwater plan and associated BMPs must demonstrate compliance
with required peak flowrate and flood control criteria by providing stormwater
detention and/or retention consistent with the requirements of the design
manual. Specific details for achieving compliance with the peak flowrate and
flood control criteria are outlined in the design manual.
      (7)   Under certain conditions, the City of Wayne, upon recommendation by
the City Engineer, may impose the following additional restrictions on
stormwater discharges.
         A.   Peak discharge may be further restricted when it can be shown
that a probable risk to downstream structures or unique natural areas exists,
or that existing severe flooding problems could be further aggravated.
         B.   Measures shall be imposed to protect against ground or surface
water pollution where the nature of the soils or bedrock underlying a
stormwater management structure constitutes substantial risk of contamination,
such as might be the case in limestone formations. Special provisions to be
followed in these cases will be provided by the City Engineer.
   (e)   Stormwater offsets may be considered in accordance with the provisions
provided in the current Wayne County Stormwater Control Program, where water
quantity or water quality BMPs required by this chapter cannot be fully
accommodated on-site.

the Constitution and the statutes of the State, especially Article IV, Sections
51 and 52 of the Constitution, and Act 641 of the Public Acts of 1978, as
amended. Pursuant to the Agreement, the City has agreed to deliver or cause to
be delivered to the Authority's incinerator substantially all solid waste

1200.01   TITLE.
   This ordinance is known and cited as the “City of Wayne Zoning Code” or the
“Zoning Code”. The official Zoning Map, a part of this Code, is known and cited
as the “City of Wayne Zoning Map” or the “Zoning Map.”
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1200.02   INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   Wayne’s Zoning Code promotes and protects the public health, safety, and
general welfare by incorporating provisions to achieve the following:
   (a)   Prevent the overcrowding of land and undue concentration of structures
and uses by regulating the intensity of land uses and lot areas and to
determine the areas of open spaces surrounding buildings and structures
necessary to protect adequate light, air, privacy, and convenience of access to
properties.
   (b)   Promote economic development and conserve and preserve the value of
land, buildings, and structures.
   (c)   Allow for a variety of residential housing types, and commercial,
industrial, institutional, and public uses.
   (d)   Protect against noxious fumes and odors, fires, crime, heat, dust,
smoke, glare, noise, radioactivity, and other nuisances and hazards.
   (e)   Promote efficient mobility throughout the City by a variety of modes,
as appropriate to the character of each part of the community, while minimizing
congestion and safety concerns.
   (f)   Promote the orderly and beneficial development of uses and prohibit
uses that are incompatible with the character of development, uses, or
structures permitted within zoning districts.
   (g)   Reduce flooding and water pollution and encourage the use of lands and
natural resources in accordance with their character, adaptability, and
suitability for particular purposes.

utilities, drainage, education, recreation, and other public services and
facilities.
   (i)   Establish standards that are consistent with and promote Wayne’s
Master Plan.
   (j)   Provide for the administration, enforcement, and amendment of this
Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1200.03   LEGAL BASIS FOR AUTHORITY.
   Wayne’s Zoning Code is enacted pursuant to the:
   (a)   Zoning Enabling Act. The Michigan Zoning Enabling Act (PA 110 of
2006), as amended establishes the authority for local units of government to
adopt comprehensive zoning regulations and empowers the City to enact a zoning
code and provide for its administration, enforcement, and amendment.
   (b)   Necessity. Wayne has determined it necessary to enact zoning
regulations for the purpose of promoting the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   (c)   Master Plan Compliance. Wayne has adopted a Master Plan intended to
guide growth in a logical and orderly fashion, which serves as the basis of
this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1200.04   SCOPE OF APPLICATION.
   (a)   Zoning applies to every building, structure, and use.
   (b)   Any use not expressly permitted within this Zoning Code is prohibited,
unless otherwise reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission as a special
land use. See Section
1202.07(c): Table of Permitted Uses by District on the determination for uses
not specifically listed.
   (c)   No building, structure, or land is to be used or occupied, and no
building or structure or part thereof is to be erected, moved, placed,
reconstructed, extended, enlarged, or altered, except in conformity with this
Zoning Code, unless specifically superseded by a law or regulation of Wayne
County, the State of Michigan, or the Federal Government of the United States.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1200.05   CONFLICTING LAWS.
   The provisions of this Zoning Code are in addition to all other ordinances
and regulations in effect within the City.
   (a)   More Restrictive. Whenever any provision of this Zoning Code imposes
more stringent requirements, regulations, restrictions, or limitations than are
imposed or required by the provisions of any other City Code, the provisions of
this Zoning Code govern. Whenever the provisions of any other regulation or
ordinance impose more stringent requirements than are imposed or required by
this Zoning Code, then the provisions of such law or ordinance govern.
   (b)   Abrogate or Annul. This Zoning Code is not intended to abrogate or
annul any easement, covenant, or other private agreement, provided that where
any provision of this Zoning Code is more restrictive or imposes a higher
standard than such easement, covenant, or other private agreement, this Zoning
Code governs.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1200.06   PRIOR UNLAWFUL STRUCTURES, SITES, LOTS, AND USES.
   Any structure, site, lot, or use that was unlawfully constructed, occupied,
or created before the effective date of this Zoning Code will continue to be
unlawful, unless expressly permitted by this Zoning Code, and is not legally
non-conforming.

1202.02   DISTRICT BOUNDARIES AND THE ZONING MAP.
   The areas establishing Wayne’s zoning districts and the boundaries of the
districts are hereby established as shown on the Zoning Map, which accompanies
this Zoning Code, and which the Zoning Map with all notations, references, and
other information shown thereon is as much a part of this Code as if fully
described herein. The Zoning Map must be certified as the official copy by the
City Clerk and kept on display at City Hall. Maps and descriptions accompanying
enacted amendments must be displayed adjacent to the official copy until such
time as the official copy is corrected. When so ordered by resolution of
Council, the official copy must be corrected to show all amendments.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1202.03   INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of a district on the Zoning
Map, the following rules apply:
   (a)   Boundaries following the centerlines of streets, highways, or alleys,
are construed as following such centerlines.
   (b)   Boundaries following platted or unplatted lot lines are construed as
following such lot lines.
   (c)   Boundaries following section lines, or the lines of customary
fractional division of sections, are construed as following such lines.
   (d)   Boundaries following the boundaries of the City are construed as
following such boundaries.
   (e)   Boundaries following railroad lines are construed to be midway between
the right-of-way lines.
   (f)   Boundaries parallel to, extensions of, or perpendicular to, features
indicated in the above subsection (a) through (e) are so construed. Distances
not specifically indicated on the Zoning Map are determined by the scale of the
map.
   (g)   In other circumstances not clearly covered above by subsections (a)
through (f), the Community Development and Planning Director determines the
boundaries by applying the criteria for such determination for subsections (a)
through (f), or by any other criteria as determined appropriate to construe the
boundaries of the district in a reasonable and harmonious manner.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1202.04   ZONING OF VACATED AREAS.
   Whenever any park, common area, outlot, street, alley, or other public way
within the City is vacated, such property (or portion thereof) is automatically
classified in the district of the adjoining property on either side of such
vacated property. In the event such vacated property is a district boundary
between two or more different districts, the new district boundary is the
former centerline of such vacated property.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1202.05   ANNEXED AREAS.
   Whenever land is annexed to the City, such land is automatically zoned the

changed by the adoption of a Zoning Map amendment by City Council.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1202.06   ESSENTIAL SERVICES.
   Essential services are permitted in all zoning districts and subject to the
standards of this Zoning Code and permitted to receive waivers from
requirements upon demonstration to the Community Development and Planning
Director that the Zoning Code standard in question would inhibit the provision
of the essential service to Wayne residents. However, buildings, towers, and
substations (such as wastewater treatment facilities, telephone repeater
stations, gas, or electric regulator stations, and the like) are not eligible
for waivers and limited to the zoning district which they are located within.

Use.”
   (b)   The “R1” One-Family Residential District includes the “R1A”, “R1B”,
and “R1C” Districts.
   (c)   The Planning Commission has the authority to determine that a use
(including a temporary use) not listed within this Zoning Code is similar in
character and intensity to the uses permitted in a given district, and
therefore permit that use by special land use approval (in accordance with the
process established in Chapter 1225). In determining the “character and

downtown.
      (7)   Building façades must incorporate recesses or projections along at
least twenty percent of the length of the façade.
      (8)   Decorative fencing must consist of wrought iron, vinyl, or
ornamental aluminum.
      (9)   Building entries must be readily identifiable and accessible, with

(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1217.03   FOOTNOTES TO THE SCHEDULE OF REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Residential units must meet the following minimum sizes:
      • EED Unit = 400 sq. ft. (only 25% of all units can be EED units)
      • 1-Bedroom Unit = 600 sq. ft.
      • 2-Bedroom Unit = 800 sq. ft.
      • 3-Bedroom Unit = 1,000 sq. ft.
   (b)   All principal buildings must be separated at least ten-feet from one
another.
   (c)   For a one-family dwelling unit on a single lot, the development
standards of Section 1203.05 apply.
   (d)   For a two-family dwelling unit on a single lot, the development
standards of Section 1204.05 apply.
   (e)   No rear setback is required, unless the site is adjacent to
residentially zoned property, in which case, the building must have a minimum
rear yard setback of twenty-feet.
   (f)   No building may be closer than twenty-feet from any residentially
zoned property boundary.
   (g)   All industrial uses must have a minimum lot area of 10,000 square
feet.
   (h)   The building height may not be greater than the horizontal distance to
the nearest residential property boundary, or fifty-feet, whichever is less.
   (i)   When the front yard is located on Michigan Avenue, Van Born, Hannan,
Cogswell, Howe, Venoy, Annapolis, and Hubbard, a front yard setback of fifty-
feet is required. Fifty percent of this setback may be used for parking and
circulation.
   (j)   Corner lots must have a minimum setback from the side street equal to
the minimum required front setback of the district in which it is located.
However, this does not reduce the buildable width of any lot of record to less
than twenty-five-feet, and the least required side yard for the district shall
be along the interior lot line. A corner lot that has a corner lot abutting or
across an alley, on which an existing principal building has a setback from the
side street less than required for the district, the side street setback may be
reduced, but not to less than fifteen-feet.
   (k)   For existing lots of record less than forty-five-feet wide, the
minimum side yard is five-feet (one) and thirteen-feet (total).
   (l)   All principal buildings must be separated by at least twenty-feet.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1217.04   EXCEPTIONS TO THE DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS.
   (a)   Height Exceptions. The height limitations of this Zoning Code do not
apply to chimneys, religious institution spires, cupolas, domes, water towers,
smokestacks, ventilators, skylights, elevators, conveyors, cooling towers,
flagpoles, public monuments, or power transmission towers, masts, and other
similar mechanical appurtenances pertaining to and necessary to the permitted
uses of the district. The Planning Commission may specify a height limit for
any such structure when special land use approval is required, and such height
limit is reasonably necessary for public safety or to otherwise to comply with
the standards set forth in this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Parapet Wall Extension. The provisions of this Zoning Code do not
prevent the erection, above the maximum building height limit, for a parapet
wall or cornice for screening purposes (without windows), extending above such
height limit not more than five-feet.
   (c)   New Lots. Newly created lots must be rectangular, with lot lines
meeting at right angles, unless that shape is rendered impossible by natural
features, legal restrictions, or other factors out of the control of the
applicant for a lot split.

is rat infestation or harborage of rats in such structures, open area or other
premises, the occupants or owners thereof, and in the case of a multiple
dwelling, the owner or owners thereof, shall immediately institute rat control
and shall continuously maintain such measures until any such open area or other
premises are declared by the Building Official or Health Inspector to be free
of rat infestation. The Building Official or Health Inspector may, if the
public health, safety, or welfare is threatened, order the installation of rat
walls in any structure as a means to eliminate rat infestation.
         C.   A vermin protection wall shall be installed and attached in all
accessory structures constructed to aid in control of vermin infestation and
said wall shall be of a material and to a depth as defined in the current
Michigan Building Code.

residential zoning district only as an accessory to an existing principal
building.
      (2)   If the function of an accessory structure is integrated into the
permitted principal building, the space shall comply in all respects with the
requirements of this Code that apply to the permitted principal building,
including but not limited to setback requirements, unless specifically stated
to the contrary herein.
      (3)   The total floor area occupied by the accessory structure(s) cannot

      (2)   Review and revocation. The Building and Engineering Department,
upon the filing of an application for a fence permit, will examine such plans
and specifications and other data and the premises upon which the fence is
proposed to be erected, and if the proposed fence complies with all the
requirements of this chapter and all other laws and ordinances of the City,
then the Department will issue the fence permit. If the work authorized under a
fence permit has not been completed within six months after its date of
issuance, said permit is null and void.
      (3)   Fee. The fee for the fence permit is set forth in
Chapter 210  of the Administration Code.
      (4)   Work without permit. Whoever commences any construction or repair,
for which a permit is required by this chapter, without first having obtained
such permit, will, if legally authorized and subsequently allowed to obtain a
permit, pay double the permit fee specified in
Chapter 210  of the Administration Code, plus one hundred dollars ($100.00) for
such construction or repair, provided that a notice has been sent or issued by
the enforcing officer to the person commencing such construction repair.
   (b)   General Fence Requirements:
      (1)   Materials.
         A.   All fences built or repaired must have posts made of either iron

passersby.
         D.   Fence appearance minimizes or prevents discordant and unsightly
surroundings in the immediate neighborhood.
      (5)   Sharp projections. No owner or lessee of any building in the City,
or their respective agents, can erect or cause to be erected or maintained on
or about its exterior building line, or upon fences, or upon any portion of the
sidewalk adjacent to such building, any railing, fence, guard, or other
projection on which there is affixed, placed or in any manner attached any
spike, nail or other sharp-pointed instrument of any kind. No wire or other
fence materials shall be affixed to the fence with the top edge having any
sharp or pointed projections of any kind. However, if such fence is constructed
of pickets, such pickets must be made of not less than one-inch by three-inch
material and have an angle at the top of not less than ninety degrees.
      (6)   Barbed wire. Barbed wire fences are only permitted in the I1 and I2
Districts on fences six-feet in height or taller. No such barbed wire can be
placed at any point nearer to the ground than six-feet. However, arms for
barbed wire on six-foot fences may be placed only on the lines enclosing an
industrial property. These arms must project over the industrial side of the
line only on such portions of the fence, which are twenty-five-feet or more
from the front lot line.

no closer than three-feet to any property line or sidewalk where they do not
exceed thirty-inches in height and the vertical surface in any five-foot
section measured from the finished ground grade to the top of the fence has
openings of at least fifty percent of the total surface of each five-foot
section of fence, and all framing members, including posts, horizontal or
vertical supports and fencing, are considered in the calculations. The fence
must be kept in a sound condition as determined by the Building Official.
      (3)   Heights exceptions. In cases of residential lots abutting public,
commercial or industrial alleys or properties, public playing fields, parking
lots, parks, school grounds or recreation areas, approved fences not exceeding
six-feet in height may be erected and maintained alongside or rear lot lines
abutting such alleys or properties.
   (d)   Business and Industrial Fences:
      (1)   Fences cannot exceed six-feet in height, measured from grade,
except that industrial fences may reach a maximum height, measured from grade
of eight-feet.
      (2)   Fences cannot obstruct vision to an extent greater than twenty-five
percent of their total area.
      (3)   Fences cannot be constructed nearer the street than the front
building line of the principal building on the site or the building setback
line of vacant business and industrial lots. On corner lots, fencing may be
erected along the side street property line no further than the front building
line of the principal building.
      (4)   No fence can be constructed nearer the street than the front
bearing wall of a structure or the building setback line of vacant lots. In
those cases where a structure is set on the rear portion of a lot, a fence may
be constructed at the building setback line of the adjacent properties or the
twenty-five-foot setback line, whichever is greater.
      (5)   Materials recovery operators. Any person whose principal business
is that of a materials recovery operator, or who is operating or conducting a
place for the dismantling of automobiles, using a yard or enclosure other than
a building for the purpose of storing and/or having on hand any secondhand
articles, junk, automobiles for dismantling or dismantled parts of automobiles,
must, unless a waiver is obtained pursuant to Section
832.15  of the Business Regulations and Taxation Code, erect and maintain a
fence made of board corrugated sheet metal or chain-link with metal inside and
against the chain-link, of a height of eight-feet, which fence must be painted
on the outside and kept and maintained in repair. On those sides adjacent to
railroad property, a chain-link or galvanized steel fence of a height of not
less than six-feet may be used.

twenty-five percent of their total area.
      (2)   Where a partition fence is constructed along a school yard or
public or private playing field, fences in excess of the height specified
herein may be permitted if the lines along which such fences are to run have
been determined in accordance with this chapter and the details of construction
are approved by the Building and Engineering Department.
   (f)   Maintenance and Nuisance Conditions.
      (1)   General requirements. Fences must be maintained in a neat and safe
condition. Any fence which, through lack of repair, type of construction or
otherwise, is not maintained in a neat and safe condition, including but not
limited to the growth of grass, weeds, vines, trees, or other vegetation shall
be deemed a nuisance. The Building and Engineering Department shall notify the
owner, agent or person in control of the property on which such fence is
located of the existence of such nuisance and specify the required repairs or
modifications to be made to render the fence safe or require that the unsafe
fence or any portion thereof be removed, and shall provide a time limiting such
repairs, modification or removal. All fences extending beyond the building or
setback line, except those installed after actions by the Zoning Board of
Appeals, shall be reconstructed in such a manner as to comply with all setback
requirements set forth in these Codified Ordinances.
      (2)   Isolation of property. In no instance shall the installation of a
fence cause the isolation of property that is inaccessible for purposes of yard
maintenance and upkeep. Under authority of subsection (b) hereof, the Building
and Engineering Department may cause a separation between fences, or between a
fence and a structure, or any other remedy necessary to ensure adequate access
for cutting of grass and weeds and/or the collection of litter and debris.

overcrowding of land, and reduce impervious surfaces.
   •   Encourage the use of native plant materials and a diversity of species
in plantings.
   •   Provide visual buffers and enhance the beautification of Wayne.
   •   Safeguard and enhance property values and protect public and private
investment.
   •   Preserve, protect, and restore the unique identity and environment of
Wayne, and preserve the economic base attracted to the City by such factors.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1219.02   SCOPE OF LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   On developed sites (excluding one-family residential dwelling units,
when developed on a parcel-by-parcel basis), landscaping must be brought into
compliance with the Zoning Code. Existing parking lots are exempt from the
interior parking lot landscaping requirements, unless they are being removed or
replaced. This applies to:
      (1)   New construction (or the modification of an existing building where
the total building square footage is increased by twenty-five percent or
greater).
      (2)   The total amount of impervious surface on the site is increased by
fifty percent or greater.
      (3)   A special land use is required.
   (b)   No landscaped area may be abandoned, paved, or otherwise employed
without submission and approval of a site plan.
   (c)   These requirements are minimum requirements, and nothing precludes a
developer from proposing a more extensive landscape plan.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1219.03   GENERAL STANDARDS.
   (a)   Plans. Landscape plans must be prepared, sealed, and signed by a
licensed landscape architect.
   (b)   General Requirements. The entire landscaped area (including lawn
areas) must be planted with grass, groundcover, shrubbery, or other suitable
plant material (excludes areas used as paved patios, terraces, sidewalks, and
similar site features).
   (c)   Maintenance of Existing Landscaping. All existing landscaping must be
maintained in good condition to present a healthy, neat, and orderly
appearance, free from refuse and debris. All unhealthy and dead materials must
be replaced within forty-five days (or within the next planting period,
whichever comes next). Grass areas must be kept weed free and mowed on a
regular basis and all edges trimmed and maintained. Landscape inspections may
be conducted on a regular basis to ensure long-term compliance.
   (d)   Preservation of Existing Vegetation. Existing vegetation to be
preserved must be protected during construction with temporary fencing around
the drip line. To promote the preservation of natural features, sites should be
designed to preserve existing woodlands and wetlands to the greatest extent
possible.
   (e)   Planting Setbacks. The trunks of trees cannot be planted closer than
four-feet to a property line.
   (f)   Private Ponds. Ponds are permitted for recreational, scenic, or
stormwater management purposes and must meet all federal, state, county, and
City requirements. The property owner must maintain the pond and the filter
system, including, but not limited to the cleaning of the pond, the mowing of
grass, and the elimination of any nuisances created by standing water or a
water body. Ponds must incorporate water tolerant grasses and seed mixes at the
bottom of the pond/basin and appropriate trees, shrubs, and grasses along the
banks based on the environment to improve views, filter runoff, and enhance
wildlife habitat.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1219.04   COMMERCIAL LANDSCAPE DESIGN STANDARDS.
   All landscaping must comply with the following minimum standards:
   (a)   Site Trees. One tree per 1,000 square feet of non-paved surface must
be provided, in addition to other trees required elsewhere.
   (b)   Frontage Landscaping. When a site abuts a road right-of-way, frontage
landscaping must be provided in the front yard area adjacent to or within the
right-of-way per the table below. For the purposes of computing length of road
frontage, openings for driveways and sidewalks are not counted towards the
total linear frontage. Trees and shrubs may be planted at uniform intervals, at
random, or in groupings.
 
Type of Frontage Landscaping Min. Required per Linear Foot of Road Frontage (or
                             fraction thereof)
Deciduous Trees              1 per 20 linear ft.
Ornamental (Flowering) Trees 1 per 50 linear ft.
Shrubs                       8 per 40 linear ft.
 
   (c)   Parking Lot Landscaping. To improve the safety of pedestrian and
vehicular traffic, guide traffic movement, and improve the appearance of
parking lots, off-street parking lots (with twenty or more parking spaces) must
dedicate at least five percent of the total parking lot area to interior
landscape islands: each island must be a minimum size of 150 square feet,
contain at least one deciduous tree, and covered with mulch, grasses, or
groundcover.
   (d)   Parking Lot Screening. Screening adjacent to a parking lot is not
required if the parking surface area is completely screened from the right-of-
way by an intervening building or structure. Where a parking lot is located
adjacent to sidewalks, streets, and other rights-of-way, screening must be
provided within ten-feet of the parking lot with the following (or a
combination thereof):
      (1)   Vegetative buffer. A ten-foot-wide greenbelt with an evergreen or
deciduous hedge, at least three-feet in height. The landscaping must be planted
to provide an unbroken visual screen within three-years and no plant material
may be located within two-feet from the front of a parking space curb (to
account for vehicle overhang).
      (2)   Screen wall/fence. A decorative masonry wall or black aluminum
fencing, at least three-feet in height. Walls must contain a stone or masonry
cap and fences must incorporate stone or masonry piers at regular intervals.
   (e)   Screening from Residential Uses. All non-residential uses that abut a
residentially used property must provide screening by one or a combination of
the following:
      (1)   A reinforced, decorative masonry wall, six-feet in height above
grade, with a stone cap.
      (2)   A ten-foot-wide greenbelt with evergreen trees forming a continuous
screen (trees planted 10-15 feet apart (on center) in two staggered rows).
      (3)   A six-foot in height earth berm, with a slope (measured on the
cross-section) no greater than 1:3 and at least a two-foot-wide planting area
at its crest, and landscaped.
   (f)   Landscaping Adjacent to Buildings. All building walls visible from a
right-of-way or publicly accessible area must have a three-foot-wide landscape
area adjacent to them for at least twenty-five percent of their total width.
This area may include inground landscaping, raised landscape beds, decorative
landscape containers, or a combination thereof.
   (g)   Dumpster/Refuse Containers. Unless otherwise required in this Code,
such containers and permitted outdoor storage must be screened by:
      (1)   A decorative masonry or composite wall, at least six-feet in height
above grade, or one-foot above the object which it is screening, whichever is
greater.
      (2)   An opaque gate (constructed from metal or wood) is required; chain
link fencing with obscuring fabric or slats is prohibited.
   (h)   Loading Zone Screening. Loading zones (including service areas,
staging areas, truck docks, etc.), must be screened from adjacent residentially
used land and rights-of-way with a decorative masonry wall, building wing wall,
or densely planted landscape buffer, or other means acceptable to the Planning
Commission.
   (i)   Mechanical and Utility Equipment Screening. Transformers, mechanical
equipment, and other above ground utility cabinets must be screened with
evergreen plantings or a decorative opaque fence at least one-foot taller than
the height of the cabinet/equipment. This requirement does not apply to

   (b)   To compute the number of parking spaces required, the definition of
usable floor area (UFA) governs: that area used for, or intended to be used
for, the sale of merchandise or service or to serve patrons, clients, or
customers. Such floor area which is used or intended to be used principally for
the storage or processing of merchandise or for hallways, utilities, or
sanitary facilities, is excluded from this computation. Measurement of usable
floor area is the sum of the horizontal areas of the several floors of the
building, measured from the interior faces of the exterior walls.

(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1220.05   MAXIMUM PARKING.
   (a)   To minimize excessive areas of pavement which negatively impact
aesthetic standards and contribute to high volumes of stormwater runoff, the
maximum amount of required off-street parking permitted for any use cannot
exceed 130 percent of the minimum parking requirements of Section
1220.03. This does not apply to one- or two-family dwelling units or for the
approved storage of vehicles for auto repair, sales, and storage and
distribution.
   (b)   The Planning Commission may permit additional parking over and above
the maximum parking limit based on documented evidence indicating that the
maximum parking permitted will not be sufficient to accommodate the use on a
typical day.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1220.06   SHARED PARKING.
   Private parking facilities may be shared by multiple uses whose activities
are not normally conducted during the same hours, or when hours of peak use
vary. The applicant has the burden of proof in requesting a reduction in the
total number of required off-street parking spaces.
   (a)   Standards.
      (1)   Evidence must be submitted that demonstrates the shared parking
will not result in inadequate parking. Applicants must submit a parking study
that provides an analysis of available and used parking spaces based on parking
counts taken at certain time intervals and days to verify parking usage
patterns. No reduction in the number of spaces reserved for persons with
disabilities is permitted. The parking study must include, but is not limited
to:
         A.   The type and hours of operation and parking demand for each land
use.
         B.   A site plan displaying shared use spaces in the lot and walking
distance to the uses sharing the lot.
         C.   A description of the character of land use and parking patterns
of adjacent land uses.
         D.   An estimate of anticipated turnover in parking space use over the
course of twelve- to twenty-four-hours at the site.
      (2)   Distance and access from the use/structure:
         A.   Shared parking facilities cannot be located further than 300-feet
from any structure or use served. In the case of the SF or MU Districts, this
distance may be increased to 500-feet. The distance between the use and the
parking facility is measured following a reasonable and safe walking route from
the main entrance of the use to the nearest parking lot.
         B.   Users sharing a parking facility must provide for safe,
convenient walking between land uses and parking, including safe, well-marked
pedestrian crossings, signage, and adequate lighting. Pedestrian paths must be
as direct and short as possible, without compromising safety. A pedestrian
circulation plan that shows connections and walkways between the parking
facilities and subject uses must be provided.
         C.   Shared parking areas must be paved and properly striped. Details
regarding the maintenance of the shared parking areas, including snow removal,
must be provided within the shared parking agreement.
         D.   Signage to direct drivers to the most convenient parking areas
for each use must be provided, if found necessary by the Planning Commission to
improve safety.
   (b)   Change in Use. Should any of the shared parking uses be changed, or
should the Planning Department find that any of the conditions described in the
approved shared parking study or agreement no longer exist, or if insufficient
parking is an issue due to complaints, the property owner must have the option
of submitting a revised shared parking study and an amended shared parking
agreement in accordance with the standards of this subsection or of providing
the number of spaces required for each use as if computed separately. If the
Planning Department determines that the revised shared parking study or
agreement does not satisfy the off-street parking needs of the proposed uses,
the shared parking request may be denied, and no certificates of occupancy
issued until the full number of off-street parking spaces are provided.
   (c)   Written Agreement. Prior to the use being initiated, a written
agreement must be reviewed by the City Attorney and executed by the property
owner to assure the continued availability of the shared parking spaces for the
life of the development. The agreement must include, at a minimum:
      (1)   List the names and ownership interest of all parties to the
agreement and contain the signatures of those parties.
      (2)   Provide a legal description of the land upon which the parking area
(s) and building(s) appurtenant to the parking areas are located.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1220.07   PARKING LOT LAYOUT AND DESIGN.
   Off-street parking lots must be laid out, constructed, and maintained as
follows:
   (a)   Parking facilities must be in accord with the following dimensions:

   (b)   All maneuvering lane widths permit one-way traffic movement, except
that the 90° pattern may permit two-way movement.
   (c)   All spaces must be provided adequate access by means of maneuvering
lanes; backing directly onto a street is prohibited.
   (d)   Parking aisles cannot exceed 300-feet without a break in circulation.
   (e)   Appropriate signage and striping must be included within all parking
lots. Designating the traffic flow at all entrances and exits (i.e.,
directional arrows) may be required by the Planning Commission if traffic
safety is a concern.
   (f)   Bumper stops, wheel chocks or curbs must be provided and so located as
to prevent a vehicle from projecting into any required front yard space, and to
prevent a vehicle from touching any required wall or fence, extending beyond
the property line or extending into landscaped areas and/or pedestrian ways.
   (g)   A wall must be provided on all sides of an off-street parking area
abutting or adjacent to a residential district. Where a wall extends to an
alley which is a means of ingress and egress to an off-street parking area, the
wall may end not more than ten-feet from such alley line in order to permit a
wider means of access to the parking area.
      (1)   The masonry wall cannot be less than six-feet in height (measured
from the surface of the parking lot) and must consist of either stone, brick,
stamped concrete, or split-faced concrete block.
      (2)   The Planning Commission, upon application by the property owner of
the off-street parking area, may waive or modify the wall requirement by
approving either an earth berm or evergreen screen (minimum six-feet in height)
in its place. The Planning Commission may waive the wall requirement in
specific cases where cause can be shown that no good purpose is served by
compliance.
   (h)   The parking lot must be graded and adequately drained so as to dispose
of all surface water accumulated in the parking area in such a way as to
preclude drainage of water onto adjacent property or toward building.
   (i)   The entire parking area, storage area and non-landscaped portion of
the lot, including parking spaces and maneuvering lanes, must be provided with
asphalt or concrete surfacing.
      (1)   Concrete surfacing consists of four-inches of stone aggregate base
(MDOT, 21aa), six-inches of nonreinforced concrete, six sacks, air entrained,
twenty- eight-day compressive strength of 3,500 psi minimum.
      (2)   Asphalt surfacing consists of six-inches of aggregate base (MDOT,
21aa), two-inches of bituminous base (MDOT, 1,300l), and one and one-half-
inches of wearing course (MDOT, 1,100t minimum).
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1220.08   LOADING ZONES.
   (a)   In connection with every building, structure, or use hereafter erected
(except one- and two-family dwelling units) an off-street loading zone must be
provided. A dedicated alley may satisfy the requirement for off-street loading
and unload.
   (b)   Loading zones must be a minimum of ten-feet by forty-feet, with a
fourteen-foot height clearance.
   (c)   Loading zones cannot back out directly onto a public road.
   (d)   In the case of a mix of uses or a mixed-use building on one developed
lot, the total requirements for loading zones is the sum of the various uses
computed separately.
   (e)   All loading zones in the IB, Industrial Business, the I1, Light
Industrial, and the I2, Heavy Industrial Districts must be located in the rear
or interior side yard.
   (f)   Loading zones must be provided as follows:
 
Usable Floor Area (square feet) Number of Loading Zone(s) Required
0 – 1,000 square feet         None
1,001 – 20,000 square feet    1 loading zone
20,001 – 100,000 square feet  1 loading zone, plus 1 for each 20,000 sq. ft.
                                in excess of 20,001 sq. ft.
100,001 square feet and greater 5 loading zones, or more if needed in the
                                opinion of the Planning Commission
 
   (g)   The Planning Commission may modify or waive the requirement for a
loading zone, upon determination that adequate loading space is available to
serve the building/use, or that provision of such a loading zone is unnecessary
for the use.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1220.09   ACCESS MANAGEMENT.
   (a)   Number of Non-residential Driveways. Access must be provided for each
site; where feasible, access must be provided via a shared access driveway. One
additional driveway may be allowed for properties with a continuous frontage of
over 500-feet and one additional driveway for each additional 250-feet of
frontage. Uses requiring more than one driveway, detailed elsewhere in this
Zoning Code, are subject to those specific standards instead. The Planning
Commission may determine additional driveways are justified due to the amount
of traffic generated by the use without compromising traffic operations along
the street, based upon a traffic impact study submitted by the applicant.
   (b)   Driveway Spacing. Where possible, the minimum spacing between two non-
residential driveways on the same side of the road is based upon posted speed
limits along the parcel frontage. The minimum spacings indicated below are
measured from centerline to centerline.
 
Posted Speed Limit (MPH) Minimum Spacing Between Driveways
25 MPH                   130 feet
30 MPH                   185 feet
35 MPH                   245 feet
40 MPH                   300 feet
45 MPH                   350 feet
50+ MPH                  455+ feet
 
   (c)   Intersection Setback. Where feasible, the minimum spacing between a
proposed non-residential driveway and an intersection must be setback fifty-
feet from the right-of-way.
   (d)   Modification of Standards. During the site plan review, the Planning
Commission has the authority to modify the standards of this section upon
consideration of the following:
      (1)   The standards would prevent reasonable access to the site.
      (2)   Access via a shared driveway or service/frontage road is not
possible due to the presence of existing buildings or topographic conditions.
      (3)   Roadway improvements (such as the addition of a traffic signal,
center turn lane, or bypass lane) will be made to improve overall traffic
operations prior to project completion, or occupancy of the building.
      (4)   The use involves the redesign of an existing development or a new
use which will generate less traffic than the previous use.
      (5)   The proposed location and design are supported by the Michigan
Department of Transportation (MDOT) or Wayne County as an acceptable design
under the existing site conditions. The Planning Commission may also request
the applicant provide a traffic impact study to support the requested access
design.
      (6)   Where there is a change in use or expansion at a site that does not
comply with standards of this Zoning Code, the Planning Commission may
determine the amount of upgrade needed in consideration of the existing and
expected traffic pattern and the capability to meet the standards of this
Zoning Code to the extent practical.
   (e)   Traffic Impact Studies. The City may require a traffic impact study
(TIS) for all development proposals that it reviews. The TIS must be submitted
by the applicant to determine the potential future traffic conditions on
adjacent roadways once a proposed development is finished. The TIS must include
a prediction of the peak-hour operational conditions at site driveways and road
intersections affected by the development. The results of the TIS may be used
in the final design of access points and internal circulation and may identify
necessary off-site road improvements. At a minimum, the TIS shall meet
standards as published by the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments
(SEMCOG) and MDOT in the handbook titled Evaluating Traffic Impact Studies and
found acceptable by the City prior to being used.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1220.10   MAINTENANCE.
   All parking lots and loading zones must be maintained in accordance with
this chapter, an approved site plan, and the following:
   (a)   Alterations to an approved parking lot or loading zone that are not in
accordance with an approved site plan are a violation of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   All parking lots, perimeter landscaped areas, and required screening
must be kept clean and free from tall grass, weeds, trash, and debris.
Surfacing, curbing, lighting fixtures, signage, and related improvements must
be kept in good repair.
   (c)   Parking lots and loading zones must be diligently kept clear of snow;
up to ten percent of the parking lot may be used for snow deposit.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1220.11   WAIVERS.
   Flexibility in the requirements and recommendations is included in
recognition that overly large parking lots are a drain on economic vitality,
present safety hazards to pedestrians and motorists, and create environmental
hazards such as heat islands, stormwater runoff, loss of habitat, and flood
hazard.
   (a)   The Planning Commission may modify the numerical requirements for off-
street parking if an applicant demonstrates that the required amount of parking
spaces is excessive based on the needs of the proposed use, or that the site
cannot physically accommodate the required number of parking spaces while also
meeting the other standards of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   The Planning Commission may attach conditions to the approval of a
modification to the minimum required parking that bind such approval to the
specific use in question, including required banked parking for waived parking
spaces.
   (c)   Where banked parking is required by the Planning Commission, the
following must be met:
      (1)   The site plan must show all required spaces, including waived
spaces and note the area where parking is being deferred, including dimensions
and parking lot layout and landscaping, and must be set as open space.
      (2)   The property owner must agree in writing to construct some or all
of the deferred spaces upon written order of the City.
      (3)   Stormwater calculations must be provided to verify adequate
capacity if an expansion is necessary.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1220.12   PENALTY.
   Whoever violates this chapter is responsible for a municipal civil
infraction for a first offense and fined five hundred dollars ($500.00).
Whoever violates this chapter within 180 days of a prior plea, or an
adjudicated or defaulted violation of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor
and subject to the penalty provided in Section

   Sign regulations balance the public and private interests: they promote a
safe, well-maintained, vibrant, and attractive community while accommodating
the need for signs to inform, direct, identify, advertise, advocate, promote,
endorse, and otherwise communicate information. The placement and design of
signs must further the land use planning objectives of Wayne and protect
neighborhood character and the value of surrounding properties.

1222.02   SIGN DEFINITIONS.
   (1)   “Air-activated signs.” A sign that is inflated by air or uses air flow
to induce movement. Inflatable objects used for signs are often made of
flexible fabric and are equipped with a motor to blow air into the object. Air-
activated signs are typically temporary and are restrained, attached, or held
in place by a cord, rope, cable, or similar method, but can be permanent.
   (2)   “Animated sign.” A sign that has any visible moving part either
constantly or at intervals; flashing, scintillating, intermittent, or
oscillating lights; visible mechanical movement of any description; or other
apparent visible movement achieved by any means that move, change, flash,
oscillate or visibly alters in appearance to depict action, create an image of
a living creature or person, or create a special effect or scene. This
definition does not include changeable-copy signs and electronic message center
(EMC) signs that comply with this chapter.
   (3)   “Banner sign.” A temporary sign on paper, cloth, fabric or other
flexible or combustible material of any kind that is attached flat against a
permanent sign face or strung between two poles or structures. National flags,
state or municipal flags, or the official flag of any institution or business
are not considered banner signs.

commercial purposes. Yard signs are characterized by a wire frame, non-durable
message surface such as cardboard or paper, and are often inserted into a lawn

message board, a consistent physical characteristic is its temporary and
disposable nature.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1222.03   PERMIT PROCESS.
   (a)   Sign Permit Required. It is unlawful for any person to erect, alter,
or structurally change a sign (unless the sign is specifically exempt per
Section
1222.04 : Exempt Signs), without first obtaining a permit from the Building and
Engineering Department. Any sign that makes use of electricity must, in
addition to a sign permit, have an electrical permit.
   (b)   Review Process.
      (1)   Application. Applications for a sign permit are made to the
Building and Engineering Department and at least contain the following:
         A.   The name, address, email, and telephone number of the applicant.
         B.   Letter of approval, which outlines the consent of the property
owner, if different from the applicant.
         C.   The location of the building, structure, or lot to which or upon
which the sign is attached to or erected on.
         D.   Photographs showing the location of the proposed sign.
         E.   Two sets of plans and specifications indicating the method of
construction and attachment to the building or in the ground.
         F.   A copy of the stress sheets and calculations showing the
structure is designed for dead load and wind pressure in any direction in the
amount required by the current Michigan Building Code. Where the Building
Official deems necessary, a registered engineer must approve the structural
design.
         G.   The name of the person or company erecting the structure.
         H.   An elevation of the proposed sign with dimensions, materials,
colors, and wording.
         I.   Any other information deemed necessary by the City to ensure
compliance.
      (2)   Building Official review. The Building Official reviews all final
sign applications and determines if the proposed request meets all the
requirements.
   (c)   Master Sign Plans. Within a project, buildings, or clusters of
buildings, that have more than one tenant must submit a master sign plan with
the sign permit application. The master sign plan must include the location,
area, height, color, and font of all ground and wall signs, including the area
designated for individual tenant signs. Elevations of ground signs must be
included. The sign plan must be designed so that it establishes a common theme
or design, uses similar construction methods, and is compatible in color, size,
and scale.
   (d)   Fees. Prior to the issuance of a sign permit, a fee must be paid, as
set forth in
Chapter 210 : Uniform Fee Schedule.
   (e)   Inspections.
      (1)   Signs for which a permit has been issued are inspected by the
Building Official once erected. Approval is granted only if the sign is
constructed in compliance with the approved plans and all applicable Zoning and
Building Code standards.
      (2)   Periodically, the Building Official may inspect signs for the
purpose of ascertaining whether the sign needs repair or removal.
   (f)   Permit Revocation and Expiration. All rights and privileges acquired
by any person under the provisions of this chapter may be revoked upon
violation of any of the conditions herein. If the work authorized under a
permit has not been started within six-months after the date of issuance, the
permit is null and void.
   (g)   Appeals. Any person filing an application for a permanent or temporary
sign permit who feels they have been aggrieved by the decision of the Building
Official may appeal such decision to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1222.04   EXEMPT SIGNS.
   The following signs do not require a permit:
   (a)   Government signs, including those used to identify public facilities,
government buildings, parks, and temporary government signs used for decoration
or for seasonal events or holidays. This includes highway and street signs, and
signs authorized by a road agency in conjunction with infrastructure
improvements.
   (b)   Address numbers, with a numeral height of no greater than twelve-
inches.
   (c)   Historic markers under the authority/designated authority of the

district, and no more than three flags are permitted per lot in all other
districts.
      (4)   Sixty square feet in size.
   (g)   Directional signs, no larger than four-square feet in area and four-
feet in height.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1222.05   GENERAL SIGN STANDARDS.
   The following general standards apply:
   (a)   Clear Corner Distance. Signs must maintain clear corner vision for all
street intersections and driveway entrances. No signs can be located within a
triangle formed by two points, each twenty-five-feet away from the intersection
of the right-of-way line and the driveway, and the line connecting them.
   (b)   Consistency. All signs developed for one building, structure or
shopping center must incorporate a theme using similar methods of display and
construction, which limits the number of fonts, colors, and sign face sizes.
Signs must be compatible with the architectural style, elements, and materials
of the principal building or structure.
   (c)   Colors. Sign colors must complement the color scheme of the building
and structures on the lot. Daylight fluorescent pigments or paints (or
reflective color materials that give the appearance of changing color or
brilliant luminescent colors) are prohibited.
   (d)   Materials. Signs must be constructed of wood, glass, masonry, cast
metal or high-density urethane (which must be painted and is intended to mimic
wood). Prohibited materials include sheet plastic, plastic substrates, interior
grade woods, unlaced plywood, sheet metal, and neon.
   (e)   Illumination and Lighting. External illumination is permitted in all
zoning districts (backlighting of opaque letters is considered external
illumination) and subject to the following standards. Temporary signs may not
be illuminated.
      (1)   Lights must be steady, stationary, and shaded and/or shielded
downward with light directed away from adjacent properties and streets.
      (2)   Signs with internal illumination must have the lettering and
graphics in a lighter color than the background to the maximum extent
practical.
      (3)   All signs must comply with the relevant lighting requirements of
Chapter 1221: Lighting.
      (4)   Illumination by bare bulbs or flames is prohibited, except that
bare bulbs are permitted on electronic changeable copy signs and theatre
marquees.
   (f)   Electronic Messaging Center (EMC) Signs.
      (1)   The message display area cannot change more than once per ten-
seconds; any sign that changes its message more frequently is considered a
flashing sign.
      (2)   Only one EMC sign is permitted per developed parcel.
      (3)   The use of a video display or special effects such as, but not
limited to, scrolling, fading, wiping, flashing, changing colors or exploding
is prohibited.
      (4)   The sign cannot create glare or have characteristics that impair
the vision of motorists or create a nuisance for surrounding properties. Glare
must be reduced and/or minimized in such a manner as to maintain an appropriate
level of contrast during the day. To reduce driver distraction at night and
light trespass into residential areas, electronic signs must have an automatic
dimmer to control brightness, which cannot be manually overridden.
   (g)   Canopies and Awnings.
      (1)   Canopies and awnings are permitted around the entire perimeter of a
building. However, canopy and awning signs are only permitted to be placed in
the bottom seventy-five percent of the awning.
      (2)   The scale, design, and color of the canopy and awning sign must be
compatible with the architectural features of the building, including the color
of the building.
      (3)   Awnings cannot extend more than six-feet in front of the building.
   (h)   Height Clearance. Canopy, awning, marquee, and projecting signs must
maintain a minimum eight-foot clear space distance from the bottom of the
structure to the grade or sidewalk.
   (i)   Landscaping. The area surrounding freestanding signs must be
landscaped to match the design characteristics of the site (only for new
signs).
   (j)   Murals. Murals are permitted in all commercial and industrial zoning
districts, only after review and approval by City Council. If the mural is
located within the downtown development district, the Downtown Development
Authority (DDA) must first review the proposed mural and make a recommendation
to City Council on the ultimate approval or denial. In reviewing a mural, the
following criteria must be applied:
      (1)   Be well designed and incorporate high-quality materials that
enhance the overall appearance of the site and will not adversely impact safe
and efficient movement of vehicles and pedestrians.
      (2)   Colors, though vibrant, must be complementary and harmonious with
the exterior colors of the building structure, as well as consistent with the
chosen theme.
      (3)   Its design and location cannot obscure or detract from the
significant architectural features of the building structure; nor should the
building's architecture be altered to accommodate the mural.
      (4)   Routine maintenance of the mural is the responsibility of the
building owner where the artwork is located. If, for whatever reason, the mural
falls into disrepair, the building owner will be notified in writing and
required to make necessary repairs per the City’s policy for correcting
violations. If the repairs are not made within the specified time, the City
reserves the right to repair or remove the mural at the owner's expense.
   (k)   Chapter 838. Additional standards per
Chapter 838  for marihuana establishments may also apply.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1222.06   MEASURING SIGNS.

IMAGES/0-0-0-8057.jpg]
 
   (a)   Signable Area. Signs are measured as the area within a single,
continuous perimeter composed of the smallest square, circle, rectangle,
triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the
writing, representation, emblem, or other display. This includes any frame or
other material or color, forming an integral part of the background of the
display or used to differentiate the sign from the background against which it
is placed.
      (1)   The support structure necessary to support the sign is excluded
from this calculation.
      (2)   Signage for multi-tenant buildings only calculates the wall length
of individual tenant space, and not the building as a whole.
   (b)   Height. The height of a sign is calculated by measuring the distance
from the base of the sign at grade, to the top of the highest attached framed
component of the sign.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1222.07   RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT SIGNS.

(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1222.11   TEMPORARY SIGNS.
   Temporary signs must meet the following:
   (a)   Sign Permit. Temporary signs on private property are allowed only upon
the issuance of a temporary sign permit by the Building and Engineering
Department.
   (b)   Display Period.
      (1)   Each lot or single tenant building is allowed a maximum of three
temporary sign permits within a twelve-month period. Each permit is for a
maximum period of four weeks. In the instance where more than one business is
located on a lot or in a building, structure or shopping center, each business
is permitted two temporary sign permits within a twelve-month period.
      (2)   One temporary banner pertaining to the opening or “Grand Opening”
of a new commercial use may be temporarily affixed to the commercial building
or the new business for a period of not more than four weeks. The length of
such banner cannot exceed twenty-five-feet.
      (3)   Portable temporary commercial signs (such as A-frames) can be
placed outside only during the hours when open to the public and must be stored
indoors at all other times.
   (c)   Right-of-way. No sign can be placed, strung, or located within the
right-of-way.
   (d)   Area and Height. Signs have a maximum surface area of thirty-two
square feet (except for A-frame signs, which are limited to twelve square feet
per side) and a maximum height of six-feet measured from grade (except for A-
frame signs, which are limited to a maximum height of five feet). Temporary
balloon signs are exempt from these area and height requirements unless
balloons are included as an integral part of the requested temporary sign.
Signs cannot impede or endanger pedestrian or automobile traffic, including
maintaining required clear corner vision.
   (e)   Materials. Signs must be constructed of a durable material designed to
withstand normal weather conditions. Wooden signs must be constructed of a
pressure treated wood that is acceptable to the Building Official and painted
or stained with an exterior grade of paint/stain. Property owners must receive
a permit as described in this chapter prior to the erection of any temporary
commercial signs and must follow all applicable requirements as described
below. Portable ground signs are considered temporary commercial signs.
   (f)   Unsafe Signs. Any temporary sign found by the Building and Engineering
Department to be in an unsafe condition must be removed by the sign owner
within three business days after receipt of written notice.
   (g)   Removal. Signs must be removed immediately at the end of the display
period provided for in this chapter. If temporary signs are not promptly
removed at the end of the display period, a written violation notice will be
issued by the City and a cumulative daily fee shall be assessed to the
temporary sign permit holder as set forth in Chapter 210 until such sign is
removed.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1222.12   CONSTRUCTION, MAINTENANCE, AND REMOVAL.
   (a)   Construction and Fastenings. Signs must be construed of durable
material and in conformance with the requirements and specifications of the
current Michigan Building Code. All signs must be erected in such a manner and
with such materials to remain safe and secure during the period of use and all
bolts, cables, and other parts of such signs must be kept painted and free from
corrosion. Any defect due to the fault of the erector must be repaired by the
owner.
   (b)   Maintenance. All signs and their components, including anchors,
braces, and supports must be maintained in a condition of good repair. The
Building Official is authorized to cause the removal of any sign, at the
expense of the owner, that is deemed to be in disrepair or an immediate peril
to persons or property. This does not alter the effect of Section
1222.13 : Non-Conforming Signs, which prohibits the replacement of non-
conforming signs.
      (1)   If a sign is found to be insecure, illegible, fading, in a state of
disrepair, or the message portion of the sign is removed leaving only the
support structures, written notice will be given to the property owner, agent
or person having interest in the building or property on which the sign is
located.
      (2)   Improvements, corrections, or removal of the sign must be completed
within thirty-days of receipt of the written notice.

1224.07   STANDARDS FOR SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   Site plans which relate to all uses or structures (permitted and special
land uses) may not be approved unless the Planning Commission and City Council
affirmatively determines that each of the following standards have been
fulfilled:
   (a)   Site Use(s) and Coordination. The relationship between the proposed
use(s) on the site must be designed and located so that the development is
aesthetically pleasing and harmonious with adjacent existing and prospective
development of contiguous properties and the general planning area. All site
features, including vehicle and pedestrian circulation, building orientation,
landscaping, lighting, utilities, recreation facilities, and open spaces must
coordinate with adjacent properties and uses.
   (b)   Site Design. The location and use of all structures and elements of
the site must be harmoniously and efficiently organized in relation to
topography, parcel configuration, adjacent properties, traffic operations,
adjacent streets and driveways, pedestrian access, and the type and size of
buildings. The site design also ensures that adequate light and air are
preserved so as not to be detrimental to the orderly and harmonious development
of the community.
   (c)   Preservation of Site Features. To the extent feasible, the site must
conserve natural, cultural, historical, and architectural site features,
including, but not limited to, architecturally or historically significant
buildings, wetlands, topography, and wooded areas.
   (d)   Impact upon Public Services. Utility services must not exceed the
existing or planned capacity of such services and must be developed in the best
interest of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. The
development must be designed and located so that public services, including
streets and sidewalks, police and fire protection, and public schools have
sufficient capacity to properly serve the development, and so that such
services will not be adversely affected by the proposed development.
   (e)   Vehicular Access and Circulation. The vehicular circulation system
must be in the best interest of the public health, safety, and welfare in
regards to on-site circulation, on-site parking, the overall circulation of the
neighborhood and community, egress/ingress to the site, vehicular turning
movements related to parking areas, loading areas, street intersections, street
gradient, site distance and hazards to the normal flow of traffic both on- and
off-site, as referenced in
Chapter 1220 .
   (f)   Parking and Loading. The parking pattern proposed shall be in the best
interest of the public health, safety, and welfare regarding size, layout and
quantity, and the location of parking and loading facilities will not be
detrimental to nearby developments, properties, or public streets.
   (g)   Pedestrian Access and Circulation. The pedestrian circulation system
must be in the best interest of the public health, safety, and welfare
regarding onsite circulation and the overall pedestrian circulation of the
neighborhood and community.
   (h)   Emergency Access and Vulnerability to Hazards. All sites and buildings
must be designed to allow convenient and direct emergency access of the Fire
and Police Departments.
   (i)   Landscaping, Screening, and Buffering. Landscaping, screening and
buffer areas must be appropriate and of such size, location, height and
quantity to ensure the development will not be objectionable to nearby
development or properties by reason of noise, fumes, flash of lights from
automobiles or other lighting, interference with an adequate supply of light
and air, an increase in the danger of fire, or other public safety hazard.
Screening must be provided in a manner that adequately buffers adjacent land
uses and screens off-street parking, mechanical appurtenances, loading zones,
and storage areas from adjacent residential areas and rights-of-way.
   (j)   Building Design and Architecture. Building design and architecture
must relate to and be harmonious with the surrounding neighborhood in terms of
texture, scale, mass, proportion, materials, and color.
   (k)   Exterior Lighting. All exterior lighting fixtures must be designed,
arranged and shielded to minimize glare and light pollution, prevent night
blindness and vision impairments, and maximize security.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1224.08   CONFORMITY TO AN APPROVED SITE PLAN.
   (a)   Property, which is the subject of site plan approval, must be
developed in strict compliance with the approved site plan, inclusive of any
amendments, which have received the approval of the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Approval of the site plan is valid for a period of one-year. If a
building permit has not been obtained and on-site development commenced within
one-year, the site plan approval is void and a new application for site plan
approval is required and new approval obtained before any construction or
grading is commenced on the site. An extension request may be considered up to
one additional year by the Planning Department.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1224.09   AMENDMENT TO AN APPROVED SITE PLAN.
   (a)   Minor revisions to an approved site plan may be administratively
reviewed by the Departments of Planning and Engineering, provided that such
changes do not materially alter the approved site design, intensity of use or
demand for public services. The Departments of Planning and Engineering must
verify that the proposed development complies with all requirements of this
Zoning Code.
   (b)   Where a mutual agreement cannot be reached, or where, in the opinion
of the Departments of Community Development and Engineering, the proposed
development warrants a more intensive review, formal application for site plan
review by the Planning Commission and City Council is required.

(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1225.03   SPECIAL LAND USE CRITERIA.
   For the Planning Commission to grant approval, a special land use must:
   (a)   Be consistent with, and promote, the intent and purpose of this Zoning
Code.
   (b)   Be of such location, size, density, and character as to be compatible
with adjacent uses of land and the orderly development of the subject zoning
district and adjacent zoning districts.
   (c)   Not have a substantially detrimental effect upon neighboring property.
   (d)   Be reasonably compatible with the natural environment of the subject
property and surrounding area.
   (e)   Not unduly interfere with provision of adequate light or air, nor
overcrowd land, that would diminish the health, safety, and welfare of the
City.
   (f)   Not interfere with, or unduly burden, the water supply facilities,
sewage collection and disposal systems, park and recreational facilities, and
other public services. The City cannot bear unreasonable costs to improve
infrastructure to serve the proposed use.
   (g)   Be such that traffic to, from, and on the premises and the assembly of
persons relating to such use will not be hazardous, considering, among other
things: safe and convenient routes for pedestrian traffic, the relationship of
the proposed use to streets and intersections, and the general character and
intensity of the existing and potential development of the area.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1225.04   BASIS OF DECISION.
   (a)   The Planning Commission may deny, approve, or approve with conditions,
a special land use.
   (b)   Special land use approval expires one-year from approval unless a
building permit has been issued on the site in accordance with an approved site
plan. The Planning Department may grant one, twelve-month extension of a
special land use upon demonstration that construction is likely to commence
within that period.
   (c)   Once established, an approved special land use runs with the land,
unless the use is specifically determined to be temporary in nature. When
approval is given for a use which is temporary in nature, a deadline must be
established for the use to cease operations, and so stated in the meeting
minutes.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1225.05   CONDITIONS.
   The Commission may impose reasonable conditions in conjunction with approval
of a special land use; the meeting minutes must contain a record of all
conditions attached to a special land use approval.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1225.06   EXPANSIONS AND CHANGES IN USE.
   An expansion of a use or a change in use of any approved special land use
requires that a new special land use permit; the procedure is the same as for
the original application.

(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1227.04   BASIS OF DECISION AND CRITERIA.
   In considering any amendment, the Planning Commission and City Council must
consider the following criteria. The City may consider other factors that are
applicable to the application, but not listed below.
   (a)   Consistency with the goals, policies and objectives of Wayne’s Master
Plan and other City or regional planning documents. If conditions have changed
since the Master Plan was adopted, consistency with recent development trends
in the area may be considered.
   (b)   Consistency with the intent and purpose of Wayne’s Zoning Code.
   (c)   The capability of the street system to safely and efficiently
accommodate the expected traffic generated by uses permitted in the requested
zoning district.
   (d)   The capacity of the city’s utilities and services sufficient to
accommodate the uses permitted in the requested district without compromising
the health, safety, and welfare of Wayne.
   (e)   If a map amendment (rezoning) is requested, the following criteria
also applies:
      (1)   Compatibility of the site’s physical, hydrological, and
environmental features with the uses permitted in the proposed zoning district.
      (2)   Compatibility of all the potential uses allowed in the proposed
zoning district with surrounding uses and zoning in terms of land suitability,
density, nature of use, traffic impacts, aesthetics, and infrastructure.
      (3)   The requested zoning district will be compatible in relationship to
surrounding zoning districts, and future construction can meet the dimensional
regulations for the requested zoning district.
      (4)   If requested to allow for a specific use, rezoning the land more
appropriate than amending the list of permitted or special land uses in the
current zoning district to allow the use.
      (5)   Will not create an isolated or incompatible zone in the City.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1227.05   CONDITIONAL REZONING PROCESS.
   (a)   Intent. The City recognizes that, in certain instances, it would be
advantageous to both Wayne and to a property owner seeking rezoning, if the
property owner proposes certain conditions and limitations as part of their
rezoning petition. Therefore, the City provides a process consistent with the
provision of Section 405 of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act (PA 110 of 2006),
as amended, to permit property owners to offer conditions regarding a use and/
or development of land as part of the rezoning request. A conditional rezoning
is intended to accomplish, among other things, the objectives of the Zoning
Code and the Master Plan.
   (b)   Definitions. The following definitions apply in the interpretation of
this section:
      (1)   “Applicant” means the property owner, or a person acting with the
written and signed authorization of the property owner to make application
under this section.
      (2)   “Conditional rezoning agreement” (CRA) means a written agreement
approved and executed by the City and property owner setting forth the
conditions attached to the rezoning pursuant to Michigan Zoning Enabling Act
(PA 110 of 2006), as amended, and any other terms mutually agreed upon by the
parties relative to land for which the City has approved a conditional
rezoning.
      (3)   “Conditional rezoning plan” means a plan of the property, which is
the subject of a conditional rezoning, with conditions, prepared by a Michigan
licensed civil engineer or architect, that may show the location, size, height,
design, architecture, or other feature for and/or of buildings, structures,
improvements, and features on, and in some cases adjacent to, the property. The
details to be offered for inclusion within the conditional rezoning plan are
determined by the applicant, subject to approval of the City Council after
recommendation by the Planning Commission.
      (4)   “Rezoning conditions” means conditions regarding the development
and use of property proposed by the applicant and approved by the City.
      (5)   “Rezoning” means the amendment of this Zoning Code to change the
Zoning Map classification on property from its existing district to a new
district classification.
   (c)   Authorization and Eligibility.
      (1)   The standards of this section grant an applicant the option of
voluntarily proposing conditions for the development and use of property in
connection with a submission of a rezoning petition. Such conditions may be
proposed at the time the application for rezoning is filed, or at a subsequent
point in the process of review of the proposed rezoning.
      (2)   To be eligible for consideration, an applicant must propose a
rezoning of property to a new zoning district classification, and must, as part
of such proposal, voluntarily offer certain site-specific conditions (to be set
forth in a conditional rezoning agreement) that are stricter or limiting than
the regulations that would apply to the land under the proposed new zoning
district. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   The location, size, height, or other measure for and/or of
buildings, structures, improvements, setbacks, landscaping, buffers, design,
architecture, and other physical features of the proposed development.
         B.   Specification of maximum density or intensity of development and/
or use (i.e., units per acre, maximum usable floor area, or hours of
operation).
         C.   Preservation of open space and/or natural features.
         D.   Improvements to address traffic issues, including paving, and/or
substantial improvements to or funding of improvements to roads to the benefit
of the entire City.
         E.   Site improvements such as signage, lighting, landscaping, and
exterior building materials, above and beyond what would otherwise be required.
         F.   Limitations on permissible uses of the property.
         G.   Any other conditions that are voluntarily proposed by the
applicant.
   (d)   Review Criteria. A conditional rezoning may only be approved if it
meets the following criteria:
      (1)   Furthers the goals and objectives of the Master Plan.
      (2)   The use of the subject property is in conformity with all
regulations governing development and use within the proposed zoning district,
including, without limitation, permitted uses, lot area and width, setbacks,
height limits, buffers, open space, and density; provided, however, the
following apply:
         A.   Development and use of the property is subject to the more
restrictive requirements shown or specified in the conditional rezoning
agreement and supersedes all inconsistent regulations otherwise applicable
under the Zoning Code.
         B.   City Council is authorized to grant modifications to the strict
terms of the Zoning Code governing dimensional requirements on the property;
provided, such authorization to grant modifications is conditioned upon the
City Council finding that each Zoning Code provision sought to be modified will
result in an enhancement of the development that is in the public interest, and
that approving the modification is consistent with the Master Plan and with the
surrounding area.
      (3)   Results in an enhancement to the subject area, as compared to the
existing zoning, and that such enhancement would be unlikely to be achieved or
would not be assured in the absence of the use of a conditional rezoning.
      (4)   As compared to the existing zoning and considering site-specific
conditions and/or the proposed land uses, it is in the public interest to grant
a conditional rezoning. In determining whether a proposed application is in the
public interest, the benefits which would reasonably be expected to accrue from
the proposal must be balanced against and be found to clearly outweigh the
reasonably foreseeable detriments, taking into consideration best practices in
planning, engineering, environmental and other principles.
      (5)   Public services are available and capable of serving the proposed
development that will occur as a result of the conditional rezoning without
negatively impacting the delivery of public services to other properties in
Wayne, or the conditions ensure that public services are sufficient to serve
both the site and other Wayne properties.
      (6)   The offered condition(s) are likely to be enforceable.
      (7)   Does not have the same effect as a use variance.
      (8)   Does not relieve the applicant of the responsibility of securing
any applicable site plan, plat, or condominium approvals. Special land use
approvals, if permitted as part of the CRA, do not have to be separately
considered, noticed, and approved.
   (e)   Effect of Approval.
      (1)   Approval of the conditional rezoning confirms only the rezoning of
the property, subject to any conditions reflected in the conditional rezoning
agreement. Any applicable site plan, plat, condominium, or variance approvals
is required before any improvements to the property may be undertaken.
      (2)   If approved, the zoning district classification of the subject
property must consist of the district to which the property has been rezoned,
accompanied by a reference to “CR, Conditional Rezoning”. The Zoning Map must
specify the new zoning district, plus a reference to “CR”. Use of the property
so classified and approved must comply with the conditions set forth in the
CRA. No development or use of the land inconsistent with the CRA is permitted.
   (f)   Compliance.
      (1)   Any person who establishes a development or commences a use upon
land that is conditional rezoned must continuously operate and maintain the
development or use in compliance with all of the conditions set forth in the
conditional rezoning agreement. Failure to comply constitutes a violation of
this Zoning Code and deemed a nuisance per se and subject to judicial abatement
as provided by law.
      (2)   No permit or approval may be granted under this Zoning Code for any
use or development that is contrary to an applicable conditional rezoning
agreement.
   (g)   Period of Approval.
      (1)   Conditional rezoning approval expires one-year from the effective
date of the rezoning, unless substantial progress towards obtaining site plan
and other required approvals has been made and expires two-years from the
effective date of the rezoning, unless development of the property is
substantially started and proceeds diligently and in good faith as required by
the Zoning Code to completion.
      (2)   In the event substantial progress towards obtaining site plan and
other required approvals has not commenced within one-year and bona fide
development has not commenced within two-years from the effective date of the
rezoning, the conditional rezoning and agreement is void and of no effect.
      (3)   The applicant may apply for a one-year extension. The request must
be submitted to the City in writing before the approval time limit expires. The
applicant must demonstrate why an extension should be granted and that there is
a strong likelihood that the development or use will commence within the period
of extension and proceed diligently to completion. An extension request may be
considered by City Council following a recommendation by the Planning
Commission. An extension request may be considered up to one additional year by
the Planning Department.
      (4)   If the conditional rezoning becomes void in the manner provided in
this section, the following procedures apply:
         A.   The applicant may seek a new rezoning of the property within
thirty-days of the expiration of the period of approval.
         B.   If no application is made for a new rezoning of the property, the
land reverts to its former zoning classification.
   (h)   Conditional Rezoning Agreement Requirements. A CRA must be executed
between the applicant and the City at the time of City Council approval, and at
a minimum, contain the following:
      (1)   Identification of the requested zoning district and a listing of
the conditions offered by the applicant.
      (2)   A statement acknowledging that the conditional rezoning was
proposed by the applicant, and further agreement and acknowledgment that the
conditions and agreement are authorized by all applicable state and federal law
and constitution, and that the agreement is valid and was entered into on a
voluntary basis and represents a permissible exercise of authority by the City.
      (3)   Agreement and understanding that the subject property cannot be
developed or used in a manner inconsistent with the CRA.
      (4)   Agreement and understanding that the approval and CRA is binding
upon and to the benefit of the property owner and City, and their respective
heirs, successors, assigns, and transferees.
      (5)   The date upon which the conditional rezoning becomes void. If the
City Council grants an extension of approval, a new conditional rezoning
agreement with the new expiration date must be recorded.
      (6)   Agreement and understanding that each of the requirements in the
CRA represents a necessary and reasonable measure which, when considered with
all other conditions and requirements, is roughly proportional to the increased
impact created by the use represented in the approved conditional rezoning,
taking into consideration the changed zoning district classification and the
specific use authorization granted.
      (7)   A legal description of the subject property.
      (8)   Development regulations impacted by the conditional rezoning,
including but not limited to density, setbacks, height, site coverage, signs,
parking, architecture, etc.
      (9)   Revocation of approval provisions returning the property to its
original zoning designation if the applicant violates the terms of the
conditional rezoning agreement.
      (10)   A conditional rezoning plan may be included as an exhibit to the
agreement and may show the conceptual layout of the proposed development or
use, along with any other information deemed relevant by the applicant.
Inclusion of such a plan as an exhibit shall not replace the requirement for
site plan, subdivision, condominium, or variance review and approval.
   (i)   Amendment of a Conditional Rezoning Agreement. Amendment of a CRA must
be submitted, reviewed, and approved in the same manner as a new conditional
rezoning application.
   (j)   Recordation of a Conditional Rezoning Agreement. A conditional
rezoning becomes effective following publication in the manner provided by law,
and, after recordation of the conditional rezoning agreement with the Wayne
County Register of Deeds.
   (k)   Termination. City Council is the only body with the authority to
terminate a CRA. The consideration to terminate the agreement must be for
reasons of expiration of the agreement, discovery of false information upon
which the initial approval was based, or the existence or discovery of new
information that alters the viability of the approved rezoning. The termination
must comply with any applicable provisions of this Zoning Code and/or the CRA.

(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1229.06   VARIANCES.
   (a)   Dimensional Variances. To authorize a non-use or dimensional variances
from the strict applications of the provisions of this Zoning Code, each of the
following criteria must be met:
      (1)   There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances applying to
the property that do not apply generally to other properties in the same zoning
classification. Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances include:
         A.   Exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific
property on the effective date of this Zoning Code, or amendment thereto.
         B.   Exceptional topographic conditions.
         C.   Any other physical situation on the land, building or structure
deemed by the Zoning Board of Appeals to be extraordinary.
         D.   By reason of the use or development of the property immediately
adjoining the property in question.
      (2)   Such a variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of
a substantial property right similar to that possessed by other properties in
the same zoning district and in the vicinity (possible increased financial
return is not of itself, sufficient to warrant a variance).
      (3)   Authorization of a variance will not be of substantial detriment to
adjacent property and will not materially impair the intent and purpose of this
Zoning Code or the public health, safety, and general welfare of the community.
      (4)   The condition or situation of the specific piece of property or the
intended use of said property for which the variance is sought, is not of so
general or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably practical the formulation
of a general regulation for such condition or situation, a part of this Zoning
Code.
   (b)   Lots of Record – Determination Required. The granting of a variance
for minimum lot size (square feet) and lot width (feet) is not required when
the subject lot is a lot of record, and the Board has determined the property
to be a buildable zoning lot.
   (c)   Use Variance. No variance can be made in the use of land, and the
Board does not consider use variance requests.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1229.07   CONDITIONS.
   The Board may impose reasonable conditions in conjunction with the approval
of a variance to ensure that public services and facilities are adequate, to
protect the natural environment and conserve natural resources, to ensure
compatibility with adjacent uses of land, and to promote the use of land, in a
socially and economically desirable manner. Conditions must meet the
requirements of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act (PA 110 of 2006), as amended
and must be recorded in the record of the approval action and remain unchanged
except upon the mutual consent of the Board and the landowner.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1229.08   PERIOD OF VALIDITY.
   (a)   No decision of the Board permitting the erection of a structure may be
valid for a period longer than one-year unless a building permit for such
erection or alteration is obtained within such year and such erection or
alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms
of such permit.
   (b)   No decision of the Board permitting a use of a structure or premises
shall be valid for a period longer than one-year unless such use is established
within such year; provided, however, that where such use permitted is dependent
upon the erection or alteration of a structure such decision shall continue in
force and effect if a building permit for such erection or alteration is
started and proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms of such permit.
   (c)   The Board may grant an extension of a variance upon the demonstration,
to the satisfaction of the Board that the delay in obtaining building permits
was not caused by the action or negligence of the applicant.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1229.09   FINAL DECISION AND APPEALS.
   The decision of the Board is final. An appeal of a decision of the Board
must be taken to the Wayne County Circuit Court within a time period specified
in the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act (PA 110 of 2006), as amended and by such
persons permitted by state statue.

CHAPTER 1230
Non-conformities
1230.01   Continuation.
1230.02   Non-conforming uses.
1230.03   Non-confirming buildings.
1230.04   Non-conforming lots.

1230.08   Unsafe structures.
1230.09   Removal by condemnation.
1230.01   CONTINUATION.
   This chapter is applied in compliance with the policy of the State of
Michigan that non-conformities should gradually be eliminated and restricted to
the same area of land and level of intensity at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this Zoning Code.
   (a)   Lots, buildings, and uses of land and structures that were lawful
before this Zoning Code was adopted or amended and which would be prohibited,
regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Zoning Code, or its future
amendments, may continue until they are discontinued, damaged, or removed,
subject to the provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   Non-conformities are declared to be incompatible with the current or
intended use of land, lots, and buildings in the district in which they are
located. Non-conformities cannot be enlarged, expanded, or extended except as
provided in this chapter. Non-conformities cannot be used as grounds for adding
other lots, structures, or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
   (c)   Once conforming, no building or land is permitted to revert to a non-
conformity.
   (d)   Any non-conformity that cannot be proved to have legally existed prior
to the effective date of this Zoning Code is in violation of this Zoning Code
and must be brought into compliance or discontinued.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1230.02   NON-CONFORMING USES.
   Where, on the effective date of this Zoning Code, a lawful use of land
exists that is no longer permitted, such use may be continued, subject to the
following:
   (a)   A non-conforming use of land cannot be enlarged, expanded, or extended
to occupy a greater area of land.
   (b)   No accessory use or structure can be established as incidental to a
non-conforming use.
   (c)   No non-conforming use of land can be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the land on which it is located.
   (d)   No non-conforming use can be extended to displace a conforming use.
   (e)   If a non-conforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of
more than six-months (consecutive), the use cannot be re-established, and
future uses must conform to the regulations of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1230.03   NON-CONFORMING BUILDINGS.
   Where a lawful building exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Code that could not be built under the terms of this
Zoning Code by reason of dimensional regulations, the building may be continued
so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following:
   (a)   A building may be enlarged or altered in a way which does not increase
its non-conformity. For the purposes of this Zoning Code, increasing the height
of a structure with a non-conforming setback is considered increasing the non-
conformity, and is not permitted.
   (b)   A non-conforming building may not be reconstructed or structurally
altered during its life to an extent exceeding in aggregate fifty percent of
the assessed value of the building unless such building is changed to a
conforming use.
   (c)   Restoration of Damaged Buildings.
      (1)   The reconstruction, repair, rebuilding, or continued use of any
non-conforming building damaged by fire, collapse, explosion, or act of God
wherein the expense of such reconstruction does not exceed the assessed
valuation of the building at the time such damage occurred is permitted,
provided there is no increase to its non-conformity. However, every effort
shall be made to rebuild or repair such non-conforming building in complete
conformity with this Zoning Code.
      (2)   When any non-conforming building is destroyed by any means to the
extent of more than the assessed valuation, said structure or use cannot be
rebuilt, restored, or reoccupied for any purpose except in conformity with the
provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (d)   Non-conforming single-family residential structures are exempt from
this section. However, application for rebuilding must be made within one year
from the date of damage or destruction.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1230.04   NON-CONFORMING LOTS.
   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-
family dwelling and accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of
record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code,
provided that all structures on the lot meet the required setbacks and that the
Zoning Board of Appeals has determined the lot to be buildable per Section
1229.06.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1230.05   COMPLETION OF PENDING PROJECTS.
   To avoid undue hardship, this Zoning Code does not require a change in the
plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual
construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Code and upon which actual building construction has
been diligently carried on. Actual construction includes the placing of
construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent
manner; except that where demolition or removal of an existing building has
been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal
is deemed to be actual construction, provided that work is diligently carried
on until completion of the building involved.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1230.06   CHANGE OF TENANCY OR OWNERSHIP.
   A change of tenancy, ownership, or management of any existing non-conforming
uses of land, or structure, is permitted.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1230.07   EXPANSION OF A NON-CONFORMITY BY SPECIAL USE.
   A non-conformity may be expanded upon granting of special land use. In
determining whether to grant approval, the Planning Commission must apply the
following criteria:
   (a)   The enlargement or increase or extension is reasonable based upon a
consideration of the area of the original non-conformity.
   (b)   The enlargement or increase or extension does not substantially
interfere with the use of other properties in the surrounding area for the uses
for which they have been zoned, or with the use of such other properties in
compliance with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (c)   The enlargement, increase, or extension does not significantly
compromise the ability of the City to effectuate the goals and purposes of its
Master Plan.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1230.08   UNSAFE STRUCTURES.
   Any structure or portion hereof declared to be unsafe by the City may be
restored to a safe condition.
(Ord. 2023-01. Passed 2-7-23.)
1230.09   REMOVAL BY CONDEMNATION.
   When, in the opinion of Council, an area will be improved by the removal of
a non-conforming use or structure, Council may, by resolution, determine to
cause such removal by purchase, condemnation or otherwise and proceed in
accordance with the City Charter or state law and may pay the cost and expense
thereof from the General Fund or proceed to assess the costs thereof by special
assessment against the area especially benefitted in accordance with any
special assessment ordinance of the City which may be applicable.

(Ord. 11. Passed 4-21-64.)
1412.07 INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   In General. The Electrical Inspection Authority, or his or her
authorized assistants, shall have and are hereby given jurisdiction, subject to
review as hereinafter provided, over the inspection of all electrical
installations, including changes, repairs and additions, and may make such
other inspections and tests after repairs or changes are deemed necessary for
safety and for the enforcement of this chapter.
   (b)   Right of Entry. The Electrical Inspection Authority and his or her
authorized assistants shall have the right, during reasonable hours, to enter
any building or premises in the City without hindrance for the purpose of
inspecting or testing an installation of electrical wiring, electrical devices
and/or electrical material. The person having control or management of
equipment covered by this chapter shall provide such assistance as is required
by the inspector in making the inspection.
   (c)   Installation Notice. Immediately upon the completion of the wiring of
any building, it shall be the duty of the person installing the same to notify
the Electrical Inspection Authority, who shall notify the Electrical Inspector
to inspect the installation as soon as possible. If it is found to be fully in
compliance with this chapter and does not constitute a hazard to life and
property, he or she shall issue to such person, for delivery to the owner, a
certificate of inspection, authorizing connection to the electrical service and
the turning on of the current.
   (d)   Power of Condemnation. Whenever any electrical device, wiring or
material is found to be unsafe or in a condition so as to be dangerous to life
or property, the Electrical Inspection Authority and his or her authorized
assistants are hereby authorized to condemn and cause the turning off of all
electric supply and to cut or disconnect, in cases of emergency, any wiring
causing such hazard, and no such unit or material thereof shall thereafter be
used until put in a safe condition and approved by the Department of
Engineering and Building.
   (e)   Condemnation Warning Tags. Whenever any electrical device, wiring or
material has been condemned, the Electrical Inspection Authority shall place
thereon a warning tag listing the cause for the condemnation.
   (f)   Re-Inspection. The Electrical Inspection Authority, or his or her
authorized assistants, may make, periodically, a thorough re-inspection of the
installation in buildings of all electrical wiring, electrical devices and
material now installed or that may hereafter be installed in the City. When the
installation of any such wiring, devices and/or material is found to be in a
dangerous or unsafe condition, the person owning, using or operating the same
shall be notified and shall make the necessary repairs or changes required to
place such wiring, devices and material in a safe condition and shall have such
work completed within fifteen days, or within such longer period specified by
the Electrical Inspection Authority in such notice. The Electrical Inspection
Authority is hereby authorized to disconnect or order the discontinuance of
electrical service to such wiring, devices and/or material so found to be
defectively installed, until the installation of such wiring, devices and
material has been made safe as directed by the Electrical Inspector.
   (g)   Certificate of Inspection. No certificate of inspection shall be
issued unless the electrical installation is in strict conformity with the
provisions of this chapter, the statutes of the State, and the rules and
regulations issued by the Michigan Public Service Commission under the
authority of State statutes, and unless it is in conformity with approved
methods of construction for safety to persons and property. Compliance with the
provisions of this chapter, including the standards adopted in Section 1412.04,
shall be prima-facie evidence of such approved methods.
   (h)   Approved Materials. No person shall install or use any electrical
device, apparatus or equipment designed for attachment to, or installation of,
any electrical circuit or system for heat, light or power, which device,
apparatus or equipment is not of good design and construction and safe and
adequate for its intended use. The Electrical Inspection Authority or his or
her authorized assistants shall have the power to disapprove the use or
installation of devices not fulfilling these requirements. The devices,
apparatus and equipment approved by such generally recognized authorities as
the United States Bureau of Standards, Electrical Testing Laboratories of New
York or Underwriters' Laboratories shall be held to have approval of the
Electrical Inspector, unless explicitly disapproved by the Authority for
reasons of faulty design and poor construction involving danger to persons and/
or property. It shall be the duty of the Electrical Inspection Authority or his
or her authorized assistants, from time to time, to inspect devices, apparatus
and equipment offered to the public for use in installations to see that such
items conform to the above requirements.
   (i)   Records of Inspection. The Electrical Inspection Authority or his or
her authorized assistants shall keep complete records of all permits issued and
inspections made and other official work performed under this chapter.

or his or her authorized assistants under the provisions of this chapter shall
expire by limitation and become null and void if the work authorized by such
permit is not commenced within sixty days from the date of such permit, or if
the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned at any time after
the work is commenced for a period of sixty days. Before such work can be
recommenced, a new permit shall be first obtained to do so, and the fee
therefor shall be one-half the amount required for a new permit for such work,
provided that no changes have been made, will be made or are required to be
made by the Electrical Inspection Authority in the original plans and
specifications for such work, and provided, further, that such suspension or
abandonment has not exceeded one year. All re-issued permits must comply with
new requirements, ordinances and fee changes.

1470.01 PURPOSE.
   It is found and declared in the areas of the City that are or may become
blighted with the resulting impairment of taxable values upon which, in large
part, municipal revenues depend, that such blighted areas are detrimental to
the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens and to the economic
welfare of the municipality; that in order to improve and maintain the general
character of the municipality it is necessary to rehabilitate such blighted
areas; that the conditions found in blighted areas cannot be remedied by the
ordinary operations of private enterprise with due regard to the general
welfare of the public, without public participation. The purposes of this
ordinance are to rehabilitate such areas by eliminating blight and blight
factors within all areas of the City for the protection of the health, safety,
morals and general welfare of the municipality, to preserve existing values of
other properties within or adjacent to such areas and all other areas of the
City, and to preserve the taxable value of the property within such areas and
all other areas of the City. It is expressly recognized that blight is
observable at different stages of severity, and that moderate blight unremedied
creates a strong probability that severe blight will follow. Therefore, the
conditions that constitute blight are to be broadly construed to permit a
municipality to make an early identification of problems and to take early
remedial action to correct a demonstrated pattern of deterioration and to
prevent worsening of blight conditions.
(Ord. 2001-16. Passed 6-5-01.)

   (a)   The City Manager or the Manager's designee shall enforce this article
and shall periodically inspect the City for blight or blighting factors within
the City.
   (b)   The owner or occupant of the property upon which any of the causes of
blight or blighting factors as set forth in this chapter may be notified in
writing to remove or eliminate said causes of blight or blighting factors from
such property within seven days after service of the notice. Such removal
notice shall be serviced by first-class mail or in person. If efforts to serve
the occupants or owner personally or by first-class mail are unsuccessful,
service shall be deemed sufficient if the written notice is posted in a
conspicuous location on the property in question. Additional time to remove the
blight or blighting factors may be granted by the enforcement officers when
bonafide efforts to remove or eliminate such blight or blighting factors are in
progress. The owner or occupant of the property who has received the notice
may, within the seven day period, request a hearing with the City Manager or
the Manager's designee, provided said request for hearing is in writing and
delivered timely. The hearing shall be conducted within ten days after receipt
of the request for the hearing and the hearing shall be held before a tribunal
consisting of the City Manager or the Manager's designee, the head Building
Official, or Building Official's designee, and the City Engineer, or the
Engineer's designee. If the tribunal noted herein determines that the blight or
blighting factors do exist, it shall advise the owner or occupant of the
building in question at the conclusion of said hearing and shall further advise
the owner/occupant that they have seven days from the conclusion of the hearing
to take the required actions to abate the blight or blighting factors.
   (c)   Failure to comply by the owner or the occupant with a notice provided
or at the conclusion of the hearing for the removal or abatement of the blight
or blighting factors within the time prescribed shall constitute a misdemeanor
as noted herein.
   (d)   If the owner or occupant neglects or refuses to abate the blight or
blighting factors upon which they have received notice and had the hearing, if
requested, then and in that event, the City may abate the blight or blighting
factors by whatever reasonable means are necessary to abate said blight or
blighting factors and that all of the costs for the removal or abatement of
said blight or blighting factors shall be billed to the owner of the subject
property and the cost incurred to abate the blight. That any invoice which
remains unpaid for a period of thirty days shall become a lien on the property
and shall be assessed against that property.
   (e)   Before commencement of prosecution under this ordinance, for a first
violation the City shall notify the violator(s) of the existence of the
violation of this chapter. Such notice shall be in writing and served upon the
violator(s) as provided herein. The violator(s) shall have seven days from the
date of service in which to remedy the violation.
   (f)   Prosecution may be commenced against a violator(s) without prior
notice in any instance where a violation notice has been previously sent within
the twelve months immediately preceding the second or subsequent notification
regarding or relating to the same address.
   (g)   Each day that a violation under this chapter continues to exist shall
be considered a separate violation subject to the penalties set forth herein.

1472.01 SCOPE.
   The City does establish this chapter to govern the abatement of dangerous
buildings, structures or part thereof, to establish procedures to determine if
a building, structure or part thereof is dangerous, to provide for review,
notice and due process in the actions involved with such buildings, structures
or parts thereof.
(Ord. 2004-10. Passed 8-2-04.)
1472.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, "dangerous building" means any building or
structure, which has any of the defects, or is in any of the conditions
hereinafter described:
   (a)   Whenever any portion has been damaged by wind, flood, deterioration,
neglect, abandonment, vandalism or by any other cause in such manner that the
structural strength or stability is appreciably less than it was before the
damage and is less than the minimum requirements of this chapter for a new
building or similar structure, purpose or location;
   (b)   Whenever any portion or member or appurtenance is likely to fall or
become detached or dislodged, or to collapse, and thereby injure persons or
damage property;
   (c)   Whenever any portion has settled to such an extent that walls or other
structural portions have materially less resistance to winds than is required
in the case of new construction;
   (d)   Whenever the building or structure or any part, because of
dilapidation, deterioration, decay, faulty construction, or because of the
removal or movement of some portion of the ground necessary for the purpose of
supporting such building or portion thereof, or for any other reason is likely
to partially or completely collapse, or some portion of the foundation or
underpinning is likely to fall or give way;
   (e)   Whenever, for any reason whatsoever, the building or structure or any
portion is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is used;
   (f)   Whenever the building or structure has been so damaged by fire, wind
or flood, or has become so dilapidated or deteriorated as to become an
attractive nuisance to children who might play therein to their danger, or as
to afford a harbor for vagrants, criminals or immoral persons, or as to enable
persons to resort thereto for the purpose of committing a nuisance or unlawful
or immoral act;
   (g)   Whenever a building or structure used or intended to be used for
dwelling purposes, because of dilapidation, decay, damage or faulty
construction or arrangement or otherwise, is unsanitary or unfit for human
habitation, or is in a condition that is likely to cause sickness or disease or
is likely to work injury to the health, safety or general welfare of those
living within;
   (h)   Whenever any building becomes vacant, dilapidated and open at door,
window or other opening, leaving the interior of the building exposed to the
elements or accessible to entrance by trespassers;
   (i)   Whenever any building or structure becomes a harborage for rats, mice
or other vermin and pests and is likely to be a source of infestation of such
vermin and pests to the surrounding neighborhood;
   (j)   In addition, the term "dangerous building" shall also include any
swimming pool, if such swimming pool is permitted:
      (1)   To become stagnant;
      (2)   To become a breeding ground for mosquitoes, or other insects;
      (3)   To become algae-ridden;
      (4)   To become otherwise unsafe for the intended purposes; or
      (5)   To have the required enclosure surrounding the swimming pool either

the City;
   (k)   Whenever a building or structure remains unoccupied for a period of
180 consecutive days or longer and is not listed as being available for sale,
lease or rent with a licensed real estate broker. For purposes of this chapter,
"building" or "structure" includes, but is not limited to, a commercial
building or structure. This division does not apply to the following:
      (1)   A building or structure as to which the owner or agent does both of
the following:
         A.   Notifies the Police Department that the building or structure

a period of 180 days or longer each year, if the owner notifies the Police
Department that the dwelling will remain unoccupied for a period of 180
consecutive days or more each year. An owner who has given the notice
prescribed by this division shall notify the Police Department not more
   than 30 days after the dwelling no longer qualifies for this exception. As

home that is occupied by the owner or a member of the owner's family during
part of the year.
(Ord. 2004-10. Passed 8-2-04.)
1472.03 DANGEROUS BUILDINGS AS PUBLIC NUISANCES.
   All such dangerous buildings or structures are hereby determined to be
public nuisances and unlawful and shall be abated by alteration, repair or
rehabilitation, or by demolition and removal in accordance with the procedures
specified elsewhere in this chapter. Further, no owner or agent thereof shall
keep, maintain or allow occupancy of any such dangerous building or structure.
(Ord. 2004-10. Passed 8-2-04.)
1472.04 COMMENCEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS.
   The City Engineer or the City Engineer's designee shall examine or cause to
be examined every building, structure or portion thereof reported as unsafe or
damaged, and if such is found to be a dangerous building as defined in this
chapter, the City Engineer shall commence proceedings to cause the alteration,
repair or rehabilitation, or the demolition and removal of the building,
structure or portion thereof.
(Ord. 2004-10. Passed 8-2-04.)
1472.05 NOTICE AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE.
   (a)   (1)   The City Engineer or the City Engineer's designee shall issue a
notice and order in writing to each owner of or party in interest in the
building or structure in whose name the property appears on the last local tax
assessment records. This notice and order shall include a time and place of a
hearing on whether the building or structure is a dangerous building and a
period of time in which the owner shall commence and complete the required
alteration, repair or rehabilitation, or demolition and removal of the building
or structure or portions thereof. All work shall be completed prior to the date
of the hearing determined by the City Engineer or the City Engineer's designee
and so stated in the written notice and order. In no event shall this period
allowed to complete the work exceed 90 days from the date of delivery of the
notice.
      (2)   If necessary to protect the health and safety of occupants or
persons in the vicinity, such notice shall also require the building, structure
or portion thereof to be vacated forthwith and not to be reoccupied until the
required repairs and improvements are completed, inspected and approved by the
City Engineer or the City Engineer's designee.
      (3)   The City Engineer or the City Engineer's designee may order the
building, structure or portion thereof to be boarded in accordance with the
standards set forth in the current Building Code and current International
Property Maintenance Code, as adopted and amended. In such an event, the owner
or agent thereof shall cause the building, structure or portion thereof to be
boarded as directed. Such orders are deemed to be a temporary measure for use
during the period of time set forth in the notice and order for alteration,
repair or rehabilitation, or demolition and removal of such dangerous
buildings, structures or portion thereof.
      (4)   In no event shall the boarding of a building or structure be deemed
to be a permanent abatement of a dangerous building. The City has specifically
determined that, though appropriate for temporary securing of dangerous
buildings or structures, boarding of buildings or structures as a permanent
measure leads or contributes to:
         A.   Urban blight;
         B.   A decline in property values for surrounding properties;
         C.   A decline in the aesthetics of the City;
         D.   The building or structure being a target for arson;
         E.   A site for trafficking in illegal and controlled substances,
prostitution and/or other social evils.
   (b)   Service of the notice and order to show cause shall be made upon each
owner of or party in interest as defined in division (a)(1) of this section.
Service shall be by any of the following methods:
      (1)   Personally delivering a copy to the owner or agent thereof; or
      (2)   Mailing a copy by certified mail, postage paid, return receipt
requested, and first class mail, postage paid, to the owner; or
      (3)   Posting a copy thereof upon a conspicuous part of the building or
structure.
   (c)   Notice shall be effective upon the earliest occurrence of any of the
following:
      (1)   Personal service upon the owner or the owner's agent;
      (2)   The date of mailing by certified mail when a signed return receipt
is received;
      (3)   The date of posting.
(Ord. 2004-10. Passed 8-2-04; Ord. 2009-05. Passed 4-21-09.)
1472.06 POSTING OF SIGNS.
   The City Engineer or the City Engineer's designee shall cause to be posted
at each entrance of such a dangerous building or structure a notice to read:
"Do not enter, unsafe to occupy." Such notice shall remain posted until the
required alterations, repairs or rehabilitation, or demolition and removal is
completed. Such notice shall not be removed without written permission of the
building official and no person shall enter this building or structure except
for the purpose of making the alterations, repairs or rehabilitation required,
demolishing and removing the building or structure or inspecting the building
or structure.
(Ord. 2004-10. Passed 8-2-04.)
1472.07 HEARING OFFICER; HEARING; TESTIMONY; ORDER; NON- APPEARANCE OR
NONCOMPLIANCE; COSTS.
   (a)   The Mayor shall appoint a Hearing Officer for a term of three years to
conduct a hearing which shall be open to the public, at which the owner shall
be granted an opportunity to show cause why the building or structure should
not be demolished or otherwise made safe as ordered by the City Engineer or the
City Engineer's designee. The Hearing Officer may not be an employee of the
City and shall have expertise in housing matters including, but not limited to,
an engineer, architect, building contractor, building inspector, or member of a
community housing organization.
   (b)   In any proceedings under this section, the Hearing Officer has the
power to administer oaths and affirmations and to certify official acts. The
Hearing Officer shall proceed with reasonable dispatch to conclude any matter
before him or her. Due regard shall be shown for the convenience and necessity
of the parties and their representatives.
   (c)   The Hearing Officer shall cause a record of the entire proceeding to
be made by tape recording or by other means of permanent recording determined
appropriate by the Hearing Officer. A transcript of the proceedings shall be
made available to all parties upon request and upon payment of a fee prescribed
therefor. The fee may be established by the Hearing Officer but shall not be
greater than the cost of making the transcript.
   (d)   The hearing need not be conducted according to the technical rules of
evidence adopted for the Courts of Record in the State of Michigan.
   (e)   (1)   The Hearing Officer shall take testimony from the City Engineer
or the City Engineer's designee, the owner of the property and any person
having knowledge relevant to the condition of the property. Oral evidence shall
be taken only upon oath or affirmation of the party offering the testimony.
      (2)   Any relevant evidence shall be admitted. "Relevant evidence" shall
be defined, for the purposes of this section, as the type of evidence upon
which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious
affairs. Such relevant evidence shall be admitted regardless of whether or not
it may be admissible in civil actions in courts of competent jurisdiction.
      (3)   Irrelevant and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.
   (f)   Each party shall have these rights:
      (1)   To call and examine witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues
of the hearing;
      (2)   To introduce documentary and physical evidence;
      (3)   To cross-examine opposing witnesses on any matter relevant to the
issues of the hearing;
      (4)   To impeach any witness regardless of which party first called the
witness to testify;
      (5)   To refute the evidence;
      (6)   To represent himself or herself or to be represented by anyone of
his or her choice who is lawfully permitted to do so; and
      (7)   To make a closing statement at the conclusion of the evidentiary
portion of the hearing.
   (g)   Failure of the owner or the owner's authorized representative to
appear at the hearing may be deemed to be an admission by the owner of the
facts set forth in the City Engineer or the City Engineer's designee's notice
and order.
   (h)   Consideration shall be given to the following when rendering a
decision:
      (1)   The evidence presented;
      (2)   The condition of the building or structure as a whole;
      (3)   The extent of the deterioration of the building or structure;
      (4)   The cost of demolishing the building or structure;
      (5)   The cost of making the building or structure safe (if the estimated
cost of repair exceeds the state equalized value of the building or structure
to be repaired, a rebuttable presumption that the building or structure
requires immediate demolition exists);
      (6)   Whether a reasonable person exercising prudent business judgment
would determine the cost of making the building or structure safe would exceed
the market value of the structure after the repairs were completed;
      (7)   Whether there are any conflicts with other ordinances, state laws
or federal statutes;
      (8)   The effect the completion of the demolition and removal or of
making the building or structure safe would have upon the health, safety and
welfare of the area immediately surrounding the building or structure in
question; and
      (9)   Whether actual substantial progress has been made by the owner to
make the building safe. In determining whether substantial progress has been
made, the Hearing Officer considers such factors as whether a building permit
has been obtained relative to the repairs, whether the owner has contracted for
necessary materials or services, and the extent to which the repairs or
demolition has progressed.
   (i)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall render a
decision based upon the findings of fact and the competent evidence and
testimony admitted during the hearing. The Hearing Officer shall be required to
conduct an on-site inspection of the building or structure. The Hearing Officer
may sustain, amend or dismiss the order of the City Engineer or the City
Engineer's designee. Said decision shall be in writing.
   (j)   If the Hearing Officer shall determine that the building or structure
is a dangerous building at the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer
shall sustain the findings of the City Engineer or the City Engineer's
designee. The Hearing Officer shall then order the building or structure to be
demolished or made safe, as the facts determined by the Hearing Officer shall
dictate. The Hearing Officer shall fix a time by which the owner of the
building or structure shall complete the demolition or make the building or
structure safe. In no event shall the period established by the Hearing Officer
exceed 30 days from the date of the service of the Hearing Officer's notice of
findings and order. The Hearing Officer's notice of findings and order shall be
given to the owner in the manner set forth in this chapter. The effective date
of the Hearing Officer's notice of findings and order shall be upon service as
provided in this chapter.
   (k)   The decision of the Hearing Officer shall be final. The authority of
the Hearing Officer to sustain, amend or dismiss the City Engineer or the City
Engineer's designee's notice and order ceases upon the service of the Hearing
Officer's notice of findings and order as set forth in this chapter. Upon such
service, the Hearing Officer shall have no authority to reverse his or her
decision, to grant an extension of time, or to entertain a request to reopen
the hearing or to grant any other request of the owner or the owner's agent.
Each written notice of findings and order of the Hearing Officer shall contain
a statement advising the owner, or the owner's agent, of the limitations of the
Hearing Officer as set forth in this section and also, of the appeal procedure
set forth in this chapter.
   (l)   Upon service of the Hearing Officer's notice of findings and order, an
aggrieved party may appeal the decision of the Hearing Officer to the Appeal
Board. The aggrieved party must file an appeal of such order within 30 days
from the date of service. The aggrieved party shall file a written request for
an appeal of the decision with the City Clerk. The Appeal Board shall conduct a
hearing at its next regularly scheduled meeting, no less than thirty days and
no more than sixty days from the date of the Hearing Officer's Notice of
Findings and Order.
      (1)   The Council shall appoint a five-member hearing Appeal Board, which
shall consist of the following:
         A.   Two citizens;
         B.   Individual registered as a building official, plan reviewer or
inspector under the building officials and inspectors registration act, Public
Act 54 of 1986, being M.C.L.A. §§ 338.2301 to 338.2313. The individual may be
an employee of the enforcing agency;
   C.   Registered Architect or Engineer;
         D.   Building Contractor.
      (2)   The Appeal Board shall adopt rules governing the hearing, including
but not limited to, the length of oral presentation, the number of Board

1473.05   Vacant properties to be registered annually.

1473.01   PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to help protect the health, safety and
welfare of the citizens. This chapter is intended to prevent blight, protect
property values and neighborhood integrity, to avoid the creation and
maintenance of nuisances and to ensure the safe and sanitary maintenance of
dwellings and commercial and industrial buildings.
   (b)   Due to economic conditions, mortgage foreclosures, and increased
bankruptcies, many homes and buildings have become vacant and unsupervised.
This has caused properties to become attractive nuisances and to invite
unwanted activity. There is an increased instance of unsecured or open doors
and windows, broken water pipes, flooded basements, theft of metals and other
materials, overgrowth of grass, weeds, shrubs, and bushes, illegal dumping, and
vermin activity at vacant structures. Vacant properties have a negative impact
on surrounding properties and neighborhoods. The City also needs to be able to
contact owners for utility shutoff, fire safety and police reasons.
(Ord. 2013-02. Passed 2-5-13; Ord. 2019-04. Passed 4-2-19.)
1473.02   DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   “Code compliance certificate” is defined as an annual certificate
issued by the City or its designee that the structure is in compliance with all
City Code requirements and the State Construction Code.
   (b)   “Evidence of vacancy” is defined to include any condition that on its
own, or combined with other conditions present, would lead a reasonable person
to believe that the property is vacant. Such conditions include, but are not
limited to: overgrown and/or dead vegetation; un-shoveled snow from sidewalks;
accumulation of newspapers, circulars, flyers and/or mail; past due utility
notices and/or disconnected utilities; accumulation of trash, junk and/or
debris; boarded up windows; abandoned vehicles, auto parts or materials; the
absence of or continually drawn window coverings such as curtains, blinds and/
or shutters; the absence of furnishings and/or personal items consistent with
habitation or occupancy; statements by neighbors, passersby, delivery agents or
utility agents, including City employees, that the property is vacant.
   (c)   “Lender” is defined to mean a person, firm or corporation holding a
mortgage on a property.
   (d)   “Owner” is defined as one who has legal title and/or the right to
possess, use, transfer or to convey property, i.e., the owner or successor to
title by foreclosure, sheriff’s sale or by court order.
   (e)   “Possessory lender” is defined to mean a person, firm or corporation
that has foreclosed a mortgage on a property but may not have legal or
equitable title.
   (f)   “Vacant property” is defined as a property, building, or structure
that remains unoccupied for a period in excess of 30 days, and/or exhibits
“evidence of vacancy” as defined herein. “Vacant property” does not mean
property that is temporarily unoccupied for a period of less than one hundred
eighty days while the residents are away on vacation, tending to personal
matters or business and does not harbor “evidence of vacancy.” “Vacant
property” does not include structures that are used for storage purposes and
located in an area where storage is legally allowed as a principal use of the
zoning district, where the use is in compliance with all appropriate provisions
of city ordinances, building and fire codes pertaining to the storage use.

infested, or because it lacks sanitary facilities or equipment, or because it
otherwise fails to comply with the minimum provisions of this Housing Code, but
has not yet reached a state of complete disrepair so as to be condemned as a
dangerous building as hereinbefore provided, he or she may declare such
structure as unfit for human occupancy and order it to be vacated.
   If any structure, or any part thereof, is occupied by more occupants than
permitted, or was erected or altered or is occupied contrary to law, the
Building Official may cause such structure to be vacated. It shall be unlawful
to again occupy such dwelling until it or its occupation, as the case may be,
has been made to conform to the law. The owner shall be notified as stated
herein.

to any interested person and the neighbors surrounding the structure or
premises in connection with which the appeal is taken, as shall be deemed
reasonable by said Construction Board of Appeals.

1620.01 SMOKE DETECTORS.
   (a)   General Requirement. At least one approved smoke detector powered by
the house electrical service shall be installed in an approved manner in every
dwelling unit. When activated, the detector shall initiate an alarm which is
audible in the sleeping rooms. For location of single station detectors, see
Appendix A, Chapter 11, of the National Fire Codes. However, in existing
construction, approved smoke detectors powered by batteries may be used.
   (b)   Responsibility of Owners. The owner of each new and existing occupied
dwelling unit shall install smoke detectors in each such dwelling unit as
provided in this section. Such smoke detectors shall be capable of sensing
visible or invisible particles of combustion and providing a suitable audible
alarm thereof. Further, they shall be installed by July 1, 1978, in the manner
hereinafter provided. Failure to install smoke detectors as and where required
by such date shall subject the property owner to the penalty provided in
Section
1620.99.
   (c)   Location.
      (1)   At least one smoke detector shall be installed to protect each
sleeping area. A sleeping area is defined as the area or areas of the family
living unit in which the bedrooms (or sleeping rooms) are located. Where
bedrooms or rooms ordinarily used for sleeping are separated by other use areas
(such as kitchens or living rooms, but not bathrooms or closets), they shall be
considered as separate sleeping areas for the purposes of this section.
      (2)   At least one smoke detector shall be installed at the head (top) of
each stairway leading up to an occupied area in such a manner as to ensure that
rising smoke is not obstructed in reaching the detector and that the detector
intercepts rising smoke before it reaches the sleeping area.
   (d)   Alternative. As an alternative to self-contained smoke detectors, an
approved fire detection system may be installed. Each fire detection system
must be individually approved and a permit must be issued therefor by the Fire
Division.
   (e)   Equipment. All devices, combinations of devices, and equipment
required by this section are to be installed in conformity with the Building
Code and this section and approved or listed by a nationally recognized testing
laboratory.
   (f)   Installation. In new residential dwellings, smoke detectors shall be
wired directly (hard-wired) to the power supply of the building. In existing
dwellings within multifamily dwellings of ten units or more, the detectors
shall meet the multifamily building power source requirements of State law or,
in the absence of State law, the requirements hereunder covering other existing
dwellings. In other existing dwellings, it is preferred that smoke detectors be
wired directly to the power supply. However, such detectors may be powered by a
self-monitored battery or operated in a plug-in outlet which is fitted with a
plug restrainer device, provided the outlet is not controlled by any switch
other than the main power supply.
   (g)   Certification at Change in Occupancy. After July 1, 1978, at every
change of occupancy of every dwelling unit occasioned by or incidental to a
sale, lease or sublease of such unit, it shall be the duty of the grantor
thereof (i.e. the seller, lessor or sublessor, as the case may be) to certify,
before occupancy, to the new occupant that all smoke detectors as required by
this section (or other applicable laws) are installed and in proper working
condition. Failure to comply with this subsection shall be punishable as set
forth in Section
1620.99, provided, however, that this subsection shall not be construed to
vitiate or render void any contract, lease or sublease subject hereto.
   (h)   Permits and Fees. No smoke detector or alternative system shall be
directly connected (permanently wired) to the electrical system of the
structure unless an electrical permit has first been obtained from the
Department of Engineering and Building or the municipal electrical authority
having jurisdiction. The City Manager is hereby authorized to adopt a fee
schedule for the issuance of such permit, which shall not exceed the cost of
administration of this section, subject to Council approval.
   (i)   Supplemental Standards. This section is intended to be used with and
supplemented by the applicable provisions of National Fire Protection
Association Standards 72-3, 1974, and 74, 1975 Edition, which are hereby
incorporated herein. However, if there is any conflict between this section and
such supplemental standards, this section and any rules and regulations adopted
pursuant thereto shall prevail.
(Ord. 17-A-4. Passed 6-21-77.)
