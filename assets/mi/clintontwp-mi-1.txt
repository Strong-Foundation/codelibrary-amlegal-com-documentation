Ordinances" may be substituted. Code, title, chapter and section headings do
not constitute any part of the law as contained in the Codified Ordinances.

components of the Codified Ordinances unless otherwise specified. Any component
code may be referred to and cited by its name, such as the "Traffic Code."

subdivided into sections, which shall be numbered in accordance with the
decimal numbering system. The numbering of all sections, except penalty
sections, shall be consecutive within each chapter commencing with the first
section of Chapter 202, which shall be numbered 202.01, the first "2"
signifying Code 2, and the two figures "02" before the decimal signifying the
chapter within the Code, and the two figures "01" after the decimal signifying

(Res. Unno. Passed 7-16-01; Res. Unno. Passed 1-14-08.)
   (h)   Deposit for Special Water Use. When water is requested for other than
use in a building, the Department may provide such water, with or without a
meter. This service shall be called a "special water use." To get such special
water use, the user must pay for the amount of water to be used. Special water
use through a hydrant will include a meter rental fee of three dollars ($3.00)
per day, inspection fees at twenty five dollars ($25.00) per inspection and a
hydrant wrench rental fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) if needed.
Before getting the supply of water, the applicant for the same is subject to a
deposit (previously called a "Gatewell Deposit"), to be applied toward the
payment for the special water use, in an amount ranging from one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) based upon the
projected use as determined by the Superintendent of the Department.
   (i)   Special Service Charges. In the event that a user of water and/or
sewage disposal services is delinquent in paying for services rendered, that
user will be subject to the special service charge listed hereinafter. A use
will be considered delinquent when said user does not pay his or her bill when
due or when said user submits a bad check when paying his or her bill.
   Whenever a user is so delinquent, the Department may turn off the water to
the user's building (with or without a written notice). If a written notice is
given, it will give a proposed shut-off date.
   The special service charge shall be $50.00 per "incident." An "incident" is
defined as any one of the following:
      (1)   A visit to the building's site with the intent to shut off the
water, but not doing so based on the user's promises; and/or
      (2)   A visit to the building's site with the intent to shut off the
water and doing so. The subsequent visit to turn on the water is considered a
part of this "incident."
   If a nondelinquent user requests the Department either to turn off or to
turn on his or her water during normal business hours, the visits to do so will
not be subject to a special service charge. However, if either a nondelinquent
user or a delinquent user requests the Department to turn on his or her water
at times other than normal Department business hours, said user will be subject
to double the special service charge.

      (2)   Contractor License Renewal Fee (effective for one year)   $10.00
   (k)   Capacity unit factor for determining water and/or sewer system
development fees.
      (1)   To determine the total amount of water and/or sewer system
development fee for other than residential use, the following table of water
and/or sewer capacity unit factor shall be used. The total fee shall be the
capacity unit factor times the current rate per capacity unit. The schedule of
capacity unit factors for each occupational use are in tabular form as follows:

239.01   DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   (a)   “Assisted-living facility” means an assisted living establishment
licensed by the state and any other residential setting where assisted-living
services are provided directly or by third parties for remuneration to three
(3) or more persons who reside in such residential setting and are not related
to the owner of the residential setting and includes a home, an apartment, or a
facility. “Assisted-living facility” does not include a home, an apartment, or
a facility in which casual care is provided at irregular intervals. As used in
this paragraph, "related" shall mean a relationship by blood, adoption or
marriage that is limited to a father, mother, sibling, child, aunt, uncle,
niece, nephew or cousin.
   (b)   “Facility” means any of the communal residential living facilities
defined in this chapter, including but not limited to “assisted-living
facilities,” “independent living facilities,” and “nursing care facilities.”
   (c)   “Independent living facility” means a residential living facility that
markets itself to senior citizens as providing, or actually provides or offers,
through the facility or through third parties, staff or contractors to serve
its residents in a communal living environment for twenty-four (24) hours per
day, hospitality services, and/or convenient access to dining, medical care,
hospitality services, and/or entertainment.
   (d)   “Lift assist” means a response by the Township's Fire Department or
emergency responders to assist in physically moving a person who does not
require emergency medical treatment or transportation.
   (e)   “Non-emergency response” means a response by the Township's Fire
Department or emergency responders to a 9-1-1 or non-emergency call for
personal physical assistance that does not require professional medical
attention on an emergency basis, in the sole judgment of Fire Department
personnel or emergency responders, such as calls for lift assistance,
transportation to a medical facility or care center for non-emergency medical
treatment, or other health care calls more appropriately addressed to a nurse,
personal care attendant, or facility employee. The Fire Department may expand
upon this definition through the issuance of bulletins or internal orders that
provide specific examples of different types of non-emergency responses that
will be deemed to fit this definition.
   (f)   “Nursing care facility” means a facility licensed as a nursing home,
nursing center, convalescent center, extended care facility, or similar
facility by the state pursuant to the requirements of the Public Health Code,
or a facility or long-term care facility where medical care, nursing care,
rehabilitation, or related services and associated treatment are provided for a
period of more than twenty- four (24) consecutive hours to persons residing at
such facility who are ill, injured, or disabled.
(Ord. 488. Passed 1-22-24.)
239.02 NON-EMERGENCY RESPONSE COST RECOVERY.
   (a)   The Township shall charge a fee to a facility for a non-emergency
response at that facility.
   (b)   The commanding officer or lead emergency responder of an emergency
response unit dispatched to a facility shall determine whether an emergency
medical condition or emergency medical necessity existed. If determined that an
emergency situation did not exist, the commanding officer or lead emergency
responder shall characterize the incident as a non-emergency response in the
incident report.
   (c)      Amount of Fee.
      (1)   The fee for providing a non-emergency response shall be established
by resolution of the Township Board.
      (2)   The fee shall be reasonably calculated to recover some or all of
the costs to or incurred by the Township. In no event, however, shall the fee
exceed the full costs incurred by the Township less any reimbursement received
by the Township from other sources.
   (d)   The Township's Fire Department shall maintain records in connection
with services provided pursuant to this chapter, and shall forward the records
required for invoicing to the Township treasurer or his/her designee.
   (e)   In making the determination as to whether to assess the fee authorized
by this section, the following factors shall be considered and at least one
must be deemed to warrant cost recovery by the Township due to the expense that
would otherwise be incurred by the taxpayers:
      (1)   The total costs above and beyond routine costs, including but not
limited to overtime costs, extraordinary time for personnel on the scene,
unusual equipment mobilization, utilization of private personnel or agencies to
assist with the response, and utilization of assistance from other public
agencies;
      (2)   Whether the response caused or contributed to any delay in
responding to other emergency or non-emergency calls for service;
      (3)   The risk that the incident imposed on the Township, its residents,
and their property;
      (4)   Whether there was any injury or damage to persons or property;
      (5)   Whether the incident in question could or should have been
addressed by the facility without Township intervention or assistance;
      (6)   Whether the response in question was necessitated by the facility's
lack of resources, lack of personnel, or lack of interest in addressing the
incident without Township intervention or assistance; or
      (7)   Whether the incident required an unusual or extraordinary use of
personnel and equipment.
(Ord. 488. Passed 1-22-24.)
239.03      BILLING, DELINQUENCY, AND COLLECTION.
   (a)   The fee may be assessed to any or all responsible parties jointly or
severally. Notice of the imposition of a fee under this chapter shall be sent
to the owner or management of the facility where the non-emergency response
occurred. The owner, manager, or chief administrative agent regularly assigned
and employed on the premises are presumed to be the appropriate person to
receive the notice, unless the Township is notified otherwise.
   (b)   Any invoice for the fee imposed pursuant to this chapter shall be due
and payable by the deadline established on the invoice, which shall not be less
than thirty (30) days from the date of mailing. The invoice shall include
notice of the appeal procedure established in this chapter. If a responsible
party submits a written appeal, the fees or costs, if upheld in whole or in
part, shall be due and payable thirty (30) days from the date of determination
of the appeal.
   (c)      Any person or entity liable for the cost of a lift assist who fails
to pay such fee when due, or any portion thereof, shall be assessed a monetary
penalty for each month of delinquency as established by resolution of the
Township Board. Delinquency penalties shall be tolled and waived during an
administrative appeal pursuant to this chapter.
   (d)   The Township shall have a lien against the real property of the
facility to secure payment. If the invoice remains unpaid after sixty (60) days
(excluding tolling periods), the amount of the invoice may be placed upon the
tax roll, and shall be subject to the same penalties, interest, and collection
procedures that are applicable to delinquent taxes. The Township shall add
interest at a rate of 6% per annum on all liens filed against properties for
delinquent fees imposed pursuant to this chapter. Enforcement of the lien to
collect fees assessed under this chapter shall not be the exclusive means of
collection, and the Township may collect such fees in any manner permitted by
law.
(Ord. 488. Passed 1-22-24.)
239.04      WAIVERS; APPEALS.
   (a)   If the Fire Chief, or his/her designee, determines that the Township's
assessment of a fee was in error or there were other mitigating facts that the
Township did not possess at the time that the fee was assessed, the Fire Chief,
or his/her designee, may waive imposition of the fee.
   (b)   A facility subject to a fee under this chapter may submit an appeal to
the Fire Chief at the address listed on the notice or invoice for submission of
appeals. The following provisions shall apply to all appeals:
   (1)   The appeal must be in writing and submitted within ten (10) days after
the issuance of the first notice or invoice for the fee.
   (2)   The appeal must include the appellant's reasoning as to why the fee
should be reconsidered.
   (3)   Appeals arguing cost or the policy underlying this chapter shall not
constitute sufficient reasons to warrant reversal of the fee.
   (4)   Appeals are limited to:
      A.   Whether information obtained by the Township was inaccurate or
incomplete and if accurate and complete information been obtained, a different
determination would have been made; or
      B.   Whether the fee assessed to the facility should have been reduced by
amounts paid to the Township for the response from other sources, if payments
from other sources resulted in the Township receiving revenue that exceeded its
actual costs as calculated pursuant to the criteria set forth in this chapter.
   (5)   The Fire Chief or his/her designee will review all information
provided with the appeal and issue a decision in writing to the appellant
within sixty (60) days.
   (6)   Unless an appeal is properly and timely submitted in accordance with
this subsection, any fee assessed under this chapter shall be final.

the positions, and shall be so arranged as to permit the filling of the higher
grades through promotion. All salaries shall be uniform for like service in

chapter, adopt rules to carry out the purposes of this chapter, not

of service, military or naval experience, and such other matters as may have a
bearing on promotion, transfer or discharge. All such "service records" and

(Ord. 224-A. Passed 11-11-70.)
270.09   FILLING POSITIONS IN CLASSIFIED SERVICE; PROCEDURE.

standing highest on the eligible list for the class or grade to which the
position belongs, and the appointing authority shall forthwith appoint to the
position one of the three persons so certified. The appointment shall be for a
probationary period to be fixed by the rules, but not to exceed six months. At
or before the expiration of the probationary period, the appointing officer, by
presenting specific reasons for such action in writing, may discharge a
probational appointee, or, with the approval of the Civil Service Commission,
transfer him or her to another department. If not discharged prior to the
expiration of the period of probation and if no complaint has been made as to
the service rendered, the appointment shall be deemed complete. To prevent the
stoppage of business or to meet extraordinary conditions or emergencies, the
head of any department or office, with the approval of the Commission, may make
a temporary appointment to remain for a period not exceeding sixty days, and
only until regular appointment under the provisions of this chapter can be
made.
(Ord. 224-A. Passed 11-11-70.)

chapter. All appointive officers and employees of the Township or any
department thereof included in the classified civil service by this chapter,

department for seasonal or temporary employment, who have been in such
employment of the Township for two successive seasons immediately prior to the
time this chapter takes effect, shall be included in the classified civil
service and be eligible for appointment to such seasonal or temporary

   Wherever possible, vacancies shall be filled by promotion. Promotion shall
be made from among employees, in the grades nearest below the grade in which
the vacancy exists, qualified by training and experience to fill the vacancy
and whose length of service in such lower grade entitles them to consideration.
The Commission, for the purpose of promotion, shall rate the qualified
employees in the lower grades on the basis of their service record, experience
in the work involved in the vacant position, training and qualification for
such work, seniority and war service ratings. Seniority shall be controlling
only when other factors are equal.
(Ord. 224-A. Passed 11-11-70.)
270.12   REMOVAL, SUSPENSION, REDUCTION IN RANK OR COMPENSATION; PROCEDURE.
   Any officer or employee in the classified civil service may be removed,

appointment or promotion is complete by an order in writing, stating
specifically the reasons therefor. The order shall be filed with the Civil
Service Commission and a copy thereof shall be furnished to the person to be
removed, suspended or reduced. The employee may reply in writing to the order
within five days from the date of filing it with the Civil Service Commission.
Any person removed, suspended or reduced in rank or compensation, within ten
days after presentation to him or her of the order of removal, suspension or
reduction, may appeal to the Civil Service Commission. The Commission, within
two weeks from the filing of the appeal, shall commence the hearing thereon,
and shall thereupon fully hear and determine the matter, and either affirm,
modify or revoke such order. The appellant shall be entitled to appear
personally, produce evidence, and to have counsel and a public hearing. The
finding and decision of the Commission shall be certified to the official from
whose order the appeal is taken, and shall forthwith be enforced and followed
by him or her, but under no condition shall the employee be removed, suspended
or reduced in rank until the finding and decision of the Commission are so
certified.

   Any person who is served with a subpoena to appear and testify, or to

investigation conducted under the provisions of this chapter, and who refuses
or neglects to appear or to testify as commanded in the subpoena, is guilty of
a misdemeanor. The fees of witnesses for attendance and travel shall be the
same as the fees of witnesses in the circuit court for the county in which the
Township is situated, and shall be paid from the appropriation for the expenses
of the Commission. The judge of the circuit court, either in term or vacation,
upon application of the Commission, shall compel the attendance of witnesses,
the production of books and papers and the giving of testimony before the
Commission by attachment for contempt or otherwise in the same manner as the
production of evidence may be compelled before the court. Every person who,
having taken an oath or made affirmation in a proceeding, swears or affirms
willfully, corruptly or falsely, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
(Ord. 224-A. Passed 11-11-70.)

by this chapter, is guilty of a misdemeanor. When, by this chapter, any act or
duty is required to be done by or under the supervision or authority of any
officer, and such act or duty is not done or performed, then the officer who

misdemeanor. Any person convicted of any of the acts or omissions which are by

provided in Section 280.99.

298.01   HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR DISTRICT JUDGES AFTER LEAVING ELECTIVE
OFFICE.
   (a)   Payment for Coverage. The Township will provide health care coverage
as provided for the non-represented employees of the Township, excluding
maternity coverage, to district judges after leaving elective office and being
at least fifty-five years of age, or older, based upon the following payment
provisions:
      (1)   If a judge has completed six years as a 41-B District Judge, then
he or she shall pay sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the cost, with the
Township paying thirty-three and one-third percent of the cost.
      (2)   If a judge completes twelve years as a 41-B District Judge, then he
or she shall pay thirty-three and one-third percent of the cost, with the
Township paying sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the cost.
      (3)   Each 41-B District Judge who serves eighteen years as a 41-
B District Judge shall be entitled to the benefits fully paid by the Township
until he or she reaches the age of sixty-five.
      (4)   These hospital and medical benefits shall be equal to the benefits
that the nonrepresented employees of the Township are receiving.
   (b)   Options Available at Age Fifty-Five if Not Serving as a 41-B District
Judge. If a judge reaches the age of fifty-five and he or she is no longer a
41-B District Judge, nor is he or she an employee of the Township or the State
of Michigan, then and in that event, at his or her option, he or she may
decline to receive any further health care coverage, and in lieu thereof, he or
she shall receive a cash payment or, at the direction of the judge, the money
shall be deposited into an annuity plan as directed by him or her.
   By electing the cash disbursement or annuity payment, the judge will receive
a portion or all of the amount paid by the Township for his or her benefit
based on a two-person plan instead of the family plan. The portion of the
amount (percentage) to be received by the judge will be based on the percentage
of cost the Township paid toward his or her insurance premiums based on the
number of years completed, as set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3)
hereof.
   By the use of this option, each 41-B District Judge shall receive his or her
distribution annualized for a year on his or her fifty-fifth birthday and each
birthday thereafter until age sixty-five.
   (c)   Medicare Supplement or Equivalent. Once a judge has reached the age of
sixty-five, is no longer employed, and has at least six years of service
completed, then he or she shall be entitled to part or all of the cost of the
supplemental benefits to Medicare available to present employees to maintain
benefits. Said judges and their dependents, upon reaching age sixty-five, must
enroll in Medicare Part B in order to qualify for this benefit.
   A judge's portion of any payment will be predicated upon his or her
percentage of insurance cost as formulated in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3)
hereof. Any payment owed by said judge to the Township shall be paid by the
judge thirty days prior to the Township's contribution. Failure to timely pay
will cause this benefit to be forfeited.
   If a judge so desires, he or she shall be entitled to the annualized cost to
the Township of the supplemental coverage on his or her birthday at age sixty-
five and each year thereafter while he or she is alive. By electing this
option, the judge relieves the Township of providing supplemental benefits.

residential structure has separate entrances for each occupancy unit and an
occupant has elected to provide an alarm system, each separate entrance to the
unit occupied shall contain separate alarm systems.
(Ord. 319. Passed 12-22-97.)
607.05   ALARM DURATION; PEACE DISTURBANCES; NUISANCES.
   No person shall operate, install, direct the installation of or use an alarm
system that emits an audible and/or visual signal for a period longer than
fifteen minutes from the initial activation of the device. All owners, lessees
or users of an alarm system shall, within 180 days from the effective date of
this chapter, bring currently installed alarm systems or alarm systems offered
for sale into conformity with this section. Whenever an alarm system continues
to emit audible signals continuously or on a regularly repeating basis for over
thirty minutes and an owner, lessee or occupant of the premises cannot be
contacted or does not respond within thirty minutes of being contacted and the
audible signals create a nuisance or other disturbance of the peace and
tranquility of the neighborhood, any owner and/or occupant of the premises
where such alarm has been activated is guilty of a misdemeanor. The Township
and its designees shall be authorized to disconnect or otherwise disable the
alarm system by cutting wires, disconnecting speakers or disabling other
components of the alarm system that are located on the exterior of the
premises.
(Ord. 319. Passed 12-22-97.)
607.06   FALSE ALARM FEES.
   (a)   Police Department Responses. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this chapter, or penalties provided in order to defray the costs of responding
to false alarms, a false alarm fee shall be charged for the second and
subsequent false alarms within the same calendar year by the same originator
and shall be as set forth in division (a)(1).
      (1)   Fees for false alarms requiring Police Department response
(automobile, residential, business and commercial fire alarms) shall be as
follows:
         A.   Second false alarm               $ 50.00
         B.   Third false alarm               $ 75.00
         C.   Fourth or subsequent false alarms         $100.00
      (2)   False alarm fees shall not apply in the case of the first two false
alarms during the two week period following installation of a new alarm or
upgrading of an existing system upon proper notice to the Police Department and
Fire Department of the installation change. Notice shall be provided
telephonically and in writing to each department. A false alarm fee shall only
be imposed where false alarms are actually responded to by police personnel
and/or equipment.
      (3)   False alarm fees shall not apply where alarm system malfunction
occurs if corrective measures have been undertaken within ten days after the
false alarm and a copy of the repair order documenting completed repair by a
licensed alarm system contractor is furnished within thirty days of the false
alarm delivered to the Record Bureau of the Township Police Department.
Notwithstanding in any calendar year, this procedure shall excuse no more than
three false alarms. The fourth false alarm shall result in a penalty as
prescribed for fourth or subsequent alarms.
   (b)   Fire Department Responses. Fees for false alarms requiring Fire
Department response shall be as follows:
      (1)   For a standard response (requiring a minimum of equipment and
manpower):
         A.   Fourth false alarm               $ 300.00
         B.   Fifth false alarm               400.00
         C.   Sixth or subsequent false alarm         500.00
      (2)   For optimal response (requiring significant deployment of manpower
and equipment due to the nature of the building for which the alarm is given,
including maximum response uses as set forth in the Fire Prevention Code, NFPA
sections and other fire prevention ordinances adopted by the Charter Township
of Clinton, such as, but not limited to, multifamily residential dwelling units
with more than twelve units, institutions, high-hazard industries and places of
assembly of more than 100 persons):
         A.   Fourth false alarm               $ 500.00
         B.   Fifth false alarm               700.00
         C.   Sixth or subsequent false alarms         1,000.00
      (3)   False alarms shall not apply to alarm activation caused by severe
weather or other conditions beyond the control of the owner or lessee of any
alarm system. No fee shall be imposed for a single engine response as required
by Department policy for alarms that have been canceled by the originator prior
to actual full response.
      (4)   No fee shall be imposed during the two week period immediately
following installation of a new alarm system or the upgrading of an existing
alarm system upon proper written notification to the Fire Department.
   (c)   Dual Response.
      (1)   Where a false alarm is responded to by both the Police Department
and the Fire Department, both applicable fees shall be charged.
      (2)   No person shall willfully give, assist in giving, countenance,
request or cause to be given any false alarm in any manner; provided that this
subsection shall not apply to members of the Fire Department. The provisions of
this subsection shall apply to the first, as well as all subsequent, willful
false alarms.
   (d)   Collection of Fees. In the event of a failure to pay, within thirty
days, any statement for fees incurred as a result of provisions of this
chapter, the Charter Township of Clinton shall be permitted to collect such
fees imposed upon any owner of premises (including lessors) in the same manner
as ad valorem real property taxes are collected. Such fees may be added to and
made a part of subsequent real property tax bills and separately noted on such
bill, for purposes of collection. A ten dollar ($10.00) collection fee shall be
imposed upon the owner of the premises where such false alarm occurred.
(Ord. 319. Passed 12-22-97; Ord. Unno. Passed 7-16-01.)
607.07   INTERFERENCE WITH POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS.
   (a)   It is the purpose of this section to prevent the disruption and
interference with the telephone communications systems of the Police Department
and the Fire Department of the Township by allowing alarm systems which, when
activated, connect with the communication facilities of the Police Department
and the Fire Department of the Township by means of the Department's telephone
system.
   (b)   No person engaged in the business of providing communication services
and facilities, or any other person, shall use or operate, attempt to use or
operate, or cause to be used or operated, or arrange, adjust, program or
otherwise provide or install, any device or combination of devices that will,
upon activation, either mechanically, electronically or by other automatic
means, initiate the telephone number assigned to the Township, or any of the
departments of the Township, provided, however, that this section shall not
apply to any public law enforcement agency.
   (c)   The term "telephone number," as used in this section, includes any
additional numbers assigned by a public utility company engaged in the business
of providing communications services and facilities to be used by means of a
rotary or other system to connect with the Township or any of its departments
to such primary number when the primary telephone number is in use.

608.01   PURCHASE BY MINORS, SALE OR DELIVERY TO MINORS, AND BRINGING ALCOHOLIC
BEVERAGES INTO AN ESTABLISHMENT LICENSED TO SELL SAME.
   (a)   Prohibited Actions by Minors.
      (1)   A minor shall not purchase or attempt to purchase alcoholic liquor,
consume or attempt to consume alcoholic liquor, possess or attempt to possess
alcoholic liquor, or have any bodily alcohol content, except as provided in
this section. A minor who violates this subsection is responsible for a city
civil infraction or guilty of a misdemeanor as follows:
         A.   For the first violation, the minor is responsible for a city
civil infraction and shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars
($100.00). A court may order a minor under this subdivision to participate in
substance use disorder services as defined in section 6230 of the Public Health
Code, 1978 PA 368, M.C.L.A. 333.6230, and designated by the Administrator of
the Office of Substance Abuse Services, and may order the minor to perform
community service and to undergo substance abuse screening and assessment at
his or her own expense as described in subsection (a)(5). A minor may be found
responsible or admit responsibility only once under this subdivision.
         B.   If a violation of this subsection occurs after one prior
judgment, the minor is guilty of a misdemeanor. A misdemeanor under this
subdivision is punishable by imprisonment for not more than thirty days if the
court finds that the minor violated an order of probation, failed to
successfully complete any treatment, screening, or community service ordered by
the court, or failed to pay any fine for that conviction or juvenile
adjudication, or by a fine of not more than two hundred dollars ($200.00), or
both. A court may order a minor under this subdivision to participate in
substance use disorder services as defined in section 6230 of the Public Health
Code, 1978 PA 368, M.C.L.A. 333.6230, and designated by the Administrator of
the Office of Substance Abuse Services, to perform community service, and to
undergo substance abuse screening and assessment at his or her own expense as
described in subsection (a)(5).
         C.   If a violation of this subsection occurs after two or more prior
judgments, the minor is guilty of a misdemeanor. A misdemeanor under this
subdivision is punishable by imprisonment for not more than sixty days, if the
court finds that the minor violated an order of probation, failed to
successfully complete any treatment, screening, or community service ordered by
the court, or failed to pay any fine for that conviction or juvenile
adjudication, or by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), or
both, as applicable. A court may order a minor under this subdivision to
participate in substance use disorder services as defined in section 6230 of
the Public Health Code, 1978 PA 368, M.C.L.A. 333.6230, and designated by the
Administrator of the Office of Substance Abuse Services, to perform community
service, and to undergo substance abuse screening and assessment at his or her
own expense as described in subsection (a)(5).
      (2)   An individual who furnishes fraudulent identification to a minor
or, notwithstanding subsection (a)(1), a minor who uses fraudulent
identification to purchase alcoholic liquor, is guilty of a misdemeanor
punishable by imprisonment for not more than ninety-three days or a fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), or both.
      (3)   If an individual who pleads guilty to a misdemeanor violation of
subsection (a)(1)B. or offers a plea of admission in a juvenile delinquency
proceeding for a misdemeanor violation of subsection (a)(1)B., the court,
without entering a judgment of guilt in a criminal proceeding or a
determination in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the juvenile has
committed the offense and with the consent of the accused, may defer further
proceedings and place the individual on probation. The terms and conditions of
that probation include, but are not limited to, the sanctions set forth in
subsection 608.01(a)(2), payment of the costs including minimum state cost as
provided for in section 18m of chapter XIIA of the Probate Code of 1939, 1939
PA 288, M.C.L.A. 712A.18m, and section lj of chapter IX of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1927 PA 175, M.C.L.A. 769. lj, and the costs of probation as
prescribed in section 3 of chapter XI of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1927
PA 175, M.C.L.A. 771.3. If a court finds that an individual violated a term or
condition of probation or that the individual is utilizing this subsection in
another court, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt, or a determination
in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the individual has committed the
offense, and proceed as otherwise provided by law. If an individual fulfills
the terms and conditions of probation, the court shall discharge the individual
and dismiss the proceedings. A discharge and dismissal under this section is
without adjudication of guilt or without a determination in a juvenile
delinquency proceeding that the individual has committed the offense and is not
a conviction or juvenile adjudication for purposes of disqualifications or
disabilities imposed by law on conviction of a crime. An individual may obtain
only one discharge and dismissal under this subsection. The court shall
maintain a nonpublic record of the matter while proceedings are deferred and
the individual is on probation and if there is a discharge and dismissal under
this subsection. The Secretary of State shall retain a nonpublic record of a
plea and of the discharge and dismissal under this subsection. These records
shall be furnished to any of the following:
         A.   To a court, prosecutor, or police agency on request for the
purpose of determining if an individual has already utilized this subsection.
         B.   To the Department of Corrections, a prosecutor, or a law
enforcement agency, on the Department's, a prosecutor's, or a law enforcement
agency’s request, subject to all of the following conditions: At the time of
the request, the individual is an employee of the Department of Corrections,
the prosecutor, or the law enforcement agency, or an applicant for employment
with the Department of Corrections, the prosecutor, or the law enforcement
agency.
         C.   The record is used by the Department of Corrections, the
prosecutor, or the law enforcement agency only to determine whether an employee
has violated his or her conditions of employment or whether an applicant meets
criteria for employment.
      (4)   A misdemeanor violation of subsection (A) successfully deferred,
discharged, and dismissed under subsection (C) is considered a prior judgment
for the purposes of subsection (a)(1)C.
      (5)   A court may order an individual found responsible for or convicted
of violating subsection (a)(1) to undergo screening and assessment by a person
or agency as designated by the department-designated community mental health
entity as defined in section 100a of the Mental Health Code, 1974 PA 258,
M.C.L. A. 330.1100a, to determine whether the individual is likely to benefit
from rehabilitative services, including alcohol or drug education and alcohol
or drug treatment programs. A court may order an individual subject to a
misdemeanor conviction or juvenile adjudication of, or placed on probation
regarding, a violation of subsection (a)(1) to submit to a random or regular
preliminary chemical breath analysis. The parent, guardian, or custodian of a
minor who is less than eighteen years of age and not emancipated under 1968 PA
293, M.C.L.A. 722.1 to 722.6, may request a random or regular preliminary
chemical breath analysis as part of the probation.
      (6)   The Secretary of State shall suspend the operator's or chauffeur's
license of an individual convicted of a second or subsequent violation of
subsection (a)(1) or of violating subsection (a)(2) as provided in section 319
of the Michigan Vehicle Code, 1949 PA 300, M.C.L.A. 257.319.
      (7)   A peace officer who has reasonable cause to believe a minor has
consumed alcoholic liquor or has any bodily alcohol content may request that
individual to submit to a preliminary chemical breath analysis. If a minor does
not consent to a preliminary chemical breath analysis, the analysis shall not
be administered without a court order, but a peace officer may seek to obtain a
court order. The results of a preliminary chemical breath analysis or other
acceptable blood alcohol test are admissible in a state civil infraction
proceeding or criminal prosecution to determine if the minor has consumed or
possessed alcoholic liquor or had any bodily alcohol content.
      (8)   A law enforcement agency, on determining that an individual who is
less than eighteen years of age and not emancipated under 1968 PA 293, M.C.L.A.
722.1 to 722.6, allegedly consumed, possessed, or purchased alcoholic liquor,
attempted to consume, possess, or purchase alcoholic liquor, or had any bodily
alcohol content in violation of subsection (a)(1) shall notify the parent or
parents, custodian, or guardian of the individual as to the nature of the
violation if the name of a parent, guardian, or custodian is reasonably
ascertainable by the law enforcement agency. The law enforcement agency shall
notify the parent, guardian, or custodian not later than forty-eight hours
after the law enforcement agency determines that the individual who allegedly
violated subsection (a)(1) is less than eighteen years of age and not
emancipated under 1968 PA 293, M.C.L.A. 722.1 to 722.6. The law enforcement
agency may notify the parent, guardian, or custodian by any means reasonably
calculated to give prompt actual notice including, but not limited to, notice
in person, by telephone, or by first-class mail. If an individual less than
seventeen years of age is incarcerated for violating subsection (a)(1), his or
her parents or legal guardian shall be notified immediately as provided in this
subsection.
      (9)   This section does not prohibit a minor from possessing alcoholic
liquor during regular working hours and in the course of his or her employment
if employed by a person licensed by this act, by the commission, or by an agent
of the commission, if the alcoholic liquor is not possessed for his or her
personal consumption.
      (10)   The following individuals are not considered to be in violation of
subsection (a)(1):
         A.   A minor who has consumed alcoholic liquor and who voluntarily
presents himself or herself to a health facility or agency for treatment or for
observation including, but not limited to, medical examination and treatment
for any condition arising from a violation of sections 520b to 520g of the
Michigan Penal Code, 1931 PA 328, M.C.L.A. 750.520b to 750.520g, committed
against a minor.
         B.   A minor who accompanies an individual who meets both of the
following criteria:
            1.   Has consumed alcoholic liquor; and
            2.   Voluntarily presents himself or herself to a health facility
or agency for treatment or for observation including, but not limited to,
medical examination and treatment for any condition arising from a violation of
sections 520b to 520g of the Michigan Penal Code, 1931 PA 328, M.C.L.A.
750.520b to 750.520g, committed against a minor.
         C.   A minor who initiates contact with a peace officer or emergency
medical services personnel for the purpose of obtaining medical assistance for
a legitimate health care concern.
      (11)   If a minor who is less than eighteen years of age and who is not
emancipated under 1968 PA 293, M.C.L.A. 722.1 to 722.6, voluntarily presents
himself or herself to a health facility or agency for treatment or for
observation as provided under subsection (a)(10), the health facility or agency
shall notify the parent or parents, guardian, or custodian of the individual as
to the nature of the treatment or observation if the name of a parent,
guardian, or custodian is reasonably ascertainable by the health facility or
agency.
      (12)   This section does not limit the civil or criminal liability of a
vendor or the vendor's clerk, servant, agent, or employee for a violation of
this act.
      (13)   The consumption of alcoholic liquor by a minor who is enrolled in
a course offered by an accredited post secondary educational institution in an
academic building of the institution under the supervision of a faculty member
is not prohibited by this act if the purpose of the consumption is solely
educational and is a requirement of the course.
      (14)   The consumption by a minor of sacramental wine in connection with
religious services at a church, synagogue, or temple is not prohibited by this
act.
      (15)   Subsection (a)(1) does not apply to a minor who participates in
either or both of the following:

alcoholic liquor under the direction of the person's employer and with the
prior approval of the local prosecutor's office as part of an employer-
sponsored internal enforcement action; and/or
         B.   An undercover operation in which the minor purchases or receives
alcoholic liquor under the direction of the state police, the commission, or a
local police agency as part of an enforcement action unless the initial or
contemporaneous purchase or receipt of alcoholic liquor by the minor was not

agency and was not part of the undercover operation.
      (16)   The state police, the commission, or a local police agency shall
not recruit or attempt to recruit a minor for participation in an undercover

(1), or M.C.L.A. 436.1801(2).
      (17)   In a prosecution for the violation of subsection (a)(1) concerning
a minor having any bodily alcohol content, it is an affirmative defense that

      (1)   Determination of a Potentially Dangerous Dog. The determination
that a dog is potentially dangerous shall be based on the following specific
behaviors exhibited by the dog:

toward, or otherwise threatens or endangers the safety of a person or domestic
animal.
         B.   Causes injury to a person or domestic animal that is less than a
severe injury. For purposes of this section, the term "severe" injury means

this section, the term "aggressively bites" means the dog physically bit the
person or animal in a manner not normally associated with playfulness or
accidental behavior while exhibiting objective signs of aggression, attack
behavior, or intent to harm. The damage inflicted by a bite, or lack thereof,

a bite was aggressive.

and documented in an official report of any law enforcement or animal control
agency.
      (2)   Notice of Determination. An Animal Control Deputy shall have the

dangerous classification after the dog has resided and been licensed within the
County for a minimum of three (3) full years following the date that the dog is
licensed with the County as a potentially dangerous dog without any violations
of the conditions required for keeping the potentially dangerous dog and
without any new incidents involving behavior by the dog that would qualify for
a potentially dangerous determination pursuant to this section. The removal
request shall be sent in writing to animal control. The decision to remove the
potentially dangerous classification shall be made in the first instance by
animal control upon a review of the history of the dog and its residence for
the three (3) years preceding the date of the removal request, including a
premises inspection and an inspection of the dog to ensure that the conditions
set forth in this section have been followed.
      (3)   Mitigating Circumstances. An Animal Control Deputy shall have
discretion to refrain from making a potentially dangerous determination if the
Animal Control Officer determines that the behavior was the result of the
victim abusing or tormenting the dog, was directed toward a trespasser or
person committing or attempting to commit a crime, involved accidental or
instinctive behavior while playing, did not involve a significant injury, or
other similar mitigating or extenuating circumstances.
      (4)   Impoundment. A dog that is determined to be potentially dangerous
shall be removed from the municipality and placed with the Department or, in
the discretion of Animal Control, the owner may authorize placement of the dog

organization or qualified dog lodging business, during any quarantine period
and until the owner has either confirmed a new place of residence for the dog

must first be microchipped with all information required by Animal Control. All
impoundment, lodging, and microchipping costs are the sole responsibility of
the dog's owner.

The dog may not return to its Township residence until these requirements have
been met, but it may be kept at a qualified rescue or dog housing business
until proof of successful completion of the program is submitted to, and
acknowledged by, Animal Control. For every future violation of this chapter for
which a dog may be determined to be potentially dangerous which occurs after
the dog has completed the requirements of this subsection and been properly
registered under this section, additional training or testing, including but
not limited to renewing the dog's compliance with this division, may be imposed
by Animal Control as a condition of continuing to keep the dog within the
Township unless the dog's status is changed to dangerous due to the nature or
frequency of the new violation(s).

old, has been spayed or neutered.

has been permanently removed from the Township, has died, or has relocated
within the Township. The new address of a relocated potentially dangerous dog
shall be provided as part of the report.
         D.   After its initial registration, a potentially dangerous dog shall
be registered with the Department annually and its owner or keeper shall pay a
registration fee established by the Macomb Office of the County Executives
annual discretionary fees approval process. This registration and fee shall be
in addition to any other requirements for annual licensing of an animal.
      (6)   Visiting Dogs. Any dog that does not reside within the municipality
and is licensed by another community but which is determined to be a
potentially dangerous dog pursuant to this section shall not be subject to the
conditions for possessing a potentially dangerous dog within the municipality,

microchipping costs shall be paid by the owner, and its owner and keeper shall
be advised by Animal Control that the dog is not to return unless all of the

finds graffiti to be a nuisance subject to removal according to the provisions
and procedures herein contained and as may otherwise be provided by law.
   (c)   It is the duty of both the owner of the property to which the graffiti

possess, such property, to at all times keep such property free and clear of
graffiti.
   (d)   Whenever, in the opinion of the Building Department Superintendent or
his or her designee, the Ordinance Enforcement Officer, or the Department of
Public Works Superintendent or his or her designee, any Township-owned or non-

of Public Works or his or her designee shall notify, in writing, the owner of
the property upon which the graffiti has been removed, and issue a statement

   The test to be applied in cases under Section

those whom it is likely to reach, that is, its impact upon the average person
in the community.
   The book, picture or other subject matter of the complaint must be judged as
a whole in its entire context, as to whether or not its appeals to the prurient

book or other publication which is contrary to any provision of this chapter,

paper, writing paper, phonograph record, picture drawing, photograph, motion
picture film, figure, image, or wire or tape recording of any written, printed

characterized by its emphasis on matters depicting, describing or relating to
specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas, as defined in
Section

into auditory, visual or sensory representations of such character, manifestly
tending to corrupt the morals of youth, or introduce into a family, school or
place of education, or buy, procure, receive or have in his or her possession,
any obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or indecent book, magazine, pamphlet,
newspaper, story paper, writing paper, phonograph record, picture, drawing,
photograph, motion picture film, figure, image, or wire or tape recording, of
any written, printed or recorded matter of an indecent character, which is
distinguished or characterized by its emphasis on matters depicting, describing
or relating to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas, which
may or may not require mechanical or other means to be transmuted into
auditory, visual or sensory representations of such character, either for the
purpose of sale, exhibition, loan or circulation to a person under the age of
eighteen years or with intent to introduce the same into a family, school or
place of education.
(Ord. 237. Passed 7-22-74.)
680.07   DISPLAYING MATTER HARMFUL TO JUVENILES.
   A proprietor, occupant or owner of any building in which magazines that
contain specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas are sold,
loaned, given away or transmitted, such as Playboy, Swank, Penthouse, and the
like, shall display such magazines in such a restrictive fashion that the

violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 237. Passed 7-22-74.)
680.09   EQUITABLE REMEDIES; CONFISCATION OF MATERIALS.
   In the event that the police do not feel that the penalty section is
sufficient to protect the public interest, the matter may be directed to the
Township Board for consideration of injunctive or other abatement-type action.
In such event, the Township Board shall act as a censor board and if the
Township Board determines that there has been a violation of this chapter of a
type and nature that ought to be immediately abated, it shall have the right to
take whatever legal action is available to the Township. It is hereby
determined that the Township Board, being all elected officials, are a proper
body to make the determination as to whether or not the local community
standards as expressed herein have been violated and a crime or a cause of
action is appropriate.
   In the event that the police can immediately determine that any materials,
books, magazines, pamphlets, newspapers, story papers, writing papers,
phonograph records, pictures, photographs, motion picture films, figures,
images, or wire or tape recordings, of any written, printed or recorded matter,
violate this chapter, and the officer making this determination believes that
to protect the public interest such enumerated materials should be confiscated,
then the Police Department shall have the right to confiscate and secure such
materials until such time as the case concerning the violation is concluded
and/or a proper order of any court of competent jurisdiction has determined in
what manner such materials shall be disposed of.

state the reason the information should be treated as proprietary and the facts

material withheld as proprietary. The Township shall weigh the policy
considerations favoring nondisclosure against the reasons cited for permitting
inspection in light of the facts of the particular case. The Township shall
then promptly notify the requesting entity and the regulated cable operator
that submitted the information as to the disposition of the request. The
Township may grant, deny or condition a request. The requesting party or the
regulated cable operator may seek review of the decision by filing an appeal in
any appropriate forum. Disclosure shall be stayed pending resolution of any
appeal.
   (f)   The procedure set forth in this section shall be construed as being
analogous to and consistent with FCC Rules and Regulations regarding requests

reports as required by this chapter shall not invalidate the decisions or
proceedings of the franchising authority.

850.01   SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter may be known and may be cited as the Charter Township of
Clinton “Massage Establishment Ordinance.”
(Ord. 376. Passed 6-16-08; Ord. 423. Passed 6-13-16.)
850.02   INTENT.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and
welfare by licensing and regulating massage establishments, massage schools,
and other similar businesses and the persons working in such massage
establishments. The Board of Trustees finds and determines that licensing
standards pertaining to massage establishment activities are necessary to
protect the public health and safety and the personal safety of massage
therapist/myomassologist. The Board of Trustees further finds that public
health and safety is best served by the adoption of a model ordinance providing
for regulation of massage activities in a manner that is consistent throughout
the Charter Township of Clinton. The purpose of this ordinance is to insure the
protection of the public health and safety and the personal safety of massage
therapist/myomassologist through the establishment of certain licensing
standards pertaining to massage therapy business activities within the Township
and to recognize massage therapy as a legitimate business occupation and health
enhancement service. The Township Board further recognizes that human
trafficking is a significant problem in the United States, that it can involve
the use of massage establishments or massologist activities as a front where
victims are forced into involuntary servitude, deceived into debt bondage and
forced against their will to perform sex acts. The Federal government has
passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and statistics have been
accumulated by the United States Department of State as well as the United
States Department of Justice and independent researchers and analysts. Human
trafficking is ranked behind only drugs and arms trafficking as profitable
criminal activity. It is estimated that more than eighty percent of trafficking
victims are female and eighty percent of trafficking involves sexual
exploitation. Physical injury and disease are other consequences of trafficking
exploitation. Substantial portions of persons who are subject to trafficking
are under the age of eighteen. Numerous studies exist outlining the various
aspects of human trafficking including trafficking within the United States
warranting the adoption of ordinance provisions in order to assist in detecting
possible human trafficking. The holding of any massage business license is
hereby declared to be a privilege, and not a right. The provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion
of the public health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the Township
receiving services from massage establishments.
(Ord. 376. Passed 6-16-08; Ord. 423. Passed 6-13-16.)

licensee may also constitute a violation by the owner, president, and/or other
supervisory official of the licensee, in his or her individual capacity, for
permitting another to violate this chapter, if such individual knew or should
have known that such activities were occurring or likely to occur. Any such
violation may be the basis for suspending, revoking, or not renewing a license.
   (n)   Any applicant or licensee shall be subject to denial, nonrenewal,

   (a)   Within ten days of issuance of notification of suspension, revocation,
or denial of a license according to this chapter, an applicant may request, in
the form of a written application to the Township Clerk, a reconsideration
hearing before the Zoning Board of Appeals. Such application may request either
reconsideration of the suspension, revocation, or denial, or a variance of any
of the provisions or requirements of any law, ordinance, code, or regulation
the violations of which constituted grounds for the suspension, revocation, or
denial, or both.
   (b)   The appeal must state specifically the applicant's reasons for
believing the actions of the applicable Township official were erroneous, and a

proposed massage establishment or massage therapist/ myomassologist; and/or
      (2)   That the granting of such massage business license or massage
therapist/myomassologist’s license will not, under the circumstances of the
particular case, have a material adverse effect upon the health, safety, or
welfare of the persons residing or working in the neighborhood or attending any
massage establishment, and will not, under the circumstances of the particular
case, be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the
immediate neighborhood or the Township at large.
   (d)   In all cases where the Zoning Board of Appeals grants a variance of
any provision or requirements of this chapter, or otherwise relaxes or
overturns an administrative decision to suspend, revoke, or deny, the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall condition its order in any manner it deems necessary or
desirable and which will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of
this chapter, and which will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.
   (e)   In no event shall the Zoning Board of Appeals grant a variance or
relax or overturn an administrative decision where the suspension, revocation,
or denial is based upon the occurrence of criminal acts, fraud, dishonesty, or
other acts of moral turpitude, if established at the hearing by a simple
preponderance of the evidence.
(Ord. 376. Passed 6-16-08; Ord. 423. Passed 6-13-16.)

fifty-one percent of the area in the district and shall present the petition to
the Township Board.
         D.   Upon certification that the petition represents not less than
fifty-one percent of the area in the district, the Township Clerk shall submit
the petition to the Township Board for its consideration in accordance with Act
80 of the Public Acts of 1989, as amended, or any other Act then permitted for
the creation of a street lighting assessment district, at which time the
Township Board shall determine whether to adopt the first resolution, and if
the Township Board decides to adopt Resolution No. 1 and defray the expenses by
a special assessment district, then the Board shall set a date for a public
hearing as provided with the by law with the proper requirements of publication
and the like.
         E.   If the Township Board determines to create the special assessment
district and to defray part or all of the cost thereof, the Township Board
shall order the assessment to be spread upon the assessment roll on a front
footage basis and become due and collected as other taxes are assessed, levied
and collected, and the same shall be returned in the same manner for non-
payment, and the Township shall thereupon direct the Township Clerk to forward
the order to the Detroit Edison Company for proper construction of the
improvements.
         F.   Before the Township Clerk shall commence any of the work
concerning the procedure for a street lighting district, he or she shall

certifying the petitions and the publication proposed.
      (2)   For Residential Districts other than single-family.
         A.   In the event a street lighting district petition is delivered or
a street lighting district is requested for a residential development other
than single family, then, prior to the inauguration of the steps set forth in
paragraphs (b)(1)D., E. and F. hereof, the petitioner shall present to the
Township Clerk the necessary legal instruments indicating that the petitioner
has the authority to make this request and legally accept the responsibility
for the assessments in the future, or that the petitioner has the right to
collect the assessments from the occupiers of the property, and the petitioner
shall present to the Township Clerk a letter from its own attorney indicating
the documents and section numbers or appropriate reference to facilitate the
Township's verification of this information, and the petitioner shall certify,

proper entity to make this request. There shall be an additional charge of
thirty-five dollars ($35.00) for the Township's verification of the
petitioner's information over and above the fee provided in paragraph (b)(1)F.
for single-family homes.
         B.   The rates mentioned in this section may be adjusted from time to
time, as needed, by the Clinton Township Board by proper resolution of said

1022.01   CONSTRUCTION, MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR; COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   The construction, maintenance and repair of any sidewalk located on any
public right-of-way or any other place open to the public within the Charter
Township of Clinton shall be in compliance with the requirements of this
chapter, and any waiver, of or variance from such requirements shall be in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 195-A-2. Passed 5-7-90.)
1022.02   WHEN SIDEWALKS ARE REQUIRED.
   (a)   Sidewalks shall be required whenever a building permit is issued in
connection with the construction of a principal structure or improvements,
additions or modifications to a structure resulting in an enclosed structure of
300 square feet or more. Enclosed structure shall mean an addition or detached
structure with walls and a roof. In all other instances the owners of land held
jointly and severally shall be required to install sidewalks where the Township
Board determines that such installation is in the interest of public health,

(Ord. 195-A-2. Passed 5-7-90.)
   (b)   Sidewalks shall be required to be installed in compliance with the
provisions of this chapter by adjacent property owners where sidewalks will be
located along major or secondary thoroughfares as defined by the Macomb County
Road Commission. The Superintendent of the Department of Public Works shall
determine and recommend to the Board of Trustees whether the installation of
sidewalks will assist in the completion of an inter-connected system for
pedestrian traffic along such a thoroughfare. Upon making such determination,
notice shall be provided to the property owners of record, as determined by
either assessment records of the Charter Township of Clinton or records of the
Macomb County Register of Deeds. Persons objecting shall have an opportunity to
appeal the recommendation of the Superintendent of Public Works by filing such
appeal on a form with the Department of Public Works within seven days after
the date notice is mailed. The appeal shall be heard by a Sidewalk Review
Committee consisting of three persons appointed by the Supervisor of the
Township. Appointments shall be for one year and those appointed shall be
subject to removal for cause. The Committee shall review the question of
necessity determining the need for safe travel for pedestrians in relation to
any hardship to the property owner.
   The Township Board may order the construction, repair or maintenance of, or
may construct, repair or maintain sidewalks in a designated area within the
Township because of the health, safety, or welfare of the residents of the
Township.
(Ord. 195-A-4. Passed 11-23-92; Ord. 346. Passed 6-30-03.)
1022.03   DUTIES OF PROPERTY OCCUPANTS AND OWNERS INVOLVING MAINTENANCE AND
REMOVAL OF OBSTRUCTION.
   It is the duty of every owner and/or occupant of land within the Charter
Township of Clinton to keep and maintain the paved sidewalk, paved bicycle
path, paved hike/bike trail, or other paved areas in the public right-of-way
and upon the public right-of-way contiguous to such owner's property. Such duty
shall not apply to any such paved surface which is at the rear or side yard of
the property and parallel to a thoroughfare or collector road where such
property has a paved sidewalk, bicycle path, or hike/bike trail contiguous to
the front yard of such property. In the case of corner lots, both the front
yard paved areas and side yard paved areas shall be maintained as provided.
Paved surfaces shall be maintained in the following manner:
   (a)   It shall be kept free from defects in the paved surface of every kind
and nature and maintained in a condition of repair.
   (b)   It shall be kept free from deposits of debris, rubbish, or other
objects including the growth of vegetation between cracks or within the area
for travel.
   (c)   It shall be kept clear from accumulations of snow, sleet, ice and

   (d)   It shall be kept free from the obstruction or encroachment from
adjacent property of vegetation, tree limbs, bushes, and other objects.
   (e)   It shall be kept free from obstructions from adjacent property
interfering with sight distance lines at driveways and other sidewalks
intersecting such sidewalk, such that a clear and unobstructed sight triangle
is maintained, using as a base leg from the sight obstruction to any sidewalk
or driveway 15 feet.
   Owner of land shall mean the record owner as disclosed through records at
the office and the County Register of Deeds or through the office of the
Assessor of the Township. In the event of more than one owner and/or occupant,
each shall be jointly and severally liable for failure to comply with this
section.
   In the event that an accumulation of snow, ice, sleet, or water has not been
removed within a twenty-four (24) hour period following the conclusion of any
rain or snow event from which it arose in whole or in part, the Township may
issue a written notification to the owner of record, demanding removal of ice
or snow within 48 hours. In the event ice or snow is not removed, the Township
may remove the ice and snow and assess the cost to the adjoining property which
if it remains unpaid for an excess of 30 days, may as an additional remedy for
collection, be added to and collected in the same manner as ad valorem, real
property taxes, including interest and penalties. The initial charge shall be a
minimum of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) with a charge of two dollars
($2.00) per foot for any footage in excess of 50 feet. This remedy shall be
considered supplemental to and not in conflict with the remedies provided under
Section
1022.11.
(Ord. 195-A-2. Passed 5-7-90; Ord. 419. Passed 12-14-15; Ord. 487. Passed 12-4-
23.)
1022.04   CONSTRUCTION OR REPAIR; PERMIT REQUIRED.
   Except as otherwise provided herein, no person, firm or corporation shall
construct or repair any sidewalk in the Charter Township of Clinton without a
permit. The Department of Public Works is authorized to issue such permit or
waiver of a permit upon application on forms provided by such Department. Such
permit shall contain at least the following information:
   (a)   Date of issuance and name and address of owner of the property.
   (b)   Description of the sidewalk to be constructed or repaired, including
estimated square feet of work to be done and a description of location relative
to public right-of-way.
   (c)   A statement signed by the applicant and owner agreeing to conform to
the specifications and regulations of this chapter.
      (1)   Where the sidewalk to be constructed will be located in whole or in
part of the right-of-way adjacent to a road under the jurisdiction of the State
Transportation Department or County Road Commission, no sidewalk permit shall
issue from the Department of Public Works until written approval of such
applicable governmental entity is obtained.
      (2)   A permit is not required for a Rehabilitation/Maintenance project
as defined in Section 128.04(f)(1) so long as a waiver is obtained. By electing
to proceed without a permit, the owner of the property and any tenant(s), where
applicable, agree to hold harmless the township, including all elected and
appointed officials and employees, against and from any and all liabilities,
obligations, damages, penalties, claims, costs, charges, losses and expense
(including without limitation, fees and expenses of attorney’s, expert
witnesses and other consultants) which may be imposed upon, incurred by or
asserted against the township in relation to the paving project. A paving
application for a Rehabilitation/Maintenance project with supporting
documentation as requested by the Department of Public Services and/or/Building
Department is still required to be submitted to the Department of Public
Services and/or Building Department in order to determine if a permit should be
required.
      (3)   A private sidewalk is a sidewalk located exclusively on private
property and not located in an easement or right-of-way dedicated or owned by a
governmental entity.
         (Ord. 195-A-2. Passed 5-7-90; Ord. 497. Passed 5-5-25.)
1022.05   PERMIT FEE.
   The Department of Public Services and/or Building Department shall charge a
fee for the issuance of any sidewalk permit, where permits are required, in an
amount as established by resolution of the Township Board. Driveway approaches,
aprons and other areas of concrete to be used by the general public located
within the street right-of-way shall be included.
(Ord. 195-A-2. Passed 5-7-90; Ord. 497. Passed 5-5-25.)
1022.06   SPECIFICATIONS.
   All sidewalks or the repair thereof shall comply with the specifications
provided within the Township Standard Paving Detail Sheet as amended.
(Ord. 195-A-2. Passed 5-7-90; Ord. 369. Passed 5-14-07.)
1022.07   ALIGNMENT AND GRADE.
   All sidewalks shall conform to the following alignment and grade
requirements:
   (a)   Alignment. Sidewalks constructed within the street right-of-way shall
be located in a manner such that the edge of the sidewalk parallel to and
farthest from the roadway shall be one foot from the right-of-way line or at
any other location as approved by the Township Engineer and as permitted by the
Macomb County Road Commission or the Michigan Department of Transportation. In
any such case where sidewalks have been constructed prior to the effective date
of this chapter, any additional sidewalk to be constructed hereafter may be in
alignment with the existing sidewalk to the roadway of the nearest intersecting
street. It is the duty of the contractor or other person installing such
sidewalk to accurately survey or otherwise determine the location of the right-
of-way line prior to installing such sidewalk. Where installation or
replacement of a sidewalk within the right-of-way is impractical due to cost or
other factors, the Township may negotiate the exchange of an easement in order
to permit sidewalk installation within a granted easement area providing
suitable alignment as determined by the Township. The Township may not compel
the conveyance of any such easement and any negotiations shall not diminish the
obligation of the property owner to otherwise complete the installation or
replacement of a sidewalk within the right-of-way abutting such property if any
attempted negotiations are unsuccessful.
   (b)   Enclosed Storm Drainage Necessary for Construction of Sidewalks in
Streets Having a Right-of-Way of Sixty Feet or Less. Where streets have a
right-of-way of sixty feet or less, enclosed storm drainage shall be installed
parallel to any required sidewalk utilizing permanent corrugated tubing or pipe
placed in a grade and manner for proper street drainage with materials and
design subject to approval by the Macomb County Road Commission and the Charter
Township of Clinton. Catch basins may be required at no greater than 200 feet
intervals and final grade shall be subject to approval by the Township
Engineer.
   (c)   Grade of Sidewalks Where Right-of-Way is Sixty Feet or Less. Where the
adjacent road has a curb the sidewalk shall be constructed to a grade
established at a slope of three-eighths of an inch per foot above the curb as
measured from the curb to the nearest edge of the sidewalk to the curb. When
the road does not have a curb, the sidewalk shall be constructed in a manner
such that the edge of the sidewalk farthest from the roadbed shall be
established at an elevation midway between the elevation of the center line of
the street and the elevation of the adjoining houses, subject to a minimum
elevation of six inches below the outside grade of adjacent houses and not more
than an elevation of nine inches above the center line of the street or as
approved by the Township Building Official.
   (d)   Grade of Sidewalks on Streets With Right-of-Way Greater Than Sixty
Feet. The grade of sidewalks shall be established by the Township Engineer in a
manner consistent with grade specifications set forth above altered as
necessary for existing conditions and the width of such right-of- way.
      (Ord. 195-A-2. Passed 5-7-90; Ord. 490. Passed 5-13-24.)
1022.08   SIDEWALKS ON CORNER LOTS.
   Sidewalks shall be constructed on the front and side of corner lots and at
the rear or other portion of any such lot abutting a public right-of-way. Any
sidewalk located upon or adjacent to any corner lot shall be continued to the
edge of the roadway adjoining said corner lot. In addition to the
specifications hereinbefore set forth, the contractor or other person
constructing said sidewalk shall install any necessary length of culvert pipe
or head wall, in accordance with specifications provided by the Township
Engineer, in the road ditch to enable the sidewalk to be constructed to the
edge of the roadway.
(Ord. 195-A-2. Passed 5-7-90.)
1022.09   IDENTIFICATION AND LIABILITY OF CONTRACTOR; STENCILING.
   All sidewalk improvements, additions, modifications, repairs or
installations in the Charter Township of Clinton shall require the following:
   (a)   At the time of filing for a permit, the contractor or person
installing such sidewalk shall furnish his or her true and correct address and
any other identifying data as established and required by resolution of the
Township Board.
   (b)   A stencil marking shall be indented into the concrete work at both
ends of any project site identifying the installer's name and the year of
installation such that the commencement and end of the project area can be
readily ascertained. Stencil markings shall be located two feet from the
property line and two feet from the outside edge of the beginning and end of
the project.
   (c)   As a condition of permit issuance, or waiver of permit issuance, the
contractor and the property owner shall remain liable for any and all defects
and repairs for a period of eighteen months, including both defects and repairs
occasioned by settling, the weather, erosion, tree roots or any other causes as
determined by the Township Building Department. This section does not relieve
the adjoining property owner from liability as provided in other sections of
this chapter. The adjoining property owner or owners shall be entitled to
indemnification from such contractor for any repairs performed for a period of
two years.
      (Ord. 195-A-2. Passed 5-7-90; Ord. 497. Passed 5-5-25.)
1022.10   SIDEWALK FUND.
   In addition to any other permits or fees required herein the Township Board
shall establish by resolution a sidewalk fund charge. Upon the issuance of any
permit hereunder, an additional portion of such permit fee shall be required to
be paid which shall be deposited in a sidewalk repair fund which shall be used
exclusively to repair sidewalks. Establishment of this fund does not modify the
obligation of the adjoining property owners with regard to repair and
maintenance of sidewalks nor does it limit or relieve persons installing such
sidewalk from liability thereon for defects in workmanship, materials or the
like. The Township Board, upon the recommendation of the Department of Public
Works, may authorize expenditures for repairs and maintenance required within
eighteen months from issuance of a permit.
(Ord. 195-A-2. Passed 5-7-90.)
1022.11   DUTY TO MAKE REPAIRS, ELIMINATE DEFECTS AND ENCROACHMENTS AND INSTALL
SIDEWALKS.
   Sidewalks damaged prior to occupancy shall be fully repaired prior to the
date of issuance of a final occupancy certificate or, in lieu thereof, a cash
escrow for repairs shall be posted with the township in an amount as determined
by the Building Department or the Department of Public Works.
   An owner or owners of property shall, jointly and severally, in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter, maintain the sidewalk free from defects
and encroachments and in good repair.
   When the sidewalk to be installed or requiring repair, maintenance or
reconstruction is contiguous or adjacent to more than one lot or parcel, costs
of such work shall be prorated on the basis of front footage between the
property owners. Failure of one abutting property owner to undertake such work
where the sidewalk abuts more than a single parcel shall not excuse the
remaining property owner from the duties established herein.
   Property owners are jointly and severally liable pursuant to the following
subsections:
   (a)   Notice. Upon a determination by the Board of Trustees of the Charter
Township of Clinton that a sidewalk is required to be constructed, repaired or
maintained, the Department of Public Works shall serve a written notice upon
the owner or owners.
      Owners of the property shall be determined either from the most current
Township tax assessment rolls or from records containing any address as may be
available in the office of the Register of Deeds for the County of Macomb. Such
owner or owners shall be notified in any of the following ways: personal
delivery of a copy of such notice; leaving a copy of such notice with some
person of suitable age and discretion who is a member of the household at the
residence of such owner; or mailing a copy of such notice, first class mail,
addressed to the last known address of such owner. The notice shall be in

PENALTIES.
   (b)   Procedures for Construction, Repair and Maintenance. The Department of
Public Works shall investigate and make a recommendation to the Township Board,

sidewalk. Following receipt of the recommendation from the Department of Public
Works, the Township Board shall hold a public meeting relative to ordering
sidewalk construction, repair or maintenance after advising property owners by
first class mail of the time and place for hearing. If the Board determines
that construction, repair or maintenance is necessary, upon the exhaustion of
appeal procedures before the Sidewalk Review Committee as appointed pursuant to
Section
1022.02, the Department of Public Works shall review the subject property to
determine whether a timely or proper installation, repair or reconstruction has
occurred. If the same has not occurred, the Township may construct, repair or

1022.12   APPEALS.
   (a)   Inclement Winter Weather. In the event of a hardship resulting from

utilizing Standards set forth herein, may determine that a sidewalk shall be
constructed in the future. In such event, the Township Board shall comply with
the following procedures and requirements.
      (1)   Escrow guarantee. Where such sidewalk is to be constructed in the

commencement and completion of the project. Time for commencement shall not
exceed one year. The time for completion shall be established with input from
the Department of Public Works. In the event commencement does not take place
within the time provided by the Township Board, funds deposited in the escrow
account are deemed forfeited to the Township without the need of further notice
or action and the Township shall use such funds for construction of sidewalks
at the proposed location. Any surplus shall be deposited into the General Fund
of the Township and in the event of any deficiency, the cost of completion of
the sidewalk shall be charged against the owners of the property in accordance
with the provisions of Section
1022.11. In the event the sidewalk has not been completed within the time
provided, the Township may complete construction utilizing funds in escrow.
Upon completion, any surplus greater than twenty percent of such original
escrow amount shall be refunded to the owner with the balance deposited in the
Township General Fund. Any deficiency shall be collected in a manner as
provided pursuant to Section
1022.11(b).

(Ord. 319. Passed 12-22-97; Ord. 482. Passed 10-24-22.)
1040.13   METERS.
   (a)   All premises using water supplied by the Water and Sewers Department
shall be metered. The premises shall pay for water and sewerage at the rates
established by resolution of the Township Board from time to time, copies of
which shall be kept at the Township Clerk’s office. All water supplied shall be
charged at the established water and sewer rate. For new construction supply
purposes, a minimum bill will be charged for each premises for a three-month
period and payments shall be made in advance. The minimum bill shall be three
times the one-inch readiness to serve unit fee and 15 times the per unit usage
charge. Temporary water service shall automatically shut off three months after
the water tap is made.
   (b)   Meters will be furnished by the Department and are, and shall remain,
the property of the Department and will at all times be under its control.
   (c)   For single-family homes, townhouses, detached condominium units,
attached condominium units designed for single-family use, and non-residential
establishments similar units designed to be occupied by one family, a one-inch
meter will be installed for all new construction or building renovation. For
residential multiple dwelling buildings with two to ten dwelling units, the
meter size shall be one inch. For non-residential establishments, separate
water meters shall be required for each unit in the building. A separate tap
will be required to the public water main stubbed in the building.
   (d)   Alternatively, an adequately sized single water service can be
provided to a non-residential building with multiple units under the following
conditions:
      (1)   A heated meter room with a keyed access given to the Department
must be incorporated into the building layout.
      (2)   An individual meter must be provided for each unit.
      (3)   The owner shall also enter into an agreement with the Township
ensuring unrestricted access and heat that space.
      (4)   Each meter is required to have a lock wing ball valve with non-
removable cap (i.e. Mueller Co. part #B20200N or approved equal by the
Department).
      (5)   There shall be no obstruction or storage of other materials
preventing access to the meter(s) and the address is permanently attached water
service.
      (6)   The Department has the authority to shut off water to the entire
building at the main shutoff if the property owner fails to comply with these
requirements.
   Where a meter larger than one inch is sought, the Superintendent of Clinton
Township Water and Sewer Department, whose decision is final, shall determine
the meter size by evaluating the probable effect of the proposed demand on
capacity upon water and sewer mains and other facilities which would serve the
proposed demand. The user or users shall furnish, in a timely manner, all
plans, drawing specifications, and other information relating to the proposed
demand reasonably requested by the Superintendent in order for a determination
to be made as to meter size. Upon all information being presented, the
Superintendent shall make a determination within 14 days.
   (e)   Meters and outside reading devices shall be set in an accessible
location and in a manner satisfactory to the Superintendent. A drawing and/or
the procedure may be given to the entity upon written request, when the permit
application is made. In no case shall a meter be set in a location where it is
liable to injury or cannot be readily reached by the meter reader. In all cases
where the premises contain no basement or cellar, the meter shall be installed
in a location which shall be approved by the Superintendent. Where it is
necessary to set the meter in a pit inside of a building, such pit shall be
built as directly by the Superintendent and to his or her entire satisfaction.
   (f)   Meters will be sealed by the Department and no one except an
authorized employee of the Department shall break such seals. No person other
than an authorized employee of the Department shall change the location of,
alter or interfere in any way with, any meter. If the seal is discovered
broken, a penalty as set forth in Chapter 209 of the Administration Code, or as
otherwise provided by law, shall be assessed.
   (g)   The expense of installing and maintaining meters will be borne by the
Department, provided that where replacements, repairs or adjustments of the
meter are made necessary by an act or negligence or carelessness of the user or
occupant of any premises, the expense to the Department caused thereby shall be
charged against and collected from the user of the premises. Failure to pay the
expenses will become a lien on the property.
   (h)   The owner or user of any premises where a meter is installed will be
held responsible for its care and protection from freezing and from injury or
interference by any person. In case of damage to the meter or in case of its
stoppage or defective condition, the owner or user shall give immediate notice
to the Department.
   (i)   All Department water used on any premises must pass through the meter.
Any by-pass or connection between the meter and the main is prohibited unless
it is sealed in a manner satisfactory to the Superintendent.
   (j)   If any meter is not working properly or fails to register, the
consumer will be charged at the average quarterly consumption rate as shown by
the meter when registering. The accuracy of the meter on any premises will be
tested by the Department upon written request of the owner, who shall pay in
advance the current published fee to cover the cost of the test. If, on such
test, the meter shall be found to register over 3% more water than actually
passes through it, another meter will be substituted therefor, the fee will be
refunded to the user of the premises and the water bill may be adjusted in such
manner as may be fair and just. For tests of meters larger than two inches, the
user must pay for the cost of the test.
   (k)   Water service installed to supply fire sprinkler systems for fire
protection will be subject to detector check metering for the purpose of
monitoring the system for leaks and/or cross connections. The applicant must
pay the sprinkler meter charge, and obtain the template for the detector check
meter assembly from the Township. Installation of the detector check meter
template shall be the responsibility of the plumber, contractor, or owner and
shall be installed prior to the issuance of any type of certificate of
occupancy for the building receiving the private fire sprinkling system. The
Township shall perform a startup of the water meter on the detector check
bypass after the plumber, contractor, owner, or other person sets the backflow
auxiliary bypass assembly. The Township will begin monitoring the readings on
the meter, and any water passing through said meter will be charged in
accordance with rates set forth in the General Fee Schedule, Chapter 209 of
this code. The Township may from time to time establish charges by resolution
that are appropriate for monitoring private fire lines with a detector check
meter under Chapter 209.
   (l)   Complete submittals for proposed fire sprinkler system detector check
system shall be submitted to the Township before connection to the water
distribution system shall be made. Fire sprinkling backflow assemblies must
have a bypass that can accommodate a detector check water meter assembly.
   (m)   Existing users with fire sprinkling systems require the installation
of a Township detector check water meter. The Township will provide the user
written notification of the requirement which will include a time line to
install a detector check meter assembly.
   (n)   Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the
following regulations shall apply to separately metered outdoor faucets and in-
ground sprinkler systems which shall be allowed only on the following terms and
conditions:
      (1)   Separate meters for connection to outside faucets and sprinkler
systems shall be permitted if the water is not deposited into a sanitary sewer
system by other than accidental absorption; and is used for watering lawns,
watering ornamental flower gardens and residential vegetable gardens for
personal consumption by occupants of the premises, pools, water operated backup
sump pumps; and is used solely upon and at the property where the separate
meter is located; and is not used for any business or commercial purpose other
than those set forth in this subsection or by resolution of the Board.
      (2)   All plumbing and meter installation work shall commence only after
appropriate permits have been obtained and fees paid in full. All plumbing and
meter installation shall be shown on a sketch to ensure full compliance with
this section.
      (3)   All costs associated with the installation of the separate meter
and related plumbing, including but not limited to, meter cost, permit and
inspection fees, and labor and material costs shall be paid by the property
owner. Meter cost (including reader) shall be the standard current charge
established by the Township.
      (4)   Separate meters for outdoor use (deduct meters) shall be read at
the same time as the reading on the first meter. Rates for water use applicable
to the separate meters for outdoor use shall be those set forth in this code
for water rates only, except that the reduced charges per billing period shall
only be applicable to such separate meters in a billing period during which
there is actual water use through the meter. All other penalties, interest,
liens, and remedies related to nonpayment of charges set forth in this section
for the building domestic meter shall apply equally to separate meter for
outdoor use. In event of nonpayment, service to both meters may be discontinued
until payment is made.
      (5)   In the event of tampering or misuse of the separate meter for
outdoor use, a notice of violation will be sent to the customer and the
privilege shall be discontinued. The customer has 30 days to comply with the
notification of violation or file an appeal. The Public Services Director
reserves the right to review and make a determination of the appeal within 30
days of receipt of such appeal. Discontinuation or reinstatement of the deduct
privileges does not relieve a customer from prosecution or relief by the
Township under any other ordinance provision or laws.

of such connection.
   (c)   Connections to the Township water mains or sewers by property owners
outside of the Township limits will be permitted only after application through
the Department to the Board and approval by them, and then under such
conditions as the Board may see fit to impose. All such connections, if
granted, shall comply with the Township specifications for the construction of
mains, services, and appurtenances.
   (d)   In addition to the connection charges required in subsection (b)
hereof, the Township shall charge the applicant, and the applicant shall pay, a
Water System Development Fee (WSDF) and a Sewer System Development Fee (SSDF)
as set forth in Chapter 209 of these Codified Ordinances-the General Fee
Schedule. All applicable debt service fees shall be paid in full prior to the
issuance of an occupancy permit or activation of the actual water service.
   (e)   The Township will review and keep current its General Fee Schedule and
methods and policies in calculating debt service fees, system benefit fees,
connection fees, and any other applicable fees. This review will also include
water and sewer capacity unit recalculations, if any.
(Ord. 319. Passed 12-22-97; Ord. 482. Passed 10-24-22.)
1040.15   INSPECTION FEES; SEWER SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT FEES.
   (a)   Before any person, other than a representative of the Water and Sewers
Department, installs a water service pipe or sanitary sewer service, he or she
shall schedule an inspection at least 24 hours in advance of the time that he
or she intends to do so. He or she shall cover the inspection cost from the
building to the stop box or sewer riser and such expense shall be in addition
to the established tapping fee. Failure to schedule an inspection 24 hours in
advance will result in a second inspection fee being charged.
   (b)   An inspection fee as set forth in
Chapter 209 of these Codified Ordinances (the General Fee Schedule) shall be
charged for inspection of the tapping of a sewer service pipe to a public
sewer. No such tap shall be made without a permit and payment of such fee.
   (c)   In addition to the sewer inspection fee provided for in subsection (b)
hereof, the Township shall charge the applicant and the applicant shall pay a
Sewer System Development Fee (SSDF).
   (d)   No sewer service permit will be issued for sewer service connections
crossing roads or highway rights-of-way unless satisfactory evidence of a cash
deposit or bond, placed with the Road Commission of Macomb County or MDOT, is
submitted to the Department. The release of this cash deposit or bond, back to
the person who placed it, is conditioned upon the applicant’s agreement to
restore said road or highway to its original condition.
(Ord. 319. Passed 12-22-97; Ord. 482. Passed 10-24-22.)
1040.16   USE OF WATER.
   (a)   When new water service pipes are put into any premises, the curb stop
shall be left closed and may thereafter be opened by the Water and Sewers
Department upon request of the owner or his or her agent. No person shall be
permitted to turn the curb stop on or off except a licensed plumber for test
purposes only, in which case the curb stop shall be left in the same condition
and position as found by said plumber.
   (b)   Where a building, originally built as a single building or premises
and fitted with one service pipe, shall thereafter be subdivided by sale, rent,
lease or otherwise, the separate divisions so made must be connected to the
main by separate service pipes and meters within 60 days after such division.
   (c)   Water shall be taken and used only through water service pipes under
the supervision of the Department and no connection through which water may
pass from one property to another shall exist, even though the ownership of
both properties may be the same.
   (d)   Excessive or unnecessary use or waste of water, whether caused by
carelessness or by defective or leaky plumbing or fixtures, is strictly
prohibited. For disregard or repeated violation of this requirement, the water
may be turned off by the Department.
   (e)   Where the water has been turned off by the Department for any reason,
no person, except authorized employees or agents of the Department, may turn it
on again. When this rule is violated, the person so doing shall be liable to
foreclosure and the penalties hereinafter provided, and the water may be shut
off at the corporation cock at the main, in which case the owner shall, before
it is turned on again, pay in advance the charge of the Department therefor,
which shall be fixed by the Superintendent based on time and material plus 50%.
   (f)   No person shall obstruct or interfere with any stop cock, valve or
fixture connected with the Department by placing in or about it building
materials, rubbish, soil, snow or other hindrance to easy and free access
thereto.
   (g)   Any official, the Township Engineer or an inspector, foreman or other
authorized employee of the Department shall have free access at all reasonable
hours to any premises supplied with Department water for the purpose of making
an inspection and/or repair thereof, including the examination of the entire
water supply and plumbing system on said premises. No person shall refuse to
admit the authorized inspectors and employees of the Department to any premises
for any such purpose. In case any authorized employee is refused admittance to
any premises, or, once being admitted, is hindered or prevented from making
such examination, the water shall be turned off from such premises after giving
24 hours notice to the owner or occupant thereof.
(Ord. 319. Passed 12-22-97; Ord. 482. Passed 10-24-22.)
1040.17   WATER RATES.
   (a)   All charges for water and/or sewer made against the user of the
premises supplied, shall be due and payable within 15 days after billing. The
charges for service shall become a lien against the premises furnished service
upon such service being provided. If not paid within 30 days, the water may be
turned off to any premises against which such charges are outstanding. Upon the
water being turned off, the water will not be turned on again until the charges
have been paid, together with the current turn-on fee. A lien against the
premises exists upon the service being furnished.
   (b)   Charges for services furnished to a premise may be placed within the
discretion of the Township, by decision of the head of the Department of Public
Services or such department head’s designee, upon the next tax roll or
subsequent tax rolls and shall be collected and enforced in the same manner as
provided for the collection of real property taxes assessed. The department
head may select the tax roll upon which such charge shall be placed and
collected.
   (c)   Where a single water meter or meters provide water and/or sewer
services to more than a single addressed premises, the lien shall be calculated
by dividing the outstanding amount unpaid by the number of addressed premises,
whether occupied or unoccupied.
   (d)   When a tenant is responsible for payment of the water and/or sewer
bill in a written lease, a landlord may file an affidavit verifying that the
lease has been properly executed and is in effect attaching a copy of the lease
to the affidavit with the Department of Public Services. At the same time, a
deposit as specified in the fee schedule, by resolution of the Township Board,
shall be paid in full. Additionally, the landlord shall, within 20 days,
provide notice of any cancellation, change in lease terms with respect to the
water, or termination of the lease. Upon full compliance by the landlord with
the foregoing, no lien shall accrue against the premises. The landlord shall be
responsible upon expiration, termination or change of any lease terms for
filing another proper affidavit with a copy of the lease. In the event the
water bill remains unpaid for in excess of 30 days, all or any portion of the
deposit may be applied toward any outstanding charges. The cash deposit or any
depleted portion of it, so used, shall be restored in full within 30 days of
any depletion, or a lien otherwise may be imposed, service not restored or shut
off.
   (e)   The proceedings set forth herein are cumulative and any other lawful
enforcement methods for the payment of charges for water service may be
enforced.
   (f)   In the case of temporary vacancy of any premises, the water will be
turned off at the curb stop and the meter removed by the department upon
written request of the owner of the premises to the department and will be
turned on the meter reset when requested, upon payment of all applicable fees
and charges. Water turn-ons will be scheduled with the department during
regular working hours. Water turn-ons occurring beyond regular working hours
will result in double special service charge as otherwise set forth in the fee
schedule ordinance. Charges shall be billed for each visit, regardless of
whether by water turn-on or water turn-off actually occurs.
   (g)   A bill shall be delivered or mailed to the premises to which the water
is supplied, or to a designated mailing address. The Township assumes no
responsibility for the loss or failure of such a bill to reach the proper
person. A charge will be made for all water registered by a meter and no
deduction shall be made for leaks, any alleged inaccuracy of the meter, or
other claimed causes, except as provided in Section
1040.13(i).
   (h)   Payment of all water and sewer charges and other accounts due shall be
made to the Township at locations within the Township as designated by the
Township.
(Ord. 319. Passed 12-22-97; Ord. 398. Passed 5-7-12; Ord. 482. Passed 10-24-
22.)
1040.18   ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES; OVERCHARGES; INTERRUPTION OF WATER OR SEWER
SERVICE.
   (a)   Any building, structure, or other improvement which is erected,
altered, installed or maintained in violation of any of the provisions of this
chapter is hereby declared to be a nuisance per se and the person charged with
enforcement of this chapter may apply to a court of equity for abatement of
such nuisance. The Township shall recover the attorney fees, if successful in
this litigation.
   (b)   Adjustments to water charges may be permitted for a period of time
retroactively six years from the date a written request for adjustment is
submitted. Written requests must be submitted to the Superintendent of the
Department of Public Services in writing with receipt of acknowledgement in
writing or delivered electronically with electronic receipt. No adjustment may
be made for a period greater than six years from the date of receipt of such
request for adjustment. A customer may submit evidence that they determine as
relevant within seven days of the application and a determination shall be made
upon the submittal of evidence in 14 days by the Director of the Department of
Public Services. The Director of the Department of Public Services shall
consider and determine whether an adjustment is appropriate. The burden of
proof is upon the party seeking adjustment. Only the customer of record for
periods for which adjustment is sought, may seek adjustment and receive
adjustment. The Township shall be the sole and final decision maker determining
whether a preponderance of evidence exists, warranting adjustment. Any party
aggrieved from the decision of the Director of Public Services, may apply in
writing, within 14 days to a committee consisting of the Township Supervisor,
Clerk and Treasurer through submitting such requests in writing to the office
of the Township Supervisor. A hearing shall be scheduled within 30 days and a
decision thereafter made within ten days following such request.
   (c)   Should it become necessary to shut off water from any section of the
Township because of accidents or for the purpose of making repairs or
extensions, the Water and Sewers Department will endeavor to give timely notice
to the consumers affected thereby, and will as far as practical use its best
efforts to prevent inconvenience and damage arising from any such causes.
However, the failure to give such notice shall not render the Department
responsible or liable for damages that may result therefrom, or from any other
cause.
   (d)   Should a scheduled interruption of sewer service become necessary, the
Department will endeavor to give timely notice to customers who may be affected
thereby, and will as far as practical use its best efforts to prevent
inconvenience and damage arising from such an interruption. However, the
failure to give notice shall not render the Department responsible or liable
for damages that may result therefrom, or from any other cause. Furthermore,
any other sewer service interruption shall not render the Department
responsible or liable for damages that may result therefrom.

1042.01   OPERATING YEAR.
   The system shall be operated on the basis of an operating year commencing on
April 1 and ending on March 31.
(Ord. 319. Passed 12-22-97.)
1042.02   RATE SCHEDULE.
   Water supply rates and sewage supply rates are based on two charge
components. The first is a “usage charge.” Where a water meter is installed,
the usage charge is based on the consumption of water measured in units or
fractions of units with one unit being the volume of one hundred cubic feet of
water. The second charge is a “readiness to serve charge” which is based on the
capacity of the user to draw water from the public system, and it is calculated
by using the size of the water meter.
   (a)   Water Rates. For purposes of this section, where a residential use is
present, “unit” shall be considered that portion of a structure occupied or
designed for occupancy by one, or two or more persons living together and
occupying that part of a building as a separate housekeeping unit with a common
and single set of culinary facilities. Rates for water and sewage furnished by
the Township shall be as published in
Chapter 209 , General Fee Schedule, of this code. The Township shall pay at
current rates for water used by the Township, or its departments.
      (1)   Water connection fee. In addition to all other charges herein
provided, each premises connecting to the water mains of the system shall pay a
connection fee. No connection shall be made to the water mains of the system
until the applicant has paid the necessary connection fee for the same in
accordance with
Chapter 209 of these Codified Ordinances-the General Fee Schedule. The fees
charged for a water connection shall be full payment for service connection to
a point within seven feet of the right-of-way line, including the curb stop and
stop box; furnishing and installing a meter on the premises; inspection of the
water service line between the meter and curb stop; and not more than three
months of unmetered water use during building construction on the premises. The
person for whose benefit the connection is made shall, on behalf of himself or
herself, or his or her heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, hold the
Township harmless for any loss or damage that may in any way be occasioned by
making such connection. All water meters shall remain the property of, and
under the sole control of, the Township.
      (2)   Water system development fee. In addition to all other charges
provided herein, the Township shall charge each premises connecting to the
water mains of the system a water system development fee. Said charge shall be
paid at the time that an application for permission to connect to the water
mains of the system is taken out. The water system development fee shall be
considered payment of the applicant's fair share of existing major capital
improvements of the Township water system, such as trunk water mains, master
water meters, and similar items that benefit all customers of the System.
      For residential use, the water system development fee shall be paid for
per single-family living unit as one capacity unit.
      For occupational uses other than residential uses, the water system
development fee shall be paid for multiples of capacity unit based on the
amount of metered water expected to be used. A single capacity unit shall be
considered the annual use of 7,200 cubic feet of metered water. The applicant
shall pay a water system development fee at the current rate times the number
of capacity units of expected annual water demand for each occupational use as
set forth in the Table of Water and/or Sewer Capacity Unit Factors provided in
subsection (c) hereof.
      (3)   Water debt service charge. In addition to all other charges
provided herein, each premises abutting an existing water main of the system
shall pay a water debt service charge, unless the premises have directly
participated in the cost of installation of said abutting water main. The
charge shall be in the manner set forth from time to time in the general fee
schedule. The width of parcels liable for debt service charges may be computed
in accordance with the Township policy adopted by the Township Board on
February 10, 1965 and any revisions or successions thereto. The above debt
service provision shall not apply to lots and subdivisions which were developed
and platted before the effective date of this paragraph unless those lots
connect the water service to such debt service line. Water debt service charges
shall be paid prior to the beginning of site improvements and the issuance of a
building permit.
      An applicant may demonstrate his or her inability to pay water debt
service charges in full by presenting to the Water and Sewer Department
Superintendent or the Superintendent's designee evidence that the applicant
meets the criteria of eligibility for a housing rehabilitation loan under the
standards supplied by the Department of Planning and Community Development for
determining community development block grant housing rehabilitation
eligibility. Upon a determination by the Superintendent or his designee, the
applicant may execute an agreement in recordable form which provides that debt
service shall be due in full upon the sale or conveyance of any interest in the
subject property. This hardship exception shall apply solely to premises which
are occupied for residential purposes only and further, shall not apply to new
construction property used for non-residential purposes or property which is
being redeveloped.
      The Superintendent of the Water and Sewer Department shall further be
permitted to establish procedures to allow a water debt service charge to be
paid on an installment basis over a ten year period by an applicant at an
interest rate set forth in the fee schedule provided a recordable debt service
agreement and tax lien form is executed and recorded at applicant's expense.
      Whenever a debt service line has been installed following a declaration
by the Superintendent of the Water and Sewers Department of a public health and
safety emergency, persons abutting such line otherwise obligated under this
section shall, upon application, be permitted to pay said debt service charge
on an installment basis over a ten-year period with seven percent interest
executing a debt service agreement and tax lien in a form substantially similar
to that provided for in paragraph (c)(2) hereof.
      (4)   Miscellaneous service. For any water furnished other than through
meters, the Water and Sewers Department shall fix a reasonable rate based on
the number of connections or any other special consideration. For temporary use
or use during construction, the Superintendent is authorized to measure the
quantity of water used and bill the user accordingly.
   (b)   Sewer Rates.
      (1)   Sewage Disposal Charge. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
sewage disposal charges provided by the system consisting of "usage charge" and
"readiness to serve charge" shall be set forth and as indicated in
Chapter 209  of the Codified Ordinances - General Fee Schedule. Charges shall
be paid by each building or premises having a connection with the system.
            Where more than one family unit on a premises is served by a single
water connection, the minimum monthly sewage disposal charge for such premises
shall be the rate calculated for a single unit multiplied by the number of
family units served by such single water connection. A family unit shall be
considered that portion of a structure occupied by one, or two or more persons
living together and occupying part of the building as a separate housekeeping
unit with a common and single set of culinary facilities. The Township shall
pay for all sewage disposal service provided to it, or any of its departments
at the current rates.
            Where no water meter exists a flat charge shall be imposed equal to
the "readiness to serve charge" imposed for single family unit multiplied by
the number of family units served, and the "usage charge" multiplied by five.
Sewage can also be charged as an alternative based on a meter size "readiness
to serve charge" using the readiness to serve rates for sewer and a "usage
charge" where an approved meter to measure water from the nonpublic source of
water for the premises has been purchased from the Township, lawfully
installed, and inspected by the Township.
      (2)   Sewer connection inspection charges. In addition to all other
charges herein provided, each premises connecting to the sewers of the system
shall pay a sewer connection inspection fee as indicated in
Chapter 209  of these Codified Ordinances-the General Fee Schedule, for
inspection of a tapping of a sewer service pipe to a public sanitary sewer.
Said charge shall be paid in full at the time that an application for a
connection is taken out.
      (3)   Sewer system development fee. In addition to all other charges
provided herein, the Township shall charge each premises connecting to the
sewers of the system a sewer system development fee. Said charge shall be paid
at the time that an application for a permit to connect to the sewers of the
system is made.
      For residential use, the sewer system development fee shall be paid for
as one capacity unit per single-family living unit.
      For occupational uses other than residential uses, the sewer system
development fee shall be multiples of capacity units based on the amount of
metered water expected to be used. A single unit shall be considered the annual
use of 7,200 cubic feet of metered water. The applicant shall pay a sewer
system development fee, at the current rate, times the number of capacity units
of expected annual water demand for each occupational use as set forth in the
Table of Water and/or Sewer Capacity Unit Factors provided in subsection (c)
hereof.
      (4)   Sewer debt service charge. In addition to all other charges
provided herein, each premises abutting an existing sewer main of the system
shall pay a sewer debt service charge, unless the premises have directly
participated in the cost of installation of said abutting sewer main. The
charge shall be in the manner set forth from time to time in the general fee
schedule. The width of parcels liable for debt service charges may be computed
in accordance with the Township policy adopted by the Township Board on
February 10, 1965 and any revisions or successions thereto. The above debt
service provision shall not apply to lots and subdivisions which were developed
and platted before the effective date of this paragraph unless those lots
connect the sewer service to such debt service line. Sewer debt service charges
shall be paid prior to the beginning of site improvements and the issuance of a
building permit.
      An applicant may demonstrate his or her inability to pay sewer debt
service charges in full by presenting to the Water and Sewer Department
Superintendent or the Superintendent's designee evidence that the applicant
meets the criteria of eligibility for a housing rehabilitation loan under the
standards supplied by the Department of Planning and Community Development for
determining community development block grant housing rehabilitation
eligibility. Upon a determination by the Superintendent or his designee, the
applicant may execute an agreement in recordable form which provides that debt
service shall be due in full upon the sale or conveyance of any interest in the
subject property. This hardship exception shall apply solely to premises which
are occupied for residential purposes only and further, shall not apply to new
construction property used for non-residential purposes or property which is
being redeveloped.
      The Superintendent of the Water and Sewer Department shall further be
permitted to establish procedures to allow a sewer debt service charge to be
paid on an installment basis over a ten year period by an applicant at an
interest rate set forth in the fee schedule provided a recordable debt service
agreement and tax lien form is executed and recorded at applicant's expense.
      (5)   Miscellaneous service. For any sewer service furnished other than
to a premises having a metered water connection, the Township Board shall fix a
reasonable rate based on the number of connections or any other special
consideration; except for a single-family use, the minimum sewer rates shall
apply. Special rates may be established by the Township Board to meet special
circumstances or situations where in its judgment a special rate is deemed
proper, advisable, fair and equitable.
   (c)   Other Conditions.
      (1)   The schedule of water and/or sewer capacity units shall be set
forth in the fee schedule ordinance and subject to periodic review and
adjustments as part of the fee schedule ordinance by the Board of Trustees for
the Charter Township of Clinton, through Township Board Resolution. See Section
209.15 for the Table of Water and/or Sewer Capacity Unit Factors.
      When the unit factor in the table refers to 1,000 square feet, it shall
mean the gross floor area of the building measured from outside of wall to
outside of wall on each floor of the building, including the basement area, if
used for any use except as a storage room, furnace room or air conditioning
equipment room. The water and/or sewer system development fee is also
chargeable for any additions to a Building. Said fee shall be paid upon
application for a building permit for the addition.
      The total number of units assigned to a particular usage on a single
premises (defined as a single use by a single lessee or owner) as computed from
the above table shall be a whole number and any fractional portion thereof
equal to 0.5 of one unit or more shall be considered the next higher whole
number.
      The Township reserves the right to review and adjust the total amount of
the water and/or sewer development fees as computed at any time and shall
review said fees upon receipt of the applicant's demand in writing within two
years after the date of payment of the water and/or sewer system development
fee as computed under the terms of this section. The basis for the Township's
review of the original water and/or sewer system development fee shall be as
follows:
      The total recorded metered water use (in cubic feet) of each of the
applicant's premises for a minimum period of twelve consecutive months after
full occupancy and full projected use shall be divided by 7,200 cubic feet
(defined in this section as one unit) to determine the number of adjusted units
(rounded off to the nearest whole number) which when multiplied by the water
and/or sewer system development fee per unit as specified elsewhere herein
produces the total adjusted water and/or sewer development fee for that
premises. The Township shall be the sole judge of the time when full occupancy
and full projected use has begun.
      On the above review basis, the Township shall refund the amount of the
original water and/or sewer system development fee which is in excess of 125
percent of the adjusted water and/or sewer system development fee. The Township
shall not be required to review the amount of any original water and/or sewer
system development fee unless the applicant's demand in writing is received by
the Township within two years of the date of payment of the original water and/
or sewer system development fee.
      (2)   Debt service agreement and tax lien. When water and/or sewer debt
service charge payment by installment is approved by the Township Board, the
applicant shall execute a debt service agreement and tax lien, the form of
which is on file with the Department.
      For the purposes of granting authority, by the adoption of this
subsection, the Township of Clinton hereby authorizes and directs that the
Superintendent of the Water and Sewers Department execute the above cited debt
service agreement and tax lien for and on behalf of the Township of Clinton,
that the collection and administration of accounts under such debt service
agreement and tax lien shall be administered by the Treasurer's Office of the
Township of Clinton, and the Treasurer shall appropriately report any
delinquency in payments and interest in order that the same may be properly
recorded as a tax deficiency according to said agreement.
      However, the Township Board shall have the right to withhold the property
from the tax sale and maintain a five percent interest penalty from the date of
default, and the Township may provide as a condition to the entering of a debt
service agreement that all payments shall be due July 1 of each year regardless
of the date of execution of the service agreement, and said payments shall
include the principal and interest next due.
      For the purposes of said debt service agreement and tax lien, an
applicant shall be considered to be any person or persons, partnership,
association, corporation or other legal entity which has a fee title interest
in said property, whether or not it is encumbered by a mortgage.
      Whenever an applicant is requesting water and/or sewer services and is
subject to debt service charges, he or she shall be required to furnish a legal
description of the parcel of land involved clearly indicating the number of
feet for which he or she desires water or sewer service (i.e., the footage
which borders the easement and/or right-of-way in which the sewer is located).
      In locations where such water mains or sewers are installed in roads
having existing or proposed rights-of-way wider than eighty-six feet and where
such roads have a then-existing pavement width exceeding thirty-six feet, no
premises located on the opposite side of such water mains or sewer shall be
connected directly with the service connection into such water mains or sewers.
In locations where such water mains or sewers are installed in roads having
existing or proposed rights-of-way wider than eighty-six feet and where such
roads have a then-existing pavement width of thirty-six feet or less, premises
located on the opposite side of such pavement from such water mains or sewers
may be connected directly with a service connection only with approval of each
such proposed connection by the Township Board.
      (3)   Deposit. A cash deposit for property which may distinguish between
classifications of the property is authorized as security for payment of water
and sewage disposal rates in such amounts as may be established by the Board of
Trustees of the Charter Township of Clinton in such instances as deemed
advisable to secure payment within the discretion of the Board or otherwise as
required pursuant to the provisions of Section 21 of Act 94 of the Public Acts
of 1933, as amended.
      (4)   Billing. Charges for water and sewage disposal service shall be
collected monthly. Bills shall become due and payable when received, and if not
paid by the due date, a five percent penalty shall be added thereto.
      (5)   Enforcement. Charges for water and/or sewage disposal service and
debt service charges shall constitute a lien on the property serviced, and if
not paid within six months after the due date of the bill, shall be certified
by the officer or employee charged with the duty of collecting said charges, to
the Township Supervisor on or before March 1 of each year, and the Supervisor
shall place the same on the general tax roll to be collected as part of the
general Township taxes.
      The Township shall have the right to shut off and discontinue the supply
of water to any premises for non-payment, when due, of water and/or sewage
disposal service charges. For turn-on charges, a fee shall be paid, in
accordance with Chapter 209 of these Codified Ordinances - the General Fee
Schedule, prior to turning on the water to such premises.

Ord. 389. Passed 8-24-09; Ord. 421. Passed 1-25-16; Ord. 460. Passed 9-30-19.)
1042.03   NO FREE SERVICE.
   No free service shall be furnished by said system to any person, firm or
corporation, public or private, or to any public agency or instrumentality. Any
such services furnished the Township, except water furnished through fire
hydrants, shall be charged against the Township at the established rates, and
shall be paid for monthly as the services accrue, from current funds, or from
the proceeds of taxes which the City is authorized and required to levy in an
amount sufficient for that purpose.
(Ord. 319. Passed 12-22-97.)
1042.04   UNREASONABLE BURDENS UPON SYSTEM.
   If the character of sewage from any manufacturing or industrial plant or any
other building or premises shall be such as to impose an unreasonable
additional burden upon the sewers of the system, then an additional charge may
be made over and above the regular rates, or it may be required that such
sewage be treated by the person, firm or corporation responsible therefor
before being emptied into the sewer, or the right to empty such sewer may be
denied, if necessary, for the protection of the sewer and sewage disposal
facilities of the system or the public health or safety.
(Ord. 319. Passed 12-22-97.)
1042.05   FIXING OF RATES FOR PROVISION OF FUNDS.
   The rates currently fixed are estimated to be sufficient to provide for the
payment of the interest upon and the principal of all the bonds as and when the
same become due and payable; to provide for the erection of a reserve therefor
as required by this chapter; to provide for the payment of the expenses of
administration and operation and such expenses for maintenance of said system
as are necessary to preserve the same in good repair and working order; and to
provide for such other expenditures and funds for said system as this chapter
may require. Such rates shall be fixed and revised from time to time as may be
necessary to produce these amounts, and it is hereby covenanted and agreed at
all times to fix and maintain such rates for services furnished by the system
as shall be sufficient to provide for the foregoing.
(Ord. 319. Passed 12-22-97.)
1042.06   DEPOSIT OF REVENUES.
   The revenues of the system are hereby ordered to be set aside, as collected,
and deposited in a bank selected by the Township Board, in an account to be
designated the Water Supply and Sewage Disposal System Receiving Fund, and said
revenues so deposited are pledged for the purposes of paying obligations of the
Water and Sewers Department.
(Ord. 319. Passed 12-22-97.)
1042.07   ESTIMATED AND ACTUAL WATER AND SEWER PRIVILEGE FEE CALCULATIONS AND
ADJUSTMENTS
   Upon demand, in writing, by an applicant within two years or at any time
within the sole discretion of the Township, the water and/or sewer privilege
computed under the terms of this chapter may be reviewed and adjusted. The
review shall occur through the selection of a twelve-consecutive-month period
by the Township, during which period the total recorded metered water use (in
cubic feet) for each of the applicants shall be divided by 7,200 cubic feet
(defined in this chapter as one unit) to determine the number of adjusted units
(rounded off to the nearest whole number) which, when multiplied by the water
and/or sewer privilege fee per unit as specified elsewhere herein, produces the
total adjusted water and/or sewer privilege fee for that premises. The
Township, during such period, shall also be permitted to review the
occupational use category currently in effect for the subject premises and
apply the appropriate per unit factor based on the actual occupational use in
the event a change of use has occurred from the original water and sewer
privilege fee calculation.
   Upon the above review basis, the Township shall refund the amount of
original water and/or sewer privilege fee which is in excess of 125 percent of
the adjusted water and/or sewer privilege fee. The Township shall impose a
water and sewer privilege fee which shall be immediately due and payable where
the adjusted water and/or sewer privilege fee is in excess of 125 percent of
the original water and/or sewer privilege fee or where a change in occupational
use category has occurred, or both. The Township shall not be required to
complete the review process more frequently than once during any twenty-four-
month period upon the request of the applicant. Unpaid adjusted charges may
serve as a basis for disconnection and compliance with other applicable laws
and ordinances and, further, may be collected in the same manner as ad valorem
real property taxes, including interest and penalties, if unpaid.
   Where a change in use or expansion is projected to occur prior to the
issuance of any building permit or occupancy permit of any kind, a water and/or
sewer privilege fee shall be paid to the Water and Sewers Department. Said
privilege fee shall be based upon the proposed use factor and estimated
quantities of use or other method of calculation as set forth in the applicable
ordinances less any previously paid water privilege fee. No refund of a
previously paid water privilege fee shall be permitted unless the subsequent
change in use or expansion is occurring within two years from the initial
payment of water and/or sewer privilege fees.

concentration or quantity either singly or by interaction with other pollutants
to cause interference, or pass through, or constitute a hazard to humans or
animals;
      (5)   Any liquid, gas, solid or form of energy, which either singly or by
interaction with other waste is sufficient to create toxic gas, vapor, or fume
within the POTW in quantities that may cause acute worker health and safety
problems, or may cause a public nuisance or hazard to life, or are sufficient
to prevent entry into the sewers for their maintenance and repair;
      (6)   Any substance which is sufficient to cause the POTW's effluent or
any other product of the POTW, such as residue, sludge, or scum to be
unsuitable for reclamation processing where the POTW is pursuing a reuse and
reclamation program. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause
the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria guidelines
or regulations developed under 33 U.S.C. § 1345, with any criteria, guidelines,
or developed and promulgated regulations affecting sludge use or disposal
developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Federal Clean Air Act,

      All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating period
representative of an industrial user's discharge, and in accordance with 40
C.F.R. Part 136.
         A.   The limitation for total PCB is non-detect. Total PCB shall not
be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 608, and the
quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 ugm/l, unless a higher level is
appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one or
more samples indicate detectable levels of total PCB, the user shall be
required to demonstrate compliance. For purposes of this section, this
demonstration may be made using analytical data showing that the total PCB
concentration is below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in
accordance with Section
1046.12(d).
         B.   The limitation of mercury (Hg) is non-detect. Mercury (Hg) shall
not be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 245.1, and
the quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 ugm/l, unless a higher level is
appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one or
more samples indicate detectable levels of mercury, the user shall be required
to demonstrate compliance. For the purposes of this section, this demonstration
may be made using analytical data showing that the mercury concentration is
below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in accordance with Section
1046.12(d).
         All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating
period representative of an industrial user's discharge, and in accordance with
40 CFR Part 136.
      (3)   Compliance period. Within thirty days of the effective date of this
chapter, the Department shall notify all industrial user's operating under an
effective wastewater discharge permit of the requirement to submit a compliance
report within 180 days after the effective date of this chapter. The compliance
report shall demonstrate the user's compliance or non-compliance with these
limitations, and, in the event of non-compliance, include the submission of a
plan and schedule for achieving compliance with the stated limitation. In no
event shall a compliance schedule exceed eighteen months from the effective
date of this chapter. An industrial user who does not demonstrate compliance
may petition the Department for a second extension as part of an Administrative
Consent Order. The Department shall include appropriate monitoring, reporting,
and penalties into an Administrative Consent Order that relates to a second
extension, and shall enter into such an agreement only upon a good-faith
showing by the industrial user of the actions taken to achieve compliance with
this provision.
   (c)   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. All users shall comply
with the applicable national categorical pretreatment standards and
requirements promulgated pursuant to the act as set forth in 40 C.F.R.
Subchapter N, Effluent Guidelines and Standards, which are hereby incorporated
by reference and with all other applicable standards and requirements,
provided, that where a more stringent standard or requirement is applicable
pursuant to State law or regulation, or to this chapter, then the more
stringent standard or requirement shall be controlling. Affected dischargers
shall comply with applicable reporting requirements under 40 C.F.R. part 403
and as established by the Department. The national categorical pretreatment
standards which have been promulgated as of the effective date of this section
are delineated in Appendix A.
      (1)   Intake water adjustment. Industrial users seeking adjustment of
national categorical pretreatment standards to reflect the presence of
pollutants in their intake water must comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R.
§ 403.15. Upon notification of approval by the Department, the adjustment shall
be applied by modifying the permit accordingly. Intake water adjustments are
not effective until incorporated into an industrial user's permit.
      (2)   Modification of national categorical pretreatment standards. The
Department may apply to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or to the
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, whichever is appropriate, for
authorization to grant removal credits in accordance with the requirements and
procedures in 40 C.F.R § 403.7. Such authorization may be granted only when the
POTW treatment plant can achieve consistent removal for each pollutant for
which a removal credit is being sought, provided, that any limitation of such
pollutant(s) in the NPDES permit neither are being exceeded nor pose the
prospect of being exceeded as a result of the removal credit being granted.
Where such authorization is given to the Department, any industrial user
desiring to obtain such credit shall make an application to the Department,
consistent with the provisions of 40 C.F.R. § 403.7 and of this chapter. Any
credits which may be granted under this section may be subject to modification
or revocation as specified in 40 C.F.R. § 403.7, or as determined by the
Department. A requisite to the granting of any removal credit may be that the
industrial user pay a surcharge based upon the amounts of such pollutants
removed by the POTW, such surcharge being based upon fees or rates which the
Board may establish and, when appropriate, revise from time to time. Permits
shall reflect, or be modified to reflect, any credit granted pursuant to this
section.
      (3)   New sources. Industrial users who meet the new sources criteria
shall install, maintain in operating condition, and 'start-up' all pollution
control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before
beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time and not to exceed
ninety days, new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards.
      (4)   Concentration and mass limits. When limits in a categorical
pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit
of production, the Department may convert the limits to equivalent limitations
expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent
concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to
individual industrial users. Equivalent limitations shall be calculated in
accordance with Sections 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c)(3) and/or 40 C.F.R. §403.6(c)(4)
and shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of 33 U.S.C. § 1317
(d) and of this chapter. Industrial users will be required to comply with the
equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from
which the equivalent limitations were derived.
      (5)   Reporting requirements for industrial users upon effective date of
categorical pretreatment standards-baseline report. Within 180 days after the
effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the
final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission
under 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users
subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging
into or scheduled to discharge into the Detroit POTW shall submit to the
Department a report containing the information listed in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)
(1-7). Where reports containing this information have already been submitted to
the Director or regional administrator in compliance with the requirement of 40
C.F.R § 128.140(b), the industrial user will not be required to resubmit this
information. At least ninety days before commencement of any discharge, each
new source and any existing sources that become industrial users after the
promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall submit to
the Department a report which contains the information listed in 40 C.F.R. §
403.12(b)(1-5). In such report, new sources shall include information
concerning the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet
applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall provide estimates of the
information requested in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)(4) and (5).
   (d)   Dilution Prohibited. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an
applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no user shall increase the use
of process water, or in any way dilute or attempt to dilute a discharge as a
partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance
with the limitations contained in the national categorical pretreatment
standards, or in any other pollutant specific limitation or requirement imposed
by the Charter Township of Clinton, the City of Detroit or by the State of
Michigan.
   (e)   Hauled in Wastewater. Any waste material or wastewater which is hauled
into or within the service region for discharge to the POTW is subject to the
requirements of this chapter including, but not limited to, permits,
inspection, monitoring and enforcement. Unloading liquid or solid waste from
hauling vehicles, directly or indirectly, into the POTW, with or without the
benefit of pretreatment, is prohibited unless the person proposing to unload
such waste has applied for and received a permit from the Department for
unloading such waste in accordance with the Board's rules pertaining thereto.
The discharger shall be subject to applicable terms and conditions, surcharges,
fees or rates as established by the Board. Hauled in wastewater shall only be
discharged at points designated by the POTW after authorization or approval
issued pursuant to the general permit requirements specified in Section
1046.07. The Department may establish specific limitations for sludge from
municipally owned or operated POTW treatment plants which are different than
the specific limitations in this chapter.
      (1)   It is unlawful for a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility to
discharge any industrial waste or wastewater into the POTW without a wastewater
discharge permit from the Department. Any authorization granted, or permit
issued, by the Department to a Centralized Waste Treatment (CWT) facility shall
specify the type of wastewater for which treatment is provided, and discharge
approval is sought, from the POTW. Unless such industrial waste or wastewater
is determined by the Department to require further authorization, a centralized
waste treatment (CWT) facility that has submitted an application to, and
received previous approval from, the Department to discharge wastewater is not
required to obtain further authorization from the Department before discharging
such wastewater. An industrial user, that provides centralized waste treatment
services and files an application for the treatment and discharge of such types

the industrial user to implement its plan prepared in accordance with
subsection (l) hereof, the industrial user shall telephone the Department at
its control center and notify the Department of the discharge. The notification
shall include the name of the caller, the location and time of discharge, the
type of wastewater, the estimated concentration of excessive or prohibited
pollutants and estimated volume, and the measures taken, or being taken, to
abate the discharge into the POTW. Within five calendar days after the
discharge, the industrial user shall submit a detailed written report
describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user
to prevent similar future occurrences and when required by the Department, the
industrial user's wastewater discharge permit may be modified to include
additional measures to prevent such future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve the industrial user of any expense, cost of treatment, loss,
damages or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, fish kills, or any other environmental impairment or any other damage to
person or property.
   (k)   Notice to Employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
industrial user's bulletin board, or other prominent place, advising employees
whom to contact in the Department in the event of an actual or excessive or

provisions of this chapter, which produces a deposit or obstruction, or causes
damage to or impairs the Department's POTW, or causes the Department to violate
its NPDES permit, shall be liable to the Department for any expense, loss,
damage, penalty or fine incurred by the Department because of said violation or
discharge. Prior to assessing such costs, the Department shall notify the user
of its determination that the user's discharge was the proximate cause of such
damage, obstruction, impairment, or violation of the City's NPDES permit and
the Department's intent to assess such costs to the user. Any such notice shall
include written documentation which substantiates the determination of
proximate cause and a breakdown of cost estimates. Failure to pay the assessed
costs shall constitute a violation of this chapter. Such charge shall be in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any penalties or remedies provided under this
chapter, or this Code, or other statutes and regulations, or at law or in
equity.
   (m)   Hazardous Waste Notification. All industrial users, who discharge into
the Charter Township of Clinton Collection System, shall notify the Department
in writing of any discharge of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of,
would be a hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261. Such
notification must comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(p).

facility, or overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company,
a new authorization satisfying the requirements of the authorized
representative definition must be submitted to the Department prior to, or
together with, any reports to be signed by an authorized representative.
         F.   If sampling performed by a permittee indicates a violation, the
user shall notify the Department within twenty-four hours of the time said user
becomes, or should have become, aware of the violation. In addition, the user
shall repeat the sampling and analysis, and submit the results of the repeat
analysis to the Department within thirty days after said user becomes, or
should have become, aware of the violation.
      (9)   In the event the Director determines that an industrial user is
discharging substances in quality, quantity or at locations which may cause
problems to the POTW, or the receiving stream, the Department has the authority
to develop and enforce effluent limits applicable to the user. To the extent
the Department seeks to impose restrictions in a permit which are more
restrictive than established in this chapter, the Department shall provide
written documentation to explain the greater restriction for protection against
pass through, interference, or violation of the NPDES permit;
      (10)   Requirement for pollution prevention initiatives; and
      (11)   Other requirements reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with
this chapter.
   (f)   Permit Duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time period.
Except as deemed necessary by the Department, or as otherwise provided for
under this chapter, permits shall be issued for a specified period of not more
than five years nor less than one year. The existing permit for significant
industrial users, who timely submit an application for permit reissuance to the
Department, shall be automatically extended until a permit is issued as final.
   (g)   Permit Modification. The terms and conditions of the permit may be
subject to modification by the Department during the term of the permit as
limitations or pretreatment standards and requirements identified in Section
1046.05 are amended, or other just cause exists. Just cause for a permit
modification includes, but shall not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   Material or substantial changes to an industrial user's facility or
operation, or changes in the characteristics of the industrial user's effluent.
It shall be the industrial user's duty to request an application form and apply

on its findings or reasonable belief of the above; or
      (12)   The user may request a modification of the permit.
   When initiated by the Department, the industrial user shall be informed of
any proposed change in its permit. The Department will issue a draft permit and
an industrial user has thirty days to file a response to the draft modified
permit. Thereafter, the Department will issue a final permit and, unless
appealed in accordance with the procedures contained in Section
1046.13, the permit will become effective twenty days after issuance.
   (h)   Permit Custody and Transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued
to a specific person as defined herein for a specific discharge. A wastewater
discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a different
person, new owner, new industrial user, different premises, or a new or changed
operation without notice to and written approval of the Department, and
providing a copy of the existing permit to the new owner or operator. It shall
be the permit holder's duty to notify the Department of any such change at
least thirty days before the date of the change. Wastewater discharge permits,
which do not receive the written approval of the Department prior to the
change, shall be null and void regardless of reassignment, or transfer, or
sale. If it has occurred, the Department may revoke a permit. If a change takes
place, the Department may require the application for a new or modified permit.
Any succeeding person shall comply with the terms and conditions of any
existing permit which the Department allows to be retained.
   (i)   Permit Notification Requirements. All industrial users shall promptly
notify the Department in advance of any substantial change in the volume or
character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or
characteristic hazardous waste for which initial notification under 40 C.F.R. §
403.12(p) has been made, request a permit application form, and apply for a
modification of the permit at least thirty calendar days prior to the change.
Failure of the industrial user to so apply shall be considered a violation of
this chapter.
(Ord. 375. Passed 1-28-08.)
1046.08 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (a)   Significant industrial users shall provide, operate and maintain at
their own expense a sampling manhole or special structure to facilitate
monitoring, inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of their discharge by
the Department and the industrial user, and to enable the Department to conduct
such other monitoring and sampling as required for determining compliance with
discharge requirements, limits and standards as provided for in this chapter.
In the event the Department determines that the monitoring facility identified
in the permit application is inadequate, a new monitoring facility must be
identified, or provided, which shall allow for collection of a representative
sample of the wastewater discharged from the facility. Unless otherwise
determined at the discretion of the Department, said facility shall be provided
within ninety days of receipt of notification by the Department. The industrial
user shall provide the Department with:
      (1)   A drawing showing all sewer connections and sampling manholes by
the size, location, elevation, and points or places of discharges into the
POTW;
      (2)   A flow schematic showing: which connections receive each national
categorical process wastestream, which connections receive storm water,
sanitary water or cooling water, and which lines handle each combined
wastestream. This report shall be certified by a professional engineer. If a
significant industrial user fails to install the monitoring facilities within
the prescribed time limits, then the Department may install such structure or
device and the significant user shall reimburse the Department for any costs
incurred therein.
   (b)   The sampling manhole should be situated on the industrial user's
premises in a location readily accessible to the Department. When such a
location would be impractical or cause undue hardship to the industrial user,
the Department may allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or
sidewalk area when there is room and the location will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles. It shall be the responsibility of the
industrial user to obtain any necessary approvals which may be required from
other government agencies for the location and construction of monitoring
facilities. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling or monitoring
manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis. The facility and any permanently installed sampling and measuring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition at the expense of the industrial user. Whether constructed upon
public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be
provided in accordance with the Department's requirements and all applicable
local construction standards and specifications. (See Section
1046.05.)
(Ord. 375. Passed 1-28-08.)
1046.09 INSPECTION, SAMPLING AND RECORD-KEEPING.
   (a)   For purposes of administering and enforcing this chapter, any other
applicable provisions of this Code or applicable State or Federal laws and
regulations, the Department may inspect the establishment, facility or other
premises of the industrial user. The Department's employees or authorized
representative shall have access to the industrial user's premises for purposes
of inspection, sampling, compliance monitoring and/or metering activities.
   (b)   Each such inspection or sampling activity shall be commenced and
completed at reasonable times, and in a reasonable manner. Upon arrival at the
industrial user's premises, the Department shall inform the industrial user, or
the industrial user's employees, that sampling and/or inspection is commencing,
and that the facility's authorized representative has the right to observe the
inspection and/or sampling. The Department shall neither refrain from, nor be
prevented or delayed from, carrying-out its inspection or sampling duties due
to the unavailability of the authorized representative of the facility to
observe or participate in the inspection or sampling activity.
   (c)   While performing work on private property, employees or authorized
representatives of the Department shall observe all reasonable safety, security
and other reasonable rules applicable to the premises as established by the
industrial user. Duly authorized employees or representatives of the Department
shall bear proper credentials and identification, and at the industrial user's
option may be accompanied by a duly authorized representative of the industrial
user. Duly authorized Department representatives shall not be restricted from
viewing any of the facility site. Department employees or representatives may
take photographs of facilities subject to this chapter, which shall be
maintained by the Department as confidential in accordance with Section
1046.10.
   (d)   Where an industrial user has security measures in force, the
industrial user shall make prompt and necessary arrangements with the security
personnel so that, upon presentation of appropriate credentials, personnel from
the Department will be permitted to enter for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.
   (e)   Significant industrial users shall sample and analyze their discharge
in accordance with the provisions of their permit. The Department may require
such samples to be split with the Department for the Department's independent
analysis.
   (f)   Industrial users shall maintain records of all information from
monitoring activities required by this chapter, or by 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(n).
Industrial users shall maintain the records for no less than three years. This
period of record retention shall be extended during the course of any
unresolved litigation regarding the discharge of pollutants by the industrial
user, or the operation of the City of Detroit's Industrial Waste Program, or
when requested by the Department, by the State, or by the EPA.
   (g)   Upon the request of the Department, industrial users shall furnish
information and records relating to discharges into the POTW. Industrial users
shall make such records readily accessible to the Department at all reasonable
times, and allow the Department to copy such records.
   (h)   In the event the Department obtains samples, and analyses are made of
such samples, a copy of the results of such analyses shall be promptly
furnished upon written request by the industrial user's authorized
representative. When requested by the industrial user, the Department employee
or representative shall leave with the user, a portion of any sample of the
user's discharge taken from any sampling point on or adjacent to the premises
for the user's independent analysis. In cases of disputes arising over shared
samples, the portion taken and analyzed by the Department shall be controlling
unless proven invalid.
   (i)   In addition to any other violation caused by the discharge described
herein, in the event a single grab sample of the industrial user's discharge is
obtained by the Department, and then analyzed in accordance with 40 C.F.R. Part
136, and found to contain concentrations of pollutants which are two or more
times greater than the numeric limitations as listed in Section
1046.05, or as contained in the facility's wastewater discharge permit, the
industrial user shall implement its slug control plan, and shall provide a
written report to the Department within fourteen days, which describes the
cause of greater concentration and provides a description of the means by which
future discharge concentrations will be held to values of less than two times
the limitation in the future.
(Ord. 375. Passed 1-28-08.)
1046.10 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   (a)   (1)   Information and data on an industrial user obtained from written
reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs,
and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental
agencies without restriction unless the industrial user specifically requests
and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department that the
release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the industrial user.
      (2)   When submitted to the Department, all information claimed to be
confidential must be clearly marked 'confidential'. When requested by the
person furnishing the report, the portions of a report determined by the
Department to disclose trade secrets or trade secret processes, and which are
clearly labeled as confidential, shall not be made available for inspection by
the public, but shall be made available upon request to governmental agencies
for uses related to this chapter, to the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit, and to the State Disposal System permit and/
or the pretreatment programs, provided, however that information shall be
treated as confidential by the governmental agency, until such time as the
information has been determined to be non-confidential by the governmental
agency. Confidential information on industrial users, which the Department
releases pursuant to a request of another governmental agency, should be
handled by the other governmental agency pursuant to its own confidentiality
procedures. The Department cannot control how another governmental agency
handles such confidential information, and assumes no responsibility for the
disposition of the information released to the governmental agency. The
Department will use sufficient care to inform the other governmental agency of
the existence of the industrial user's confidentiality claim.
      (3)   The Department shall determine whether the information requested to
be treated as confidential, in fact, satisfies the requirements of confidential
information as defined herein. The decision of the Department shall be made in
writing.
      (4)   Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized
as confidential information.
   (b)   Except as otherwise determined by the Department or provided for by
applicable law, all information with respect to an industrial user on file with
the City shall be made available upon request by such user or the user's
authorized representative during normal business hours.
(Ord. 375. Passed 1-28-08.)
1046.11 STATUTES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
   The national categorical pretreatment standards defined in 40 C.F.R. Chapter
I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471, shall be and are incorporated by reference
herein and made a part hereof. Unless otherwise provided, any reference in this
chapter to a code, standard, rule, regulation, or law enacted, adopted,
established, or promulgated by any private organization, or by any element or
organization of government other than the Charter Township of Clinton shall be
construed to apply to such code, standard, rule, regulation, or law in effect
or as amended or promulgated, from the date of enactment of this chapter.
(Ord. 375. Passed 1-28-08.)
1046.12 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Violations. It shall be a violation of this chapter for any user to:
      (1)   Fail to completely and/or accurately report the wastewater
constituents and/or characteristics of the industrial user's discharge;
      (2)   Fail to report significant changes in the industrial user's
operations or wastewater constituents and/or characteristics within the time
frames provided in Section
1046.07(g)(1);
      (3)   Refuse reasonable access to the industrial user's premises, waste
discharge, or sample location for the purpose of inspection or monitoring;
      (4)   Restrict, lockout or prevent, directly or indirectly, access to any
monitoring facilities constructed on public or private property. The locking or
securing of the monitoring facility shall not constitute a violation pursuant
to this subsection, provided, that upon request reasonable access to the
facility is promptly provided to the Department;
      (5)   Restrict, interfere, tamper with, or render inaccurate any of the
Department's monitoring devices including, but not limited to, samplers;
      (6)   Fail to comply with any condition or requirement of the industrial
user's wastewater discharge permit;
      (7)   Fail to comply with any limitation, prohibition, or requirement of
this chapter including any rule, regulation, or order issued hereunder.
Industrial users acting in full compliance with wastewater discharge permits
issued prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be deemed to be in
compliance with the requirements of this chapter, and such permits shall remain
in effect and be enforceable under this chapter until a superseding permit is
effective. Industrial users shall comply with applicable national categorical
pretreatment standards and requirements on the date specified in the Federal
regulations, regardless of compliance schedules.
   (b)   Upsets. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with national categorical pretreatment standards
where the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) hereof are met.
      (1)   An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence, that:
         A.   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause
(s) of the upset;
         B.   At the time, the facility was being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
         C.   The industrial user has submitted the following information to
the Department, orally or in writing, within twenty-four hours of becoming
aware of the upset and where this information is provided orally, a written
submission must be provided within five days:
            1.   A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (2)   In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof;
      (3)   The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to
the extent necessary to maintain compliance with this chapter upon reduction,
loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   (c)   Bypass. Bypasses are prohibited unless the bypass does not cause a
violation of pretreatment standards or requirements, but only if it is for
essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the treatment system.
These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)
(2) hereof.
      (1)   Notice of anticipated bypass. Industrial users anticipating a
bypass shall submit notice to the Department at least ten days in advance.
      (2)   Notice of unanticipated bypass. An industrial user shall submit
oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards within twenty-four hours from the time the industrial user becomes or
should have become aware of the bypass. A written submission shall be provided
within five days of the time the industrial user becomes or should have become
aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been
corrected, to prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
      (3)   Prohibition of bypass and enforcement. Bypass is prohibited, and
the Department may take enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         A.   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
         B.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated waste, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
         C.   The industrial user properly notified the Department as described
in paragraph (c)(2) hereof.
      (4)   Bypass approval. Where it meets all conditions in paragraph (c)(3)
hereof, the Department may approve an anticipated bypass.
   (d)   Pollution Prevention Initiative. Where one or more of the measurements
taken for any pollutant defined in Section
1046.05(b) during a six month period exceed by any magnitude the daily maximum
non-detect limit for the same parameter, the industrial user may develop and
implement pollution prevention initiatives, or a BMP, as part of its response.
The Department may, as part of an administrative order, also require
development of a BMP as a part of the Department's enforcement response. Upon
approval of the Department, these pollution prevention initiative, or BMPs
shall be made an enforceable part of the wastewater discharge permit.
Industrial users shall provide, at six month intervals, analytical results and
certifications in support of its implementation of an approved pollution
prevention initiative or BMPs. Upon demonstration of compliance, the industrial
user may request to be relieved of this implementation requirement.
   (e)   Emergency Suspensions and Orders. The Department may order suspension
of the sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge
permit where, in the opinion of the Department, such suspension is necessary to
stop any actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an
imminent or significant hazard to the health or welfare of persons or to the
environment, interferes or may interfere with the POTW, or causes or may cause
the City of Detroit to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. Any person
notified of a suspension of the sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or
the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. In the event the Department provides informal notification under
this section, written confirmation and an order shall be provided within
twenty-four hours. In the event of a failure of the person to comply
voluntarily with any suspension or revocation order, the Department shall take
such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection or services, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or
danger to any individual or the environment. In the event such steps are taken,
the Director shall notify the industrial user within twenty-four hours in
writing of such action and order, and the specific recourse available. In any
event, the Department shall provide the industrial user with an opportunity for
a hearing before the Director, or his designated representative, within ten
days of such action. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written
statement to the Department within fifteen days of the occurrence describing
the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any
future occurrence. Upon proof of elimination of the noncomplying discharge, the
Department shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or the sewer or
wastewater treatment service.
   (f)   Notice of Violation. Except in the case of an actual or threatened
discharge as specified in subsection (e) hereof, whenever the Department has
reason to believe that any industrial user has violated or is violating this
chapter, the Department shall serve a written notice stating the nature of the
violation upon such industrial user. Where applicable, the Department shall
pursue appropriate escalating enforcement action as defined within its approved
enforcement response plan. The failure of the Department to issue a notice of
violation shall not preclude the Department from escalating its enforcement
response.
   (g)   Administrative Actions. Whenever the Department has reasonable grounds
to believe that a user is violating, or has violated, a provision of its
wastewater discharge permit, or a pretreatment standard or requirement or any
prohibition of this chapter, the Department may initiate appropriate
administrative enforcement action, except in the case of emergency or flagrant
violation, in order to compel the industrial user to eliminate or to remedy
such violation as soon as possible.
      (1)   A.   Conferences. The Department may order any person, who violates
this chapter, to attend a conference wherein the Department may endeavor to
cause the user to eliminate or remedy the violation by establishing an
enforceable compliance schedule. The notice of violation shall be served at
least ten days before the scheduled conference and shall set forth the date,
time, and place thereof. The conference shall be conducted by a representative
of the Department. The industrial user shall present a plan and schedule for
achieving compliance with this chapter. Nothing contained herein shall require
the Department to accept or agree to any proposed plan or schedule, or to
prevent the Department from proceeding with a show cause hearing as set forth
in paragraph (g)(2) hereof. If the attendees agree upon a compliance schedule,
the user and the Department's duly authorized representative may enter, by
consent, into a compliance agreement or an administrative order setting forth
the terms of such agreement. An industrial user must exhibit good faith and
expeditious efforts to comply with this chapter and any procedures,
requirements, and agreements hereunder.
         B.   Compliance schedules. The user and the Department may agree upon
a schedule which sets forth the terms and conditions, and time periods or
schedules for completion of actions to remedy or to eliminate the causes of
violation. These schedules may be developed as part of a compliance agreement,
administrative consent order. Schedules developed under this subsection shall
adhere to the following conditions:
            1.   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form
of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of upgraded or additional pretreatment facilities,
or to the implementation of additional operation and maintenance procedures
required for the industrial user to meet the applicable pretreatment
requirements and standards including, but not limited to, hiring an engineer,
completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contracts for
major components, commencing construction, and completing construction;
            2.   No single increment referred to in paragraph (g)(1)B.1. hereof
shall exceed nine months;
            3.   Not later than fourteen days following each date in the
schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a
progress report to the Department including, at a minimum, whether it complied
with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date
which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason(s) for
delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the
established schedule; and
            4.   Any deviations from the compliance schedule may result in the
industrial user being found in violation of this chapter.
         C.   Administrative orders. The Department may order any industrial
user, who violates or continues to violate this chapter or a duly issued
permit, to install and to properly operate devices, treatment facilities, or
other related appurtenances. In addition, orders may contain such other
requirements as might reasonably be necessary and appropriate to address the
violation including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional
self-monitoring and management practices, implementation of a waste
minimization assessment to identify and implement feasible source reduction,
and recycling practices to reduce the generation or release of pollutants at
the facility. An order may be either an administrative consent order, which is
the result of an agreement, or a unilateral administrative order.
      (2)   Show cause hearing. The Department may order any industrial user,
who violates this chapter or allows such violation to occur, to show cause
before the Department why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A
notice shall be served upon the industrial user specifying the time and place
of a hearing before the Department regarding the violation, the reason(s) why
the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the
industrial user to show cause before the Department why any proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be
served personally, or by registered or certified mail with return receipt
requested, at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made upon any
agent or officer of a corporation, or its authorized representative.
         A.   Hearing proceeding. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance
with the procedures adopted by the Board. A hearing officer shall conduct the
show cause hearing and take the evidence, and may:
            1.   In the name of the Board, issue notices of hearing requesting
the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence
relevant to any matter involved in such hearing; and
            2.   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the Director
for action thereon.
         B.   Transcript. At any show cause hearing held pursuant to this
chapter, testimony shall be recorded by a court reporter.
      (3)   Actions. After a show cause hearing has been conducted, the
hearings officer shall issue order to the industrial user directing any of the
following actions:
         A.   Immediate compliance with the industrial user's wastewater
discharge permit or with any applicable limitation, condition, restriction or
requirement of this chapter, or applicable local, State or Federal law or
regulation;
         B.   Pretreatment of waste by installation of adequate treatment
equipment or proper operation and maintenance of existing treatment equipment
be accomplished within a specified time period;
         C.   Submission of compliance reports on effluent quality and quantity
as determined by self-monitoring and analysis during a specified time period;
         D.   Submission of periodic reports on effluent quality and quantity
determined by self-monitoring analysis throughout the final period set by a

         E.   Control of discharge quantities;
         F.   Payment of costs for reasonable and necessary inspection,
monitoring, and administration of the industrial user's activities by the
Department during compliance efforts; and/or
         G.   Any such other orders as are appropriate including, but not
limited to, immediate termination of sewer or wastewater treatment services, or
revocation of a wastewater discharge permit, or orders directing that following
a specified time period sewer or wastewater treatment service will be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or operation and
maintenance practices have been employed.
         H.   A finding the user has demonstrated by a preponderance of the
evidence that a violation either of this chapter or of a duly issued permit did
not occur.
      (4)   Public notification of significant noncompliance. The Department
shall publish in the largest daily newspaper published in the City of Detroit
and a list of all industrial users which were in significant noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment requirements at any time during the previous twelve
months. All industrial users identified in a proposed publication shall be
provided with a copy of the proposed notice at least thirty days before
publication and allowed an opportunity to comment as to its accuracy.
   (h)   Legal actions.
      (1)   Criminal action. Any user, who violates any provision of this
chapter including the failure to pay any fees, fines, charges or surcharges
imposed hereby, or any condition or limitation of a permit issued pursuant
thereto, or who knowingly makes any false statements, representations or
certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed
or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter or wastewater discharge
permit, or who tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring
device required under this chapter, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon
conviction, shall be punished by a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars
($500.00) for each violation per day, or by imprisonment for not more than
ninety days, or by both. The Department is hereby authorized, through its
counsel, to seek prosecution of criminal charges against any person violating
any provision of this chapter.
      (2)   Civil action. Whenever the Department has reasonable grounds to
believe that a user is violating, or has violated, a provision of its
wastewater discharge permit, a pretreatment standard or requirement or any
requirement of this chapter, the Director may commence a civil action to compel
compliance in a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin the user from
discharging, and/or to obtain appropriate relief to remedy the violations. The
Department or Board may also seek additional legal and/or equitable relief. The
commencement of suit neither constitutes an exclusive election of remedies nor
prohibits the Department, Director, Board, or City of Detroit from commencing
action in Federal Court for discharges believed to be in violation of this
chapter, State and Federal requirements contained in the Clean Water Act, the
City of Detroit's NPDES permit, or other applicable laws or requirements. In
addition, the City of Detroit may recover the reasonable attorney fees, court
costs, court reporters' fees, and other unusual expenses related to enforcement
activities or litigation against the person found to have violated this
chapter, or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder.
      (3)   All fines, costs, and penalties which are imposed by any court of
competent jurisdiction shall be payable to the City of Detroit Water and
Sewerage Department.

1050.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Debt service drainage facilities" means drainage facilities and
related improvements installed at the expense of, or at the direction of, the
Township.
   (b)   "District project" means the land area to be potentially benefitted by
debt service drainage facilities, which areas shall be established by the
Township Board upon recommendation by the Township Engineer and the
Superintendent of the Department of Public Works.
   (c)   "District project costs" means the costs for debt service drainage
facilities, within the district project area, established as actual
construction costs by the Township Board, upon recommendation of the Township
Engineer, which shall include construction, legal, engineering and, if
applicable, bonding costs, plus five percent of the aforementioned costs for
administrative expenses and an interest cost, calculated upon the unpaid
balance annually for debt service drainage facilities within the district
project, of eight percent per annum compounded annually, calculated from the
date of project completion, as certified by the Township Engineer.
   (d)   "Net benefitted acreage" means the total acreage within the district
project, less areas credited for the previous payment of the installation of
facilities by property owners or their designees, such credits to be calculated
proportional to the remaining facilities benefitting the property, or credits
for areas of property which are served by other nondebt service drainage
facilities. The Township Engineer shall calculate the proportionate areas of
property served by nondebt service drainage facilities based upon the
anticipated property outflow and drainage facilities involved. Where a property
owner or his or her designee has paid in whole or in part for the installation
of drainage facilities, the credit in no situation shall exceed what otherwise
would have been the debt service charge. The credit shall be determined by
calculating the costs paid by the property owner or his or her designee in
proportion to the total system costs factored against the property owner's
property area in proportion to the total project area.
(Ord. 297. Passed 10-18-93.)
1050.02   PAYMENT OF DRAINAGE DEBT SERVICE CHARGE REQUIRED; BASIS OF CHARGE.
   A drainage debt service charge shall be paid, based upon a charge per acre,
which shall be prorated based upon actual property size. A charge per acre
shall be based upon the district project cost divided by the net benefitted
acreage within the district project.
(Ord. 297. Passed 10-18-93.)
1050.03   TIME OF PAYMENT; DETERMINATION OF CREDITED ACREAGE.
   Property owners shall pay the drainage debt service charge, in full, for
their property area, less any credited acreage, when drainage facilities are
connected or used, as determined by the Township Engineer, and, in cases where
property development is contemplated, no later than the issuance of a building
permit. Credited acreage shall be determined in the same manner provided in
Section 1050.02 for calculating net benefitted acreage.
(Ord. 297. Passed 10-18-93.)
1050.04   UNAUTHORIZED USE OF DEBT SERVICE DRAINAGE FACILITIES.
   Unauthorized use of debt service drainage facilities without full payment of
the drainage debt service charge is hereby prohibited.
(Ord. 297. Passed 10-18-93.)
1050.05   HARDSHIP APPEALS; REVIEW CRITERIA; INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS.
   (a)   Existing developed properties wishing to connect to drainage
facilities shall be permitted to submit a hardship appeal upon payment of an
application fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00) to the Township Board. The
appeal shall be reviewed and a recommendation made by the Superintendent of the
Department of Public Works. Criteria for determining whether to grant a
hardship appeal shall include:
      (1)   Drainage debt service charges for the subject property;
      (2)   The income of the property owner and his or her ability to pay; and
      (3)   The value of the currently developed property and its income
potential in proportion to the cost of debt service drainage facilities and the
resultant increase in property value or productivity upon connection.
   (b)   Relief upon appeal shall be the allowance of annual installment
payments for a period up to ten years, provided that interest is paid at the
rate of eight percent per year.
(Ord. 297. Passed 10-18-93.)
1050.06   VIOLATIONS AS NUISANCE; ABATEMENT.
   Any person, including, but not limited to, a natural person, corporation,
partnership or other entity in charge of property, who or which causes or
permits to continue any violation of this chapter, shall be deemed to be
causing or permitting a nuisance per se. The cost of an action to abate such a
nuisance, including actual attorney's fees, shall be recoverable by the

rejection, in writing. If the plat is rejected, reasons shall be given and
shall be recorded in the minutes pertaining thereto. The minutes of the meeting
shall be open for inspection.
      (4)   Final approval of the preliminary plat shall confer upon the
proprietor, for a period of two years from the date of approval, the
conditional right that the general terms and conditions under which preliminary
approval was granted will not be changed. The two-year period may be extended

abstract of title certified to date with the written legal opinion thereon, or,
at the option of the proprietor, a policy of title insurance for examination in
order to ascertain whether or not the proper names appear on the plat.
   (b)   Review.
      (1)   One mylar copy and fifteen paper prints of the final plat shall be
filed by the proprietor with the Clerk, and such sums of money as the governing
body may require herein, or by other ordinances or resolutions, shall be

of the Public Acts of 1967, Sections 162 through 165, as amended, prior to
submission to the Township for its review.
      (2)   The final plat shall be reviewed by the Planning and Community
Development Department as to compliance with the approved preliminary plat, and
by the Municipal Engineer as to compliance with the plans for utilities and
other improvements.

subsequent approvals shall follow the procedures set forth in the Subdivision
Act.
      (6)   The placing of required monuments and lot corner markers may be
waived by the governing body for a period of one year from the date of approval
of the final plat by the governing body, provided that the proprietor shall
have delivered to the Clerk cash, a certified check or an irrevocable bank
letter of credit running to the Municipality, whichever the proprietor selects,
in an amount equal to twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per monument remaining to be
placed, plus ten dollars ($10.00) per lot corner marker remaining to be placed.
In no case shall said deposit be less than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
         Such cash, certified check or irrevocable bank letter of credit shall
be returned to the proprietor upon receipt of a certificate by a surveyor that
the monuments and markers have been placed as required within the time
specified. If the proprietor defaults, the governing body shall promptly
require a surveyor to locate the monuments and markers in the ground as
certified on the plat at a cost not to exceed the amount of the security
deposited and shall pay the surveyor. Any unexpended balance of the deposit
shall then be returned to the party from whom it was received.
      (7)   In lieu of the proprietor having installed improvements, the
governing body shall require of the proprietor, as a condition of final plat
approval, a deposit in the form of cash, a certified check or an irrevocable
bank letter of credit, whichever the proprietor selects, running to the
Municipality for the full cost, as estimated by the Municipal Engineer, of
improvements required in the Land Development Regulations, other than public
streets and street drainage facilities, to ensure the completion of said
improvements and facilities within a length of time agreed upon from the date
of approval of the final plat by the governing body. The Municipality shall

Commission.
   (a)   Location and Arrangement.
      (1)   The proposed subdivision shall conform to the various elements of
the Master Plan and shall be considered in relation to the existing and planned
major thoroughfares and collector streets, and such part shall be platted in
the location and width indicated on such plan insofar as possible.
      (2)   The street layout shall provide for the continuation of local or
collector streets in the adjoining subdivisions or of the proper projection of
streets when adjoining property is not subdivided, or conform to a plan for a
neighborhood unit drawn up and adopted by the Commission.
      (3)   The street layout shall include minor streets so laid out that
their use by through traffic shall be discouraged.
      (4)   Should a proposed subdivision border on or contain an existing or
proposed major thoroughfare, the Commission may require marginal access
streets, reverse frontage or such other treatment as may be necessary for
adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation and
reduction of traffic hazards.
      (5)   Should a proposed subdivision border on or contain a railroad,
expressway or other limited-access highway right of way, the Commission may
require the location of a street approximately parallel to and on each side of
such right of way at a distance suitable for the development of an appropriate
use of the intervening land, such as for parks and Residential Districts. Such
distances shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance
required for approach grades to future grade separation.
      (6)   Half-streets shall be prohibited, except where absolutely essential
to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these Regulations. Wherever there exists, adjacent to the tract
to be subdivided, a dedicated or platted and recorded half-street, the other
half shall be platted or the adjacent half-street shall be vacated.

of centerline fifty feet in length, measured from the right of way line of the
major or collector thoroughfare, where said minor streets are on a curve with a
radius of at least 400 feet, which tangent does not make a ninety degree
intersection with the thoroughfare being intersected.
   (e)   Grading and Centerline Gradients. In accordance with the Land
Development Regulations.
   (f)   Street Jogs. Street jogs with the centerline offsets of less than 125
feet shall be avoided.
   (g)   Truck Wells. Truck wells and receiving and shipping depots will be so
located as to provide adequate vehicular movement on the site and shall not
face directly onto a public right of way unless at least 100 feet from the
right of way, and shall be subject to the review of the Macomb County Road
Commission.

the area. It shall be the responsibility of the proprietor to submit copies of
the preliminary plat to all appropriate public utility agencies.
      (3)   Easements three feet in width shall be provided where needed along
side lot lines so as to provide for street light dropouts. Prior to the
approval of the final plat for a proposed subdivision, a statement shall be
obtained from the appropriate public utility indicating that easements have
been provided along specific lots. A notation shall be made on the final plat
indicating: "The side lot lines between lots (indicating lot numbers) are

property, thus avoiding Municipal responsibility in the future.
         C.   The proposed manner of regulating the use of the common
facilities and areas so as to eliminate possible nuisances to other property
owners and cause for enforcement by the governing unit.
         D.   The proposed method of notifying the Municipality when any change
is contemplated in plans which would affect the original specifications
approved by the Municipality.

realized by the residents of the proposed subdivision and the Municipality by
approval of the proposed Subdivision Open Space Plan, with particular reference
to the objectives stated in paragraph (a)(3) hereof.
   (c)   If the Commission is satisfied that the proposed Subdivision Open
Space Plan meets the letter and spirit of the Zoning Code and should be
approved, it shall recommend such approval to the governing body with the
conditions upon which such approval should be based. Thereafter, the governing

1244.01   SITE GRADING AND DRAINAGE WATER SYSTEMS.
   (a)   Except for agricultural purposes, it shall be unlawful for any person
to change the drainage pattern of any land by excavating, grading, or filling
in any way to change the effect on adjoining property without first obtaining a
permit for construction from and where applicable the Township Water and Sewer
Department, Building Department, and Department of Public Works. Each site
shall receive grading for the purpose of directing surface water run-off to
appropriate drainage water systems, and the same shall be done in a manner
which will not cause drainage water from the site to flow onto adjacent land or
obstruct the flow of existing drainage from adjacent properties. Drainage water
systems shall be provided to collect surface water run-off and building
foundation drain ground water. The drainage water system shall consist of
enclosed storm sewers throughout the project. An extension of the drainage
water collection system shall be made to furnish an outlet for foundation drain
service pipes for each building having a basement. The collected drainage water
shall be conveyed to a point of disposal that shall be a public storm water
drain as approved by the appropriate governmental agency.
   (b)   When, in the opinion of the Township Engineer and/or the office of the
Macomb County Commissioner of Public Works, there is inadequate drainage water
outlet capacity, the developer shall install a storm sewer of adequate size to
serve a logical service area, including his or her site, or obtain a legally
signed petition for a special assessment project to install such a storm sewer
of adequate size, or construct his or her full share of such a storm sewer of
adequate size and provide drainage water storage capacity to limit the rate of
flow of drainage water from his or her site to the existing capacity of the
outlet. Once approved and constructed, the owner shall not reduce the volume of
such drainage water storage facilities on the site without the written approval
of the Township. Such drainage water storage capacity which serves a single
site may be on the surface of that site's parking lot if the same is properly
designed.
   Drainage water storage facilities serving more than one site shall be
provided by furnishing a retention basin of sufficient capacity and with a
controlled outlet to limit the rate of discharge. Final approval of any plans
that include a retention basis serving more than one landowner shall be
conditioned upon an operation and maintenance agreement with the Township based
on the following criteria:
      (1)   Retention basins on private developments, where ownership will
remain consolidated over an extended period of time, such as industrial sites,
shopping centers, apartment complexes, etc., should remain in private
ownership, subject to Township review as to size, design and proper operation.
Maintenance and liability also shall remain with the property owner.
      (2)   Retention basins serving predominantly single-family areas may be
dedicated to the Township for ownership and maintenance, subject to the
following criteria and subject to case-by-case review and approval by the
Planning Commission and the Township Board.
         A.   Minimum land area of isolated parcels should be no less than six
acres so that they will eventually be usable as public parks. Therefore,
adjoining developers should make every effort to consolidate their retention
areas into a single site where feasible from the standpoint of engineering.
Smaller sites may be acceptable where they abut directly on other Township or
elementary, middle or high school sites.
         B.   Properties shall have a length-to-width ratio of not more than
two and one-half to one.
         C.   Sites for retention basins shall be shown on the preliminary and
final plats.
         D.   Public street access shall be provided directly to the site with
a paved roadway.
         E.   A signed agreement and approved plans shall be in effect prior to
Township approval of the final plat. The developer and/or builder shall be
responsible for dewatering and maintaining the basin until it is accepted in
writing by the Township Board.
         F.   The developer and/or builder shall make payment to the Township
of sufficient funds to cover maintenance, operation and insurance liability
costs for a period of fifteen years, and such costs, including a reasonable
inflation factor, shall be estimated by the Township Engineer and deposited
with the Township prior to construction of the retention basin.
   (c)   All trunk storm sewers and drains shall conform to the Township's
Storm Sewer Master Plan.
(Ord. 281. Passed 10-2-89; Ord. 356. Passed 4-25-05.)
1244.02   STREET AND PARKING LOT PAVEMENT AND RIGHTS OF WAY.
   (a)   All residential land developments, public or private, whether single-
family or multiple-family, shall be served by paved roadways having a width and
type of pavement as indicated in these Land Development Regulations and
Township Paving Detail Sheet, as amended.
   (b)   All industrial developments shall be served by concrete paved roads.
Commercial developments shall be served by paved roadways and parking lots.
Paving for commercial developments shall be of the type and width as indicated
in these Regulations and Township Paving Detail Sheet, as amended.
   (c)   Where any land development abuts or includes a proposed collector
street as indicated on the Master Thoroughfare Plan, or where it is deemed
essential by the Township to provide for continuity to other parts of the
public road system through the subject land development, the developer of such
land development shall be responsible for the installation of the collector
street or other local streets, with dedication of the right-of- way to the use
of the public for the same.
   (d)   Where the Township Zoning Code requires off-street parking, each
parking space (or stall) shall be ten feet in width and twenty feet in length.
Parking areas shall be paved with either a concrete or an asphalt pavement. All
paved areas shall have concrete curbs. Parking lots shall be designed in
accordance with standards contained in these Regulations and Township Paving
Detail Sheet, as amended.
(Ord. 281. Passed 10-2-89; Ord. 369. Passed 5-14-07.)

be operated as public facilities shall be conveyed to the Township for
operation and maintenance.
   (c)   All water main sizes shall conform to the Township's Water Main Master
Plan.
(Ord. 281. Passed 10-2-89.)
1244.04   WASTEWATER COLLECTION SYSTEMS.
   (a)   All developments shall be serviced by a public wastewater collection
and disposal system. The developer shall provide sanitary sewers to service
each proposed building site and shall connect the same to the public wastewater
disposal system.
   (b)   All sanitary sewers that are intended to be operated as public
facilities shall be conveyed to the Township for operation and maintenance.
   (c)   All sanitary sewer sizes shall conform to the Township's Sanitary
Sewer Master Plan.
(Ord. 281. Passed 10-2-89.)
1244.05   SIDEWALKS.
   Five-feet wide sidewalks shall be constructed completely across the
developer's project where it abuts existing or proposed major thoroughfares and
collector streets. Except in industrial developments, sidewalks shall be
constructed along both sides of the development's internal streets. The outside
edge of a walk will normally be located one foot inside of the right of way,
but for mobile home parks and some multiple housing developments (as determined
by the Township Engineer) the walk may be located adjacent to the street
pavement.
(Ord. 281. Passed 10-2-89.)
1244.06   TREES.
   Except on major thoroughfares, the developer shall install at least one
Norway maple tree (minimum of three inches in diameter) per lot or per building
site on each side of all streets, but in no event shall the spacing of trees
exceed 120 feet.
(Ord. 281. Passed 10-2-89.)
1244.07   UNDERGROUND WIRING.
   The developer shall provide for all local distribution lines for telephone,
electric and/or other similar services distributed by wire or cable, to be
placed underground entirely throughout the area to be developed for residential
use, except for main supply and perimeter feed distribution lines which serve
areas outside the development area, and except for surface facilities related
to underground service (such as above-ground closure or terminals), and such
wires, conduits or cables shall be placed within private easements which shall
be provided to the service companies by the developer. All such facilities
shall be constructed in accordance with standards of construction approved by
the Michigan Public Service Commission.
(Ord. 281. Passed 10-2-89.)
1244.08   GUARANTEE FOR COMPLETION OF SITE IMPROVEMENTS.
   After site plan approval or preliminary plat approval by the Township Board,
and after approval of the plan for the site improvement, but before the
issuance of building permits for buildings within the development, the
developer shall provide the Township and/or other public agencies, as
requested, with a guarantee for the satisfactory completion of all required
public improvements to serve his or her development. Such guarantee shall be in
the form of cash, a certified check or an irrevocable bank letter of credit,
whichever the developer selects, or in the form of a surety bond, acceptable to
the Township or the public agency, based on the estimated construction cost of
said improvements as approved by the Township Engineer or the other concerned
public agency. The Township shall release funds from such deposit as made with
the Township as the site improvements are completed and approved by the
Township, approximately in proportion to the amount of improvements
satisfactorily completed.

      (1)   The public utility company shall prepare and present to the
Superintendent of the Water and Sewers Department plans and specifications for
the proposed utility, whether it be an underground utility or an overhead
utility (including a single pole relocation). The utility company shall
ascertain where the location (horizontally or vertically) may be in possible
conflict with utilities existing and proposed by the Township.
      (2)   Upon completion of the plans and specifications for the public
utility, the utility company shall make an application for a plan review on a
form furnished by the Township. As part of this application, the utility
company shall submit the following:
         A.   Two sets of completed plans for the proposed utility.
         B.   A cash payment as the plan review fee.
         C.   Such inspection fees as may be determined to be necessary by the

1248.02   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PLANS.
   (a)   All plans submitted shall be on 24 by 36 inch white prints having
black lines and shall be neatly and accurately prepared. Judgment should be
exercised in the design, layout and presentation of proposed improvements. All
plan submittals shall include two hardcopies of completed plans and
specifications, and an itemized engineer's estimate of cost. Electronic
versions of plans and details with an itemized engineer’s estimate of cost must
also be submitted to the Township Engineer. Five sets of hardcopies and a final
digital set of plans with required standard details need to be submitted at
time of final approval.
   (b)   Engineering plans shall have a scale of no more than one inch equals
50 feet horizontal per sheet. Profile views shall have a scale of one inch

   (h)   All storm sewers, sanitary sewers and water mains shall be indicated
in profiles. There shall be a separate profile view for each utility. However,
it shall be the responsibility of the design engineer to ascertain that the
depth of the storm sewer (or storm drain) does not interfere with the building
service sewers crossing the storm sewer. Profiles shall indicate the size of
pipe, class of pipe, slope of the utility, invert elevations, and control
elevations of the utility. The existing and proposed grade lines shall be shown
along the profile view of each utility.

indicated, or a copy of the computed plat, if applicable, shall be submitted
with the engineering plans.
   (l)   Plans shall have all lettering a minimum height of one-tenth of an
inch and be of such quality as to provide for a clear and legible recording.
   (m)   All plans submitted shall bear the seal of the registered Michigan
professional engineer responsible for the design.
   (n)   The plans covering all of the required site improvements for a
specifically designated area of the developer's land shall be submitted as one
package before any plan review shall commence.
   (o)   The plans must show all existing wetlands and floodplain boundaries.
Improvements within or near these boundaries will require additional local,
State or Federal approvals, dependent on the impact to those natural features.
(Ord. 281. Passed 10-2-89; Ord. 481. Passed 10-24-22.)
1248.03   SITE GRADING AND STORM WATER DRAINAGE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL.
   (a)   All sets of plans which include plans for storm sewers shall include
the current Township Storm Sewer Detail Sheets, which shall be considered an
inseparable part of the plans when said plans are approved. Plans must be
designed in accordance with the current applicable detail sheets and standards
noted herein.
   (b)   A site grading and drainage water plan is required for all
developments, except if the building site is a site in a subdivision or other
project for which a general site grading plan has been submitted and approved.
A separate grading plan or permit will be required for individual building
sites, including those in platted subdivisions recorded prior to January 1,
1968. The intent is to require that an enclosed storm drainage system shall be
provided for all land development projects. If there are any upstream watershed
drainage areas which need to be drained through the site under design
consideration, sufficient capacity shall be provided to take fully developed
upstream drainage into the system.
   (c)   Site grading for all building sites shall be reviewed to determine
that proposed and/or actual site grading is reasonable, that drainage from land
lying upstream is not obstructed and that downstream properties will not be
adversely affected by run-off from the property under design consideration. All
site grading and drainage needs to meet all current applicable Macomb County
stormwater management requirements noted herein. Before a certificate of
occupancy for any building is issued, the Township shall approve the final site
grading and drainage for each building site. The Township shall require that a
survey, drawing and certificate, done by a registered professional engineer or
registered land surveyor, be furnished by the developer, indicating that the
work has been done in conformity to the approved site grading and drainage
plan. It shall be unlawful for any person to interfere with, modify or obstruct
the flow of drainage water across any property in any manner different from the
approved plan.
   During periods of the year when weather conditions make site grading work
infeasible, the Building Department may issue a temporary certificate of
occupancy subject to the furnishing of a satisfactory bond, letter of credit or
cash deposit guaranteeing the completion of the work when weather conditions
permit. Such temporary certificate of occupancy shall state the time for final
completion, inspection and the date of forfeiture of the guarantee for
noncompliance.
   Finished easement grades shall be indicated on the plans at each lot or
building site corner not adjacent to a street pavement. Permanent finish grade
markers consisting of four-inch diameter, 36-inch long concrete encasing a one-
half inch diameter steel rod, shall be buried vertically such that the top is
at the final finished grade shown on the plan. The builder shall furnish to the
Township Building Department a certificate of a registered professional
engineer or land surveyor indicating that such markers are correctly in place
before issuing a final building certificate of occupancy for a building.
   (d)   The fall of the land away from the building shall be a minimum of six
inches in the first 25 feet (2%). From this elevation, the land shall slope to
a drainage water collection swale at a minimum slope of one foot in 100 feet
(1%).
   (e)   The maximum slope of the land for the site, except for transitional
terraces between usable site areas, shall be seven feet in 100 feet (7%). The
sodded terrace slopes shall be a maximum slope of one foot vertically and four
feet horizontally,
   (f)   Adequate soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be
specified on the plans, and followed during construction, to conform to the
requirements of Act 451 of the Public Act of 1994, entitled Natural Resources
and Environmental Protection Act as amended. The Macomb County Public Works
Office is the jurisdictional agency responsible for issuing soil erosion
permits in Clinton Township.
   (g)   All buildings having foundation drains shall direct the flow of
drainage water from such foundation drains into a storm sewer or a storm drain
by means of an underground pipe. Sump pumps shall be used if necessary. No
building permit for any building having a basement shall be issued unless the
plans for such building indicate a building service sump line connection to a
storm sewer, storm drain or road ditch. In no circumstance shall a sump line be
connected to the sanitary sewer system.
   (h)   Drainage water run-off from building service drains and other storm
discharge facilities shall be designed so that the discharged water through an
impermeable structure, installed and maintained to avoid discharge upon paved
surfaces and public rights of way designed for pedestrian and vehicular
traffic. Splash blocks or pipes are allowed where the discharge point is at
least five feet perpendicularly away from all building walls onto a pervious
surface (e.g. grass, pond, bioretention area, etc). Subsection coexists with
Section 1470.075(c).
   (i)   The longitudinal grade of any unpaved drainage swale shall not be less
than 1.0 feet per 100 feet (1.0%). Where a site is unable to obtain a fall of
1.0 foot per 100 feet (1.0%) for a longitudinal drainage slope, an acceptable
minimum slope will be allowed as determined by the Township Engineer. At no
instance will a minimum drainage longitudinal slope be less than 0.3 feet per
100 feet (0.3%). The maximum distance drainage water shall travel in a drainage
swale without an intercepting yard catch basin shall be 350 feet. Planned final
grade elevations shall be indicated on the plans at a maximum spacing of 50
feet. Drainage swales shall be intercepted by a catch basin on each building
site.
   (j)   Storm water run-off piping systems shall be designed for a ten-year
storm by means of the rational method formula Q = CIA, where Q is the peak rate
of run-off in cubic feet per second, A is the area in acres, C is the co-
efficient of run-off for the drainage area, and I is the average rainfall
intensity in inches per hour for a certain time of concentration. The rainfall
intensity shall be determined by the formula I = 175/(25+T), where T is the
time of concentration equal to the time required for a drop of water to run
from the most remote point of the watershed to the point for which run-off is
being estimated. The design engineer shall use judgment in arriving at proper
imperviousness factors, but in general the following factors are acceptable
minimums:
      (1)   Lawn areas and unimproved natural areas - 0.2
      (2)   Gravel surfaces - 0.85
      (3)   Pavement and roof areas - 0.90
   (k)   Storm water management shall also be designed to the most current
requirements of Procedures and Design Standards for Stormwater Management from
the Macomb County Public Works Office. A weighted average to determine the
overall site’s impervious factor shall be used for stormwater detention
calculations.
   (l)   A storm water pretreatment forebay or structure for each connection to
the stormwater system will be required and be sized according to Macomb County
stormwater management design standards. The design is subject to approval the
Department of Public Services. The pretreatment system shall have a minimum
total suspended solids removal rate of 80%.
   (m)   The developers shall submit a map outlining the various watershed
drainage areas, including off-site upstream areas, which drain to each inlet
point used for design. The map shall be accompanied by storm sewer design
computation. The minimum acceptable size of a storm sewer downstream of any
storm water inlet structure is twelve inches in diameter.
   (n)   For the design of storm sewers, the Manning's formula for pipe sizing
with an “N” factor of 0.013 for smooth wall pipe shall be used. Storm sewers
shall be designed to provide a minimum velocity, when flowing full, of two and
one-half feet per second, if possible. The maximum velocity of storm water flow
shall be ten feet per second.
   (o)   On-site storm sewer shall be a private system to be maintained by the
property owner unless it is otherwise determined by the Township Engineer. A
recorded Stormwater Maintenance Covenant is required for all developing
properties prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy and/or Engineering
Plan approval. Any storm sewers requiring easements, shall be agreements solely
between private entities with terms and conditions reviewed by Clinton
Township. Public storm sewer easements will not be considered in Clinton
Township. The minimum acceptable width of private easements for storm sewers
shall be 12 feet wide for sewers and 15 inches and under in diameter, 20 feet
for sewers over 15 inches in diameter, and 30 feet for sewers over 48 inches in
diameter. The sewer shall be placed within the middle third of the above
designated easement width. Township Engineer will also consider the depth of
the sewer when reviewing the necessary easement width.
   (p)   Where open drains are proposed for drainage water disposal, the
Manning's formula shall be used for determination of flow depth and capacity.
When additional permitting agencies are required as part of plan approval,
those standards shall apply.
   (q)   Where possible, a minimum of three feet of cover from the top of the
finish road or earth grade to the top of any storm sewer shall be provided.
Township Engineer shall consider less cover if existing site conditions warrant
a deviation.
   (r)   The design elevation of the hydraulic gradient profile shall be
indicated on the sewer profile view for all proposed storm sewer systems. In
some cases, it will be acceptable to allow the hydraulic gradient to be above
the top of the sewer pipe, but never less than one foot below an at-grade rim
of a storm sewer structure.
   (s)   Access manholes shall be provided along the storm sewer at every
change of pipe size, change of rate of grade, or change of direction. However,
the maximum spacing for storm sewer manholes shall be 500 feet.
   (t)   Catch basins shall not be constructed over a main sewer line to
replace manholes in street sewers or trunk sewers outside of streets. Moreover,
a manhole normally shall not be used as a storm water inlet structure. However,
if a normal manhole location (outside of streets) coincides with a storm water
inlet structure location, and at least 75% of the upstream storm water inlet
structures are catch basins (with sumps), the manhole may be used as a storm
water inlet structure by adding a sump and a catch basin cover on the manhole.
   Not more than three upstream catch basins will be allowed to discharge into
any catch basin.
   Catch basin leads may tap directly into sewers 42 inches and larger. Catch
basin sewer leads need not be shown on the plans in profile view.
   (u)   A prefabricated bar screen shall be installed on the end of all storm
sewers 18 inches in diameter and larger which outlet into an open drain.
Openings of the bar screen shall be no more than six inches on centers.
   (v)   In general, pavement-type catch basins shall be located as follows:
      (1)   At the radius return of street pavement intersections; 150 feet
maximum distance of drainage water travel is allowed around a corner without an
intercepting catch basin.
      (2)   At all low points in streets.
      (3)   At intermediate points along the street or parking areas, such that
there is a maximum pavement drainage area per structure as follows:
         A.   Intercepting road catch basins: 600 lineal feet of road.
         B.   Low-point catch basins: 0.5 acres
   (w)   Yard-type catch basins shall be provided at all low points in drainage
swales. Intercepting yard-type catch basins, such that not more than 350 feet
of swale drainage runs into any one catch basin, other than a low point catch
basin where 600 feet of drainage is allowed, shall be provided. In new
subdivisions, each lot shall have direct-run lot drainage to a catch basin with
an outlet provided in said catch basin for the foundation drain connection. All
yard-type catch basins shall be precast concrete with a minimum two-foot
diameter. Plastic, fiberglass, corrugated metal, etc. low point structures
shall not be permitted.
   (x)   Improved open drains may be permitted under special circumstances,
provided that the Township Engineer has determined that the enclosure of such
open drains would require a storm sewer of 60 inches or larger in diameter.
When open drains are used, a private or county easement will be required when
the drain is being designed to accept flow from more than one source upstream
or at the site. If the existing route is currently accepting flow overland or
through a pipe an easement may not be required. The design of the open drain
shall meet the most current requirements of Procedures and Design Standards for
Stormwater Management from the Macomb County Public Works Office.
   (y)   An extension of the storm sewer system shall be provided to furnish an
outlet for foundation drain service pipes for any buildings not otherwise
serviced. Such extensions shall have a minimum diameter of eight inches.
   (z)   If the enclosed sewer pipe system were to fail, an emergency overflow
route is required for all developed sites. The emergency overflow route must
demonstrate that no buildings would be adversely affected by the storm sewer
system failure and an overflow to a public right of way or drain is provided.
Emergency overflows to adjacent private properties will require a recorded
covenant with that adjoining private property owner.
   (aa)   Any site improvements to undeveloped property (except individual plot
plans), greater than one acre, shall require stormwater to be detained on-site
in either a pond or an approvable underground storage system. The storage
capacity of such detention systems shall contain a capacity equivalent to the
most current design requirements provided in the “Procedures and Design
Standards for Stormwater Management” published by the Macomb County Public
Works Commissioner (MCPWO Stormwater Management & Design Standards) designed to
drain into the detention basin. Discharge from the detention basin shall be at
a controlled rate based upon the most current MCPWO Stormwater Management &
Design Standards.
   (bb)   Redeveloped sites will require stormwater detention, following the
“Procedures and Design Standards for Stormwater Management” published by the
Macomb County Public Works Commissioner (MCPWO Stormwater Management & Design
Standards). Stormwater detention with an outlet restriction shall be required
for any of the following circumstances:
      (1)   A net increase in impervious area of the site. The stormwater
detention volume shall be calculated using the calculated increase in site
imperviousness. The release rate of the detention area must not exceed the pre-
existing conditions.
      (2)   There is limited downstream storm sewer or open drain capacity. If
site calculations show that discharge from a newly developed site contribute to
downstream storm sewer surcharging and/or flooding, the redeveloped site will
need to restrict and detain storm sewer flows to an amount that eliminates
downstream surcharging and/or flooding in a ten-year storm event or to a
minimum discharge of 0.20 cfs/acre.
   (cc)   Retention basins may be considered at the discretion of the Township
Engineer where no positive outlet is available, and must follow the most
current MCPWO Stormwater Management & Design Standards.
   (dd)   Additional requirements for storm water detention basins are as
follows:
      (1)   The maximum design elevation for storage in the detention basin
shall be at least one foot below the low point of the watershed surface area
draining into the detention basin.
      (2)   A detention or retention basin slope cannot be steeper than one
foot vertical for every five feet (1:5) horizontal does not need to be fenced.
A ten-foot wide maintenance buffer with a maximum side slope of one foot
vertical for every ten feet horizontal (1:10) shall be required.
      (3)   Any side slopes of a detention or retention basin that is between
one foot vertical for every 5 feet horizontal (1:5) to one foot vertical for
every four feet horizontal (1:4) will require a fence around the entire
perimeter of the basin. A ten-foot wide maintenance buffer with a maximum side
slope of 1 foot vertical for every ten feet horizontal (1:10) shall be required
inside the fenced enclosure. The detention or retention basin shall be
completely fenced with a minimum 12-foot wide, double-opening access gate
provided with proper locks. The fence shall be six-feet high with a material
that is found approvable by the Planning Department, Building Department and
Department of Public Services. The bottom of the fence shall be six inches
below the ground surface to prevent burrowing by rodents.
      (4)   The bottom of the basin shall have a minimum grade of 1%. The slope
of the gutter line to the outlet shall have a minimum grade of 0.5%.
      (5)   The entire detention or retention basin area must be sodded or
seeded with the turf fully established in accordance with Macomb County Soil
Erosion Control requirements before Township approval will be granted.
      (6)   Rip-rap shall be installed on a geotextile fabric and provided at
all pipe entrances to the basin. Sizing of the rip-rap shall be reviewed by the
Township Engineer. All pipe entering or leaving the basin shall have either a
headwall or flared-end section at the end of the pipe with an erosion control
device.
      (7)   An overflow system shall be provided, which system shall consist of
either a pipe having an invert at the design storage level elevation or a
concrete spill-way extending from the inside bank slope to the outlet drain.
      (8)   For basins with pumped outlets, a silt trap and bar screen shall be
installed on the inlet pipe to the pump station. The screen clear opening shall
be a maximum of two inches.
      (9)   Pumping stations for dewatering of the detention basins shall
include duplicate pumps, with each pump capable of handling the design flow.
The controls shall include a lead-pump start and stop, a lag-pump start and
stop, an alternator for alternating the lead-lag pump, a high-water alarm
system with a light, and a safety all-pumps-off control. An emergency call-out
system or other privately monitored emergency system that notifies the property
owner(s) must be part of the system design. The control panel, pumps, and wet-
well shall be installed inside of the fenced enclosure near the access gate,
and the controls shall be installed in a suitable weather-proof and vandal-
proof enclosure. The size, make and type of pumps and controls shall be subject
to Township approval. Electrical service shall be extended inside the fence
with suitable electrical outlets, whether gravity flow or pumps are used for
dewatering.
      (10)   Where the basin abuts residential properties (existing or
proposed), a dense hedge shall be planted along the inside perimeter of the
fence. Trees may be required by the Township where the basin parallels a
roadway and in other instances where improved aesthetics could be achieved
without interfering with maintenance.
      (11)   All detention basins shall be designed so that the entire capacity
of the basin can be discharged in 48 hours.
      (12)   Parking lot detention systems in commercial or industrial areas
are not permitted and will only be considered by the Township Engineer on a
case by case basis. In no instance will parking lot detention systems be
allowed in residentially developed properties. Any parking lot detention area
allowed by the Engineer, shall not exceed a depth of 0.5 feet in depth with the
storage area not occupying any parking or vehicle storage areas. Parking lot
detention areas cannot be placed within an egressible route for ADA facilities.
      (13)   Enforcement of this section shall be the responsibility of the
Township Department of Public Services.
(Ord. 281. Passed 10-2-89; Ord. 481. Passed 10-24-22.)
1248.04   STREET AND PARKING LOT PAVING.
   Plans must be designed in accordance with the current detail sheets and
standards noted herein.
   (a)   In general, pavement on public rights of way and private roadways in
new developments shall meet current Macomb County Department of Roads paving
standards for concrete or asphalt roads. The paving width, measured from back
to back of curbs, shall be 28 feet for minor streets having a minimum width of
60-foot R.O.W., 36 feet for collector streets having a minimum width of 86-foot
R.O.W., 36 feet for industrial streets having a 70- or 75-foot R.O.W. and 24
feet for marginal access streets having a 50-foot R.O.W. Boulevard sections for
collector streets in an 86-foot R.O.W. may consist of two 19-foot pavements
separated by a 16-foot island, if approved by the County Department of Roads.
Cul-de-sac R.O.W. shall be 50 feet in radius with the outer back of the curb
located 16 feet from the R.O.W. line. No islands in the cul-de-sac paving shall
be permitted unless approved by the County Department of Roads. All paving
sections shall be centered in the R.O.W., except marginal access pavements,
which shall be located to provide 16 feet from the back of the curb to the
property side R.O.W. line. Pavements in 120-foot R.O.W. streets shall be 29
feet wide on each side of the centerline, unless otherwise approved by the
County Department of Roads.
   (b)   Pavement shall be installed in accordance with the applicable details
and requirements as follows:
      (1)   All public roads and driveways shall follow either current Macomb
County Department of Roads standard details and procedures or Michigan
Department of Transportation standards details, where applicable.
      (2)   All private roads, driveways and parking areas shall follow current
Clinton Township Standard Paving Detail Sheets.
   (c)   All street pavement in residential areas shall have 18-inch wide by 4-
inch high concrete mountable curbs. Where the pavement is a boulevard section,
island curbs shall be six-inch high concrete roll curbs.
   (d)   At the end of a street that will be extended in the future, an 18-inch
wide by six-inch high concrete curb, a standard road-end barricade and a sign
shall be installed.
   (e)   Where the Zoning Code requires off-street parking, the design of the
parking area shall conform to the following requirements:
      (1)   All parking areas (other than driving lanes in residential or
commercial parking lot areas) shall be paved with:
         A.   Two inches of HMA, 5EML mix (220 pounds per square yard), on two
inches of HMA, 3EML mix (220 pounds per square yard), on nine inches of
compacted 21AA aggregate base; or
         B.   Six inches of concrete pavement (3,500 psi minimum compressive
strength) on six inches of compacted 21AA aggregate base.
      (2)   All driveway lanes in parking lots and multiple-family housing

paving, and utility construction is completed. The survey shall include, but is
not limited to, the following items:
      (1)   Utilities. Elevations of inverts and structure covers, hydrants,
and shut-offs for all underground utilities (water, sanitary and storm), along
with actual pipe lengths and types of materials, shall be obtained and noted on
plans. The location of edge drains or other underground facilities not included
above shall be noted on plans. All structures at ground level which are not in
the road pavement shall be tied in an acceptable fashion to property corners or
other suitable witnesses.
      (2)   Grading. Perimeter lot grades and additional grades at appropriate
intervals to detail the flow of drainage and the character of finished grading
work (berms, swales, etc.) shall be noted on plans. Sufficient information
should be provided to describe detention/retention areas or ponds and noted on
plans. Permanent pond elevations and/or detention-storage elevations are to be
provided.
      (3)   Paving. Finished pavement cross-section grades shall be obtained at
100-foot intervals, or where there is a significant break in the road profile
grade. Low points (sags) and crests in a road profile are to be identified.
Cross-sections at existing adjoining streets are also required.

materials used (i.e. one-half inch rerod) and certify on mylars by a registered
land surveyor that all irons and monuments are in place.
      (5)   Sidewalks. Elevations of sidewalks and pathways along major roads
shall be obtained at intervals not to exceed 50 feet in length and shall be
obtained where there is apparent breaks in grade and/or intersections with
driveways or side streets. Two elevations shall be taken at each interval to
determine the crown of the pathway.
   (c)   The above information is to be neatly described on the original
construction plan drawings by crossing out the design information and printing
the survey information adjacent to it. Both plan and profile sheets are to be
done in this fashion. On profile sheets, it is not necessary to redraw the
storm sewer or sanitary sewer, but slope, inverts, lengths, etc., shall be
indicated in the fashion described. All plans shall indicate the as-built date
and the initials of the person producing the documents. Final plans shall be
submitted on hard copy and an acceptable digital format for GIS updating.
   (d)   Submit two sets of prints of record drawings, computer-aided drafting
(CAD), and portable document format (PDF) files; these will need to be
submitted to the Department of Public Services.
   (e)   The Department of Public Services will review record drawings for
final approval. They will also determine if additional information is needed on
record drawings submittals.
   (f)   Timely submittal of final record drawings is necessary for project

         A.   The Township Board may. by resolution, establish a fee to be paid
by any person filing an appeal for a variance to any regulation of this Zoning
Code in all cases except those cases where a particular use under this Zoning
Code may be permitted only after approval by the Board of Appeals.
         B.   The Township Board may, by resolution, establish such additional
fees as it may deem reasonable to be paid by any person filing an appeal in the
event such appellant shall request a special meeting of the Board of Appeals.
      (2)   The Board of Appeals shall be furnished with all documents
constituting the records upon which the action appealed from was taken.
   (c)   Time and Notice of Appeal.
      (1)   The Board of Appeals shall schedule a hearing within and at a
reasonable time and give due notice thereof to the parties and to any person
shown on the latest tax roll as owner of any property within 300 feet of the
premises in question and to the occupants of any onefamily and two-family
dwellings within 300 feet of the premises in question by personal service or by
mail.
      (2)   Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or
attorney.
      (3)   The Board of Appeals shall decide upon the appeal within a
reasonable time.
      (4)   The decision of the Board of Appeals shall not become final until
the expiration of seven days from the date of determination, unless the Board
of Appeals shall find the immediate effect of the order is necessary for the
preservation of property or personal rights and shall so certify on the record.
The date of determination shall be deemed to be the date the motion is passed.
   (d)   Stay of Proceedings. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of
the action appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken
certifies to the Board of Appeals, after the application for hearing has been
filed and of which notice has been made to said officer, that, by reason of
fact stated in a certificate, a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order. Such restraining order may be
granted by the Board of Appeals or by the Circuit Court, on application, on due
notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
   (e)   Dimensional or non-use variances may be allowed by the Board of
Appeals. Use variances are not authorized in this Zoning Code. Dimensional or
non-use variances may be allowed only in cases where there is evidence of
practical difficulty and where all of the following standards have been met:
      (1)   There are extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying to the
property that do not apply generally to other properties in the same zoning
district. Extraordinary circumstances may include the following:
         A.   Exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific
property; or
         B.   By reason of exceptional topographic or environmental conditions
on the land, building, or structure; or
         C.   The use or development of the property immediately adjoining the
property in question would cause practical difficulties of enforcing the
requirements of the ordinance.
      (2)   The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right similar to that held by other properties in the same
zoning district and/or vicinity.
      (3)   The variance will not be detrimental to adjacent properties and the
surrounding neighborhood.
      (4)   The variance will not impair the intent and purpose of the Zoning
Code.
      (5)   The immediate practical difficulty causing the need for the request
was not created by the applicant or the applicant’s predecessor in interest.

1254.06   JURISDICTION.
   (a)   The Board of Appeals may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may
modify, the order, requirement, decision or determination as, in its opinion,
ought to be done, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from
whom the appeal is taken.
   (b)   Where there are practical difficulties in the way of carrying out the
strict letter of this Zoning Code, the Board of Appeals shall have the power,
in passing upon appeals, to vary or modify any of its rules, regulations or
provisions so that the spirit of the Zoning Code shall be observed, public
safety secured and substantial justice done.
(Ord. 260. Passed 7-9-79; Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)
1254.07   DECISION PROCESS.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall approve, with or without conditions, or
deny the application. The decision on an application shall be incorporated into
a statement of findings and conclusions relative to the request which specifies
the basis for the decision and any conditions imposed. Reasonable conditions
may be required with the approval of an application. Conditions may include
conditions necessary to ensure that public services and facilities affected by
a variance will be capable of accommodating increase services and facilities
affected or caused by the variance activity, to protect the natural environment
and conserve natural resources and energy, to ensure compatibility with
adjacent properties and to promote the use of land in a socially and
economically desirable manner.
   Decisions shall be communicated to the applicant, the Township Board, the
Planning Commission, and the Planning and Community Development Director within
one week from the time of the meeting occurring.
(Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)
1254.08   DECISIONS FINAL UNLESS APPEALED.
   The decision of the Board of Appeals shall be final, provided that any
person having lawful standing by any such decision shall have the right to
appeal to the Circuit Court as provided under State law.
(Ord. 260. Passed 7-9-79; Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)
1254.09   STANDARD CONDITIONS FOR ALL VARIANCES.
   All variances granted by the Board of Appeals are subject to several
standard conditions. These conditions are to be included in the Certificate of
Approval issued to the petitioner. The standard conditions are as follows:
   (a)   The petitioner must comply with all applicable requirements of
Township ordinances.
   (b)   The project work requiring the variance must be completed within two
years of the date that the variance was granted. A petitioner requiring an
extension to the two-year period may petition for a request for
reconsideration.
   (c)   The project work must be completed substantially in accordance with
the plans submitted to the Board of Appeals. Plans that require revision in
order to meet engineering standards and/or minor dimensional changes not
affecting the variance are considered to be substantially in accordance with
the plans submitted to the Board of Appeals. If there is a question of
interpretation, the matter shall be placed on the next available agenda of the
Board of Appeals.
   (d)   The variance is valid only for the useful life of any structure(s) on
the property for which variance was granted. The useful life of a structure is
deemed to be ended if said structure is destroyed, by any means, to an extent
beyond 50% of its reasonable market value.

1282.01   PURPOSE.
   (a)   The I-2 General Industrial District is established primarily for
manufacturing, assembly and fabrication activities including large-scale or
specialized industrial operations whose external physical effects will be felt,
to some degree, by surrounding districts. The I-2 District is structured so as
to permit, in addition to I-1 Light Industrial uses, the manufacturing,
processing and compounding of semi-finished or finished products from raw
materials.
   (b)   It is the intent of the Township of Clinton to carefully preserve land
in the I-2 General Industrial District for manufacturing and related uses.
Therefore, only in exceptional circumstances will certain convenience services
necessary to serve the industrial uses be permitted.

1286.01   PURPOSE.
   (a)   SP Special Purpose Districts are designed to accommodate specific uses
which are generally compatible with single-family areas, but which, because of
particular characteristics of size and/or use, should not be permitted in a
Residential District without review and rezoning by the Township Board.
   (b)   The purpose of this District is to permit the use of land and/or
buildings for specific purposes in order that a high degree of control over the
use to be provided for can be maintained.
   (c)   The Special Purpose Districts are split into two subdistricts, SP- and
SP-2. See Section
1286.02 for specific permitted uses related to each subdistrict.
(Ord. 260. Passed 7-9-79; Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)
1286.02   PRINCIPAL USES PERMITTED.
   (a)   In an SP-1 Special Purpose Senior Care Facilities District, no
building or land shall be used and no building shall be erected except for
convalescent homes, nursing homes, rest homes, assisted care facilities or
homes for the aged, subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   The site shall be developed so as to create a land-to-building
ratio on the parcel whereby for each one bed in the principal use there shall
be provided not less than 600 square feet of open space. The open space land
area per bed shall provide landscaped setting, off-street parking, service
drives, loading space, yard requirements and any space required for accessory
uses. The 600 square foot requirement is in addition to the building coverage
area.
      (2)   In an SP-1 Special Purpose Senior Care Facilities District,
buildings shall not exceed three stories or 35 feet in height.
   (b)   In an SP-2 Special Purpose Hospitals District, no building or land
shall be used and no building shall be erected except for a hospital or clinic
for human care.
   (c)   Accessory buildings and uses customarily incidental to any of the
principal uses permitted in the SP Districts shall also be permitted.

Passed 10-30-23.)
1286.03   REQUIRED CONDITIONS.
   (a)   All access to the site shall be directly from a major thoroughfare.
   (b)   Whenever the parking plan is designed so as to cause automobile
headlights to be directed toward any Residential District within 100 feet of
the parking areas, an obscuring wall, fence or berm may be required, as
recommended by the Planning Commission and approved by the Township Board,
along that entire side of the parking area.
   (c)   The lot area covered by all buildings shall not exceed thirty-five
percent.
(Ord. 260. Passed 7-9-79.)
   (d)   For all parcels directly abutting a major thoroughfare, access to the
parcel shall be from an internal marginal access road having a width of thirty
feet and not directly from the abutting Clinton Township thoroughfare. The
Township Board, upon recommendation from the Planning Commission, may waive
this requirement if such marginal access road is impractical to construct or
would serve no useful purpose. In granting such waiver, the Township Board may
require easements to provide for vehicular access to existing or proposed
adjacent parking lots in order to minimize the need for driveways to each
facility and thereby decreasing hazards to vehicle traffic. In such instances,
a reciprocal use agreement shall be signed by each owner in a form satisfactory
to the Township Attorney and shall be recorded with the Macomb County Register
of Deeds.
   (e)   Curb cuts for vehicular access to and from a marginal access road to
and from the abutting major thoroughfare shall be no closer than 300 feet to
each other.

   FOOTNOTES TO SCHEDULE OF REGULATIONS CHART
   (a)   Modifications in height requirements above the 35 feet allowed within
the district may be permitted subject to the requirements and conditions set
forth in
Chapter 1293.
   (b)   All required front yard setbacks shall be measured from the proposed
right-of-way line of any abutting thoroughfare. In the instance of a corner lot
or parcel of land abutting more than one public thoroughfare, all frontages
shall require the minimum front yard setback specified in the district. Off-
street parking shall be permitted to occupy a front yard setback in excess of
the minimum setback of 25 feet.
   (c)   Off-street loading and unloading space shall be provided in the rear
yard or an interior side yard, unless the side yard abuts a Residential
District and shall, in no instance, be permitted in a front yard. In those
instances where exterior side yards abut an Industrial District, loading and
unloading may take place in the exterior side yard, except that in those
instances where exterior side yards have a common relationship with an
Industrial District across a public thoroughfare, loading and unloading may
take place in the side yard when the setback is equal to at least 50 feet. Off-
street loading space shall further meet the requirements of Section
1294. Where an alley exists or is provided at the rear of the buildings, the
rear building setback and loading requirements may be computed from the
centerline of such alley, but separately from the off-street parking
requirements.
   (d)   The minimum distance between any two buildings shall be 20 feet. In no
instance shall a building be located closer than 50 feet to a residentially-
zoned district.

CHAPTER 1287
GB Groesbeck Highway Overlay District
1287.01   Purpose and objectives.
1287.02   Application of chapter.
1287.03   General requirements in flood hazard areas.
1287.04   Watercourse and wetland protection.
1287.05   Site plan review; drawings.
1287.01   PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   The purpose of this section is to establish design standards for new
development, significant redevelopment, or changes to a more intense use or
expansion for commercially and industrially zoned properties along Groesbeck/M-
97 Highway in Clinton Township.
   (b)   Groesbeck Highway has been targeted by the Township as a reinvestment
opportunity to help bring cohesiveness, economic development, aesthetic value,
and pedestrian-friendly design to the corridor that is consistent with the
Township Master Plan's goals.
   (c)   The standards herein are based on the Design Guidelines and have some
level of flexibility to respond to opportunities and adjust to the scale and
location of the development. Refer to the M-97/Groesbeck Highway Design
Guidelines for representative illustrations of the standards. The Design
Guidelines ensure that the standards meet the intent of this Overlay District
regarding landscaping, screening and buffering, access and circulation,
building scale/placement, parking placement, building design and materials,
signage, and lighting.
   The goals of this overlay district include the following:
      (1)   Provide for functional and attractive new development/redevelopment
of a site.
      (2)   Encourage reinvestment in vacant and underutilized properties.
      (3)   Enhance the public realm and pedestrian experience through
aesthetic improvements.
      (4)   Provide a transparent and consistent framework for decision-making.
(Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)
1287.02   APPLICABILITY OF STANDARDS.   
   (a)   These standards are applicable to all new commercial and industrial
development and substantial building expansions or alterations (results in
expanding a building in excess of 125% of the existing Gross Floor Area), or
major changes in use that increases the intensity of the use (i.e. results in
more traffic, parking, noise, and other external impacts) along M-97/Groesbeck
Highway in Clinton Township (see Figure 1).
   (b)   All requirements of the Zoning Code shall apply, except as modified by
this Section. When applying the regulations of this Overlay, if regulations
elsewhere within the Zoning Code conflict or appear to conflict with the
regulations in this Overlay, the regulations of this Overlay shall apply.
   (c)   Groesbeck Highway, or M-97, is under jurisdiction of the Michigan
Department of Transportation. The land uses of parcels along the corridor in
Clinton Township are under jurisdiction of the Township. While most of the
standards apply to the area outside of the Groesbeck Highway right-of-way, some
of the features, such as sidewalks and street trees, may be within those areas
that require a permit from Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In
such cases, coordination with the Township and MDOT is necessary.

(Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)
1287.03   EXEMPTIONS.
   (a )    For expansion or redevelopment of existing sites, the Planning and
Community Development Director, Planning Commission, or Township Board may
determine that compliance with standards of this section are difficult to meet
based on factors such as the amount of the overall improvement to the site or
the extent of change compared to existing conditions but that the standards
shall be applied to the site to the maximum extent possible. Full compliance is
required for new development. The following list is a hierarchy of priority
design standards (with (1) being the highest priority standard to be met and
(8) being the lowest priority standard to be met):
      (1)   Frontage landscaping.
      (2)   Sidewalks along Groesbeck Highway.
      (3)   Internal sidewalk connections.
      (4)   Buffers and Screening.
      (5)   Lighting.
      (6)   Access consolidations.
      (7)   Signage.
      (8)   Interior Landscaping.
   (b)   The applicant shall provide justification for why particular standards
could not be met. Higher priority design standards will require thorough
justification and are discouraged from being altered. The applicant shall also
state how the site plan still meets the general intent of the Township Master
Plan, Strategic Plan, Zoning Code, and the overall purpose of these Design
Standards.
(Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)
1287.04   REVIEW PROCESS.
   (a)   When an applicant submits a site plan, the Director of Planning and
Community Development or the Planning Commission will oversee the review of
compliance with the standards set forth in this section. The review process
shall adhere to the Site Plan Review Process as set forth in Chapter 1297.
Other Township departments and agencies (i.e. MDOT) may also be involved with
the review process.
(Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)
1287.05   DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   Frontage and Interior Landscaping. Landscaping along the corridor
should be cohesive to enhance the streetscape and be easy to maintain for
property owners. Additional landscaping standards apply, including buffers and
screening and parking lot landscaping, and can be found in
Chapter 1295 . Where there are conflicts, the standards in this overlay
district shall apply.
      (1)   Frontage Landscaping along Groesbeck. Proper landscaping in front
yard areas that are visible from the corridor shall be implemented to maintain
consistency along street frontage on Groesbeck Highway.
         A.   Landscaped Front Yards. Enhanced landscaping shall be applied as
gateway treatments at entry points of the property. Consistently spaced trees
shall be planted along the property's frontage with a minimum of one tree per
20 linear feet, interspersed with low maintenance shrubs.
         B.   Front Yard Screening for Commercial/Retail Properties. Front
yards shall be landscaped and screened using a minimum of a ten-foot-wide
landscape area with a continuous hedge, no more than three feet in height. One
canopy or evergreen tree shall be planted every 20 linear feet.
         C.   Front Yard Screening for Industrial Properties. Front yards for
industrial properties shall be landscaped and screened using a minimum of a 25-
foot-wide landscape area with a continuous hedge, no more than three feet in
height. One canopy and one evergreen tree shall be staggered and planted every
20 linear feet.
         D.   Other Plantings. Low shrubs, perennials, and ornamental grasses
shall kept below three feet in height for natural surveillance. Landscape areas
shall include a combination of low shrubs, perennials and/or ornamental grasses
with one low shrub being equivalent to two perennials or ornamental grasses.
The table below describes additional number of plants required in the front
yard landscaping:
 
Number of Plants Required
                               4 low shrubs or
Street frontage landscape area 8 perennials/ornamental grasses per 20 linear
                               feet
 
      (2)   Site Design Amenities. These elements will create better pedestrian
conditions, establish enhanced open spaces and sustainable design features, a
more appealing overall appearance of each site. Some of these standards may not
apply to certain sites where they do not exist or are not already required
(i.e. detention ponds, outdoor dining, etc.).
         A.   Foundation plantings shall be installed along building edges to
screen the appearance of building foundations from public view. Foundation
planting areas adjacent to the building edges shall be at least five feet wide.
Plantings should be low maintenance species and may include a combination of
small canopy or ornamental trees, evergreen trees, shrubs, and ornamental
grasses. Foundation plantings must not block the building's windows, doors, or
entryways. Planting areas shall be mulched and edged to create a clean and
well-kept appearance.
         B.   Detention ponds shall be designed as natural free-form in shape.
Side slopes must not exceed one vertical foot for every three horizontal feet.
Plantings around detention ponds shall include at minimum one canopy or
evergreen tree and either ten shrubs or groupings of ornamental grasses for
every 50 linear feet of pond perimeter. Plantings should be in a random,
natural pattern. Any security fencing around the perimeter shall be decorative.
Shrubs shall be planted around the outside of fencing to soften the appearance
at a maximum spacing of five feet between shrubs.
         C.   Waste receptacles shall be completely enclosed by opaque
screening on three sides and operable opaque doors for access on one side.
         D.   Service and mechanical areas shall be located in the rear or on
the side of buildings in a way that their appearance is minimized or eliminated
from the roadway and public areas.
         E.   Opaque fencing or a combination of opaque fencing and masonry
shall be used. Materials for screening or enclosures shall be high quality and
durable, yet visually appealing and they may include the following: Corrugated
or ribbed metal (more appropriate for industrial contexts); Powder-coated
extruded aluminum slats; Treated hardwood; Brick; Stone; Metal screen.
Screening shall be at least six feet tall. Prohibited types of fencing includes
chain link with slats and barbed wire. Landscaping and planting around
screening and enclosures for these areas is highly encouraged, especially if
the area is visible from public parking areas or from the street.
         F.   Outdoor Dining spaces shall include defined seating areas. These
should remain consistent and complementary to the building with which the
outdoor dining space is associated. Barrier styles shall include one or a
combination of the following: (1) free standing decorative fences or railings;
(2) low masonry walls; (3) planters; (4) planting areas inclusive of ornamental
grass, hedges, shrubs, and/or ornamental trees. Fences or walls shall be a
maximum height of 36" above the outdoor patio surface.
         G.   Screening of outdoor dining areas adjacent to parking areas shall
include an opaque area of at least four feet in height to protect the space
from headlights of cars maneuvering and parking. Outdoor dining areas shall
provide at least one exterior exit/entrance point that is connected to the
sidewalk and/or parking areas. When located on public sidewalks, a minimum
sidewalk clearance of six feet shall be retained for unrestricted pedestrian
access.
         H.   For industrial sites two acres or larger in size, a minimum of
10% of the site shall contain useable open space. This is internal space and
does not include required buffer and greenbelt areas, though some flexibility
to include non-required amenities in those areas, such as seating, could meet
the intent. At least 5% of any new commercial development shall contain useable
open space, with exceptions allowed for very small lots (less than ½ acre) or
where existing buildings and parking will not easily accommodate that much open
space. In those cases, some amenities should be provided in other locations in
the site. Usable open space should be designed to include amenities like picnic
areas, pocket parks, courtyards, patios, pathways, benches, and water features.
Open space and associated amenities are to be maintained by the property owner.
Where multiple open spaces occur on the property, pedestrian connections (i.e.
a pathway), should be made to connect them. Existing natural features on the
property are encouraged to be preserved, including mature trees, wetlands, and
ponds. If designed with associated public amenities, these features can count
towards useable open space.
         I.   Maintenance. All landscaping shall be properly maintained and
irrigated. Diseased, dying, or dead landscaping shall be replaced.
   (b)   Rear Screening and Buffers. 
      (1)   Rear yard design standards for commercial properties. The rear yard
shall be landscaped and screened with a minimum five-foot-wide landscaped area
with evergreen trees and/or tall shrubs with a four-foot-eight-inch tall
masonry wall. Wall materials shall match or complement the building materials.
      (2)   Rear yard design standards for industrial properties. The rear yard
shall be landscaped and screened with a minimum five-foot-wide landscaped area
with evergreen trees and/or tall shrubs with a six-foot-tall masonry wall. Wall
materials shall match or complement the building materials.
   (c)   Access and Circulation. Access management along the corridor is
necessary to ensure safe and efficient travel for all users of the roadway.
Proper access management can minimize traffic conflicts and provide clear
accessibility to properties for vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles.
Pedestrians, in particular, need safe passageway between the right-of-way and
the building entrance. A properly designed circulation system is a key
component to encouraging a walkable environment.
      (1)   The number of driveways along Groesbeck Highway shall be minimized
as much as is practical.
      (2)   Shared access between adjoining properties should be encouraged,
with cross-access easements provided.
      (3)   Driveways shall either be aligned with those across the street, or
spaced at least 150 feet from them, to avoid left turn conflicts in the center
turn lane.
      (4)   Driveways shall be spaced as far apart as possible. It is
recommended by MDOT to space driveways 455 feet apart on the same side of the
road for roads that have a posted speed limit of 50 mph (like Groesbeck
Highway). Driveways shall also be kept as far as possible from signalized
intersections to reduce traffic conflicts.
      (5)   Driveways shall be designed for the typical vehicle in terms of
radii and width. For uses that generate higher traffic volumes or with
significant truck movements, MDOT may require a deceleration taper or lane.
      (6)   Where a site is adjacent to an undeveloped property, the site shall
be designed to accommodate a future parking lot connection.
      (7)   Loading areas shall not interfere with on-site pedestrian and
vehicle circulation.
      (8)   Pedestrian crosswalks and pathways shall be provided within parking
areas of more than 25 parking spaces to ensure safe passage between vehicles
and the building entrance.
      (9)   Where sidewalks do not currently exist along the public roadway,
sidewalks with a minimum five feet of width should be installed. Sidewalks
should generally be placed one foot inside the property line. Since Groesbeck
Highway is a state roadway, approval of MDOT is required.
      (10)   A safe and convenient connection should be provided between the
sidewalk along Groesbeck Highway and the building's front entrance. In some
cases, islands and crosswalk-type markings may be needed, especially for
restaurants and other businesses that will have relatively high pedestrian
volumes.
   (d)   Building Scale/Placement and Parking Placement. Buildings should
typically be oriented to face the street, and setbacks along the corridor
should be consistent to provide a more cohesive street wall and pedestrian-
oriented environment. Similarly, parking placement is crucial to site design;
side and rear parking areas are highly encouraged not only for aesthetic
reasons, but to also encourage walkability and decrease the potential for
vehicle and pedestrian/bicycle conflicts.
      (1)   Industrial and Commercial Building Design Standards.
         A.   For industrial buildings, the minimum setback shall be 60 feet to
accommodate for pedestrian amenities, open space, and landscaped buffers.
Commercial buildings shall be setback at least 35 feet, but no more than 50
feet along the corridor.
         B.   Buildings shall be oriented so that at least one main entrance
faces the road. The main entrances of a building shall be ADA compliant.
         C.   For larger buildings with multiple tenants, multiple entries
along the street frontage should be incorporated into the site plan.
         D.   Parking shall be located along the side and rear yards to avoid
dominating the streetscape. Where this is not possible, a limit of two rows of
parking is permitted in the front yard. If front yard parking is implemented,
then additional landscaping is required to properly screen the parking area.
         E.   Shared parking is encouraged between adjacent sites or mixed-use
developments on the same site.
         F.   Parking per use shall not exceed 110% of the minimum parking
spaces required as stated in the Zoning Code.
         G.   For corner lots, buildings or landscaping shall be located
nearest the intersection. Parking areas are discouraged at this location.
         H.   Outdoor storage areas shall not be visible from the roadway.
Ideally, storage areas and loading facilities are located to the rear of the
building. Proper screening and landscaping shall be implemented where these
storage and/or loading areas abut residential properties.
      (2)   Multi-Family Residential Building Design Standards.
         A.   Multi-family residential buildings shall be setback a minimum of
60 feet from the right-of-way along Groesbeck Highway. Setbacks for any
internal roads as part of a development shall be at least 20 feet.
         B.   Any development with multiple buildings shall allow a minimum of
30 feet spacing between buildings.
         C.   Developments with multiple residential buildings shall include an
open space for residents that is central to and accessible from all buildings.
         D.   Pathways and driveways shall be paved. Pathways for pedestrians
shall connect to sidewalks along the roadway and lead directly to building or
individual unit entrances, whichever applies to the residential building.
         E.   Parking may consist of surface parking, garages (attached or
detached) or carports and shall be adjacent or close to the primary structure.
Parking for multi-family residential units may be front, side, or rear entry in
relation to each unit. It is encouraged that parking is not visible from the
roadway. If a residential building is facing the corridor, it is encouraged
that parking is located behind the building. If a residential building is
facing a direction other than toward the corridor, parking shall be screened
from view.
         F.   Access to multi-family residential parking areas is encouraged on
side streets or consolidated along internal roads of a development wherever
possible.
         G.   Where a parking lot is adjacent to a single family-zoning
district, a screening wall or landscape buffer is required.
   (e)   Building Design and Materials. Building massing and façade treatments,
especially along sides that are visible from the roadway and adjacent
residential uses, should have a consistent architectural quality along the
corridor.
      (1)    If a building is more than one story, a different architectural
treatment may be used on the ground floor façade than on the upper floors.
      (2)   Climbing vegetation and green walls are encouraged as a method to
provide visual interest to building façades.
      (3)   The following building materials and designs are discouraged as
their features can negatively affect the overall look and feel of the corridor:
         A.   Aluminum siding.
         B.   Asphalt shingles.
         C.   Larger and blank wall façades.
         D.   Brightly-colored roofs.
         E.   Pre-fabricated metal walls.
         F.   Highly reflective surfaces.
      (4)   Building Design for Commercial Buildings.
         A.   65% of the total front façade of a building shall be of brick or
similar material (excluding window and doorway openings, as well as decorative
trim). Side and rear façades shall be at least 50% each of brick or similar
material, in coordination with the front façade treatment.
         B.   For building front and side façades that are 100 feet or greater
in length, these shall be designed with offsets at intervals of every 50 feet.
         C.   Building sides visible from Groesbeck Highway or internal parking
lots or adjacent residential uses, shall also be at least 50% brick, with the
same exclusions.
         D.   Modulation of roofs and roof lines are encouraged to eliminate
the look of box-shaped buildings.
      (5)   Building Design for Industrial Buildings.
         A.   Exterior façade materials shall consist of high quality and
durable materials on the building frontage and corner articulations. If a
façade faces residential, then that façade should also consist of similar types
of materials, including brick, concrete block, and pre-cast concrete.
         B.   Blank walls are discouraged. Building articulation can be met
through providing transparency and varying building materials and finishes to
create a more welcoming feel to the overall building.
         C.   For buildings that are 100 feet in length or longer, a material
change and shift in the wall façade shall be applied to the front façade for
every 40 feet. If side and rear façades face either another roadway or
residential use, then the same standard applies.
      (6)   Building Design for Multi-Family Buildings.
         A.   Architectural features and façade variation are required for
buildings with a length greater than 100 feet to break up expansive façades.
         B.   For street-facing exterior elevations, 75% of the total area for
each façade may be brick, face brick, or stone (excluding windows, doorways,
and decorative trim.) Permitted materials for the remaining 25% of the building
include wood, vinyl, or fiber cement siding.
         C.   Side and rear façades that do not face a street may be brick,
face brick, stone, wood, vinyl, or fiber cement siding, but using the same
materials and treatment as street-facing façades is encouraged.
         D.   Permitted materials for foundation walls include concrete block,
score block, precast concrete, and cast-in-place concrete.
         E.   Detached garages, carports or accessory building exteriors shall
use a similar treatment and materials that are coordinated with the primary
residential structure.
         F.   All exterior utility equipment, such as air conditioning units
and utility boxes, shall be screened from view from the roadway.
   (f)   Signs. Signage can hold a significant influence upon the general
aesthetics and safety of the roadway. The placement, type, and number of signs
permitted on a site, if executed properly, can keep signs from distracting and
interfering with traffic and other users of the road.
      (1)   Locate signage on the site to not obstruct the sightlines of
vehicles entering and exiting the property. Signs shall also be placed so that
they do not dominate the architectural features of the building.
      (2)   Signage shall be sized to be visible to pedestrians and makes
access to the entrance of the building obvious.
      (3)   For multi-tenant signs, similar color schemes should be utilized to
avoid signage clutter. Varying fonts can be used to differentiate between
business logos.
      (4)   Signs can be illuminated, but only to the minimum required for
readability at night.
   (g)   Lighting. Proper lighting on a site should minimize light trespass
onto adjacent properties (particularly residential properties) as well as serve
the purpose of providing a safe and secure environment for users and visitors
to the property. Well-designed lighting will also not contribute to nighttime
pollution, helping to preserve the natural quality of the nighttime sky.
      (1)   The height and direction of lighting on a site shall light the
property it’s intended for, but avoid light pollution spilling onto adjacent
properties. Lighting shall not exceed 25 feet in height from the parking lot
grade and should be particularly sensitive to adjacent residential properties.
      (2)   Ornamental lighting shall be used along pedestrian walkways (both
within the site and along the street side of the property) and adjacent to
building entrances to provide for a safe and pedestrian-scaled environment.
      (3)   Exterior lighting should complement the architectural style of the
building and contribute to the overall design of the site. Wall mounted and
pole mounted lights shall direct light downward. Where uplighting is desired on
a building façade to highlight architectural features, it shall be angled or
shielded to avoid unnecessary light pollution.

1288.07   Final Phase PUD Plan.
1288.08   Minor Amendments to Final Phase PUD Plan.
1288.01   INTENT.
   The intent of the Planned Unit Development ("PUD") District is to permit
flexible regulation of land development for a site containing unique natural
features which the developer and Township desires to preserve and/or for
property in an area adjacent to a major thoroughfare which is undergoing
redevelopment. The standards of the PUD District are intended to encourage
innovative design and create opportunities which may not be obtainable through
more rigid standards within other zoning districts. The PUD District is
intended to accommodate developments with potential mixed or varied uses, sites
with unusual topography or unique settings within the community and/or on land
exhibiting difficult or costly development problems. The PUD District
classification is not permitted where this zoning classification is sought
primarily to avoid the imposition of standards and requirements of other zoning
classifications rather than to achieve the stated purpose above.
(Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)
1288.02   TOWNSHIP BOARD APPROVAL.
   The Board of Trustees of the Charter Township of Clinton shall review
Planning Commission recommendations on all applications for PUD, permit public
comment thereon and make final decisions to grant approval, deny approval or
grant approval with conditions as provided within the ordinance. No issuance of
any zoning certificate or building permit shall occur prior to Township Board
approval.
(Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)
1288.03   PERMITTED USES.
   (a)   Permitted Uses.
      (1)   Permitted Principal Uses. Any combination of uses permitted in any
residential, office, business, technical research or industrial classification
pursuant to this chapter. No marihuana related uses shall be permitted pursuant
to this chapter.
      (2)   Permitted Accessory Uses. Any use which is accessory to the uses
allowed as permitted principle uses.
(Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)
1288.04   ELIGIBILITY.
   (a)   A PUD may be allowed by the Township Board following a recommendation
by the Planning Commission based upon review and consideration of the following
applicable criteria:
      (1)   The subject site shall be a minimum size of one acre of contiguous
land. All such land shall be under the control of one owner, or a group of
owners. All applications must be made with written authorization of all
property owners and any parties to executory purchase agreements, options to
purchase, or holding some prospective or beneficial interest in the subject
property.
      (2)   The proposed site contains significant natural or historic features
to be preserved through development under the PUD standards, or the PUD will
provide a complimentary mixture of uses or housing types with unique, high
quality design, and is suitable for the blending of existing and proposed uses.
      (3)   The PUD District will result in the recognizable and substantial
benefit to the ultimate users of the project and to the Township, where such
benefit would otherwise be unfeasible or unlikely to be achieved. These
benefits shall be demonstrated in terms of the preservation of natural
features, unique architecture, extensive landscaping, integration of various
site features into a unified development, provision of useful open space and/or
shall expand the supply of affordable housing or provision of employment and
shopping opportunities.
      (4)   A finding that the proposed type and density of use shall not
result in an unreasonable increase of traffic, use of public services,
facilities and utilities; that the natural features of the subject site have
the capacity to accommodate the intended development; and that the development
shall not place an unreasonable burden upon surrounding land or land owners.
      (5)   The proposed PUD District shall be consistent with the Master Plan
of the Township.
      6)   Useable open space and off street parking shall be furnished at
least equal to the minimum requirements for each of the component uses of the
PUD District. The Township may require, depending on the configuration and
location of the proposed PUD District, more or less useable open space and
parking than required otherwise within other provisions of this chapter.
      (7)   Landscaping and screening shall be furnished to ensure that the
proposed use or uses shall be adequately buffered from one and another and from
surrounding public and private property. The Township may require more or less
landscaping and screening than required otherwise by this chapter.
      (8)   Vehicular and pedestrian circulation allowing safe, convenient,
uncongested and well defined circulation within and to the PUD District shall
be provided.
(Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)
1288.05   APPROVAL PROCEDURE.
   (a)   The following approval procedures shall apply to the PUD District:
      (1)   The PUD District approval involves two phases. The preliminary
phase involves a review of the conceptual PUD District to determine its
suitability for inclusion in the land use and zoning plans of the Township and
adoption by the Township as part of the Zoning Code. The final phase shall
require detailed site plans for any part of the conceptual PUD Plan prior to
the issuance of building permits. The two phases may be combined and considered
for approval as a preliminary and final PUD Plan.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may hold an informational meeting where the
petitioner presents the proposed PUD Plan. The Planning Commission shall
provide the petitioner with its comments within 30 days after holding such a
meeting. Notice of the meeting shall be given to the Board of Trustees. No fees
shall be charged for said informational meeting.
      (3)   Petitioner shall submit to the Director of Planning and Community
Development sufficient copies of the PUD Plans with review fees following such
informational meeting. Copies of plans as submitted shall be distributed to
appropriate Township agencies for review and comment to determine the impact of
the proposed PUD District upon Township services and surrounding properties and
to determine if any additions to or extensions of facilities are necessary for
the project.
      (4)   The Director of Planning and Community Development shall notify the
petitioner of questions raised by Township agencies during said review
submitting like information to the Planning Commission for its consideration
along with a report evaluating the planning aspects of the project and its
impact on the present and future development of the Township.
      (5)   The Planning Commission shall, after holding a public hearing or
hearings on the proposed PUD Plan and reviewing reports, make its
recommendation to the Township Board upon such plan within 60 days of its date
of filing, unless an agreement to extend by petitioner occurs in writing. The
Planning Commission may extend this time period for a period not to exceed 30
days each if such extension is necessary for adequate review as a result of
materials being considered incomplete by the Director of Planning and Community
Development or the Planning Commission. Public hearing notice shall be
furnished in the same manner as for rezoning and special land use, including
publication in a newspaper of general circulation and notice by mail or
personal delivery to owners of property for which approval is considered and to
all persons to whom real property is assessed within 300 feet of the property
and occupants of all structures within 300 feet of the property.
      (6)   If the preliminary phase or final phase of the PUD Plan is rejected
by the Planning Commission, reasons for such rejection shall be specified in
writing and approved by the Planning Commission.
      (7)   The Planning Commission's recommendations and reports shall be
submitted to the Township Board for its consideration. The Township Board
shall, after allowing public comment on the preliminary phase and final phase
PUD Plan, take final action on said plan and petition within 90 days from the
date they receive a report from the Planning Commission or such reasonable
extension of time as determined necessary for adequate review by the Township
Board as a result of incomplete information being submitted, modifications
proposed or delay in the submittal of additional information for consideration.
      (8)   Any conditions of approval required by the Township Board shall be
satisfied by petitioner, owner, or other parties submitting the application
prior to subsequent final phase site plan approval and prior to the issuance of
any building permits and the commencement of any work on the subject property.
The Township Clerk and Department of Planning and Community Development each
shall keep a special record of all approved PUD Plans and approved conditions.
      (9)   Approval of the preliminary phase PUD Plan by the Township Board
shall rezone the property to a "PUD" zoning classification for uses as shown on
the PUD Plan and shall confer upon the owner the right to proceed through the
subsequent planning phase in accordance with regulations and ordinances in
effect at the time of the Township Board's approval for a period not to exceed
18 months from the date of approval, unless subsequent regulations or
ordinances are specifically made applicable to developments which have been so
approved. If final phase PUD Plans have not been submitted for approval before
the termination of the aforesaid 18 month period, subsequent site planning must
conform to the regulations, ordinances and laws in effect at the time such site
plan is submitted upon request of the petitioner. The Township Board may extend
the approval for a maximum of an additional 18 months. Any such extension shall
be granted only if existing site conditions have not substantially changed, and
provided further that there are no revisions to the PUD Plan. If, after the 18
month extension a building permit has still not been issued, the petitioner
must resubmit the PUD Plan for normal review as provided herein.
      (10)   An approved PUD District runs with the land, not with the owner.
If the land is sold or otherwise exchanged, the approved PUD District shall
remain in effect, unless a petitioner submits and is granted a request to amend
or terminate the PUD District.
(Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)

   (a)   The following standards apply to walls and earth berms:
      (1)   Continuous earth berms shall be provided with undulating horizontal
and vertical top and sides, the height of which shall be no less than required
for a wall in the district. Earth berms may consist of opaque screen plantings
within the horizontal berm depressions, masonry walls or a combination of both
as long as the minimum required height of the earth berm, plantings, walls or
combinations thereof is provided.
      (2)   Berms shall be landscaped earth mounds possessing a maximum slope
ratio of three to one (three feet of horizontal plane for each one foot of
vertical height). Side slopes shall be designed and planted to prevent erosion.
The berms shall have a nearly flat horizontal area at their crests of at least
two feet in width.
      (3)   Berm or earth mound slopes shall be protected from erosion by
sodding or seeding. If slopes are seeded, they shall be protected with a straw
mulch held in place by jute netting until the seed germinates and a permanent
lawn is established. The straw mulch is not required if the seeded slope is
protected by a net which is specifically designed to control erosion. The berm
area shall be kept perpetually free of weeds, refuse, debris and general
clutter, shall be planted with shrubs, trees or lawn and shall be continuously
maintained in a healthy growing condition. Failure to maintain the earth berm
area in accordance with these requirements shall constitute a violation of this
Zoning Code.
      (4)   In those instances where the Planning Commission and the Township
Board permit an earth berm or landscaped greenbelt in lieu of a wall, a
detailed drawing of the proposed berm, greenbelt or other barrier shall be
submitted in addition to the site plan.
      (5)   Required walls, earth berms or a greenbelt shall be located as
nearly as possible to the lot lines, except where underground utilities
interfere and except in instances where this Zoning Code requires conformance
with front yard setback lines in abutting Residential Districts.
      (6)   Such walls, earth berms and/or greenbelt shall have no openings for
vehicular traffic or other purposes, except as otherwise provided in this
subsection.
      All walls herein required shall be constructed of materials approved by
the Township Department of Building to be durable, weather-resistant, rustproof
and easily maintained.
      Masonry walls or earth berms may be constructed with openings which do
not, in any square section (height and width), exceed 20% of the surface. Where
walls or earth berms are so pierced, the openings shall be spaced so as to
maintain the obscuring characteristic required and shall not reduce the minimum
height requirement. The arrangement of the openings shall be reviewed by the
Planning Commission and approved by the Township Board.
      (7)   Required walls may, upon recommendation of the Planning Commission
and approval of the Township Board, be located on the opposite side of an alley
right of way from a nonresidential zone that abuts a residential zone upon
agreement with affected property owners. Such agreements shall be indicated on
the site plan and recorded as a covenant upon the land. The continuity of the
required wall on a given block will be a major consideration of the Planning
Commission and Township Board in reviewing such requests.
      (8)   Upon review of the site plan, the Planning Commission may recommend
to the Township Board a waiver of any part or all of the wall, earth berm or
greenbelt requirements, if it is determined that the intended screening effect
of the wall, earth berm or greenbelt would serve no useful purpose. Planning
Commission may also recommend to the Township Board to substitute the required
masonry wall for a six foot high vinyl fencing where they determine it is
appropriate.
      (9)   If the Planning Commission and Township Board should determine that
a Residential District may be a future nonresidential area, temporary waiver of
the requirements of this section, for an initial period not to exceed 12 months
may be granted, provided that escrow money or a surety bond in the amount of
the estimated cost for erection of the wall or earth berm is filed with the
Township for a period not to exceed five years. Granting of waivers, subsequent
to the first waiver, shall be permitted.

Commission or Township Board. If interior landscaping is provided along the
perimeter of the parking lot, it shall be in addition to the perimeter
landscaping requirements.
      (1)   All parking lots shall be landscaped with canopy tree per 3,200
square feet of pavement.
      (2)   Interior landscape islands shall have a minimum area of 150 square
feet. Each landscape island shall a minimum of one canopy tree.
   (b)   Perimeter Landscaping and Screening. Perimeter landscaping shall be
provided along the edge of any parking lot facing and located within 100 feet
of a public right-of-way. The Planning Commission or Township Board may waive
this requirement if the parking lot will be sufficiently screened from view by
buildings or improvements on the site. Parking lot perimeter landscaping shall
comply with the following standards:
      (1)   Perimeter parking lot landscaping shall include a minimum of one
deciduous tree and one ornamental tree per every 40 lineal feet.
      (2)   Where a parking lot or loading area for a nonresidential uses abuts
a residential use or district, a minimum four foot eight inch tall wall shall
be provided between the parking lot and residential lot. Walls shall be
constructed of brick or other masonry material compatible with the front façade
of the principal building. The Township may approve a six-foot high vinyl
privacy fence where it is more compatible with adjacent residential uses.
   (c)   Curbing Required. All landscaping and perimeter screening shall be
protected from vehicle encroachment with concrete curbing or similar methods.

1297.04   SPECIAL LAND USE APPROVAL.
   (a)   In all cases, the power to grant special approval is vested in the
Township Board. All applications for special approval shall include a site plan
in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 1293 and shall be submitted to
the Department of Planning and Community Development for review and
recommendation. A public hearing, in accordance with State law and after proper
notice, shall be held by the Planning Commission in order to hear any comments
or matters by any person on the application. The Planning Commission shall
consider all comments in making recommendation to the Township Board.
      In reviewing a request for special approval, the Planning Commission and
Township Board shall consider each case individually and must find that, in
addition to the minimum conditions as previously specified herein, each of the
following conditions will also be met:
      (1)   The proposed use shall be of such location, size and character that
it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the
surrounding area and applicable regulations of the zoning district in which it
is to be located.
      (2)   The proposed use shall be of a nature which will make vehicular and
pedestrian traffic no more hazardous than is normal for the district involved,
taking into consideration vehicular traffic flow, proximity and relationship to
intersections, adequacy of sign distances and location and access to off-street
parking.
      (3)   The proposed use shall be designed as to the location, size
intensity, site layout and periods of operation of any such proposed use in
order to eliminate any possible nuisance emanating therefrom, which might be
noxious to the occupants of any nearby permitted uses, whether by reason of
dust, noise, fumes, vibration, smoke or lights.
      (4)   The proposed use shall be such that the proposed location or height
of buildings or structures will not interfere with or discourage the
appropriate development or use of adjacent land or unreasonably affect their
value.
   (b)   The Township Board shall provide a statement of findings and
conclusions relative to the special land use which specifies the basis for the
decision and any conditions imposed. The Township Board may, upon
recommendation from the Planning Commission, impose such conditions or
limitations in granting approval which it deems necessary to fulfill the
requirements set forth in subsection (a) hereof. Such conditions, imposed with
respect to the approval of a special use, shall be recorded in the record of
the approval action and shall remain unchanged.
   (c)   In all cases where a particular special use has been granted,
application for a building permit must be made not later than eighteen months
thereafter or such approval shall automatically be revoked.
   (d)   If the Township Board determines that the particular special use
requested does not meet the standards of subsection (a) hereof or may be
injurious to the public health, safety, welfare or orderly development of the
Township, said Board shall deny the application and furnish the applicant
written endorsement of the same which clearly sets forth the reasons for
denial.

Appendix II
1298.01   INTENT.
   (a)   It is the intent of this chapter to permit legal nonconforming lots,
structures or uses to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage
their survival.
   (b)   It is recognized that there exist within the districts established by
this Zoning Code and subsequent amendments, lots, structures and uses of land
and structures which were lawful before this Zoning Code was passed or amended
which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this
Zoning Code or future amendments. Such uses are declared by this Zoning Code to
be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved.
   (c)   It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall
not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as the basis for adding
other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
   (d)   A nonconforming use of either or both a structure and/or land shall
not be extended or enlarged after the effective date of this Zoning Code by
attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen
from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would
be prohibited in the district involved.
   (e)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Zoning Code shall be deemed
to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any
building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective
date of this Zoning Code, or any amendment thereto, and upon which construction
has diligently proceeded and progressed. Actual construction is hereby defined
to include the placing of construction materials in a permanent manner, except
that where demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially
begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to
be actual construction, provided that work shall diligently proceed and
progress until the completion of the building involved.
(Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)
1298.02   NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   In any district in which one-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding
limitations imposed by other regulations of this Zoning Code, a one-family
dwelling and customary accessory building may be erected on any single lot of
record on the effective date of this Zoning Code, or any amendment thereto.
This regulation shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements
for area and/or width that are generally applicable in the district, provided
that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area and/or width of
the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is
located. A variance from yard requirements may be obtained after public hearing
and approval by the Board of Appeals.
(Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)
1298.03   NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where, on the effective date of this Zoning Code, or any amendment thereto,
a lawful use of land exists which is not permissible under the provisions of
this Zoning Code as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long as
it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following regulations:
   (a)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the effective date of
this Zoning Code, or any amendment thereto.
   (b)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved, in whole or in part, to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use on the effective date
of this Zoning Code, or any amendments thereto.
   (c)   If such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period
of more than 12 consecutive months, any subsequent use of such land shall
conform to the regulations of this Zoning Code for the district in which such
land is located.
(Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)
1298.04   NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists on the effective date of this Zoning Code,
or any amendment thereto, which could not be built under the provisions of this
Zoning Code by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards or
other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following regulations:
   (a)   No structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its
nonconformity, i.e. existing residences on lots of a width less than that
required herein may add a rear porch, provided that other requirements relative
to yard space and land coverage are met.
   (b)   Should a structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than
50% of its reasonable market value, it shall not be reconstructed except in
conformity with the regulations of this Zoning Code.
   (c)   Should such structure be moved for any reason, it shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is
moved.
(Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)
1298.05   NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES AND LAND.
   If a lawful use of a structure or of structures and land in combination
exists on the effective date of this Zoning Code, or any amendment thereto,
which would not be allowed in the district under the regulations of this Zoning
Code, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following regulations:
   (a)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Zoning
Code in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
   (b)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use and which
existed on the effective date of this Zoning Code, or any amendment thereto,
but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
   (c)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure or structures and premises may be changed to another nonconforming
use, provided that the Board of Appeals, by making findings in the specific
case, shall find that the proposed use is equally compatible or more compatible
to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change,
the Board of Appeals may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in
accordance with the purpose and intent of this Zoning Code.
   (d)   Any structure or structure and land in combination in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the
nonconforming use may not be resumed.
   (e)   When a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and premises in
combination is discontinued or ceases to exist for six consecutive months, or
for eighteen months during any three-year period, the structure or structure
and premises in combination shall not thereafter be used except in conformance
with the regulations of the district in which it is located. Structures
occupied by successive seasonal uses shall be excepted from this regulation.
   (f)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
(Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)
1298.06   REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use,
work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs or
on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to
an extent not exceeding 25% of the market value on the date of repair, provided
that the cubic content of the building, as it existed on the effective date of
this Zoning Code, or any amendment thereto, shall not be increased.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening
or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
such official.
(Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)
1298.07   CHANGE OF TENANCY OR OWNERSHIP.
   There may be a change of tenancy, ownership or management of any existing
nonconforming uses of land, structures and premises, provided that there is no
change in the nature or character of such nonconforming uses.
(Ord. Passed 10-30-23.)

1469.06 TERM OF PERMIT AND RENEWAL OF PERMIT.
   (a)   The permit year shall begin on January I in each year and shall
terminate on December 31 of the same calendar year. An annual permit issued
between December 1 and December 31 of any year shall expire on December 31 of
the calendar year next following issuance thereof.
   (b)   A collection box permit shall be renewed annually. The application for
renewal must be filed not later than thirty (30) days before the permit
expires. The application for renewal shall be upon a form provided by the
Township.
   (c)   The Township shall either approve or deny the renewal of a permit
within ten (10) business days of receipt of the complete renewal application
and payment of the renewal fee. Failure of the Township to act before
expiration of the permit shall constitute approval of the renewal of the
permit.
   (d)   A permit fee set by resolution of the Board of Trustees shall be
submitted with the application for renewal.
   (e)   Prior to expiration of the permit, the permittee may voluntarily
cancel the permit by notifying the Township in writing of the intent to cancel
the permit. The permit shall become void upon the Township’s receipt of a
written notice to intent to cancel the permit. No refunds will be provided once
a permit has been issued.
   (f)   The Township shall approve the renewal of a permit if the Township
finds that no circumstances existed during the term of the permit which would
cause a violation to exist and that at the time of submission of the
application for renewal, or at any time during the renewal of the application
for renewal, there were not circumstances inconsistent with any finding
required for approval of a new permit. Any permittee whose permit has been
revoked shall be denied renewal of the permit for the subsequent calendar year.
   (g)   If the permit expires and is not renewed, the collection box(es) must
be removed from the real property within a maximum of ten (10) days after
expiration of the permit.

1469.07 REVOCATION OF PERMIT, REMOVAL OF COLLECTION BOXES AND LIABILITY.
   (a)   The Township shall have the right to revoke any permit issued
hereunder for a violation of this Chapter. Any of the grounds upon which the
Township may refuse to issue an initial permit shall also constitute grounds
for such revocation. In addition, the failure of the permittee to comply with
the provisions of this Chapter or other provisions of this code or other law
shall also constitute grounds for revocation of the permit. The Township shall
provide a written notification to the permittee and a property owner at the
address upon the application for each stating the specific grounds for a
revocation and a demand for correction and abatement. The notice shall allow a
maximum of ten (10) days from mailing of the notice to correct or abate the
violation. Upon failure to make the correction or abatement, the permit shall
be revoked by the Township and, thereafter, the permittee shall not be eligible
for a permit on the property for the subsequent calendar year.
   (b)   Upon revocation the collection box shall be removed from the real
property within ten (10) days and, if not so removed within the time period,
the Township may remove, store or dispose of the collection box at the expense
of the permittee and/or real property owner. All costs associated with the
removal of the collection box incurred by the Township, or the Township’s
contractor shall be the responsibility of the property owner. If such
obligation is not paid within thirty (30) days after mailing of a billing of
costs to the property owner, the Township, may place a lien upon such real
property enforceable as a tax lien in the manner prescribed by the general laws
of this state against the property and collected as in the case of general
property tax with the same penalties and interest. If the same is not paid
prior to the preparation of the next assessment roll of the Township, the
amount shall be assessed as a special tax against such premises on the next
assessment roll and collected there under. Unpermitted collection boxes may
also be removed in the same manner. Revoked and unpermitted collection boxes
may be disposed of by the Township thirty (30) days after appeal is completed,
or thirty (30) days after revocation in no appeal or improper appeal occurs.
Disposal after thirty (30) days may occur for unpermitted collection boxes.
   (c)   A permit for a collection box may be revoked if any governmental
authority or agency determines that the collection box has violated the
Michigan Consumer Protection Act and/or the Charitable Organizations and
Solicitations Act.
(Ord. 441. Passed 3-19-18.)
1469.08 APPEAL TO ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS.
   Any person aggrieved by the decision rendered by the Township in granting or
denying an application for a permit under this Chapter or in revoking a permit
issued under this Chapter may appeal the decision to the Zoning Board of
Appeals. The appeal shall be made by filing a written notice thereof with the
Planning Department setting forth the grounds for the appeal not later than ten
(10) days after mailing notice of the decision of the Township. The Zoning
Board of Appeals may grant relief if the applicant presents clear and
convincing evidence that there was an error in the decision of the Township.
(Ord. 441. Passed 3-19-18.)
1469.99 PENALTY AND REMEDIES.
   (a)   In addition to revocation of permit pursuant to Section
1469.07, any person violating the provisions of this Chapter is guilty of a
misdemeanor offense in accordance with Section
202.99 for general code penalty.
   (b)   In addition to the penalty provided in subsection (a) of this section,
any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of the provisions of
this Chapter, or any ordinance shall be deemed a new separate offense for each
day that such condition continues to exist.
   (c)   Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent the Township from pursuing any
other remedy provided by law in conjunction with or in lieu of prosecuting
persons under this section for violation of this Chapter.
   (d)   The real property owner and permittee shall be jointly and severally
liable for each violation and for payment of any fine and costs of abatement.
   (e)   No fines shall be imposed for a violation of this Chapter until ninety
(90) days after its effective date. All collection boxes existing at the

(Ord. 290. Passed 5-29-91.)
1470.05   SITE DRAINAGE PLANS.
   Prior to issuance of any building permit or the commencement of installation
of any building, structure or other improvement, a builder must submit plans
and otherwise demonstrate that site drainage complies with the provisions of
this chapter and other Township ordinances. The following procedures and
requirements apply:
   (a)   The applicant shall furnish the Engineering Department a scaled plan
of the proposed site, including structures with grades, dimensions, and
elevations shown, prepared under the seal of a registered engineer or
registered land surveyor. A review fee established by resolution of the
Township Board shall be paid to defer the cost of plan review. The review fee
shall be subject to waiver if the building grades and site drainage have been
previously reviewed and approved pursuant to the land development regulations
of the Township or any successor ordinance.
(Ord. 356. Passed 4-25-05.)
   (b)   The plan shall include outside grade elevations for any buildings or
structures proposed, site drainage slopes from the building, and dimensioned
drainage facilities necessary to drain the site. Utilities structures shall be
identified and located on plans.
   (c)   A fully executed easement upon a form furnished by the Township shall
be provided with a title commitment in an amount not less than one thousand
dollars ($1,000) demonstrating ownership of the property. The easement shall be
in favor of the Charter Township of Clinton permitting the installation of
drainage facilities and maintenance. As part of the easement document the
owner, successors and assigns shall indemnify fully the Township from any and
all liability for bodily injury or damage toproperty in connection with the
property within the easement area and drainage facilities.
(Ord. 290. Passed 5-29-91.)
   (d)   The Township Engineer shall review the plans. Approval must be granted
prior to the issuance of the building permit. The elevations, grades and slopes
indicated on the plan, upon approval, are established as the finished grades to
be constructed. Property owners shall be jointly and severally liable at all
times for providing that no utility structures be covered or made inaccessible,
or otherwise interfered with. All utility structures shall be staked and stakes
shall be maintained until issuance of a certificate of occupancy. The method
and manner of staking shall be periodically determined by the concurrence of
the heads of the Departments of Water and Sewers, Building, Public Works and
Engineering. When the building and site are ready for final inspections prior
to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy, the Township Engineer will
verify that the building and site were developed and constructed according to
the approved permitted plan with respect to elevations, grades, slopes and
structure location and notify the Department of Public Works of such request
prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy. The building and site
shall be verified by using documentation supplied by the Water and Sewer
Department, Department of Public Works and Building Department final
inspections and the final certificate of grade and location provided by a
licensed State of Michigan engineer or surveyor. If the constructed site is not
conforming to the previously established finished grades, elevations and
slopes, or if utility structures are covered or accessibility is interfered
with, no certificate of occupancy shall be issued until such time as compliance
has been achieved. A temporary occupancy permit may be issued prior to a
complete, final inspection, following receipt of a properly executed and
acceptable temporary letter of agreement by the Building Department, only where
an applicant has posted a bond with the Building Department in a minimum amount
of one thousand dollars ($1,000) cash, as approved by the Building Department
and, further, only in instances where weather interferes with completion of a
site inspection. No interest shall accrue upon funds deposited. However, upon
refund, if any, an administrative fee of ten percent of funds deposited shall
be retained. Cash deposits shall be subject to forfeiture following the final
inspection in the event utilities have been covered or damaged or grades have
not been properly established. Such forfeiture shall be cumulative to any other
penalties or remedies.
(Ord. 290-A. Passed 2-18-92; Ord. 367. Passed 11-27-06.)
   (e)   Where the structure or other improvement involves the installation of
an above-ground pool, garage, gazebo, deck or similar structure, which
structures are associated with a principal structure of a residential nature,
plans need not be submitted as otherwise required pursuant to this section
unless a change in grade shall occur. The applicant shall submit a statement
indicating that no change in grade is anticipated to occur. In the event of any
change in grade or resulting change in site drainage caused in whole or in part
as a result of the installation of structures and improvements, property owners
shall be required to undertake drainage improvements as directed by the
Department of Public Works upon recommendation from the Township Engineer.
Notice may be delivered of such proposed improvements by first class mail to
the last known owner of record pursuant to the Township Assessing Department's
records advising of required site drainage. If such notice is furnished and the
property owner fails to undertake such proposed improvements within thirty
days, the Township may undertake such improvements. The costs of such
maintenance, improvements or modification, including administration costs,
engineering costs and other professional fees, shall be established as a lien
again the property and collected in the same manner as ad valorem real property
taxes added as a separate item under the next real property tax statement.
(Ord. 290. Passed 5-29-91.)
1470.06   MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR DRAINAGE SLOPE AND GRADE.
   The sloping grade from any building shall cause the surface water run-off to
flow away from such building. The sloping grade shall have a fall of at least
six inches in the first ten feet to twenty-five feet from the building grade as
established and/or approved by the Township Engineer, thereafter there shall be
a sloping grade of at least one percent (i.e. a rate of one foot per 100 feet)
and no more than a seven percent slope. The foregoing minimum requirements
shall be subject to modification, and slope requirements otherwise shall be
determined by existing elevation at the sidelots, including, if necessary,
"stepping" the brick ledge of the proposed building to match existing side-lot
elevations. In all cases the ultimate determination of drainage, slope and
grade pursuant to the foregoing shall be established by the Township Engineer.
Unless otherwise established by the Township Engineer, the outside grade shall
be not less than twelve inches above the highest elevation of the public
sidewalk adjoining the site and not less than eighteen inches above the highest
elevation of the top of the curb for adjoining streets (or its center line if
no curb exists). Unless otherwise established by the Township Engineer, the
outside grade shall not be more than twenty-four inches above the highest
elevation of the public sidewalk adjoining the site and no more than six inches
above the outside grade for any existing principal structure on any adjoining
lots.
(Ord. 290-A-1. Passed 7-26-93; Ord. 319. Passed 12-22-97.)
1470.065   MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR DRAINAGE FACILITIES.
   For lots developed where an engineering, grading, and drainage plan has not
been prepared and approved pursuant to Title Six of Part Twelve of these
Codified Ordinances (the Land Development Regulations), the following minimum
requirements shall apply:
   (a)   An eight-inch enclosed drainage line of materials subject to approval
by the Township Engineer shall be constructed along the side and rear property
lines. A variance in the size and location of the eight-inch line shall be
subject to issuance by the Superintendent of the Department of Public Works
upon written application therefor.
   (b)   A two-foot catch basin or a special basin as approved by the
Superintendent of the Department of Public Works shall be placed in approved
locations at the intersections of the side and rear property lines.
   (c)   The drainage line shall be made available to adjacent property owners
through extension of the line to abutting property lines. An easement
permitting the receipt of drainage and the establishment of a connection shall
be provided.
   (d)   Lots shall be graded to allow water to flow freely to the catch basin.
   (e)   As determined by the Superintendent of the Department of Public Works,
a swale may be required along side lots.
   (f)   Sump pumps may not discharge to any road surface. Sump pumps may only
be directed to a storm sewer or a location in a ditch or swale as approved in
writing by the Superintendent of the Department of Public Works.
   (g)   In the event three or more contiguous lots are being developed, the
rear lot storm sewer line shall be constructed of materials as approved by the
Township.
   (h)   In the event a site drainage plan cannot meet the requirements of this
section and/or this Building and Housing Code, a variance may be sought in
writing from the Superintendent of Water and Sewers, the Superintendent of
Public Works, the Township Engineer or their designees. The standards for
issuance of a variance shall be the same standards as set forth under the Land
Development Regulations (Title Six of Part Twelve of these Codified Ordinances)
for the issuance of variances.
(Ord. 290-A-1. Passed 7-26-93; Ord. 319. Passed 12-22-97.)
1470.07   DRAINAGE SITE MAINTENANCE, IMPROVEMENT OR MODIFICATION.
   Each property owner shall be jointly and severally liable for the
maintenance of drainage facilities and the drainage easement areas. Notice may
be delivered by first class mail to the last known owner of record pursuant to
the Township Assessing Department's records advising of the need for any
maintenance, improvement or modification. If such notice is furnished and the
property owner fails to undertake such maintenance, improvement or modification
within thirty days, the Township may undertake such maintenance and repair.
Costs of such maintenance, improvement or modification, including
administration costs, engineering costs and other professional fees, shall be
established as a lien against the property and collected in the same manner as
ad valorem real property taxes added as a separate item under the next real
property tax statement. Notwithstanding the thirty-day notice requirement, in
the event of an emergency condition requiring immediate intervention in order
to eliminate a nuisance or avoid injury or damage to persons or property, the
Township may enter upon the property and complete maintenance and repair
without notice. A report will be furnished to property owners of record in such
instance. Property owners of record shall be jointly and severally liable for
all such costs and expenses incurred by the Township under such circumstances,
which shall be collected in the same manner as set forth hereinabove. No
structures, objects or plantings, other than grass or fences, shall be
permitted in the area of the drainage easement. The Township is authorized to
remove, at any time, any structures, fences, plantings or objects not permitted
in the area of the drainage easement. The cost of removal shall be billed to
the property owner and included upon the next tax bill for ad valorem real
property taxes. Structures, objects, plantings and fences removed may be
disposed of after three days. The Township shall not be liable for any damage
or injury to any items so removed.
(Ord. 290. Passed 5-29-91.)
1470.075   STORM DRAINAGE SEPARATION FROM SANITARY SEWERS; DISCHARGE FROM
EAVESTROUGHS, GUTTERS AND DOWNSPOUTS.
   (a)   Backfill and Grading. Basement excavations and/or excavations for
foundation walls for buildings and structures served by a public sewer shall be
backfilled immediately upon completion of construction of the basement wall or
other foundation wall. The earth surface surrounding such wall shall be graded
so as to direct the drainage water away from such wall to a point of disposal
at minimum in accordance with the provisions of Section
1470.06. During stages of construction of the building, temporary downspouts
and connections directing the storm water away from the building shall be
provided, and the owner and/or contractor or person in charge of the premises
shall be jointly and severally liable for maintaining such drainage during all
times the building is connected to a public sewer.
   (b)   Disallowed Connections to Sanitary Sewer. No person shall make or
allow connection of any roof downspouts, foundation or footing drains, areaway
drains, or other sources of surface runoff and/or groundwater to a building
sewer or building service sewer which is in turn connected directly or
indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. No person shall allow to be maintained
any connection of any roof downspout through any footing drain, areaway drain
or other source, which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public
sanitary sewer.
   (c)   Mandatory Discharge Point; Eavestrough, Gutter, Downspout Where
Footing Drain Connected to Sanitary Sewer. All buildings, existing and
proposed, shall be equipped with adequate eavestroughs, gutters and downspouts,
splashguards, and similar connections, extended so as to discharge storm water
through an impermeable structure or impermeable surface to a discharge point at
least five feet (1-52/100 (1.52) meters) perpendicularly away from all building
walls. The point of discharge to the grounds shall slope away from the building
so that surface water will be effectively disposed of away from the building.
Building service drains and other storm discharge facilities shall be designed,
installed and maintained to avoid discharge upon paved surfaces and public
rights of way designed for pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and the owner and/
or occupants or builders, jointly and severally, shall provide for an
appropriate design and/or maintenance to avoid hazards of freezing and thawing
on paved surfaces. The provisions of this section requiring discharge five feet
perpendicular shall not apply where footing drains are not directly or
indirectly connected to a public sanitary sewer.
   (d)   Notice to Correct; Enforcement by Township; Lien for Reimbursement of
Expenses Incurred by Township. The responsibility and cost for providing
changes to existing building drainage pursuant to this section is decreed to be
the joint and several responsibility of the owner/lessee and/or occupant, and
the continuation of drainage contrary to the provisions of this chapter is
decreed to be a public nuisance to be abated. Following notification in writing
by either the Superintendent of the Department of Public Works, the
Superintendent of the Department of Water and Sewers, or his or her designee,
the owner/lessee and/or occupant, jointly and severally, shall have sixty
calendar days to disconnect the areaway drains to a public sanitary sewer or to
install eaves, gutters, downspouts and gradiing so as to comply with the
provisions of this chapter. Thereafter, the Township may enter upon the
premises and perform necessary work, with such expenses to be imposed as a lien
upon the property, to be collected in the same manner as prescribed by the
general laws of the State relative to ad valorem real property taxes, including
an additional administration fee of ten percent of the actual costs incurred.

(Ord. 290. Passed 5-29-91.)
1470.10   FEES IMPOSED.
   In order to provide assistance in the eventual development, maintenance,
repair and replacement of major drains throughout the Township (including
County drains), a drainage system development fee shall be collected from every
applicant for a building permit for new residential construction, except for
building permits associated with items pursuant to Section
1470.05(e), unless grade changes are anticipated to occur. Fees shall also be
collected from every applicant for a building permit for construction of a new
building or a parking lot. Where a site has already been developed and has been
previously received site plan approval, a fee shall be collected from every
applicant for a site plan associated with any improvements upon the subject
site.
   Adequate site drainage, otherwise required pursuant to the Subdivision and
Land Development Regulations, is required for all parcels within the Township.
The development of adequate site drainage may require one or more of the
following as determined by the Township:
   (a)   The installation of trunk and lateral drains, including acquisition of
easement rights adequate to provide for off-site drainage in compliance with
other Township ordinances, including the Land Development Regulations of the
Township or any successor ordinances.
   (b)   The installation of trunk and/or lateral drains under special
assessment district (SAD) proceedings (i.e. Act 188 of the Public Acts of 1954,
as amended) to provide adequate off-site drainage as required pursuant to
Township ordinances, including Land Development Regulations of the Township or
any successor ordinances.
   (c)   The installation of trunk and lateral drains by the Township under the
provisions of this chapter.
   In order to assist in alleviating serious drainage problems, the Township
may cause the installation of drains other than major drains. When the Township
has caused the installation of such drains intended to furnish drainage for a
parcel along or adjacent to the front, side or rear property lines, a lateral
drain benefit fee obligation shall be imposed. The fee shall be imposed upon
and payable jointly and severally by the owner or owners of the property and
such fee shall be payable upon connection to the drain. The lateral drain
benefit fee shall be a lien upon the property. In the event the lateral drain
benefit fee is not paid within thirty days of connection or otherwise pursuant
to the provisions of this chapter in a timely manner, the Township shall
collect the fee in the same manner and procedures as the collection of ad
valorem real property taxes.
   A special lateral drain benefit fee shall be imposed where the Township has
caused the installation of a drain through a parcel.
   A front yard lateral benefit fee shall be imposed where the Township has
caused the installation of a drain along the public road frontage of a parcel.
   A rear yard lateral drain benefit fee shall be imposed where the Township
has caused the installation of a drain along the side or rear property line of
a parcel.
   Drainage fees shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of a building
permit where drains are installed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 290. Passed 5-29-91; Ord. 379. Passed 4-1-08.)

be inspected prior to connection. Inspection requests shall be made through the
Department of Public Works upon a prescribed form.
(Ord. 290. Passed 5-29-91.)
1470.13   AMOUNT OF DRAINAGE FEES.

the development, i.e., single-family, residential family, residential
condominium, residential multiple, or other development, unless the site plan
provides for an expansion of parking lot and/or building envelope of over fifty
percent of the entire site. If such expansion is proposed, the fees shall be

height will not endanger the public health, safety or welfare of the Township
of Clinton and its inhabitants.
      (2)   A fence located in an industrial or commercial zoned district may
exceed four and one-half feet in height when necessary for the purpose for
which the fence is erected upon a determination by the Building Department that
such additional height will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or
welfare of the Township of Clinton and its inhabitants.
      (3)   Fences surrounding private swimming pools in Residential Districts
must comply with swimming pool enclosure requirements of the current state
building code.
   (g)   Privacy Screens. These types of structures which are erected for other
than swimming pool areas and not upon property lines for enclosure of the land
may be erected without a permit under this chapter, provided however, that this
type of structure shall be subject to other requirements of this chapter.
   (h)   Maintenance of Fences. All fences shall be maintained in a manner to
prevent rust, corrosion and deterioration and otherwise so as not to become a
public or private nuisance, dilapidated or a danger to adjoining property

1472.04   OBSCURING MATERIALS.
   After the effective date of this section, it shall be unlawful for any
person to plant, maintain or allow any hedge, foliage privacy screen or other
substance or material which, in the discretion of the Building Department
Superintendent or his or her agent, is opaque to the extent that visibility is
obscured on any lot or residential premises in a Residential District in
Clinton Township. The restriction listed in this section applies from the front
lot line a distance of eighteen feet or to the building setback line if that

such grades to the Building Department for inclusion as part of the permit.
   (b)   Corner Lots. No obscuring fence shall be located nearer than ten feet
to the right-of-way line of a side street. The Building Superintendent may
permit the angling of obscuring fences provided sufficient sight lines are
provided for public safety. A chain-link or other unobscuring fence may be
permitted along the exterior side lot line provided said fence is unobscured
within a triangular area formed at the point of intersection of the side and
rear lot lines. Such triangular areas shall be formed by a straight line drawn
between said lot lines at a distance along the rear lot line of ten feet and
along the exterior side lot line of twenty-five feet from their point of
intersection. Such triangular areas shall not contain obscuring hedges, shrubs,
trees or other plantings which exceed a height of 18 inches.
(Ord. 261-A-1. Passed 2-11-80; Ord. 394. Passed 7-25-11.)
1472.06   HARDSHIP CASES AND APPEALS.
   Where strict compliance with the requirements of this chapter would be an
undue hardship on the property owner, as a result of the circumstances and
conditions of the property involved and its relationship to surrounding
properties, or the type of fence contemplated, pursuant to this chapter, would
not adequately and reasonably fulfill any reasonable purpose intended by a
fence as contemplated, the Building Department may issue a special permit
designed to accommodate such circumstances with reasonable conditions. No
permit varying the terms of this chapter shall issue where the fence would
create a hazard and/or unreasonably increase the risk of injury to persons or
property or would result in a substantial lack of harmony with surrounding
properties. The Building Department may refer the matter to the Charter
Township of Clinton Zoning Board of Appeals for determination. If the property
owner is aggrieved by a decision of the Building Department, the owner may
appeal to the Charter Township of Clinton Zoning Board of Appeals for a waiver
or variance of requirements. The Zoning Board of Appeals may consider a request
for a variance or waiver in light of the requirements of this chapter. A fee
shall be paid in the same amount as for a variance by either a residential or
nonresidential applicant as set in the Fee Schedule Ordinance,
Chapter 209 of this code. The reasons for the variance shall be set forth, in
writing, upon an application form approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals. The
Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider and issue a decision within forty-five
days provided all information necessary for a decision has been timely
submitted by the applicant.

all signs and outdoor display structures in all zoning districts, as
established in Part Twelve - the Land, Development and Zoning Code, for the
purposes of reducing sign or advertising distractions and thereby reducing
traffic hazards and accidents; reducing hazards which could be caused if signs
were to be located in, project into or overhang any public right of way or be
attached to utility poles; diminishing visual pollution caused by the unlimited
number, type and size of signs and thereby increasing the effectiveness of
signs; and so protecting the health, safety and welfare of the public.
