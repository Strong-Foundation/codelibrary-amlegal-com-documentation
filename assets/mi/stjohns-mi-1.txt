notice required to be sent under the provisions of the City Charter and this
chapter shall not invalidate any special assessment or special assessment roll.

law for the collection of personal property taxes.

special assessment, or the initial installment of such assessment when
installment payments are provided for, shall be collected by the Treasurer and
collection fees shall be charged as prescribed in the Charter.
(1990 Code, § 1.192)
§ 34.15 CONTESTED ASSESSMENTS.
   No owner of real property located in the special assessment district shall

he is assessed.
(1990 Code, § 1.193)
§ 34.16 ILLEGAL OR INVALID ASSESSMENTS.
   Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of the Commission, be

court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge such assessment to be illegal,
the Commission shall, whether the improvement has been made or not, or whether
any part of the assessments have been paid or not, subject to the decision of
the court, have power to cause a new assessment to be made for the same purpose
for which the former assessment was made. All proceedings on such reassessment
and for the collection thereof shall be conducted in the same manner as
prescribed for the original assessment, and whenever any sum or part thereof
levied upon any property in the assessment so set aside has been paid and not
refunded, the payment so made shall be applied upon the reassessment or if the
payments exceed the amount of the reassessment refunds shall be made.
(1990 Code, § 1.194)
§ 34.17 SINGLE LOT ASSESSMENTS.
   When any expense shall have been incurred by the city upon or in respect to
any single premises, which expense is chargeable against said premises and the
owner thereof under the provisions of this code and City Charter and is not of
that class required to be pro-rated among the several lots and parcels of land
in a special assessment district, an account of the labor, material and service
for which such expense was incurred, with a description of the premises upon or
in respect to which the expense was incurred, and the name of the owner, if
known, shall be reported to the Treasurer, who shall immediately charge and
bill the owner, if known. The Treasurer at the end of each quarter shall report
to the City Commission all sums so owing to the city and which have not been
paid within 30 days after the mailing of the bill therefor. The Commission
shall, at such times as it may deem advisable, direct the Assessor to prepare a
special assessment roll covering all such charges reported to it, together with
a penalty of 10%. Such roll shall be filed with the Clerk who shall advise the
Commission of the filing of the same, and the Commission shall thereupon set a
date for the hearing of objections to such assessment roll. The assessment roll
shall be open to public inspection for a period of seven days before the
Commission shall meet to review the roll and hear complaints. The City Clerk
shall give notice in advance by publication of the opening of the roll to
public inspection and of the meeting of the Commission to hear complaints and
shall also give like notice to the owners of and persons having an interest in
property affected by first class mail at their addresses as shown on the last
general assessment roll of the city, at least ten full days prior to the date
of such hearing. Such special assessments and all interest and charges thereon
shall, from the date of confirmation of the roll, be and remain a lien upon the
property assessed, of the same character and effect as a lien created by
general law for state and county taxes, until paid. The same penalty and
interest shall be paid on such assessments, when delinquent from such date
after confirmation as shall be fixed by the City Commission, as are provided by
the City Charter to be paid on delinquent general city taxes and such
assessments, with penalties and interest, shall be added by the Treasurer to
the next general city tax roll or general county and school tax roll, as shall
be convenient, and shall thereafter be collected and returned in the same
manner as general city taxes.

§ 35.02 PREAMBLE.
   It is acknowledged that it is a proper public purpose of the State of
Michigan and its political subdivisions to provide housing for its citizens of
low income and to encourage the development of such housing by providing for a
service charge in lieu of property taxes in accordance with the State Housing
Development Authority Act of 1966. The city is authorized by said Act to
establish or change the service charge to be paid in lieu of taxes by any or
all classes of housing exempt from taxation under the Act at any amount not
exceeding the taxes that would be paid but for the Act. It is further
acknowledged that Suntree - Oxford Associates, Limited Dividend Housing
Association for persons of low income is a public necessity, and as the city
will be benefitted and improved by such housing, the encouragement of the same
by providing certain real estate tax exemption therefor is a valid public
purpose. It is further acknowledged that the continuance of the provisions of
this subchapter for tax exemption and the service charge in lieu of taxes
during the period hereinafter contemplated are essential to the determination
of economic feasibility of the Housing Development herein referenced which is
constructed and financed in reliance thereon. It is further acknowledged that
Suntree Oxford Associates, Limited Dividend Housing Association, has offered to
pay the city on account of the elderly portion of the housing development an
annual service charge for public services in lieu of all taxes on that portion.
The city reserves the right to establish an annual service charge for public
services in lieu of all taxes for the family portion of the housing
development.
(1990 Code, § 1.232)
§ 35.03 CLASS OF HOUSING PROJECT.
   It is determined by the city that the class of housing project to which the
tax exemption recognized herein shall apply and for which a service fee shall
be paid in lieu of taxes is a housing project for elderly persons of low
income, which project is financed with a MSHDA mortgage and which is subject to
MSHDA enforced regulatory agreement. It is further determined that the elderly
portion of the housing development is of that class.
(1990 Code, § 1.233)
§ 35.04 EXEMPTION.
   The elderly portion of the housing development identified as Suntree and the
property on which it shall be constructed is determined to be exempt from all
real and personal property taxes, pursuant to Public Act 346 of 1966, as
amended. The city acknowledges that the sponsor and MSHDA have established the
economic feasibility of the housing development in reliance upon the enactment
and continuing effect of this subchapter and the qualifications of the elderly
portion of the housing development for exemption from all property taxes and a
payment of the service charge in lieu thereof.
(1990 Code, § 1.234)
§ 35.05 ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVICE CHARGE.
   (A)   In consideration of the sponsor’s offer, which is subject to the
receipt of a commitment for a mortgage loan from MSHDA, for construction and
permanent financing of the housing development, the city agrees to accept
payment of an annual service fee for public services in lieu of all property
taxes on the elderly portion of the housing development. The sponsor agrees to
pay the service fee as provided in this subchapter and under the Act. The
annual service charge for the elderly portion of the housing development, and
the property on which it is located, shall be 4% of the difference between
contract rents actually collected and the utility costs paid by that portion of
the housing development.
   (B)   The annual service charge shall be payable in the same manner as
general property taxes are payable to the city, except that the annual payment
shall be paid on or before July 1 of each year.
(1990 Code, § 1.235)
§ 35.06 DURATION.
   The tax exemption recognized herein shall not be withdrawn and the service
charge established herein shall not be changed by the city so long as the
mortgage loans remain outstanding and unpaid or MSHDA has any interest in the
property; provided further, however, in no case shall the duration exceed 30
years from the date of issuance of an occupancy permit, and provided further
that:
   (A)   The sponsor annually files with the City Assessor a certified
notification of exemption as required by Section 15a(1) of the Act, as amended,
being M.C.L.A. § 125.1415a(1); and
   (B)   Pursuant to Section 15a(6) of the Act, as amended, being M.C.L.A. §
125.1415a(6), the annual service charge to be paid in lieu of taxes for that
part of the housing development which is occupied by other than persons or
families of low income shall be equal to the full amount of taxes that would be
paid on that portion of the housing development if the housing development were
not exempt; and
   (C)   Construction of the housing development commences within one year of
the effective date of this subchapter.
(1990 Code, § 1.236)
§ 35.07 NONASSIGNABILITY.
   The tax exemption established by this subchapter only pertains to Suntree -
Oxford Associates, Limited Dividend Housing Association, and may not be
assigned to any other person, partnership or corporation. The tax exemption
established by this subchapter provides an exemption only for the property
described in Exhibit “A” attached to Ordinance 323 and does not apply to any
other real or personal property located in the city.
(1990 Code, § 1.237)
§ 35.08 CONTRACTUAL EFFECT.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 15a(5) of the Act, as amended,
being M.C.L.A. § 1415a(5), to the contrary, a contract between the city and
sponsor with the authority as a third party beneficiary thereunder to provide
tax exemption and accept payments in lieu thereof as previously described is
effected by enactment of Ordinance 327.
(1990 Code, § 1.238)
§ 35.09 TAX ABATEMENT.
   The city shall not grant any municipal tax abatement to any class of housing
projects within its boundaries to which Public Act 346 of 1966, § 15a, as
amended, being M.C.L.A. § 1415a, shall apply except as set forth in this

   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ASSESSABLE COSTS.  Those costs for services incurred by the city in
connection to a response by the Public Safety Department to a purported
emergency incident or other covered event. The costs will be determined using
actual costs as measurement. Based on an evaluation of actual costs, a flat fee

civil defense services, to include responses to events involving motor
vehicles.

   FALSE ALARM. Any automated or manual device designated to request or summon
emergency assistance whether such device is activated intentionally or
otherwise, in the absence of an actual need for emergency assistance. What
constitutes a FALSE ALARM as opposed to an actual emergency shall be determined
by the on-scene commander or supervisor of the event or incident which caused
the response. A FALSE ALARM will not be considered as an assessable cost under
this subchapter until a second such occurrence has issued from the same
premises, business or location during the preceding 6-month period.
   FIRE RUN. Any response by the City Fire Department to a dispatched request
for service as relates to a structure, premises or motor vehicle, to include
trailers or appurtenances attached to a motor vehicle.
   MUTUAL AID AGREEMENT EVENT. Assistance provided by the City Fire Department
to a requesting governmental entity outside of the physical boundaries of the
City of St. Johns. A mutual aid event under this subchapter is limited to

Mutual Aid Agreement of which the City of St. Johns is a signatory. See §
35.22.
   RESPONSIBLE PARTY. Any individual, business, firm, corporation, association,

there is a  Public Safety or Fire incident or event. Furthermore, RESPONSIBLE
PARTY includes heirs, estates, successors in interest and assigns of the
entities above-described.
(Ord. 521, passed 4-28-2003; Am. Ord. 529, passed 5-24-2004)
§ 35.21 COST RECOVERY PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The Public Safety Director, or his or her designee, shall determine
when a Public Safety incident, Fire or other incident/event as described in §
35.20 has occurred, giving rise to potential assessable costs to a responsible
party. In making such a determination, the Public Safety Director shall consult
with other city personnel involved and the City Manager.
   (B)   If it is determined that a Public Safety incident, Fire or other
incident/event per this subchapter has occurred, and costs can properly be
assessed, the city shall initiate the procedure to bill the costs to all
responsible parties. If more than 1 responsible party is identified, such costs
are to be considered the joint and several responsibility of the identified
parties.
   (C)   The assessed cost will be that cost provided for by the City Fee and
Rate schedule.
(Ord. 521, passed 4-28-2003)
§ 35.22 COST RECOVERY UNDER MUTUAL AID AGREEMENT EVENT.
   (A)   If the City Fire Department responds to a mutual aid event as a
"responding governmental entity" per the extant Mutual Aid Agreement, the
Public Safety Director shall keep records of all costs incurred by the Fire
Department associated with the response.
   (B)   If it is determined that the city responded to a Mutual Aid event
pursuant to the Mutual Aid Agreement of which the Requesting Governmental
Entity seeks reimbursement, the city shall provide the Requesting Governmental
Entity an itemization of the city's associated costs for that event.
Reimbursement for costs incurred will be determined by the Requesting
Governmental Entity, based on actual reimbursement and the city's pro rata
share of same.
(Ord. 521, passed 4-28-2003)
§ 35.23 BILLING AND COLLECTION OF ASSESSABLE COSTS.
   (A)   After determining the assessable cost(s) against the responsible party
or parties pursuant to §
35.21, supra., the City Treasurer shall mail an itemized invoice to the
responsible party(s) at the last known address. Such invoice will be due and
payable within 60 days of the date of mailing. An appeal of the assessable
costs taken by a responsible party shall toll the time for payment until such
time as the appeal is heard and decided.
(Ord. 521, passed 4-28-2003)
§ 35.24 PROCEDURE FOR APPEALING ASSESSABLE COSTS.
   (A)   Introduction. A responsible party who receives an invoice for

the City Manager or his other designee to request vacation or modification of
the costs.
   (B)   Procedure for appeals. The person or entity appealing the assessed
costs shall make such a request, in writing, directed to the City Manager. This
request must be received by the City Manager, at the City Offices, within 14
days of the date of the costs invoice. The City Manager shall schedule a
meeting with the appellant within 7 days of receipt of the written request to
appeal. The City Manager has the inherent authority to vacate or modify the
assessed cost, if good cause is shown by appellant.
   (C)   Appeal to City Commission. If the responsible party is not satisfied
with the decision of the City Manager as relates to the procedure described in
division (B), above, the responsible party can request review by the City
Commission. Request for this review must be made in writing no later than 7
days after meeting with the City Manager. The reasons for requesting review
must be contained therein.
   (D)   The City Commission will address a written review request as an agenda
item at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The City Commission will give the
responsible party a reasonable opportunity to indicate its reasons for
objection to the assessed costs. The City Manager will be given the opportunity
to respond to the responsible party's argument. The City Commission will then
render a final decision on the matter.
(Ord. 521, passed 4-28-2003)
§ 35.25 REMEDIES.
   Under appropriate circumstances, unpaid assessable costs shall constitute a
lien upon the real property of the responsible party to which the Public Safety
incident, Fire or other covered incident/event relates. Such lien shall accrue
interest and penalties in the same manner as liens for unpaid property taxes.
The City Treasurer shall report and certify to the City Assessor any delinquent
and unpaid assessable costs under this subchapter. The City Assessor shall then
enter the delinquent amount on the next general ad valorem tax roll as a charge
against the affected property. Enforcement of the lien shall be the same as for
unpaid property taxes.
(Ord. 521, passed 4-28-2003)
§ 35.26 NO LIMITATION ON RESPONSIBLE PARTY LIABILITY.
   The billing and recovery of assessable costs against a responsible party
does not limit the liability of the party under other applicable theories of
recovery as implicated by local, state or federal law.

shall indicate the time by which the alleged violator must appear at the
Bureau, the methods by which an appearance may be made, the address and

amount of the fine scheduled for the alleged violation, and the consequences
for failure to appear and pay the required fine within the required time.

violation are not paid at the Bureau, a municipal civil infraction citation may
be served by first-class mail upon the alleged violator at the alleged
violator’s last known address. The citation filed with the court does not need
to comply in all particulars with the requirements for citations as provided by

the allegations stated in the municipal ordinance violation notice and shall
fairly inform the alleged violator how to respond to the citation.

§ 37.01 TITLE AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   Title. The title of this chapter shall be “Ethical Standards of
Conduct for Elected Officials, Appointees, and City Employees.”
   (B)   Purpose and intent. Elected officials, appointees, and city employees,
by virtue of their positions, are trustees of the public, chargeable with
honesty, integrity, and openness in their handling of public affairs. When
conduct inconsistent with this expectation occurs, public suspicion is
heightened and public confidence is compromised. Where government is founded
upon the consent of the governed, it is critical that each citizen have
complete confidence in the integrity of the government. Each public official,
appointee, and/or employee must endeavor to earn and honor the public trust in
the conduct of all official duties and actions. The purpose of this chapter is
to define standards of ethical conduct that are clearly established and
uniformly applied and for enforcement of same.
(Ord. 631, passed 9-25-2017)
§ 37.02 APPLICATION.
   (A)   Application to elected officials. The ethical standards enunciated in
this chapter are aspirational as they apply to City of St. Johns Commissioners,
who are elected by the people. Any discipline or sanction of a city elected
official is limited by the provisions of the St. Johns City Charter and the
applicable laws of the State of Michigan.
   (B)   Application to non-elected officials. The ethical standards enunciated
in this chapter are based on an accountability model as they apply to non-
elected officials, which category includes appointees to various volunteer
positions and committees. Failure by a non-elected official to abide by the
ethical standards enumerated herein can result in loss of the city position,
appointment, or committee membership as determined by the St. Johns City
Commission.
   (C)   Application to City of St. Johns employees. City employees are charged
with the responsibility of conforming their conduct to the ethical standards
enunciated in this chapter. City employees who are found to be in violation of
such standards will be subject to discipline commensurate with the gravity of
the established ethical violation.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 52.01 ADMINISTRATION.
   The Supervisor of the Water Department, hereinafter called the Supervisor,
shall have charge of the maintenance and operation of the water supply,
treatment plant, pumping equipment and meters. The City Treasurer shall be
responsible for the accounting and billing of water bills. The amount of
revenue shall be accounted for in a manner satisfactory to the Commission and
shall be collected by the City Treasurer. The Treasurer shall prepare and
present a monthly financial statement of the receipt and expenditures of the
Water Department to the City Commission. The City Treasurer shall deposit water
revenues in the manner approved for other city deposits but shall keep water
revenues in a separate and distinct account.
(1990 Code, § 2.31)
§ 52.02 ACCESS OF SUPERVISOR.
   The Water Supervisor, or any of his authorized agents, shall have free
access at all reasonable hours to inspect any premises supplied with water. No
person shall refuse to admit authorized agents of the Water Department to any
premises for such purpose. In case any authorized employee be refused
admittance, or is in any way hindered in making the necessary inspection or
examination, the water may be turned off from such premises after giving 24
hours notice to the owner or occupant thereof.
(1990 Code, § 2.42)
WATER MAINS
§ 52.20 UNDER CONTROL OF COMMISSION.
   The water mains of the city shall be under the exclusive control of the City
Commission, and no person or persons other than agents or employees of the
Water Department shall tap, change, obstruct, interfere, or in any way disturb
the system of water mains.
(1990 Code, § 2.32)
§ 52.21 MAIN EXTENSIONS.
   Water main extensions shall be made in accordance with one of the following
plans.
   (A)   Payment of entire cost in advance. Any one or more property owners may
request the City Commission to determine the feasibility and the estimated cost
of the construction of a proposed water main extension to serve their premises.
If the City Commission shall approve the proposed extension and determine the
estimated construction coats, such property owners may deposit with the Water
Department a sum equal to such estimated cost and the City Commission shall
thereupon proceed with the construction. Any surplus in the deposit amount over
and above the construction costs shall be refunded to the owner or owners or
their agent. Should the construction cost exceed the deposit amount, the owner
or owners shall pay the excess amount and no water taps shall be installed or
water service rendered from the extension until the cost is paid in full.
   (B)   Construction by owner. In undedicated streets and in new subdivisions,
the City Commission may permit the owner or owners to arrange for the laying of
water main extensions by private contract, the work to be under the supervision
of the Supervisor, however. In any such case, the City Commission shall require
a deposit in a sum deemed adequate by the City Commission as a guarantee
against defective workmanship or materials. Each deposit, less any sums
expended by the Department for repair or replacement of defective work or
materials, shall be refunded one year after the water main extension has been
placed in service. No other refund of payment shall be made. In the
construction of any such extension, the contractor shall use only duly
inspected pipes, specials, valves and the like obtained from the Water
Department upon payment of the cost thereof.
   (C)   Fifty percent petition. In the case of existing dedicated streets, the
City Commission shall be authorized to construct water main extensions where
practicable, upon application of the owners of 50% of the abutting foot
frontage to be served by the proposed extension, accompanied by the payment of
a charge per lineal abutting front foot of the property owned by the
petitioner. When a water main extension has been constructed in accordance with
this plan, which shall be known as Plan 3, water tap connections to such
extension shall be permitted only to serve premises for which the front foot
charge was collected at the time of filing the petition, provided that the
owners of other property may be permitted to make connections upon payment of
sums per front foot of the abutting premises owned by them. No part of the
payment made in accordance with Plan 3 shall be refunded in any case.
   (D)   Construction without petition. Whenever the City Commission shall
determine that it would be to the best interests of the water distribution
system to construct a water main extension connecting two or more existing
water mains, it shall construct such extension without the filing of any
petition therefor or the making of any advance payment or deposit. After the
completion of any such connecting water main extension, the City Commission
shall cause all premises abutting the street or way in which such connecting
extension is laid to be billed at a rate per front foot of their abutting
property. No connecting tap shall be permitted to be made in any such extension
until and unless the abutting front foot charge herein provided for shall have
been paid in full.
   (E)   Construction outside the city. The entire cost of all mains
constructed outside the city limits shall be defrayed by the property owners.
The size, location and methods of construction shall be determined by the
Department. If constructed by the Water Department, advance payment must be
made before the work will be started. If the construction is done by the owners
or their agents, plans and specifications will be furnished by the Department.
All construction not performed by the city shall be under the city’s
supervision and inspection and the cost of supervision and inspection defrayed
by the property owners.
(1990 Code, § 2.33)
§ 52.22 PROPERTY OWNERS NOT TO BE RELIEVED FROM PAYMENT.
   No construction of water main extension shall be proceeded with by the
Supervisor under Plan 3 until the advance payments or deposits required by such
section shall have been paid in full to the Water Department. If in any case,
by reason of inadvertence or oversight, construction shall have been made
without compliance with advance payment requirements, such inadvertence or
oversight shall not relieve the benefitted property owner from the obligation
to pay the amount due. In such cases, no water tap connection shall be made or
water service rendered, unless and until the required payment or deposits are
made in full.
(1990 Code, § 2.34)
§ 52.23 SIZE OF MAIN.
   The City Engineer shall determine the size and location of any proposed
water main, which size shall not be less than six inches, and shall bear all
costs exceeding the front foot charge made against the abutting property
benefitted by this construction.

§ 52.24 SPECIFICATIONS.
   The City Engineer shall establish detailed specifications for the
installation of service pipes on either public or private property, service

permit must be made in writing by the owner of the premises to be served, or by
his authorized representative, at the office of the City Clerk. The application
shall be made on forms provided by the Water Department, which shall contain
such information as the City Commission may require.
(1990 Code, § 2.37)

installation. The amount of such fees shall continue as in force on the
effective date of this code and may thereafter be changed by resolution of the
City Commission.
(1990 Code, § 2.38)
§ 52.27 PERMIT REVOCATION.

holding a permit issued under the terms of this chapter for failing to comply
with this chapter or the rules, regulations, plans or specifications
established for the construction, rebuilding, or repair of any water utility
service, and the issuance of such stop order shall be effective until the next
regular meeting of the City Commission. If confirmed by the City Commission at

Water Act of 1977, 33 USC 1251 et seq.; the General Pretreatment Regulations
(40 C.F.R. Part 403); Part 31 of Act 451 of Public Acts of Michigan of 1994,
M.C.L.A. §§ 324.3101 et seq., as amended (“Water Resources Protection”); and
the rules, Michigan Administrative Code, R 323.2301 et seq., as amended,
promulgated pursuant to §§ 3103, 3106 and 3109 of Part 31 of Act 451 of the
Public Acts of Michigan of 1994, as amended.
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the city wastewater
system which will interfere with the normal operation of the system, cause pass
through, or contaminate the resulting municipal sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the city wastewater
system which do not receive adequate treatment in the POTW and which will pass
through the system into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be
incompatible with the system; and
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the system.
   (C)   This chapter provides for the regulation of contributors to the city
wastewater system through the issuance of permits to certain nondomestic users
and through enforcement of general requirements for the other users, authorizes
monitoring and enforcement activities, requires user reporting, assumes that
existing customers’ capacity will not be preempted, and provides for the
setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the
program established herein.
   (D)   This chapter shall apply to the city and to persons outside the city
who are, by contract or agreement with the city, users of the city POTW. This
chapter is a supplement to
Chapters 51 and

product of the POTW such as residues, sludges, or scums to be unsuitable for
reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case
shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance
with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under
§ 405 of the Act, any criteria, guidelines, or regulations affecting sludge use
or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air
Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or state criteria applicable to the
sludge management method being used.
      (7)   Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral
oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through.
      (8)   Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or
fumes within the POTW in quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety
problems.
      (9)   Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated
by the Supervisor.
      (10)   Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES and/
or state permit or the receiving water quality standards.
      (11)   Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the
treatment process, such as but not limited to dye wastes and vegetable tanning
solutions.
      (12)   Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological
activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case
wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the POTW which exceeds
40°C (104°F).
      (13)   Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD and the
like), released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which a user
knows or has reason to know will cause interference to the POTW. In no case
shall a slug load have a flow rate or contain a concentration of quantities of
pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than 15 minutes more than
five times the average 24-hour concentration, quantities, or flow during normal
operation. In no case shall a flow be released which restricts the hydraulic
capacity of sewer structures.
      (14)   Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of
such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the
Supervisor in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.
      (15)   Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a
public nuisance.
   (B)   When the Supervisor determines that a user is contributing to the POTW
any of the above enumerated substances in such amounts as to interfere with the
operation of the POTW or cause pass through, the Supervisor shall:
      (1)   Advise the user of the impact of the contribution on the POTW; and
      (2)   Develop effluent limitations for such user to correct the
interference with the POTW and/or pass through.

§ 54.36 NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   Deadline for compliance with categorical standards by existing sources
with categorical pretreatment standards shall be within three years of the date
the standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the
appropriate subpart of 40 C.F.R. Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471. Direct
dischargers with NPDES permits modified or reissued to provide a variance
pursuant to § 301(i)(2) of the Act, being 33 U.S.C. § 1311, shall be required
to meet compliance dates set in any applicable categorical pretreatment
standard. Existing sources which become industrial users subsequent to
promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall be
considered existing industrial users except where such sources meet the
definition of a new source as defined in 40 C.F.R. § 403.3(k). New sources
shall install and have in operating condition and shall “start-up” all
pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards
before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed
90 days), new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards.
   (B)   Upon the promulgation of the national categorical pretreatment
standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the national standard, if
more stringent than limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in the
subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this
chapter. The Supervisor shall notify all affected users of the applicable
pretreatment standards.
   (C)   When wastewater subject to a national categorical pretreatment
standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the
Supervisor shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream
formula in 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e).

§ 54.37 MODIFICATION OF NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   The city may apply to the approval authority for modification of specific
limits in the national pretreatment standards, as set forth in § 403.7 of 40
C.F.R. Part 403 “General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources
of Pollution” promulgated pursuant to the Act. The city may then modify
pollutant discharge limits in the national pretreatment standards if the
requirements contained in 40 C.F.R. § 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval
from the approval authority is obtained.
(Ord. 677, passed 8-28-2023)
§ 54.38 SPECIFIC POLLUTANT LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   Limitations for selected materials. Users who fall into categories for
which national categorical pretreatment standards have been established shall
comply with these standards. More stringent standards may be applied by the
city where necessary to achieve the goals of the city’s pretreatment program.
   (B)   Concentration and mass limits.
      (1)   Pollutant discharge limits in categorical pretreatment standards
will be expressed either as concentration or mass limits. Wherever possible,
where concentration limits are specified in standards, equivalent mass limits
will be provided so that local, state, or national authorities responsible for
enforcement may use either concentration or mass limits. Limits in categorical
pretreatment standards shall apply to the effluent of the process regulated by
the standard or as otherwise specified by the standard.
      (2)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the
control authority may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed
either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for
purpose of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial
users.
      (3)   The control authority calculating equivalent mass-per-day
limitations under division (B)(2) of this section shall calculate such
limitations by multiplying the limits in the standard by the industrial user’s
average rate of production. This average rate of production shall be based not
upon the designed production capacity but rather upon a reasonable measure of
the industrial users actual long-term daily production, such as the average
daily production during a representative year. For new sources, actual
production shall be estimated using projected production.
      (4)   The control authority calculating equivalent concentration
limitations under division (B)(2) of this section shall calculate such
limitations by dividing the mass limitations derived under divisioin (B)(3) of
this section by the average daily flow rate of the industrial user’s regulated
process wastewater. This average daily flow rate shall be based upon a
reasonable measure of the industrial user’s actual long-term average flow rate,
such as the average daily flow rate during the representative year.
      (5)   Equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with this section
shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of § 307(d) of the Act
and this subchapter. Industrial users will be required to comply with the
equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from
which the equivalent limitations were derived. The control authority must
document how the equivalent limits were derived and make this information
publicly available.
      (6)   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average or four day average limitations. Where such
standards are being applied, the same production of flow figure shall be used
in calculating both types of equivalent limitations.
      (7)   Any industrial user operating under a control mechanism
incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a
production based standard shall notify the control authority within two
business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production
level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not
notifying the control authority of such anticipated change will be required to
meet the mass or concentration limits in its control mechanism that were based
on the original estimate of the long-term average production rate.
   (C)   Limitations for compatible pollutants and other constituents. Standard
ordinance limits for discharge of compatible pollutants and other constituents
are set forth and incorporated hereto in Appendix 1 following this chapter;
and, MAIL limits for compatible pollutants and other constituents are set forth
and incorporated hereto in Appendix 2 following this chapter.
   (D)   Special alternative limits (SALs). For any discharge that would
otherwise be prohibited by this section of this chapter, above, the city POTW
may impose one or more SALs for all or any portion of the discharge (or for all
or any pollutant parameter thereof) pursuant to a user permit or by POTW order.
Each SAL must be approved in advance by the Supervisor. The following
conditions and requirements shall apply to all SALs:
      (1)   The city POTW shall not be required to approve or require a SAL,
but may do so at its sole discretion. The city may terminate or modify the SAL,
and/or require compliance with different or additional discharge standards or
requirements as determined necessary or appropriate at any time.
      (2)   A SAL shall not create any property rights or privilege of any kind
whatsoever, nor shall it be construed to authorize any injury to private or
public property or any invasion of personal rights, nor any violation of local,
state or federal laws or regulations.
      (3)   A SAL may include any terms, conditions or requirements determined
necessary and appropriate by the Supervisor, including, but not limited to,
terms, conditions and requirements regarding sampling, analysis, fees,
reimbursement, surety, indemnification, and insurance.
      (4)   The Supervisor shall establish each SAL based on an allocation of
the amount of remaining available loadings from the city POTW’s maximum
allowable industrial loading (MAIL) for a given pollutant at the time when the
SAL is approved and assigned. Each SAL may also be subject to a maximum (not-
to-exceed) concentration as determined necessary by the city POTW to protect
the receiving sewer, the city POTW, public health and safety, the environment,
or to otherwise achieve the purposes, objectives, and requirements of this
chapter. The MAILs for pollutants of concern are set forth in Appendix 2. All
SAL allocations shall be in the amounts, and subject to the terms, conditions,
and requirements, as deemed necessary and appropriate by the Supervisor.
      (5)   Violation of any SAL (or of any of the terms, conditions or
requirements of a SAL) shall be a violation of this chapter and subject to
applicable fines, penalties, and other enforcement actions.
      (6)   The total mass of a pollutant of concern allocated to trucked
wastes and all other nondomestic users (specifically excluding domestic/
background sewage, septage wastes, and all other domestic users) shall not
exceed the MAILs as set forth in Appendix 2 in the aggregate when taking into
account all SALs that have been assigned by the Supervisor and considered to be
active at the time.
      (7)   SALs shall not exceed national standards applicable to categorical
industries, nor any other local, state, or national standards and requirements.
      (8)   The following constituents are not eligible for a SAL: FOG
Nonpolar, FOG Total, Mercury, Cis-1,2-Dichloroethylene, Trans - 1,2-
Dichloroethylene, Trichloroethylene, Cyanide Available and Vinyl Chloride.
      (9)   Local initiative limits. The Supervisor may, in a wastewater
discharge permit or an order, impose a local initiative limit (“LIL”) for any
pollutant not specifically regulated in § 54.38. In determining a LIL
(concentration or mass), the Supervisor shall consider the acceptable discharge
level of the pollutant based on current influent loading, treatment plant
design, treatability, potential for pass through or interference, potential for
fire/explosion or fume toxicity, potential for adverse impact to the collection
system, and other factors deemed relevant by the Supervisor. A LIL shall be
subject to EGLE, or its successor state department, review and approval before
implementation.

§ 54.39 STATE REQUIREMENTS.
   State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case
where they are more stringent than national requirements and limitation or
those in this chapter.

§ 54.40 CITY’S RIGHT OF REVISION.
   The city reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent
limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if
deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in §
54.01. Individual permits may specify more stringent requirements or
limitations than those set forth in this chapter when, in the opinion of the
Supervisor, such requirements or limitations are necessary to prevent pass
through or interference with the operation or performance of the POTW.
(Ord. 677, passed 8-28-2023)
§ 54.41 DILUTION PROHIBITED AS SUBSTITUTE FOR TREATMENT.
   Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment
standard or requirement, no industrial user shall ever increase the use of
process water or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or
complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a
pretreatment standard or requirement or in any other pollutant specific
limitation developed by the city or state. The control authority (as defined in
40 C.F.R. § 403.12(a)) may impose mass limitations on industrial users which
are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or
in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. 677, passed 8-28-2023)
§ 54.42 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Significant industrial users and all industrial/commercial users with
the potential to discharge toxic substances or prohibited pollutants in amounts
which the city determines may cause pass through or interfere with the
operation of the POTW shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. Upon
request by the city, detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures
to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review. Review of
such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the
responsibility to modify the user’s facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   In case of all discharges that could cause pass through or problems to
the POTW, including slug loadings, it is the responsibility of all categorical
and noncategorical industrial users to immediately telephone and notify the
POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge,
type of waste, concentration and volume and corrective actions.
   (C)   Within five days following an accidental discharge, unless waived by
the Supervisor, the user shall submit to the Supervisor a detailed report
describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user
to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the
user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as
a result of pass through or damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage
to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any
fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter
or other applicable law.
   (D)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of an
accidental discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause
or discover such a discharge are advised of the emergency notification
procedure.
   (E)   Significant industrial users are required to notify the Supervisor
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug
discharge.
   (F)   The Supervisor shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user
needs an accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to
control slug discharges. The Supervisor may require any user to develop, submit
for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be
necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the Supervisor may develop
such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan
shall address, at a minimum, the following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Supervisor of any
accidental or slug discharge; and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.

§ 54.43 MERCURY REDUCTION PLAN (MRP).
   (A)   The local discharge limitation for mercury discharged into the city
sewage treatment plant (STP) is established at the level of detection (LOD) as
set out in §
54.38(D). Mercury sampling procedures, preservation and handling, and
analytical protocol for compliance monitoring shall be in accordance with EPA
Methods 245.1 and 1631. The LOD, developed in accordance with the procedure
specified in 40 C.F.R. 136 shall not exceed 0.2 ug/L for mercury, unless higher
levels are appropriate due to matrix interference(s).
   (B)   The evaluation of potential matrix interference(s) shall include, at a
minimum, the following:
      (1)   A demonstration that the laboratory conducting the analysis is
capable of achieving the LOD of 0.2 ug/L in reagent water;
      (2)   A demonstration that the LOD of 0.2 ug/L cannot be achieved in the
effluent; and
      (3)   A demonstration that an attempt has been made to resolve the matrix
interferences.
   (C)   In cases where true matrix interference can be demonstrated, a
discharge-specific LOD will be developed in accordance with the procedure in 40
C.F.R. 136. Discharge-specific LODs will be incorporated into the wastewater
discharge permit of the nondomestic user.
   (D)   Mercury reduction plan. To ensure that the maximum allowable mercury
loading to the sewage treatment plant (STP) is not exceeded, the city may
require any nondomestic user with a reasonable potential to discharge mercury
to develop, submit for approval and implement a mercury reduction plan (MRP).
The MRP may be required by permit even if the nondomestic user has not violated
the local limit for mercury, but the city has determined that a reasonable
potential for such a violation may exist. An MRP may be required in notices of
violations, orders or other enforcement actions when the non- domestic user has
violated the mercury local limit. At a minimum, an approved MRP shall contain
the following:
      (1)   A written commitment by the user to reduce all nondomestic
discharges of mercury to levels below the established level of detection (LOD)
(0.2 ug/L) within three years of the MRP’s original approval date;
      (2)   Within 60 days of notification by the city that a MRP is required,
the user shall supply an initial identification of all potential sources of
mercury which could be discharged to the sanitary sewer system;
      (3)   Specific strategies for mercury reduction with reasonable
timeframes for implementation, capable of ensuring that mercury discharges will
be below the specified LOD within three years;
      (4)   A program for quarterly sampling and analysis of the nondomestic
discharge for mercury in accordance with EPA Methods 245.1 and 1631;
      (5)   A demonstration of specific, measurable and/or otherwise
quantifiable mercury reductions consistent with the goal of reducing mercury
discharges below the specified LOD. Where such reductions cannot be
demonstrated through normal effluent monitoring (e.g., mercury discharges are
already near LOD) the demonstration should incorporate the following:
         (a)   Internal process monitoring, documenting the results of mercury
reduction strategies at sampling locations within the facility (e.g., a program
of regular monitoring of sink traps where mercury containing reagents had
previously been disposed, but have since been substituted by non-mercury
containing compounds);
         (b)   Internal and/or effluent sampling utilizing clean sampling and
analytical methods as referenced by EPA Federal Register. Note that the results
of such monitoring will not be used for compliance purposes unless performed in
accordance with EPA Method 245.1 and collected at the appropriate compliance
measurement location;
         (c)   Loading calculations wherein the nondomestic user calculates the
total mass of mercury reduced from the sanitary sewer discharge through reagent
substitutions, changes in disposal practices and/or other approved MRP
strategies implemented.
      (6)   A semi-annual report on the status of the mercury reduction
efforts. At a minimum, these reports shall:
         (a)   Identify compliance or noncompliance with specific reduction
commitments in the MRP;
         (b)   Summarize the analytical, mass-based or other quantifiable
demonstrations of mercury reductions performed to date;
         (c)   Provide all applicable analytical data;
         (d)   Provide an evaluation of the effectiveness of actions taken to
date;
         (e)   Provide updates to the initial list of mercury containing
compounds discharged to the sanitary sewer; and
         (f)   Propose for approval new strategies and/or modifications to the
current MRP to continue and improve mercury reduction efforts.
      (7)   Any other conditions that the city deems necessary to ensure that
mercury reduction efforts are effective in achieving the goals of this section.
   (E)   Failure to submit an approved MRP within 30 days of the required due
date shall constitute significant non-compliance in accordance with this
section and will result in publication as a significant violator.
   (F)   A MRP may be evaluated for adequacy at any time by the city. If such
an evaluation determines that the MRP is inadequate, or the nondomestic user
has not complied with its approved MRP, the nondomestic user will be notified.
Failure to comply with the MRP requirement constitutes non-compliance. The city
will follow its Enforcement Response Plan (ERP), as found in §§
53.80 et seq., to ensure that corrective actions are taken and the public
protected.
   (G)   The city reserves the right to take appropriate enforcement action
against any nondomestic user that violates its discharge permit in any way, to
include the discharge of mercury into the city system, even if such user has an
MRP in place and is making progress toward full compliance.
   (H)   A nondomestic user may request a release from the MRP requirements if:
      (1)   All samples of the discharge for a period of one year are less than
the specified LOD;
      (2)   The nondomestic user has complied with at a minimum the monitoring
frequency of quarterly sampling events; and
      (3)   The city deems the MRP commitments have been fulfilled sufficiently
to ensure continued compliance with the mercury limitation. The city shall
notify the nondomestic user of any release from MRP requirements in writing.
   (I)   If the MRP requirement is waived by the city, the nondomestic user
remains subject to the local limitation for mercury in accordance with the
requirements of local and state law.
   (J)   Rediscovery of mercury in the nondomestic user’s discharge subjects
said user to the submission of a new MRP, or escalation of enforcement in
accordance with the city’s ERP.

§ 54.58 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMITTEE.
   (A)   Inspection, sampling and analysis.
      (1)   The Supervisor may inspect the monitoring facilities of any
discharger to determine compliance with the requirements of this section. The
discharger shall allow the Supervisor to enter upon the premises of the
discharger at all hours, for the purposes of inspection, sampling or records
examination. The Supervisor shall have the right to set up on the discharger’s
property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations and have access to examine and
copy any records. All costs associated with this monitoring requirement shall
be borne by the discharger.
      (2)   The reports required in this section must be based upon data
obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, which data are representative of conditions occurring
during the reporting period. The city shall require that frequency of
monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. Grab samples must be used
for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic
compounds. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained
through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-
proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city.
Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by
the city, the samples must be representative of the discharge and the decision
to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user
file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil & grease the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures
as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the control
authority, as appropriate.
         (a)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-
day compliance reports required in this section, a minimum of four grab samples
must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and
volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do
not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
city may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by this section,
the city shall require the number of grab samples necessary to assess and
assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements.
         (b)   All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established by the approval authority pursuant to § 304(h) of the Act and
contained in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test
procedures approved by the approval authority. (See §§ 136.4 and 136.5.)
Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the
approval authority.
      (3)   Where EPA 40 C.F.R. Part 136 does not include a sampling or
analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall
be performed in accordance with the procedure set forth in the EPA publication,
Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for
Priority Pollutants, April, 1977, and amendments thereto or with any other
sampling and analytical procedures approved by the Administrator of the EPA.
Where the POTW performs all the required sampling and analyses and collects all
the information required for the reports required in §
54.58, the significant industrial user will not be required to submit the
report.
      (4)   If sampling performed by a significant industrial user indicates a
violation, the user shall notify the Supervisor within 24 hours of becoming
aware of the violation. At a minimum, the user is required to resample and
analyze and submit results within 30 days of becoming aware of the violation.
The Supervisor may, with the issuance of a modified permit, require more
frequent sampling and analysis. Resampling by the significant industrial user
is not required if the city performs sampling at the user’s facility between
the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the
significant industrial user or city receives the results of this sampling.
Where the city has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the
industrial user, the city must perform any required repeat sampling and
analysis unless it notifies the industrial user of the violation and requires
the user to perform any required repeat analysis.
      (5)   If a significant industrial user, subject to the reporting
requirement in §
54.58, monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the POTW, using
the procedures prescribed in this section, the results of this monitoring shall
be included in the report.
      (6)   The reports required by §
54.58 shall include the following certification statement:
         I certify under penalty of the law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with
a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and
evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or
persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for
gathering the information submitted, it is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of
penalty and imprisonment for knowing violations.
      (7)   Signatory requirements for industrial user reports. The reports
required by §
54.58 shall include the certification statement as set forth in division (A)
(7), and shall be signed by an authorized representative of industrial user as
defined in §
54.02.
      (8)   If an authorization under division (A)(7) of this section is no
longer accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility
for the overall operation of the facility, or overall responsibility for
environmental matters for the company, a new authorization satisfying the
requirements of division (A)(7) of this section must be submitted to the
Supervisor prior to or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized
representative.
      (9)   Reports of permittees shall contain all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow, nature, concentration,
production and/or mass, where required by the Supervisor.
   (B)   Periodic compliance reports. Any industrial user subject to
categorical pretreatment standards shall submit to the Supervisor a report, as
required in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(e), indicating the nature and concentration of
prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent. Unless alternative months
are approved by the POTW, the reports shall be submitted for the six month
periods in June and in December. In cases where the pretreatment standard
requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention
alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the Supervisor or
the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the
significant industrial user. In addition, this report shall include a record of
all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows which during the
reporting period exceeded the average daily flow reported in §
54.56(C)(1)(e) hereof. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual
measurement provided, however, where cost or feasibility considerations
justify, the Supervisor may accept reports of average and maximum flows
estimated by verifiable techniques. The Supervisor, for good cause shown,
considering such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget
cycles, or other extenuating factors, may authorize the submission of said
reports on months other than those specified above.
   (C)   Significant non-categorical user compliance report. For dischargers
who are not subject to categorical pretreatment standards, but are subject to
local limits, and discharge or have the potential to discharge substances which
could adversely affect the POTW’s operation, or for violating any pretreatment
standard or requirement, a report is to be submitted in June and December,
unless alterative months are approved by the POTW, following the commencement
of the discharge to the Supervisor. The report shall specify a description off
the nature, concentration, and flow of all prohibited or regulated substances
contained in their discharge as set forth in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(h) and Mich.
Admin. Code R. 323.2310(7) and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons.
The report shall state whether the requirements are being met on a consistent
basis and, if additional pretreatment is necessary, to bring the discharge into
compliance with the requirements. In cases where a local limit requires
compliance with a Best Management Practice or pollution prevention alternative,
the user must submit documentation required by the city to determine the
compliance status of the user. These reports must be based on sampling and
analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and in accordance with
the techniques described in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 of this chapter and amendments
thereto. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the city in lieu of the
significant non-categorical industrial user.
   (D)   Baseline monitoring report. Within 180 days after the effective date
of a categorical pretreatment standard or 180 days after the final
administrative decision made upon a category determination request, or 90 days
prior to the commencement of discharge in the case of a new source, the
industrial user shall submit a baseline monitoring report, signed by an
authorized representative, in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b) and Mich.
Admin. Code R. 323.2310(2), for any discharge subject to national categorical
pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (E)   Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall
apply to the compliance schedule required by §
54.56(E)(6):
      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months;
      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the Supervisor no later
than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of
compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and
      (4)   In no event shall more than 9 months elapse between such progress
reports to the Supervisor.
   (F)   Ninety-day compliance report; 90-day report on compliance with
national categorical standards. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance with applicable national categorical pretreatment standards, or in
the case of a new source following the commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the POTW, any discharger subject to national categorical
pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit a report in accordance
with 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(d) and Mich. Admin. Code R 323.2310(3).
   (G)   Notification of changed discharges. All industrial users shall
promptly notify the POTW in advance of any substantial change in the volume or
character of pollutants in their discharges.
      (1)   Industrial users do not have an affirmative defense for the
discharge of pollutants that result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors or
fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health or
safety problems.
      (2)   Industrial users shall report any changes to information in the
baseline monitoring report to the POTW within 60 days.
      (3)   All nondomestic user reports shall contain a certification
statement by an authorized representative as outlined in division (A) above.
      (4)   A nondomestic user shall notify the POTW in advance of any
substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in its discharge.
These changes could include the following:
         (a)   Ground waters purged for remedial action programs;
         (b)   Ground waters containing pollutants that infiltrate into the
sewers;
         (c)   Listed or characteristic hazardous wastes.
   (H)   Hazardous waste notification.
      (1)   Any industrial or commercial user, except as specified in division
(H)(5) below, who discharges any substance to the POTW which, if otherwise
disposed of, would be a listed or characteristic hazardous waste under 40
C.F.R. Part 261, shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management
Division Director and the state hazardous waste authorities as set forth in 40
C.F.R. § 403.12(p) and Mich. Admin Code R. 323.2310(15) in writing of such
discharge.
      (2)   All hazardous waste notifications shall include:
         (a)   The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part
261;
         (b)   The EPA hazardous waste number;
         (c)   The type of discharge (continuous, batch or other); and
         (d)   A certification that the user has a program in place to reduce
the volume and toxicity of the hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
      (3)   In addition to be information submitted in §
54.58(H)(2), the reports from industrial and commercial users discharging more

ENFORCEMENT
§ 54.75 HARMFUL CONTRIBUTIONS.
   (A)   The city may immediately suspend or terminate the wastewater treatment
service, wastewater discharge permit, and/or any discharge into the city’s
wastewater system when such suspension or termination is necessary, in the
opinion of the city, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health
or welfare of persons or to the environment, causes interference to the POTW,
pass through, or causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit.
   (B)   Any person notified of a suspension or termination of the wastewater
treatment service, the wastewater discharge permit and/or discharge into the
city’s wastewater system shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution.
In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The city shall reinstate
the wastewater discharge permit and/or wastewater treatment service upon proof,
at a show cause hearing scheduled in accordance with § 54.78 below, of the
elimination of the noncompliance. A detailed written statement submitted by the
user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken
to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the city within 15 days
of the date of occurrence.
(Ord. 677, passed 8-28-2023) Penalty, see §
54.99
§ 54.76 REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   Any user who violates the following conditions of this chapter or applicable
state and federal regulations is subject to having his or her permit revoked in
accordance with the procedures of this chapter:
   (A)   Failure of a user to report factually the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of his or her discharge;
   (B)   Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater constituents and characteristics;
   (C)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose of
inspection or monitoring; or
   (D)   Violation of conditions of the permit.
(Ord. 677, passed 8-28-2023) Penalty, see §
54.99
§ 54.77 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   Whenever the city finds that any user or any other person or entity has
violated or is violating this chapter, wastewater discharge permit, or any
prohibition or limitation or requirements contained within, the city shall
serve or cause to be served upon such user a written notice either personally
or by first class mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature of the
alleged violation. Within 30 days of the date of receipt of the notice, the
user shall respond personally or in writing to the city, advising of its
position with respect to the allegations. Thereafter, the parties shall meet to
ascertain the veracity of the allegations and, where necessary, establish a
plan for the satisfactory correction thereof. Submission of such a plan in no
way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the Supervisor to take any action, including emergency actions or
any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(Ord. 677, passed 8-28-2023) Penalty, see §
54.99
§ 54.78 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   (A)   The city may order any user, or any other person or entity which
causes or allows conduct prohibited by §
54.75, has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, to show cause before the city or its duly
authorized representative why the proposed service termination action should
not be taken. A written notice shall be served on the user specifying the time
and place of a hearing to be held by the city or its designee regarding the
violation, the reasons why the enforcement action is to be taken, the proposed
enforcement action, and directing the user to show cause before the city or its
designee why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of
the hearing shall be served personally or by first class mail not less than ten
days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent, officer, or
authorized representative of a user.
   (B)   The City Commission may itself conduct the hearing and take the
evidence or may designate any of its members or any office or employee of the
assigned department to:
      (1)   Issue in the name of the City Commission notices of hearings
requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of
evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings;
      (2)   Take the evidence;
      (3)   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts, and other evidence, together with recommendations to the City
Commission for action thereon.
   (C)   At any hearing held pursuant to this chapter, testimony taken must be
under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript so recorded will be
made available to any member of the public or any part to the hearing upon
payment of the usual charges thereof.
   (D)   After the City Commission has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an
order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a
specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances shall have been
installed on existing treatment facilities, and that such devices or other
related appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders and directives as
are necessary and appropriate may be issued.
(Ord. 677, passed 8-28-2023) Penalty, see §
54.99
§ 54.79 CONSENT ORDERS.
   The Supervisor may enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance, or
other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user, or any other
person or entity responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include
specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a
time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force
and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §§
54.78,
54.80 and
54.81 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Ord. 677, passed 8-28-2023) Penalty, see §
54.99
§ 54.80 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Supervisor finds that a user, or any other person or entity has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Supervisor may issue an order to the
user, person or other entity responsible for the discharge directing that the
user, person or entity come into compliance within a specified time. If the
user, person or other entity does not come into compliance within the time
provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the
user, person or entity of liability for any violation, including any continuing
violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 677, passed 8-28-2023) Penalty, see §
54.99
§ 54.81 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   (A)   Order to immediately cease and desist discharge. The Supervisor may
issue an order to cease and desist from discharging any wastewater, pollutant,
or discharge not in compliance with this chapter. The order shall have
immediate effect if the actual or threatened discharge to the POTW presents, or
may present imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons, to the environment, or causes or may cause interference or pass
through. The Supervisor shall implement whatever action is necessary to halt or
prevent the discharge, including but not limited to, emergency suspension of
service. The user shall be assessed for any penalties, fines, charges,
surcharges, expenses, or losses incurred due to the actual or threatened
discharge of pollutants as provided by this chapter.
   (B)   Order to cease discharge within a time certain. The Supervisor may
issue an order to cease and desist from discharging any wastewater, pollutant,
or discharge not in compliance with this chapter by a certain time and date.
The proposed time for remedial action shall be specified in the order. In
addition to any other circumstances as determined appropriate by the
Supervisor, an order may be issued under this section for failure to pay
applicable permit fees or to comply with any term of a user permit.

§ 54.82 JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS.
   Following the entry of any order by the city with respect to the conduct of
a user contrary to the provisions of §
54.75, or user or any other person or entity that has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the City Attorney may, following the
authorization of such action by the city, commence an action for appropriate
legal and/or equitable relief in the appropriate local court.
(Ord. 677, passed 8-28-2023) Penalty, see §
54.99
§ 54.83 RIGHT OF APPEAL.
   Any user or any interested party shall have the right to request in writing
an interpretation or ruling by the city on any matter covered by this chapter
and shall be entitled to a prompt written reply. In the event that such inquiry
is by a user and deals with matters of performance or compliance with this
chapter for which enforcement activity relating to an alleged violation is the
subject, receipt of a user’s request shall stay all enforcement proceedings
pending receipt of the aforesaid written reply. Appeal of any final judicial
order entered pursuant to this chapter may be taken in accordance with local
and state law.
(Ord. 677, passed 8-28-2023)
§ 54.84 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.
   The response to a user’s noncompliance is normally dependent on the
violation significance, compliance history, suspected intention, and attitude.
However, there are the following affirmative defense provisions in the law:
   (A)   For upset events, there is an affirmative defense if the user can
demonstrate through operating logs or other relevant evidence that: (i) an
upset occurred and the causes can be identified; (ii) the facility was at the
time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner in accordance with
standard operations and maintenance procedures; and (iii) the user has
submitted to the Supervisor the information required per Mich. Admin. Code R.
323.2315(2)(c)i-iii within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset.
   (B)   For pass through and/or interference events, there is an affirmative
defense if the user can demonstrate that: (i) it did not know that its
discharge, alone or in combination with discharges from other sources, would
cause the violation; and (ii) it was in compliance with a corresponding local
limit, or there was no local limit, before/during the violation and the
discharge did not change substantially.
   (C)   A user shall have an affirmative defense in any action brought against
it alleging specific prohibitions under §§
54.35(A)(2), (7), (12) or (13) if the user can demonstrate that all of the
conditions necessary to establish the defense under Mich. Admin. Code R.
323.2303(3)(a) and (b) are met. However, even if the affirmative defense is
established, the user may still be liable for surcharges for exceeding
applicable discharge limitations as provided by this chapter. In any
enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the affirmative defenses
provided by Mich. Admin. Code R. 323.2303(3) shall have the burden of proof.
(Ord. 677, passed 8-28-2023)
§ 54.85 BYPASS.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      BYPASS. The intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of an
industrial user’s treatment facility.
      SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property, damage
to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial or permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   Limited allowance. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur
which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but
only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the provision of divisions (C) and (D) of
this section.
   (C)   Notice.
      (1)   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass
that is not otherwise allowed, it shall submit prior notice to the control
authority, if possible, at least ten days before the date of the bypass.
      (2)   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the control authority
within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass.
A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the
industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its causes; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The control
authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within 24 hours.
   (D)   Prohibition of bypass.
      (1)   A bypass, if not otherwise allowed pursuant to division (B) of this
section or approved pursuant to division (D)(2) below, is prohibited, and the
control authority may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a
bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgement to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
         (c)   The industrial user submitted notices as required under division
(C) of this section.
      (2)   The control authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the control authority determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed in division (D)(1) of this section.
(Ord. 677, passed 8-28-2023) Penalty, see §
54.99
§ 54.86 OPERATING UPSETS.
   (A)   Any user which experiences an upset in operations which place the user
in a temporary state of noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards
shall immediately inform the city thereof and in no case later than 24 hours of
first awareness of the commencement of the upset. Where such information is
given orally, a written follow up report thereof shall be filed by the user
with the city within five days.
   (B)   The report shall specify:
      (1)   Description of the upset, the cause thereof and the upset’s impact
on a user’s compliance status;
      (2)   Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance, and if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance
is reasonably expected to occur; and
      (3)   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of noncompliance.
(Ord. 677, passed 8-28-2023) Penalty, see §
54.99
§ 54.87 NET/GROSS CALCULATION.
   Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence
of pollutants in the industrial user’s intake water in accordance with this
section.
   (A)   Application. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake
pollutants must make application to the control authority. Upon request of the
industrial user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a “net” basis
(adjusted to reflect pollutants in the intake water) if the requirements of
this section are met.
   (B)   Criteria.
      (1)   The industrial user must demonstrate that the control system it
proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would,
if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the absence of
pollutants in the intake waters.
      (2)   Credit for genetic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be granted
unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the genetic
measure in the user’s effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of
the genetic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits
are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere.
      (3)   Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s), up to a maximum value equal to
the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine
eligibility for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this
section.
      (4)   Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the
intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW
discharges. The control authority may waive this requirement if it finds that
no environmental degradation will result.
      (5)   The applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40
C.F.R. Subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net
basis.
(Ord. 677, passed 8-28-2023)
§ 54.88 RECOVERY OF COSTS INCURRED BY THE CITY.
   Any user violating any of the provisions of this chapter or who discharges
or causes a discharge producing a deposit or obstruction or causes damage to or
impairs the city’s wastewater disposal system shall be liable to the city for
any expense, loss, or damage caused by such violation or discharge. The city
shall bill the user for the costs incurred by the city for any cleaning,
repair, or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge. Refusal to
pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this chapter enforceable
under the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 677, passed 8-28-2023) Penalty, see §
54.99
§ 54.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Administrative fines. Notwithstanding any other section of this
chapter, any user who is found to have violated any provision of this chapter
or permits and orders issued hereunder shall be fined in an amount not to
exceed $1,000 per violation. Each day on which noncompliance shall occur or
continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. Such assessments
may be added to the user’s next scheduled sewer service charge, and the
Supervisor shall have such other collection remedies as he or she has to
collect other service charges. Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall
constitute a lien against the individual user’s property. Individual users
desiring to dispute such fines must file a request for the City Manager to
reconsider the fine within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where the
City Manager believes a request has merit, he or she shall convene a hearing on
the matter within 15 days of receiving the request from the industrial user.
   (B)   Civil penalties. Any user who is found to have violated an order of
the city or who willfully or negligently failed to comply with any provision of
this chapter and the orders, rules, and regulations and permits issued
hereunder shall be fined not more than $1,000, plus actual damages incurred by
the POTW per violation per day for as long as the violation continues. In
addition to the penalties provided herein, the city may recover reasonable
attorneys’ fees, court costs, court reporters’ fees and other expenses of
litigation by appropriate suit at law against the person found to have violated
this chapter or the orders, rules, regulations, and permits issued hereunder.
   (C)   Criminal penalties. Any user convicted of the following may be
punished by a fine of not more than $500 per violation per day, or imprisonment
for not more than 90 days, or both:
      (1)   Willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW
which causes personal injury or property damage. (This penalty shall be in
addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage
available under state law.)
      (2)   Willfully or negligently violates any provision of an individual
wastewater discharge permit, this chapter, an order of the city, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement.
      (3)   Falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any
required monitoring device or method.
      (4)   Knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation
required by a permit, this chapter, an order of the city, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement.

engineering guidelines with amended soils and specific plants, shrubs, and
trees that has a specific volume to store stormwater runoff.
   REAR LOT DRAINAGE. A stormwater system designed to provide drainage in rear
lot areas to prevent water from ponding for extended periods of time. It must
be noted that these systems are not designed to convey stormwater in a rapid
manner. It is a deliberately designed system that can provide additional
detention capabilities during severe runoff conditions.
   REDEVELOPMENT. Altering, improving, reconstructing or otherwise changing the
use of an existing developed property. A site will be considered a

drainage flows toward the area being considered for development.
   URBANIZATION. The development, change, or improvement of any parcel of land
consisting of one or more lots for residential, commercial, industrial,
institutional, recreational, or public utility purposes.
   WATERCOURSE. Any natural or artificial stream, river, creek, channel, ditch,
canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, ravine, street, roadway,
swale, or wash in which water flows in a definite direction, either
continuously or intermittently.
   WATERS OF THE STATE. Any of the following: the Great Lakes bordering the
state and their connecting waters; and all inland lakes, rivers, streams,

lot adjacent to rear lot drainage systems for the purpose of maintenance access
to the system by the city and by neighboring lot or condominium owners.
         (f)   Existing rear lot drainage systems abutting a proposed
development may be used for the development provided the following are true:
            1.   The existing rear lot drainage system has the capacity to
convey stormwater runoff from the proposed rear lot drainage areas; and
            2.   A signed agreement is obtained from property owners located
within the existing development allowing the proposed development's rear lot
stormwater runoff to pass through their existing system.
         (g)   Phased developments owned by the same proprietor may utilize
proposed rear lot drainage for a current development phase on future phases
provided that appropriate deed restrictions/covenants are recorded with the
affected properties allowing for future phases of the development to drain into
or through the existing rear lot drainage system.
         (h)   Rear lot drainage shall be included on preliminary plat
documents or site plan documents.
         (i)   All rear lot drains shall connect to an approved stormwater
drainage system. They cannot connect to road underdrains.
         (j)   Rear lot drainage systems in platted developments are the
responsibility of the landowners and homeowners' association. An easement is to
provide for maintenance work on rear lot drainage systems. The property must be
returned to its pre-maintenance conditions after repairs or maintenance has

property under consideration such that strict compliance with the provisions of
the stormwater discharge permit would deprive the applicant of the reasonable
use of their land;
      (3)   A variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right of the proprietor;
      (4)   Granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
health, safety of general welfare, or injurious to other property in the area;
and
      (5)   The City Manager has sought and received an affirmative
recommendation from a qualified professional engineer.
   (E)   Stormwater system maintenance plans. It is recommended that a
maintenance plan be developed for sites with a stormwater management plan. The

(Ord. 607, passed 9-10-2012)
§ 95.12 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms, phrases, words,

project and program as an opportunity to improve public and private streets and
the transportation network for all users, and shall work in coordination with
other departments, agencies, and jurisdictions to achieve complete streets.
   (B)   Every street project on public or private streets shall be designed to
incorporate complete streets infrastructure sufficient to enable reasonably
safe travel along and across the right-of-way for all categories of users;

      (2)   The cost would be excessively disproportionate to the need or
probable future use over the long term;
      (3)   There is an absence of current or future need;
      (4)   Inclusion of such infrastructure would be unreasonable or
inappropriate in light of the scope of the project; or
      (5)   Safety considerations preclude the utilization of the complete
streets design criteria.
   (C)   To the extent practical and feasible, the city shall incorporate
complete streets infrastructure into existing public and private streets to
improve the safety and convenience of users, construct and enhance the
transportation network for each category of users, and do so through engaging
partners such as Bingham Township, St. Johns Public Schools, other community
groups, public safety departments, the Clinton County Road Commission, and the
Tri-County Regional Planning Commission.
   (D)   If the safety and convenience of users can be improved within the
scope of pavement resurfacing, re-striping, or signalization operations on
public or private streets, such projects shall implement complete streets
infrastructure where feasible to increase safety for users.
   (E)    The City Manager or his or her designee shall review all proposed
revisions to all appropriate land use plans, zoning and subdivision codes,
laws, procedures, rules, regulations, guidelines, programs, templates, and
design manuals, including the comprehensive plan of the city, Safe Routes to
School Programs, and the like, and recommend measures to integrate,
accommodate, and balance the needs of all users in all street projects on
public and private streets.
   (F)   In design guidelines, the design engineer shall develop and review
standards to incorporate complete streets infrastructure, such as bicycle
lanes, sidewalks, street crossings, and planting strips.

environmental reviews, and other project reviews for projects requiring funding
or approval by the city shall:
      (1)   Evaluate the effect of the proposed project on safe travel by all
users; and
      (2)   Identify measures to mitigate any adverse impacts on such travel

may remove or cause or order to be removed any tree or part thereof which is in
an unsafe condition, which is of a prohibited species, or is affected with any
injurious disease, fungus, insect or other pest. Whenever the Department shall
remove any tree, plant or shrub, solely for the purpose of constructing any
public work, the City Manager shall, if practicable, replace the same at public
expense at some nearby location by planting another tree, plant or shrub, not
necessarily of the same type.

of authorized width and location.
(1990 Code, § 3.38)
§ 96.09 GAS MAIN LEAKAGE.
   Gas pipes or mains within any public rights-of-way or on any public property
shall be so maintained as to avoid any leakage therefrom. In the event a leak

§ 96.10 PRIVATE TREES.
   (A)   Clearance. Every owner of any tree on private property overhanging any
street or right-of-way within the city shall trim the branches so that such
branches shall not obstruct the light from any street lamp or obstruct the view
of any street intersection and so that there shall be a clear space of ten feet
above the surface of the street or right-of-way. The owners shall remove all
dead, diseased or dangerous trees or broken or decayed limbs which constitute a
menace to the safety of the public. The city shall have the right to trim any
tree or shrub on private property when it interferes with the proper spread of
light along the street from a street light or interferes with visibility of any
traffic control device or sign, such trimming to be confined to the area
immediately above the right-of-way.
(1990 Code, § 3.40)
   (B)   Diseases and infestations. When the City Manager shall discover that
any tree growing on private property within the city is afflicted with any
dangerous and infectious insect infestation or tree disease, he shall forthwith
serve a written notice upon the owner or his agent, or the occupant of the
property, in the manner specified in this code, describing the tree, its
location and the nature of the infestation or tree disease and ordering the
owner, agent and occupant to take such measures as may be reasonably necessary
to curb such infestation or disease and to prevent the spreading thereof,
specifying the measures required to be taken. Such order may require the
pruning, spraying or destruction of trees as may be reasonably necessary. Every
such notice shall be complied with within ten days after service thereof, upon
the owner, agent or occupant of the property on which the afflicted tree is
located or within such additional time as may be stipulated in such notice. Any
person receiving notice to remove a tree may within the time limited for
compliance therewith file an appeal with the City Clerk which shall be
transmitted to the City Commission and shall be heard at the next City
Commission meeting thereafter.
(1990 Code, § 3.42)
   (C)   Owners failure to comply. In case the owner, agent and occupant of the
property refuse to carry out the order of the City Manager within the time
limited, or in case of an appeal, within five days after the City Commission
shall have affirmed such order, the City Manager shall carry out the pruning,
spraying or destruction of the trees as deemed necessary by him and shall bill
the owner, agent or occupant of the property for the cost thereof. In case the
owner of such property shall fail to pay such bill within 60 days after the
same has been rendered, the City Manager shall report the same to the City
Commission for collection as a single lot assessment against the property. The
City Manager may, without serving the above notice, when the owner or occupant
of any private property shall consent thereto and pay the reasonable cost
thereof, cause trees growing on private property to be sprayed when he deems
the same necessary on account of any infestation or disease or threat thereof.
(1990 Code, § 3.43)
   (D)   Inspection. The City Manager and his assistants and employees shall
have authority to enter upon private premises for the purpose of examining any
trees, shrubs, plants, or vines for the presence of destructive insects or
plant diseases. No damages shall be awarded for the destruction of any tree,
shrub, or plant or fruit or injury to the same, if done by the City Manager or
under his direction, in accordance with this chapter.
(1990 Code, § 3.44)
§ 96.11 CORNER CLEARANCE.
   All shrubs and bushes located on the triangle formed by two right-of-way
lines at the intersection of two streets and extending for a distance of 25
feet each way from the intersection of the right-of-way lines on any corner lot
within the city shall not be permitted to grow to a height of more than two
feet in height from top of curb at street level in order that the view of the
driver of a vehicle approaching a street intersection shall not be obstructed.
Trees may be planted and maintained on private property in this area, provided
that all branches are trimmed to maintain a clear vision for a vertical height
of ten feet above the roadway surface. Any owner of any property failing to
trim any trees, shrubs or bushes in conformity with this division or division
(A) of this section shall be notified by the City Manager in the manner
provided in this code, to do so and the notice shall require trimming in
conformity with this section within ten days after the date of the notice. Upon
the expiration of such period, the City Manager may cause the trimming to be
done and the cost thereof may be collected from the owner of the property as a
single lot assessment.
(1990 Code, § 3.41)
§ 96.12 LAWN EXTENSIONS.
   On residence streets, the abutting owner or occupant may maintain a planting
strip on the lawn extension between the sidewalk and curb and may plant
flowers, trees and shrubbery therein in conformity with this chapter. No person
shall willfully injure or destroy any grass, flower, tree or shrub upon any
such planting strip or throw any papers, refuse or other thing thereon. No
person shall drive an automobile, bicycle or other vehicle upon or over any
such planting strip.

§ 96.13 OVERHEAD LINES.
   The City Manager shall grant permission to public utilities to trim and keep
trimmed all trees within the streets, alleys, parks and public places of the
city in such a manner as shall keep the overhead lines of such public utilities
safe and accessible. The trimming shall be done in accordance with approved
practices and under the general direction of the Department. The permission, as
provided for in this section, shall require reasonable prior notice to the city
before any work is commenced thereunder; provided, however, that in the event
of an emergency requiring immediate maintenance work on the overhead lines of
the public utilities, prior notice of commencing work under the permit shall
not be required. The word EMERGENCY as used in this section shall be defined to
mean the occurrence or happening of an event which could not be foreseen by the
exercise of reasonable care and foresight, which might cause damage to the
overhead lines of the public utilities.
(1990 Code, § 3.46)
§ 96.14 ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS.
   The City Manager shall make such rules and regulations supplementary to this
chapter and not in conflict herewith as he may from time to time deem necessary
to be effective upon approval by the City Commission. Until changed pursuant to

shall continue in effect. No person shall fail to obey any rule or regulation
effective hereunder.

or fireworks will be part of the event, and other considerations deemed
relevant.
   (B)   If it is determined that insurance is required, an amount of coverage

Attorney a valid certificate of insurance in the designated amount naming the
City of St. Johns as an additional insured. Failure to provide this proof of

or consumption of alcohol must submit a separate special events application to
sell/consume alcohol. This application will be reviewed by the City Manager and

of or billed to the sponsoring person or organization unless specifically
waived by the city.

further on any specific occurrences with past special events of a similar
nature held on prior occasions, the City Manager or his/her designee may impose

§ 97.09 RESERVATION OF ANNUAL EVENT DATES.

scheduled time or date, the current year’s applicant may also request
reservation of a date for the following year’s event. Approval of the
application will include tentative reservation of the following year’s
requested date. This will not, however, constitute approval of the next year’s
event until a timely application is submitted for city approval. In general,
the city will not approve special events more than one year in advance.
(Ord. 612, passed 1-14-2013)

purchase or attempt to purchase alcoholic liquor, consume or attempt to consume
alcoholic liquor, possess or attempt to possess alcoholic liquor, or have any

prior conviction in the State of Michigan for minor in possession of alcohol,
or has previously been found responsible for a civil infraction involving minor
in possession of alcohol, he or she is subject to prosecution for a misdemeanor
as described in division (3) below.
      (2)   Penalties for civil infraction finding under this section. For the
first violation, the minor is responsible for a civil infraction and shall be
fined not more than $100. A court may order the minor to participate in

conviction) shall be charged with a misdemeanor under § 111.05(A)(5) and
subject to a $200 fine, community service, a term of probation not to exceed
one year, or any combination thereof. If a minor is placed on probation by the
court under this section, and violates any material term of said probation, the
court has the discretion to use its contempt powers to punish the minor, to
include incarceration in a suitable facility.
      (4)   A peace officer who has reasonable cause to believe a minor has
consumed alcoholic liquor or has any bodily alcohol content may request that
individual to submit to a preliminary chemical breath analysis. If the minor
does not consent to a preliminary chemical breath analysis, the analysis shall
not be administered without a court order, but a peace officer may seek to
obtain a court order. The results of a preliminary chemical breath analysis or
other acceptable blood alcohol test are admissible in a civil infraction
proceeding or criminal prosecution to determine whether the minor has consumed
or possessed alcoholic liquor or had any bodily alcohol content.
      (5)   A law enforcement agency, on determining that an individual who is

license, as distinguished from any renewal thereof, the Commission shall
consider the question of whether public convenience and necessity require the
operation of such taxicab. The Commission shall consider the number of taxicabs
operating in the city and whether the demands of the public require additional

the additional taxicab service will result in a greater hazard to the public
and such other relevant facts as the Commission may deem advisable. The

Michigan and the Charter, ordinances and code of the city and that any judgment
rendered in any court against such applicant or the driver of any taxicab
arising out of damage or injury to any person or property caused by the
negligent operation of any such taxicab will be paid. Any person damnified by
the negligent operation of any taxicab belonging to the applicant, whether

case, more than ten days after such suspension. The hearing shall then be held
and shall determine whether the license shall be terminated and revoked, or
whether the suspension should be extended, or if the license should be restored
to the holder. The holder of the license shall be notified of the time, date,
and place of the hearing and shall be notified of the reason or reasons for the

request for such appeal must be filed within seven days of the date the
decision was rendered.

written request, within ten days of the receipt of the written request. The
hearing shall be scheduled and held before the entire City Commission or a
quorum thereof. The factual record made in the hearing below shall constitute
the basic record for the appeal. The city may, but need not, allow the
presentation of additional evidence, the decision to be by a majority vote of
the City Commission. The City Commission may affirm, reverse, or modify any
action taken by the City Manager or his designee relative to the license.

the following: If the city incurs expenses as a result of the utility’s
occupation or use of the public right-of-way, upon receipt of an invoice for
said expenses, the utility will immediately reimburse the city the stated
expenses. In addition, if collection efforts are required, and the utility is
unsuccessfully in a challenge to the invoice, then the utility will agree to
reimburse the city the cost incurred in the collection of the invoice.

         (a)   No burden on public right-of-way. The utility, its contractors,
subcontractors, and its facilities shall not unduly burden or interfere with
the present or future use of any of the public right-of-way. A utility’s
facilities shall be installed and maintained so as to not endanger or injure
persons or property in or about the public right-of-way. If the city reasonably
determines that any portion of the facilities constitutes an undue burden or
interference, due to changed circumstances, utility, at its sole expense, shall

subcontractors shall immediately restore, at the utility’s sole cost and
expense, in a manner approved by the city, any portion of the public right-of-
way that is in any way disturbed, damaged, or injured by the construction,
installation, operation, maintenance or removal of the facilities to a
reasonably equivalent (or, at utility’s option, better) condition as that which
existed prior to the disturbance. In the event that the utility, its
contractors or subcontractors fail to make such repair within a reasonable
time, the city may make the repair and the utility shall pay the costs the city
incurred for such repair.
         (c)   Installation and maintenance. The construction and installation
of the facilities shall be performed pursuant to plans approved by the city.
The open cut of any public right-of-way shall be coordinated with the City
Engineer, Zoning Administrator or his/her designee. The utility shall install
and maintain the facilities in a reasonably safe condition. If the existing
poles in the public right-of-way are overburdened or unavailable for the
utilities use, or the facilities of all users of the poles are required to go
underground then the utility shall, at its expense, place such portion of its
facilities underground, unless the city approves an alternate location. The
utility may perform maintenance on the facilities without prior approval of the
city, provided that the utility shall obtain any and all permits required by
the city in the event that any maintenance will disturb or block vehicular
traffic or are otherwise required by the city.

utility to conduct all work in the public right-of-way in conjunction with or
immediately prior to any street construction or street resurfacing planned by
the city.
         (e)   Street vacation. If the city vacates or consents to the vacation
of public right-of-way within its jurisdiction, and such vacation necessitates
the removal and relocation of the utility’s facilities in the vacated public
right-of-way, the utility shall remove its facilities at its sole cost and
expense when ordered to do so by the city or a court of competent jurisdiction.
The utility shall relocate its facilities to such alternate route as the city
and the utility mutually agree, applying reasonable engineering standards.
         (f)   Relocation. When the city requests the utility to relocate,
protect, support, disconnect, or remove its facilities because of street or
city utility work, or other public projects, the utility shall relocate,
protect, support, disconnect, or remove its facilities, at its sole cost and
expense, including where necessary to such alternate route as the city and the
utility mutually agree, applying reasonable engineering standards. The work
shall be completed within a reasonable time period.
         (g)   Public emergency. The city shall have the right to sever,
disrupt, dig-up or otherwise destroy facilities of the utility if such action
is necessary because of a public emergency. If reasonable to do so under the
circumstances, the city shall attempt to provide notice to the utility. Public
emergency shall be any condition which poses an immediate threat to life,
health, or property caused by any natural or man-made disaster, including, but
not limited to, storms, floods, fire, accidents, explosions, water main breaks,
hazardous material spills, and the like. The utility shall be responsible for
repair at its sole cost and expense of any of its facilities damaged pursuant
to any such action taken by the city.

shall conduct its business in conformance with the statutory provisions and
regulations promulgated thereunder.
         (i)   Underground relocation. If the utility has its facilities on the
poles of Consumers Energy, Verizon or another electric or telecommunications
provider and Consumers Energy, Verizon or such other electric or
telecommunications provider relocates its system underground, then the utility
shall relocate its facilities underground in the same location at the utility’s
sole cost and expense.
         (j)   Identification. All personnel of the utility and its contractors
or subcontractors who have as part of their normal duties contact with the
general public shall wear on their clothing a clearly visible identification
card bearing the utility’s name, their name and photograph. The utility shall
account for all identification cards at all times. Every service vehicle of the
utility and its contractors or subcontractors shall be clearly identified as
such to the public, such as by a magnetic sign with utility’s name and
telephone number.
      (4)   Removal.
         (a)   Removal; underground. As soon as practicable after the utility
has discontinued the use of its facilities, the utility, or its successors and
assigns shall remove all of its facilities from the public right-of-way which
has been installed in such a manner that it can be removed without trenching or
other opening of the public right-of-way. The utility shall not remove any
underground portions of the facilities which requires trenching or other
opening of the public right-of-way except with the prior written approval of
the City Engineer, Zoning Administrator or other designee of the city. All
removals shall be at utility’s sole cost and expense.
         (b)   Removal; above ground. As soon as practicable after the utility
has discontinued the use of its facilities, the utility, or its successor or
assigns at its sole cost and expense, shall, unless waived in writing by the

above-ground elements of its facilities, including but not limited to poles,
pedestal mounted terminal boxes, equipment cabinets, consoles and lines
attached to or suspended from poles.
         (c)   Schedule. The schedule and timing of removal shall be subject to
approval by City Engineer, Zoning Administrator or other designee of the city.
Unless extended by the city, removal shall be completed not later than 12
months following the discontinuance. Portions of the facilities in the public
right-of-way which are not removed within such time period shall be deemed
abandoned and, at the option of the city, exercised by written notice to the
utility, title to those portions of the abandoned facilities shall vest in the
city.

damages and expenses, the city may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction
as necessary to enforce, or enjoin a violation of this chapter.
   (C)   Continuing offense. Each act of violation and each day upon which any

this section or an installment of the fine, costs, or damages or expenses as
allowed by the court, may be collected by the city by a means authorized for
the enforcement of a judgment under Chapters 40 or 60 of the Revised Judicature
Act, M.C.L.A. §§ 600.101, et seq., MSA 27A. 101, et seq., as amended.

and may issue a summons, order to show cause, or bench warrant of arrest for
the defendant’s appearance.
      (2)   If a corporation or an association is ordered to pay a civil fine,
costs, or damages or expenses, the individuals authorized to make disbursements
shall pay the fine, costs, or damages or expenses, and their failure to do so
shall be civil contempt unless they make the showing required in this
subsection.
      (3)   Unless the defendant shows that the default was not attributable to
an intentional refusal to obey the order of the court or to a failure on his or
her part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for payment,
the court shall find that the default constitutes a civil contempt and may
order the defendant committed until all or a specified part of the amount due
is paid.
      (4)   If it appears that the default in the payment of a civil fine,
costs, or damages or expenses does not constitute civil contempt, the court may

   (A)   On November 6, 2018, Michigan voters approved Initiated Law 1 of 2018,
known as the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act ("2018 Marihuana
Act"). Among other things, the 2018 Marihuana Act makes marihuana legal under
state and local law for adults 21 years of age or older, makes industrial hemp
legal under state and local law, and controls the commercial production and
distribution of marihuana under a system that licenses, regulates, and taxes
the businesses involved.
   (B)   Section 6 of the 2018 Marihuana Act authorizes a municipality to
completely prohibit or limit the number of marihuana establishments within its
boundaries. A "marihuana establishment" under the 2018 Marihuana Act means a
marihuana grower, marihuana safety compliance facility, marihuana processor,
marihuana microbusiness, marihuana retailer, marihuana secure transporter, or
any other type of marihuana-related business licensed by the Michigan
Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.
   (C)   The City of St. Johns has carefully considered the potential benefits,
effects, and costs of permitting marihuana establishments within its boundaries
and has determined that prohibiting marihuana establishments is in the best
interest of the public health, safety, and welfare at this time.
(Ord. 652, passed 9-9-2019)
§ 118.02 PROHIBITION ON MARIHUANA ESTABLISHMENTS.

prohibits any and all commercial marihuana establishments within its geo-
political boundaries.
(Ord. 652, passed 9-9-2019)
§ 118.03 SCOPE.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit non-commercial
activities, or other legal activities, that are permitted under the Michigan
Medical Marihuana Act, Initiated Law 1 of 2008, M.C.L.A. § § 333.26421 et seq.

§ 119.03 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES.
   The City Commission shall establish, by resolution, the required fees for
registration, certification, inspection, appeals, and other applications under
this chapter, as well as the fines for non-compliance with this chapter. The
City Commission shall also establish, by resolution, procedures and deadlines
for initial registration and certification of rental dwelling units under this
chapter. The City Commission may establish a fee schedule that includes
deadlines for registration and/or certification and higher fees or fines if
those deadlines are not met.
   (A)   Notice to non-100% PRE (principal residence exemption) residential
property owners. Prior to a date set by the City Commission by resolution, the
city shall inform, in writing, the owners of all residential dwelling units
that do not claim a 100% principal residence exemption of the rental
registration requirement.
   (B)   Application for registration. Following the written notice described
in division (A), any property owner renting or leasing a dwelling unit in
exchange for financial compensation, for any period of time, shall be required
to be registered. The city shall create a registration form and shall provide
it to property owners upon request. The registration form, or another form to
be included with the registration form, shall require such information as shall
be determined by the public safety departments of the city. Once all required
registration information is submitted for a given property, the property shall
be placed on the rental registration list, which the city shall maintain.
   (C)   Inspection and certification requirement. Prior to a date set by the
City Commission by resolution, there shall be no inspection or certification
requirement. All registration applications prior to that date shall be approved

   (E)   Newly created rental dwelling units. When a dwelling unit is newly
constructed, or created through renovation, the city shall register the unit as
a rental at the time of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, unless the
property owner submits a principal residence exemption claim to the City
Assessor. There shall be no fee for registering a newly created dwelling unit,
provided that all required zoning and building fees have been paid.
   (F)   Removal from rental registration list. If a property owner is approved
for a principal residence exemption, or otherwise demonstrates to the city that
the dwelling unit is not being rented or leased, and is not being marketed for
rental or lease (for any period of time), the property shall be removed from
the rental registration list.
(Ord. 670, passed 6-27-2022)
§ 119.04 RENTAL INSPECTION AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM.
   Beginning on a date to be set by the City Commission by resolution, it shall
be unlawful for an owner to rent or lease a dwelling for financial compensation
unless the dwelling unit is in "Good Standing" under the Rental Inspection and
Certification program, as described below.
   (A)   Good standing. A dwelling unit shall be considered in "Good Standing"
if it meets the following criteria:
      (1)   A registration application has been submitted to the city and the
dwelling unit is included on the rental registration list described in §
119.03.
      (2)   The dwelling unit was certified following an inspection of the
building it is located within by the city, as described in §
119.03(C) and (D) within the previous three calendar years OR the building the
dwelling unit is located within is scheduled for its first inspection under the
Rental Inspection and Certification Program within the coming three calendar
years.
      (3)   All required fees have been paid.
   (B)   Inspection requirement. The owners of all dwelling units listed in the
rental registration list shall make their dwellings available for inspections
by the city once in every third calendar year.
      (1)   After a date to be set by the City Commission by resolution, the
city shall divide the buildings containing dwelling units on the rental
registration list into three groups, and shall notify property owners of the
group each building has been assigned to.
         (a)   Group 1 shall be inspected in a year to be established by the
City Commission by resolution, and each subsequent third year, for as long as
any dwelling units in the building remain on the rental registration list.
         (b)   Group 2 shall be inspected in the year after Group 1, and each
subsequent third year, for as long as any dwelling units in the building remain
on the rental registration list.
         (c)   Group 3 shall be inspected the year after Group 2, and each
subsequent third year, for as long as any dwelling units in the building remain
on the rental registration list.
      (2)   Newly created residential buildings containing dwelling units shall
be added to the Group that will be inspected in the third calendar year
following the issuance of their certificate of occupancy.
      (3)   Fully or partially owner-occupied buildings that are converted to
rentals shall be subject to the requirements of §
119.03(E) and must be inspected and certified prior to any tenants occupying
the dwelling unit. Once certified, the buildings shall be added to the Group
that was inspected in the calendar year that it was certified, and shall be
inspected in each subsequent third year.
      (4)   Number of units inspected per building. For each building to be
certified, the following number of units shall be inspected during each
regularly scheduled inspection. When calculating the required number of units,
fractional units shall always be rounded up. The inspector shall choose the
units to inspect at random, and shall not inform the property owner in advance
which units will be chosen for inspection. Additionally, if the building
contains a basement dwelling unit, the basement dwelling unit must be one of
the units inspected during every regularly scheduled inspection of the
building.
         (a)   Buildings with four or fewer units: All units in the building.
         (b)   Buildings with five to ten units: 50% of the units in the
building, minimum of four units.
         (c)   Buildings with 11 or more units: 25% of the units in the
building, minimum of five units.
      (5)   Complaint-based supplemental inspections. A tenant may request a
supplemental inspection of their unit at any time. In the event of a request
for a supplemental inspection, the inspection shall take place within 60 days
using the process and criteria described in divisions (C) and (D).
         (a)   Only the unit of the tenant making the request shall be
inspected.
         (b)   If the unit passes the inspection, then the property owner shall
be refunded 50% of the inspection fee.
         (c)   The regularly scheduled inspections on the three year cycle
described in division (B)(1) shall be unaffected by a request for a
supplemental inspection.
   (C)   Certification criteria. The Planning Commission shall develop and
adopt a list of inspection criteria. The list shall include "Life Safety"
requirements that directly impact the life, safety, and welfare of the tenants,
and "Quality of Life" requirements that do not impact safety, but are important
for the comfortable enjoyment of the unit by the tenant. In order to be
certified, a unit must comply with all life safety requirements, and at least
80% of the quality of life requirements. The Planning Commission shall review
the inspection criteria on an annual basis and make adjustments to the list as
necessary.
   (D)   Rental certification determination and outcome.
      (1)   Good standing. If all of the life safety criteria and 80% of the
quality of life criteria are met, in the opinion of the inspector, the city
shall issue a rental certification certificate to the building and shall
designate the building as in "Good Standing" on the rental registration list.
The criteria shall not be cumulative among units, but shall apply to each unit
individually.
      (2)   Failure to meet criteria. If ANY of the life safety criteria OR
more than 20% of the quality of life criteria, are not met, in the opinion of
the inspector, for any inspected dwelling unit, the inspector shall instruct
the owner to make the necessary improvement within seven days (for life safety
issues) or 30 days (for quality of life issues). The property owner may choose
which quality of life improvements to make to bring the unit up to 80%
compliance. If the inspector determines that the work may reasonably take
longer than that, the inspector may designate a different deadline. The
inspector shall schedule a re-inspection on or soon after the deadline. If the
improvements are made by the deadline, the city shall issue the rental
certification certificate and designate the building as in "Good Standing" on
the rental registration list.
      (3)   Failure to meet improvement deadline. If required improvements are
not made by the deadline designated by the inspector, then the owner of the
property shall be fined an amount to be set by the City Commission by
resolution, and a new deadline shall be set for completion of the improvements.
If that deadline is also missed, the owner of the property shall be fined
double the amount of the first fine, a new deadline shall be set, and the City
Attorney may begin proceedings to remove the tenants. Any further missed
deadlines shall result in a fine of four times the amount of the first fine.
   (E)   Appeals. If an inspection requires improvements, the property owner
may, within 21 days of receiving the inspection report, appeal the inspector's
determination to the Planning Commission.
      (1)   The fee for the appeal shall be set by the City Commission by
resolution.
      (2)   Filing the appeal shall stay any deadline imposed by the inspector
until after the Planning Commission hearing.
      (3)   The Planning Commission hearing shall take place no more than 60
days after the appeal is filed with the city.
      (4)   The Planning Commission shall hear evidence from both the inspector
and the property owner, and shall either determine that the inspector's
required improvement to the property is not necessary, or shall order the
improvement completed, setting a new deadline under §
119.03(D)(2). In order for the Planning Commission to determine that an
improvement is not necessary, both of the following criteria must be met:
         (a)   The existing condition of the dwelling unit does not threaten
the life, health, or safety of the tenant.
         (b)   The improvement is not possible due to historic preservation
requirements, potential damage to other parts of the unit or other dwelling
units, or potential long term deterioration of the unit due to the impacts of
the required improvement.
      (5)   The outcome of re-inspection of a unit to determine if improvements
required by an inspector or the Planning Commission have been satisfactorily
completed may not be appealed to the Planning Commission. The ordered
improvements must be completed to the satisfaction of the inspector.
      (6)   A determination by the Planning Commission that an improvement is
not necessary shall not exempt the unit from the requirement to comply with
that improvement at the next regularly scheduled inspection. However, the
Planning Commission ruling shall exempt the unit from the requirement during
any supplemental inspections.

§ 150.063 HEARING.
   (A)   At a hearing prescribed herein, the hearing officer shall take
testimony of the enforcing agency, the owner of the property, and any
interested party. Not more than five days after completion of the hearing, the
hearing officer shall render a decision either closing the proceedings or
ordering the building or structure demolished, otherwise made safe, or properly

   (B)   If the hearing officer determines that the building or structure
should be demolished, otherwise made safe, or properly maintained, the hearing
officer shall enter an order that specifies what action the owner, agent, or
lessee shall take and set a date by which the owner, agent, or lessee shall
comply with the order. If the building is a dangerous building as set forth in
§
150.061(J), the order may require the owner or agent to maintain the exterior
of the building and adjoining grounds owned by the owner of the building
including, but not limited to, the maintenance of lawns, trees, and shrubs.
   (C)   If the owner, agent, or lessee fails to appear or neglects or refuses
to comply with the order issued under division (B) of this section, the hearing
officer shall file a report of the findings and a copy of the order with the
legislative body of the city not more than five days after the date for
compliance set in the order and request that necessary action be taken to
enforce the order. If the legislative body of the city has established a Board
of Appeals as set forth in §

officer shall be served on the owner, agent, or lessee in the manner prescribed
in §
150.062.
   (D)   The legislative body or the Board of Appeals, as applicable, shall set
a date not less than 30 days after the hearing prescribed in §§
150.062 and
150.063 for a hearing on the findings and order of the hearing officer. The
legislative body or the Board of Appeals shall give notice to the owner, agent,

or lessee shall be given the opportunity to show cause why the order should not
be enforced. The legislative body or the Board of Appeals shall approve,
disapprove, or modify the order. If the legislative body or Board of Appeals

action to enforce the order. If the order is approved or modified, the owner,
agent, or lessee shall comply with the order within 60 days after the date of
the hearing under this division. For an order of demolition, if the legislative
body or the Board of Appeals determines that the building or structure has been
substantially destroyed by fire, wind, flood, deterioration, neglect,
abandonment, vandalism, or other cause, and the cost of repair of the building
or structure will be greater than the state equalized value of the building or
structure, the owner, agent, or lessee shall comply with the order of
demolition within 21 days after the date of the hearing under this division. If
the estimated cost of repair exceeds the state equalized value of the building
or structure to be repaired, a rebuttable presumption that the building or

hearing officers, costs of title searches or commitments used to determine the
parties in interest, recording fees for notices and liens filed with the County
Register of Deeds, demolition and dumping charges, court reporter attendance
fees, and costs of the collection of the charges authorized under this
subchapter. The cost of the demolition, of making the building safe, or of

conformance with this section shall be reimbursed to the city by the owner or
party in interest in whose name the property appears.
   (F)   The owner or party in interest in whose name the property appears upon
the last local tax assessment records shall be notified by the assessor of the
amount of the cost of the demolition, of making the building safe, or of
maintaining the exterior of the building or structure or grounds adjoining the
building or structure by first class mail at the address shown on the records.
If the owner or party in interest fails to pay the cost within 30 days after
mailing by the assessor of the notice of the amount of the cost, the city shall
have a lien for the cost incurred by the city to bring the property into
conformance with this chapter. The lien shall not take effect until notice of
the lien has been filed or recorded as provided by law. A lien provided for in
this division does not have priority over previously filed or recorded liens
and encumbrances. The lien for the cost shall be collected and treated in the
same manner as provided for property tax liens under the General Property Tax
Act, Public Act 206 of 1893, being M.C.L.A. §§ 211.1 to 211.157.
   (G)   In addition to other remedies under this section, the city may bring
an action against the owner of the building or structure for the full cost of
the demolition, of making the building safe, or of maintaining the exterior of
the building or structure or grounds adjoining the building or structure. The
city shall have a lien on the property for the amount of a judgment obtained
under this division. The lien provided for in this division shall not take
effect until notice of the lien is filed or recorded as provided by law. The
lien does not have priority over prior filed or recorded liens and
encumbrances.
(Ord. 549, passed 5-8-2006)

structure against whom the judgment is obtained. A lien provided for in this
section does not take effect until notice of the lien is filed or recorded as
provided by law, and the lien does not have priority over prior filed or
recorded liens and encumbrances.

   (A)   Complaints.
      (1)   Complaints of violation of any provision of this subchapter
conveyed to the City of St. Johns shall be recorded in written form in a
central log book as to date and time of the complaint, the name of the property
owner/responsible party (if known) and the address where the alleged violation
is sited. Unless the complainant requests anonymity, complainant’s name will
also be recorded. A complainant’s name will not be divulged, even when known,
unless expressly requested by the property owner/responsible party.
      (2)   Once a complaint has been lodged with the city, the Enforcement
Officer, or his or her designee, will take whatever action is necessary to
determine if there has been a violation of this subchapter. If the Enforcement
Officer reasonably believes a violation of this subchapter has occurred, the
following procedure is initiated:
         (a)   Notification Letter: Initial notification of the violation shall
be in letter form from the City Enforcement Officer, describing the nature of
the violation. The property owner/responsible party will be instructed to make
contact with the City Enforcement Officer within 10 business days of receipt of
the letter. Once contact is made between the property owner/responsible party
and the city, discussion will follow regarding the remedial steps the city
expects to be taken to cure the violation, the timeline for correction of the
violation, and any assistance that may be available for remediation. (The City
of St. Johns has compiled a list of service organizations that have volunteered
to provide an individual property owner assistance with respect to compliance
with this ordinance. Each organization establishes its own criteria for
qualifying for such assistance.)
         (b)   Administrative review option:
            1.   If the property owner/responsible party wishes to contest the
violation, or wishes to present information in mitigation of the violation, the
individual can request the matter be heard by the Citizens Review Panel. See
subsection 2, below.
            2.   A property owner/responsible party will also have the right to
a hearing in the District Court. This right is separate from and cumulative to
the right to appear before the Citizens Review Panel. This judicial forum is
available only after a Civil Infraction Citation has issued. See subsection
(d), below.
         (c)   Failure to Comply: Failure to 1) respond to the initial
Notification Letter (subsection (A)(2)(a) above) and comply with the directive
of the Enforcement Officer or 2) comply with the recommendations of the
Citizens Review Panel (subsection (A)(2)(b) above) will cause a Municipal Civil
Infraction Notice to be issued per Ordinance #499. This notice will direct the
property owner/responsible party to appear at the Municipal Violations Bureau
and pay the fine per the schedule established in the Municipal Civil Infraction
Ordinance.
         (d)   Civil Infraction Citation: Failure to 1) request a Citizens
Review Panel hearing or (2) pay the Municipal civil infraction fine specified
in the Civil Infraction Notice within 10 business days will result in the
issuance of a Municipal Civil Infraction Citation. This Citation will provide
the property owner/responsible party a time period within which to appear in
court.
   (B)   Citizens Review Panel and procedure.
      (1)   The Citizens Review Panel will be comprised of 4 residents,
separately drawn from the 4 geographic quadrants of the city as delineated by
State Street and Clinton Ave. The panel will also have 1 City Commissioner as a
member. The members will be appointed by the Mayor, and will serve staggered
terms of 2 years.
         (a)   Procedure. A hearing will be scheduled before the panel upon
request as soon as is practicable. At the hearing the city will have the burden
of proving that a violation has occurred. The alleged violator will be given
full opportunity to present information to the panel for purposes of contesting
the violation. Alternatively, the alleged violator can admit the violation and
present information or evidence in mitigation of the offense. This information
can be presented directly, through witnesses or by documentary or other
tangible evidence. The panel reserves the right to limit testimony or the
presentation of information if it is cumulative, irrelevant, or of marginal
probative value.
         (b)   Determination. After hearing the matter, the members sitting in
review of the alleged violation shall make a finding as to whether a violation
of the code has in fact occurred. If a finding of “no violation” is made, the
notice of violation will be dismissed. If a finding of “violation” is made, the
members sitting in review shall provide the property owner/responsible party
with an opportunity to correct the violation as a means of avoiding the penalty
provisions of City Ordinance No. 500. Failure by the property owner/responsible
party to correct the violation within the timeframe indicated by the Citizens
Review Panel will result in the issuance of a Civil Infraction Notice.
        (2)   Requesting administrative review, as outlined above, does not
preclude a property owner from seeking subsequent judicial review.

such times they shall transmit to the City Commission an estimate of the time
period within which the land acquisition for public use indicated on the
certified plat should be accomplished. The making or certifying of such a plat
by the Commission shall not in and of itself constitute or be deemed to

issued for, and no building or structure or part thereof shall be erected on
any land located within the proposed future outside lines of any new, extended
or widened street, avenue, places or other public way, or of any park,
playground, or other public grounds, or extensions thereof, shown on any such
certified and adopted plat. Any such ordinance shall provide that the City
Commission, when acting as a Zoning Board of Appeals, shall have the power, on
appeal filed with it by the owner of such land, to authorize the granting of a
permit for the erection of a building or structure, or parts thereof, within
the lines of any mapped street, park, playground, or other public ground in any
case in which said Board finds upon the evidence the arguments presented to it
on such appeal:
      (1)   That the entire property of the appellant located in whole or in
part within the lines of such mapped street, park, playground, or other public
ground cannot yield a reasonable return to the owner unless such permit be
granted; and
      (2)   That balancing the interest of the city in preserving the integrity
of the adopted map, and the interest of the owner of the property in the use
and benefits of his property, the granting of such permit is required by
consideration of justice and equity.
   (B)   Before taking any such action the City Commission as such Zoning
Appeal Board shall hold a public hearing thereon, at least ten days notice of
the time and place of which shall be given to the appellant by mail at the
address specified by the appellant in his appeal petition. In the event the
Board of Appeals decides to authorize a building permit and erection, it shall
have the power to specify the exact location, ground area, height and other
details and conditions of size, character and construction and also the
duration of the building, structure or part thereof to be permitted.

public grounds shown on any plat certified and adopted as hereinbefore provided
may for convenience be shown, wholly or in part, by appropriate symbols on any
official map or other map of the city, provided that showing such lines on any
map shall not in and of itself constitute or be deemed to constitute the
opening or establishment of any street or the taking or acceptance of any land
for any of the aforesaid purposes.

a water loop system when deemed advisable by the City Engineer and City Water
Department.

§ 153.07 DIGITAL STANDARD.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. More businesses desire to utilize advancements in
technology which permit signs to change copy electronically (e.g., utilizing an
LED type of sign). These newer technologies pose additional risks of impacting
adjacent areas and adversely dominating the environment in which they operate
unless regulated in a reasonable fashion. The intent of this section is to
establish operating standards and regulations for signs which utilize these
newer technologies in order to minimize the secondary effects that often
accompany the unregulated display of digital signs, preserve the character and
repose of adjacent areas (with a principal focus on residential neighborhoods),
protect property values, and reduce traffic hazards caused by undue
distractions.
   (B)   Display.
      (1)   Electronic message boards shall be permitted provided they meet the
requirements for illumination and message display as delineated in
Chapter 155 of the City Ordinances.
      (2)   A digital sign may not allow the display or message to change more
frequently than once every eight seconds, with a transition period of one
second or less. Any electronic message boards that are placed adjacent to
residential properties may only switch from one message to another by fading in
and out.
      (3)   A digital sign must have installed an ambient light monitor, which
shall continuously monitor and automatically adjust the brightness level of the
display based on ambient light conditions consistent with the terms of this
chapter.
      (4)   The maximum brightness levels for all digital signs shall not
exceed 0.1 footcandles over ambient light levels measured within 150 feet of
the source, consistent with terms of this section. Certification must be
provided to the city demonstrating that the sign has been preset to
automatically adjust the brightness to these levels or lower. Re-inspection and
recalibration may be periodically required by the city in its reasonable
discretion, at the owner's expense, to ensure that the specified brightness
levels are maintained at all times.
      (5)   Brightness of digital signs shall be measured as follows:
         (a)   At least 30 minutes following sunset, a foot candle meter shall
be used to obtain an ambient light reading for the location. This done while
the sign is off or displaying black copy. The reading shall be made with the
meter aimed directly at the sign area at the pre-set location.
         (b)   The sign shall then be turned on to full white copy to take
another reading with the meter at the same location.
         (c)   If the difference between the readings is 0.1 foot candles or
less, the brightness is properly adjusted.
      (6)   Other requirements.
         (a)   Any digital message board that will be located within 150 feet
of a residential structure must be a freestanding, monument sign not exceeding
eight feet in height.
         (b)   The use, size and location of digital signs must comply with all
other relevant regulations and ordinances of the city.
(Ord. 617, passed 1-27-2014; Am. Ord. 675, passed 5-22-2023)
§ 153.08 PROHIBITED SIGNS.

to the platting of land under the laws of the state, and to provide for the
orderly growth and harmonious development of the city, consistent with the
Community Development Plan and the Zoning Code; to secure adequate traffic
circulation through coordinated street systems so as to lessen congestion on
the streets and highways; to insure adequate provisions for water, drainage and
sanitary sewer facilities, and other health requirements; to achieve the safety

Clerk or other designated official accomplishing the approved land division or
transfer.
      (4)   The City Assessor or designee shall maintain an official record of
all approved and accomplished land divisions or transfers.
   (C)   Standards for approval of land divisions. A proposed land division
shall be approved if the following criteria are met:

fully comply with the applicable lot (parcel), yard and area requirements of
the city zoning ordinance, including, but not limited to, minimum lot (parcel)
frontage/width, minimum road frontage, minimum lot (parcel) area, minimum lot
depth to width ratio, maximum lot (parcel) coverage and minimum setbacks for
existing buildings/structures;
      (2)   The proposed land division(s) comply with all requirements of the
State Land Division Act and this chapter;
      (3)   All parcels created and remaining have existing adequate
accessibility, or an area available therefor, to a public road for public
utilities and emergency and other vehicles not less than the requirements of
the applicable zoning ordinance, major thoroughfare plan, road ordinance or
this chapter. In determining adequacy of accessibility, any ordinance standards
applicable to plats shall also apply as a minimum standard whenever a parcel or
tract is proposed to be divided to create one or more parcels.
      (4)   The ratio of depth to width of any parcel created by the division
does not exceed a four to one ratio exclusive of access roads, easements, or
nonbuildable parcels created under this chapter and parcels added to contiguous
parcels that result in all involved parcels complying with said ratio. The
permissible depth of a parcel created by a land division shall be measured
within the boundaries of each parcel from the abutting road right-of-way to the
most remote boundary line point of the parcel from the point of commencement of
the measurement. The permissible minimum width shall be as defined in the
applicable zoning ordinance.
      (5)   Satisfactory evidence of the suitability of each proposed land
division for on-site sewage disposal and a potable on-site water supply is
provided from the Mid-Michigan Health Department or State Department of
Environmental Quality unless public water and sewer service is available to the
site.
   (D)   Allowance for approval of other land divisions. Notwithstanding
disqualification from approval pursuant to this chapter, a proposed land
division which does not fully comply with the applicable lot, yard,
accessibility and area requirements of the applicable zoning ordinance or this
chapter may be approved in any of the following circumstances:
      (1)   Where the applicant executes and records an affidavit or deed
restriction with the County Register of Deeds, in a form acceptable to the
city, designating the parcel as not buildable. Any such parcel shall also be
designated as not buildable in the city records and shall not, thereafter, be
the subject of a request to the Zoning Board of Appeals for variance relief
from the applicable lot and/or area requirements and shall not be developed
with any building or above ground structure exceeding four feet in height and
shall not be used for human habitation;
      (2)   Where, in circumstances not covered by subsection (1) above, the
Zoning Board of Appeals has, previous to this chapter, granted a variance from
the lot, yard, depth to width ratio, frontage and/or area requirements with
which the parcel failed to comply;
      (3)   Where the proposed land division involves only the minor adjustment
of a common boundary line or involves a conveyance between adjoining properties
which does not result in either parcel violating this chapter, any applicable
zoning ordinance or the State Land Division Act.
   (E)   Consequences of noncompliance with land division approval requirement.
Any parcel created in noncompliance with this chapter shall not be eligible for
any building permits or zoning approvals, such as special land use approval or
site plan approval, and shall not be recognized as a separate parcel on the
assessment roll. In addition, violation of this chapter shall subject the
violator to the penalties and enforcement actions set forth in §
154.99 and as may otherwise be provided by law.

forwarded to the City Commission until the conditions have been satisfied by
the proprietor. The revised preliminary plat shall be marked a revision and
shall follow the filing procedure set forth in this chapter.

§ 154.49 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   It is the purpose of this section to establish and define the public
improvements which will be required to be provided by the proprietor as
conditions for final plat approval.
   (A)   All water, sanitary sewer, storm drainage, street and sidewalk
improvements shall comply with the city’s engineering and construction
standards.
   (B)   (1)   Accessible public drainage system. Where a storm drain is
reasonably accessible, each lot within the subdivided area shall be provided
with a connection thereto. All connections shall be subject to the approval of
the City Engineer and all materials used in such system shall be subject to
current city specifications.
      (2)   Non-accessible public drainage system. In the event that a public
storm drain is not reasonably accessible to the subdivision, the subdivider
shall pay the cost of extending the storm sewer lines from the area platted to
the nearest public storm sewer trunk of adequate size to carry additional flow.
In addition, the subdivider shall install public storm drain facilities within
the platted area in accordance with the current city specifications.
      (3)   Existing trees near street rights-of-way shall be preserved by the
subdivider. Street trees from the varieties listed in the city specifications

(Ord. 509, passed 4-22-2002)
§ 154.50 GUARANTEE OF COMPLETION OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   The developer shall be responsible for the provision of all required
improvements to the subdivision. The final plat should not be submitted until
all of the required improvements within the plat have been completed according
to plans and specifications as set forth herein or until satisfactory
arrangements have been made to complete them.
   (B)   This may be accomplished by either the full installation of all
required improvements by the developer at the time that the final plat is
forwarded to the City Commission with a recommendation of approval by the
Planning Commission or by the provision of a financial guarantee of performance
in the following manner.
      (1)   Performance guarantee.
         (a)   Any requests made of the City Commission to accept a performance
guarantee deposit in lieu of completing all required improvements prior to
having the City Commission approve the final plat shall be confirmed in writing
and shall be accompanied by an estimate of costs of the remaining required
improvements. This estimate shall be furnished by the proprietor’s engineer. It
shall be complete in all respects, including estimated quantities and unit
prices, and bear the engineer’s seal of registration. If approved by the City
Commission, this estimate will provide the basis for the amount of performance
deposit and written agreement. Generally, the amount of performance guarantee
deposit required will be equal to 100% of the proprietor’s engineer’s estimate,
following review by the City Engineer’s estimate and agreement, plus 25% of
such estimate for contingencies. The agreement may further stipulate that the
deposit shall be rebated to the proprietor, or an appropriate reduction in the
security, in the amounts equal to the cost of completed units of work
stipulated in the agreement prepared pursuant to this section and satisfactory
accomplishment of the construction milestones noted therein. The performance
guarantee shall either be a cash deposit or a certified check or an irrevocable
letter of credit deposited by the subdivider with the City Treasurer or a
responsible escrow agent or trust company, subject to the approval of the City
Commission and the City Attorney.
         (b)   Further, the agreement will be so written that any part of the
performance deposit, as required, may be used to reimburse the city for costs
incurred in connection with the examination and inspection of the required
improvements.
         (c)   In the event the developer shall in any case fail to complete
such work within such period, as required by the conditions of the guarantee,
the city shall have such work completed. In order to reimburse itself for the
cost expense thereof, the City Commission may appropriate from the deposit
which the subdivider deposits in lieu of the required improvements.
      (2)   Maintenance bond. Prior to acceptance by the city of required
improvements, a one year maintenance bond in an amount set by the City
Commission shall be posted by the subdivider.
      (3)   Inspections.
         (a)   City staff or their designees shall provide construction
inspection of all required improvements on a continuous basis as outlined in
the city’s engineering and construction standards. In no case shall the same
engineer provide services to both the city and the subdivider.
         (b)   It shall be the responsibility of the improvements contractors
to notify the office of the City Manager at least days in advance for the
following periodic inspections:
            1.   Storm and sanitary sewers, water lines, mains, laterals, and
catch basins before the trenches are backfilled;
            2.   Forms set for curb and cutter sub-base has been put in place
and before the concrete is poured;
            3.   Forms set for sidewalks before any concrete is poured;
            4.   All subgrade that has been shaped and rolled, before
compaction test is made;
            5.   Forms for pavement before any concrete is poured;
            6.   All base courses.
         (c)   No work covered by the bond shall be accepted or bonds released
until these inspections have been made and work found satisfactory.
         (d)   The agreement to install required public improvements shall also
provide for the checking of improvement plans and continuous inspections of all
improvements by the city and for costs of said services which shall be borne by
the subdivider.

writing to the Planning Commission and be accompanied by a sketch drawn to
scale showing the original lot, the proposed division, all pertinent dimensions
and the proposed legal descriptions.

Code and shall not have the effect of increasing the number of buildable lots
in a subdivision. This provision shall not apply to nonresidential
subdivisions.
      (3)   Maximum number of divisions. The proposed divisions will not result
in the division of a platted lot into more than four parts.

of 18 feet or such other treatment as may be adequate for protection of
residential properties or with side lot lines parallel to the major traffic
streets.
   (D)   Uninhabitable lots. Lots located wholly within the floodplain or lots
deemed by the City Commission to be uninhabitable shall not be platted for
residential occupancy, nor for such other purposes as may increase danger to
health, life or property or aggravate the flood hazard, but such land within
the plat shall be set aside for such uses as shall not produce unsatisfactory
living conditions.
   (E)   Lot remnants. All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after
platting of a larger tract shall be added to adjacent lots rather than allowed
to remain as unusable parcels.
   (F)   Modifications. Variations, exceptions, and/or modifications of these
design requirements may be made by the Planning Commission in specific cases
where it is determined that unusual topographical conditions or other physical
conditions justify such modifications.
(Ord. 509, passed 4-22-2002)

chapter or any continuance of any such violation. Any sale of lands subdivided
in violation of the provisions of this chapter shall be voidable at the option
of the purchaser thereof and shall subject the seller thereof to the forfeiture
of any and all consideration received or pledged therefore, together with any
damages sustained by said purchaser thereof, recoverable in an action at law.

location of land in order to maximize economic benefit for the community as a
whole.

determination. Any party aggrieved by an adverse decision by the City Zoning
Administrator may appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals, which board shall make
the determination, with findings, without reference to the standards for the
granting of variances. The determination of compatibility shall be based upon
the character, design and appearance of residential dwellings located outside
of mobile home parks within 300 feet of the subject dwelling where such area is
developed with dwellings to the extent of not less than 20% of the lots
situated within said area; or where said area is not so developed, by the
character, design, and appearance of the residential dwellings generally found
throughout the city. The determination of compatibility shall also be based
upon compliance with the following standards:

comparable to the overhang and pitch of homes typically found in the
neighborhood in which it is to be located.
      (2)   The dwelling shall have a chimney that is constructed of a material
and style similar to those of other dwellings typically found in the
neighborhood in which it is to be located.
      (3)   The dwelling shall have steps and/or porches which provide access
to exterior doors, which are permanently attached to the ground and to the
structure, and which are comparable to steps and/or porches of homes typically
found in the neighborhood in which it is located.
      (4)   The dwelling and roof shall be covered with a material which is in
composition, comparable to those typically found in the neighborhood in which
it is to be located.
      (5)   The dwelling shall have windows located on the front sides, and
exterior doors either on the front and rear or front and side as generally
found in homes in the neighborhood in which it is to be located.
      (6)   The orientation of the dwelling's front entrance shall be similar
to the orientation of homes in the neighborhood in which it is located.
      (7)   A dwelling may be approved as aesthetically compatible in design
and appearance to homes in the neighborhood in which it is to be located, even
if all of the above conditions do not exist, provided it is determined that the
dwelling and/or its site has other design features which make it aesthetically
compatible to homes in the district. The foregoing shall not be construed to
prohibit innovative design concepts involving such matters as energy conscious
devices such as solar energy, view, unique land contour or relief from the
common or standard designed home.

§ 155.191 EXTERIOR/INTERIOR LIGHTING.
   (A)   Purpose. To require and set minimum standards for outdoor lighting to:
      (1)   Manage outdoor lighting so that its safety, security and economic
and aesthetic benefits are maintained while minimizing dangerous glare, energy
waste, light pollution and light trespass.
      (2)   Implement these principles of good lighting design by regulating
the shielding, height, illumination levels, and other aspects of outdoor
lighting so that residents may continue to enjoy the rural and residential
character of St. Johns.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   (a)   All uses of land or buildings within the city where there is
interior or exterior lighting that creates a nuisance or hazard as viewed from
outside, including, but not limited to, residential, commercial, industrial,
public and private recreational/sports and institutional uses, and sign,
billboard, architectural and landscape lighting. The following are regulated
activities and shall be regulated by this chapter to the entirety of the city
unless specifically exempted by this section:
         (b)   All zoning permits, subdivisions, site plans, and land
development applications.
      (2)   The following are exempt from this chapter:
         (a)   Temporary seasonal decorative lighting associated with single-
family dwellings is exempt from this chapter.
         (b)   Emergency lighting, as may be required by any public agency
while engaged in the performance of their duties, or for illumination of the
path of egress during an emergency, is exempt from the requirements of this
chapter.
         (c)   The requirements of this chapter shall not apply to outdoor
lighting installations operating before the effective date of this chapter,
except for any lighting installation that creates a safety hazard as deemed by
the city. Routine maintenance of these pre-existing outdoor lighting
installations shall not have to comply with the requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      (1)   FOOTCANDLE.  Unit of light density incident on a plane (assumed to
be horizontal unless otherwise specified), and measurable with an illuminance
meter, a.k.a. light meter.
      (2)   FULL CUTOFF.  Attribute of a lighting fixture where no more than
10% of the lamp's intensity is emitted at or above an angle ten degree below
that horizontal plane, at all lateral angles around the fixture.
      (3)   FULLY SHIELDED.  Attribute of a lighting fixture provided with
internal and/or external shields and louvers to prevent brightness from lamps,
reflectors, refractors and lenses from causing glare at normal viewing angles.
      (4)   GLARE.  Excessive brightness in the field of view that is
sufficiently greater than the brightness to which the eyes are adapted, to
cause annoyance or loss in visual performance and visibility, so as to
jeopardize health, safety or welfare.
      (5)   ILLUMINANCE.  Quantity of light, measured in footcandles.
      (6)   LIGHT TRESPASS.  Glare emitted by a lighting fixture or
installation, which is cast beyond the boundaries of the property on which the
lighting installation is sited.
      (7)   LUMEN.  As used in the context of this chapter, the light-output
rating of a lamp (light bulb).
   (D)   Performance criteria.
      (1)   Fixtures shall be of a type and design appropriate to the lighting
application and shall be aesthetically acceptable to the city.
      (2)   For the lighting of predominately horizontal surfaces such as, but
not limited to, parking areas, roadways, vehicular and pedestrian passage
areas, merchandising and storage areas, automotive-fuel dispensing facilities,
automotive sales areas, loading docks, cul-de-sacs, active and passive
recreational areas, building entrances, sidewalks, bicycle and pedestrian
paths, and side entrances, fixtures shall be aimed straight down and shall meet
full cutoff criteria.
      (3)   For the lighting of predominately non-horizontal surfaces such as,
but not limited to, stairways, facades, landscaping, signs, billboards,
fountains, displays and statuary, fixtures shall be fully shielded and shall be
installed and aimed so as to not project their output into the windows of
neighboring residences, adjacent uses, past the object being illuminated,
skyward or onto a public roadway.
   (E)   Control of nuisance and disabling glare.
      (1)   All lighting shall be aimed, located, designated, fitted and
maintained so as not to present a hazard to drivers or pedestrians by impairing
their ability to safely traverse and so as not to create a nuisance by
projecting or reflecting objectionable light onto a neighboring use or
property.
      (2)   Directional fixtures such as floodlights and spotlights shall be so
shielded, installed and aimed that they do not project their output into the
windows or neighboring residences, adjacent uses, past the object being
illuminated, skyward or onto a public roadway or pedestrian way. Floodlights,
when building, pole or otherwise installed above grade on residential
properties, except when motion-sensor actuated, shall not be aimed out more
than 45 degrees from straight down. When a floodlight creates glare as viewed
from an adjacent residential property, the floodlight shall be required to be
re-aimed and/or fitted with a shielding device to block the view of the glare
source from that property.
      (3)   "Barn lights", a.k.a. "dusk-to-dawn lights", when a source of glare
as viewed from an adjacent property, shall not be permitted unless effectively
shielded as viewed from that property.
      (4)   Lighting controlled by motion sensors/detectors. This type of
lighting is to be used to deter vandalism and theft and shall be placed in
locations where the sensors will not be tripped on a reoccurring basis and
shall be installed and/or aimed so that they do not project their output at
neighboring residences, adjacent uses, directly skyward or onto a roadway.
      (5)   Vegetation screens shall not be employed to serve as the primary
means for controlling glare. Rather, glare control shall be achieved primarily
through the use of such means as cutoff fixtures, shields and baffles, and
appropriate application of fixture mounting height, wattage, aiming angle and
fixture placement.
      (6)   The illumination projected from any use onto a residential use
shall at no time exceed 0.1 footcandle, measured line-of-sight from any point
on the receiving property.
      (7)   The illumination projected from any property onto a non-residential
use shall at no time exceed 1.0 footcandle, measured line-of-sight from any
point on the receiving property.
      (8)   Except as permitted for certain recreational lighting and permitted
elsewhere in this division, fixtures shall not be mounted in excess of 20 feet
above finished grade of the surface being illuminated. Mounting height shall be
defined as the distance from the finished grade of the surface being
illuminated to the optical center of the luminary. Where proposed parking lots
of 100 or more contiguous spaces, the city may, at its discretion, based
partially on mitigation of potential off-site impacts, allow a fixture mounting
height not to exceed 25 feet above finished grade.
      (9)   Under canopy lighting for such applications as gas/service
stations, hotel/theater marquees, fast-food/bank/drugstore drive-ups, shall be
accomplished using flat-lens, full cutoff fixtures aimed straight down and
shielded in such a manner that the lowest opaque edge of the fixture shall be
below the light source at all lateral angles. The average illumination in the
area directly below the canopy shall not exceed 20 footcandles and the maximum
shall not exceed 30 footcandles.
      (10)   The illumination projecting from any interior lighting fixture may
contribute to excessive glare. Windows, doors, skylights, and the like may be
required to be shielded with anti-glare window tint or other window covering as
approved by the city to reduce site illumination.
   (F)   Installation.
      (1)   Electrical feeds for lighting standards shall be run underground,
not overhead and shall be in accordance with the National Electrical Code (NEC)
Handbook.

NON-CONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
§ 155.230 PURPOSE.
   This chapter establishes separate districts, each of which is an appropriate
area for the location of specified types of buildings, structures, and uses. It
is necessary and consistent with the establishment of these districts that all
lawfully non-conforming buildings, structures, and uses be permitted to
continue only under specific controls. It is, further, necessary and consistent
with the establishment of these districts that certain non-conforming uses be
eliminated in accordance with applicable statutes. Therefore, it is the purpose
of the following sections to provide for the regulation of non-conforming
buildings, structures and uses.
(Ord. 616, passed 9-23-2013)
§ 155.231 NON-CONFORMING USE OF LAND OR BUILDING.
   Any lawful non-conforming use of land or building, may be continued, subject
to the following provisions.
(Ord. 616, passed 9-23-2013)
§ 155.232 EXPANSION.
   A non-conforming use of land or building shall not be in any way expanded or
extended either on the same or adjoining property or throughout the balance of
a building after the adoption of this Code or of any subsequent amendment
hereto which shall make such use of land or building nonconforming. However, in
a district where residences are prohibited, an existing single family or two
family use building may be permitted additions and structural alterations
providing:
   (A)   That such structural changes can be made only if in conformity with
all the regulations of use, height, area, yard, useable open space, and off-
street parking, as required in the R3 High Density Residential District.
   (B)   That no additional family units may be provided, and that there is no
intensification of occupancy as would constitute a rooming or boarding house.
   (C)   The floor area added shall not exceed 50% of the total floor area
existing in the dwelling at the time the dwelling became a legal non-conforming
use. Accessory garages up to 576 square feet in size may be constructed and not
count towards a portion of the 50% limitation.
   (D)   That such addition may not be made if a portion of the existing
dwelling has been converted to commercial or industrial use subsequent to the
date the dwelling became a legal non-conforming use.
   (E)   That the parcel to be so used is restricted to that existing as a
residential use at the time of affixing the prospective zoning district, or to
that parcel plus such subsequent consolidation as would bring the parcel up to,
or tending toward, in dimension and area, the minimum residential building site
parcel as specified in this chapter.
(Ord. 616, passed 9-23-2013; Am. Ord. 665, passed 12-13-2021)
§ 155.233 DISCONTINUANCE.
   If a non-conforming use of land or building is discontinued, it shall not
hereafter be re-established, and any subsequent use of the land or building
shall conform to the regulations of the district in which the land is located.
A non-conforming use of land or building shall be considered discontinued if
customary operations of that use are not pursued for 12 months.
(Ord. 616, passed 9-23-2013)
§ 155.234 CHANGE OF USE.
   (A)   The non-conforming use of land or building shall not be changed to any
other use except to a use permitted in the district in which the land is
located.
   (B)   Ordinary repair or alteration of structure housing a non-conforming
use.
   (C)   Ordinary repairs or incidental alterations to correct deterioration or
wear may be made providing no structural alterations or enlargement shall be
made except those required by law or ordinance. If the cost of such repairs
exceeds 60% of the cost of replacing the structure, the repairs may only be
made if the structure and use are brought into compliance with the chapter.
(Ord. 616, passed 9-23-2013)
§ 155.235 NON-CONFORMING BUILDINGS.
   Any building which does not conform to the regulations of the district in
which it is located may be continued subject to the provisions of this chapter.

   (A)   Expansion or structural alteration. A non-conforming structure may be
expanded or otherwise structurally altered as long as the change does not
increase the building's non-conformity.
   (B)   Ordinary repairs. Ordinary repairs or incidental alterations to
correct deterioration or wear may be made to non-conforming structures provided
the cost of such repairs do not exceed 60% of the cost of replacing the entire
structure, in which case the repairs may only be made if they result in the
structure complying with all zoning requirements.
(Ord. 616, passed 9-23-2013)
§ 155.236 RESTORATION OF DAMAGED STRUCTURES.
   (A)   A non-conforming building or a building housing a non-conforming use
which is partially destroyed in any manner, or from any cause whatsoever, may
be restored provided the cost of such restoration does not exceed 60% if a non-
conforming residential use, or if the cost of restoration does not exceed 50%
for all other non-conforming uses under this Code. No repairs or restoration
shall be undertaken, however, unless started within one year from the date of
the partial destruction and is diligently carried on to completion once
started. If the cost of restoration exceeds 60% of the cost of replacing the
entire structure in all other classifications, such structure, when restored,
shall comply with all provisions of the district in which it is located, except
that, if it is located on a lot with a smaller lot area, or a lesser width of
lot than is prescribed for the district in which it is located, including use
it need not comply with the provisions of that district for minimum lot area or
minimum width of lot but shall maintain as a minimum, the lot area and lot
width existing previous to the damage to the building or structure. Buildings
with non-conforming parking areas that require restoration in excess of 60% of
the replacement cost of the building must be built so that the parking complies
with the chapter.
   (B)   The determination of replacement cost shall be made by the Zoning
Administrator.

which complies with the requirements of this chapter may be continued for as
long as the premises are used in compliance with this chapter. Reconstruction
of buildings with non-conforming parking shall meet the requirements of §
155.234.
(Ord. 616, passed 9-23-2013)
§ 155.238 NON-CONFORMING, NON-RESIDENTIAL LOT.

§ 155.239 PRIOR CONSTRUCTION APPROVAL.
   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the completion of construction and
use of a non-conforming building for which a building permit has been issued as
provided for in §
155.193 "Construction or Contracts Under Permits Prior to this Chapter".
(Ord. 616, passed 9-23-2013)
§ 155.240 CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP, TENANCY OR MANAGEMENT.

Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the change of ownership, tenancy or
management of a non-conforming use, building or lot.
(Ord. 616, passed 9-23-2013)
SPECIAL USES AUTHORIZED BY SPECIAL USE PERMIT
§ 155.255 INTENT.
   The special use permit process is based on the concept that some uses are
appropriate in a zoning district only under certain circumstances and with
specific conditions. The special use permit review process allows the city to
review a proposed use, determine if it is appropriate in the location proposed
and what conditions are required to be placed on the use to ensure it's
compatibility with other uses in the area.
(Ord. 616, passed 9-23-2013)
§ 155.256 PRELIMINARY REVIEW.
   (A)   Prior to submission of a special use permit application to the
Planning Commission, an applicant shall submit a preliminary application for
the Zoning Administrator and other city staff to review. The purpose of this
preliminary review is to make the applicant aware of problems or concerns the
staff may have with the application before the applicant invests the time and
effort necessary to prepare a complete application. A preliminary application
consists of a preliminary site plan as identified in §§
155.275 through
155.282.
   (B)   Following their review of the application, the Zoning Administrator

(Ord. 616, passed 9-23-2013; Am. Ord. 657, passed 12-14-2020)
§ 155.281 STANDARDS FOR SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   (A)   All elements of the site plan shall be harmoniously and efficiently
organized in relation to topography, the size and type of plot, the character

shall be designed to prevent spill or discharges to the air, surface of the
ground, groundwater, streams, drains or wetlands. Secondary containment for
above ground storage of hazardous material shall be provided.
   (Q)   In approving the site plan, the Planning Commission may require a bond
or other financial guarantee acceptable to the city of ample sum be furnished
by the developer to ensure compliance for such requirements as drives, walks,
utilities, parking, landscaping and the like.

§ 155.282 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES.
   In the interest of insuring compliance with the Zoning Ordinance provisions,
protecting the natural resources and the health, safety and welfare of the
residents of the city of St. Johns and future users or inhabitants of an area
for which a site plan for a proposed use has been submitted, the City
Commission may require the applicant to deposit a performance guarantee as set
forth herein. Performance guarantees shall be required in instances where an
occupancy permit is requested prior to completion of all improvements on an
approved site plan. The purpose of the performance guarantee is to ensure
completion of improvements connected with the proposed use as required by this
chapter, including but not limited to roadways, lighting, utilities, sidewalks,
drainage, fences, screens, walls, landscaping, and widening strips.
   (A)   Performance guarantee as used herein shall mean a cash deposit,
certified check or irrevocable bank letter of credit in the amount of the
estimated cost of the improvements to be made as determined by the applicant
and verified by the Zoning Administrator.
   (B)   Where the city or the Planning Commission requires a performance
guarantee, it shall be deposited with the City Treasurer prior to the issuance
of a building permit. The city shall deposit the performance guarantee, if in
the form of a cash deposit or certified check, in an interest-bearing account.
   (C)   An approved site plan shall also prescribe the period of time within
which the improvements for which the performance guarantee has been required
are to be competed. The period will begin from the date of the issuance of the
building permit.
   (D)   In the event the performance guarantee deposited is a cash deposit or
certified check, the city shall rebate to the applicant 50% of the deposited
funds when 60% of the required improvements are completed as confirmed by the
Zoning Administrator, and the remaining 50% of the deposit funds when 100% of
the required improvements are completed as confirmed by the Zoning
Administrator. If a request is made by the applicant for a temporary
certificate of occupancy without completion of required exterior improvements,
the performance guarantee may be applied by the applicant to assure compliance
with Zoning Ordinance standards and the specifications of the approved site
plan.
   (E)   Upon the satisfactory completion of the Improvements for which the
performance guarantee was required, as determined by the Zoning Administrator,
the Treasurer shall return to the applicant the performance guarantee deposited
and any interest earned thereon.
   (F)   In the event the applicant defaults in making the improvements for
which the performance guarantee was required within the time period established
by the city, the city shall have the right to use the performance guarantee
deposited and any interest earned thereon to complete the improvements through
contract or otherwise, including specifically the right to enter upon the
subject property to make the improvements. If the performance guarantee is not
sufficient to allow the city to complete the improvements for which it was
posted, the applicant shall be required to pay the city the amount by which the
costs of completing the improvements exceeds the amount of the performance
guarantee. Should the city use the performance guarantee or a portion thereof,
to complete the required improvements, any amount remaining after said
completion shall be applied first to the city's administrative costs in
completing the improvement with any balance remaining being refunded to the
applicant. If the applicant has been required to post a performance guarantee
or bond with another governmental agency other than the city to ensure
completion of an improvement associated with the proposed project prior to the
city's conditional approval, the applicant shall not be required to deposit
with the city a performance guarantee for that specific improvement. At the
time the performance guarantee is deposited with the city and prior to the
issuance of a building permit, the applicant shall enter an agreement
incorporating the provisions hereof with the city regarding the performance
guarantee.

   (A)   The requirements set forth in this subchapter shall apply to all lots,
sites, and parcels which are developed or expanded following the effective date
of this chapter that are subject to site plan review, as described in §
155.276. No site plan or land use shall be approved unless said site plan shall
show landscaping consistent with the provisions of this subchapter.
   (B)   The approving body for a site plan approval as described in §
155.276 (Zoning Administrator, Site Plan Review Committee, or Planning
Commission) may also determine that existing conditions of the parcel would
prevent development of required buffer zones, landscaping or green belts,
without causing negative impacts on neighboring properties. If such a
determination is made, the approving body may grant an exception from the
landscaping provisions of this subchapter.
   (C)   The following are minimum landscape standards and the city may require
additional landscaping based on individual circumstances. If applicable this
determination will be made during site plan review.

approving body may require additional landscaping to screen parking lots access
drives, loading zones, outdoor display areas, storage yards, or accessory
structures.
   (D)   Parking and storage.
      (1)   All loading and unloading areas which are visible from residential
districts or public thoroughfares, shall be screened by a vertical screen
consisting of structural or plant materials no less than six feet in height.
Screening shall be sufficient to contain blowing debris and screen the loading
and unloading areas from adjacent property owners.
      (2)   All storage areas (including areas for storage of refuse) shall be
screened on four sides by a fence or wall no less than six feet in height.
Three screened sides may be allowed with Planning Commission approval if the
applicant can demonstrate just cause. The fence or wall shall not allow light
to penetrate through it. The four sides screened shall be those sides where the
potential visual impact of the storage areas is greatest for adjacent property
owners.
   (E)   Buffer wall standards. Required walls shall comply with the standards
listed below.
      (1)   Walls shall be located on the lot line except where underground
utilities interfere and/or where this chapter requires conformance with yard
setback lines.
      (2)   Walls shall have no openings for vehicular traffic or other
purposes, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, unless specifically
approved by the City Commission.
      (3)   Walls shall be constructed of decorative concrete block, brick,
pressure treated wood, or comparable nonporous materials on the exterior sides
facing an affected district.
      (4)   Walls shall be durable, weather resistant, rustproof and easily
maintainable. Wood or wood products shall be high quality durable materials as
approved by the Building Inspector. Wood fences shall be sight obscuring
sufficient to shield light and block blowing debris. Masonry walls may be
constructed with openings which do not in any square section (height and width)
exceed 20% of the surface. Where walls are so pierced, the openings shall be so
spaced as to maintain the obscuring character required and shall not reduce
minimum height requirement.
      (5)   Walls must be maintained in good condition by the property owner.
      (6)   Curbing, bollards, or plant material shall be required where
parking is adjacent to walls. Bumper blocks shall not be permitted.
   (F)   Buffer berm standards. Required berms shall be constructed as
landscaped earth mounds with a crest area at least four feet in width. The
exterior face of the berm shall be constructed as an earthen slope. The
interior face of the berm may be constructed as an earthen slope or retained by
means of a wall, terrace or other means acceptable to the Building Department.
Whenever an earthen slope is provided, it shall be constructed with a slope not
to exceed one foot of vertical rise to three feet of horizontal distance (1:3).
Free form naturalistic contouring and berm shaping is encouraged.

interior of the parking area. Tree requirements may be adjusted based on review
by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Parking lot tree calculations and interior parking lot tree
requirements shall be rounded up.
   (C)   Tree base. Each tree shall be surrounded by an area of grass or living
ground cover at least 150 square feet in size and a minimum of eight feet wide
to provide for adequate resources of air and water. Tree plantings shall also
be protected from automobiles with curbing or other suitable device.
   (D)   Design of parking lot islands.
      (1)   All parking lot islands shall contain decorative material and be
curbed. Islands shall be at least 150 feet in area. Each island shall be at
least ten feet wide, with a depth two feet shorter than the depth of the
adjacent parking space.
      (2)   Islands shall have a minimum of ten feet radius at the ends facing

§ 155.299 STREET FRONTAGE LANDSCAPING.
   The intent of street frontage landscaping is to provide a consistent buffer
along vehicular corridors. A green belt shall be planted within or adjacent to
the right-of-way of any public street. If planting in the right-of-way is not
permitted by the road agency with jurisdiction in the right-of-way, or is not
acceptable to a utility company, the green belt plantings shall be planted
within the required setback. The approving body may allow such planting to be
placed anywhere within the front yard if there is no front yard parking. The
green belt shall meet the following standards.
   (A)   The green belt shall include only living materials and planting beds,
except for approved sidewalks, signs, driveways and essential services.
   (B)   Green belts shall include one deciduous canopy tree per 30 linear feet
of the frontage including any openings for driveways, sidewalks, or easements.
The approving body may waive this requirement for roadways where city
streetscape has been installed.
   (C)   Greenbelt trees should be arranged to simulate a natural setting such
as massing or staggered rows, except where a more formal arrangement is
determined to be more consistent with the existing character of the city.
   (D)   Landscaping materials arrangement shall ensure adequate site
visibility for motorists, adequate clearance for pedestrians and vehicles and
accessibility to fire hydrants. Refer to the visibility controls in §
155.188.
   (E)   Green belts shall be a minimum of eight foot wide. Trees shall not be
planted closer than four feet from pavement, curb or other structures.

CONDOMINIUMS
§ 155.320 INTENT.
   The intent of this subchapter is to regulate the division and development of
land under the Condominium Act (PA 59 of 1978) so that the development is
comparable in quality of design to property divided and developed by other
methods.
(Ord. 616, passed 9-23-2013)
§ 155.321 REVIEW REQUIREMENTS.
   In order to ensure compliance with this chapter, all condominium
developments shall go through the site plan review process, including
developments consisting solely of single family or duplex residences, that may
otherwise not be required to prepare a site plan. In addition to the
information required in §§
155.275 through
155.282, all applicants for condominium site plan review shall submit the
following information.
   (A)   A copy of the proposed condominium master deed.
   (B)   A copy of the proposed condominium subdivision plan (this may replace
the site plan normally required for site plan review).
   (C)   A copy of the proposed condominium by-laws.
(Ord. 616, passed 9-23-2013)
§ 155.322 ZONING CHAPTER STANDARDS.
   (A)   Lot size. In a conventional condominium development the entire site
must meet the minimum lot size requirements for the zoning district in which
the parcel is located. For site condominium developments, each condominium unit
and it's associated limited common area are considered equivalent to a "lot"
and must meet the minimum lot size requirements for the zoning district in
which the parcel is located.
   (B)   Setbacks. In conventional condominium development the buildings must
be setback from the site boundaries as required in the zoning district in which
the parcel is located, while the setback from other buildings must meet the
building setback requirements of the High Density Residential district (R-3).
For conventional condominium developments, the rear of the buildings must meet
the 35 feet minimum rear setback requirement regardless of location on the
parcel. For site condominium developments the setbacks shall be from the outer
edge of the "lot" consisting of a condominium unit and its associated limited
common area, and shall be consistent with the setbacks for principal structures
in the zoning district in which it is located.

of the subdivision if the angles points can be readily reestablished by
reference to monuments along the sidelines of the streets.
   (B)   All monuments used shall be made of solid iron or steel at least ½
inch in diameter and 36 inches long and completely encased in concrete at least
four inches in diameter.
   (C)   Monuments shall be located in the ground at all angles in the
boundaries of the site condominium; at the intersection lines of streets and at
the intersection of the lines of streets with the boundaries of the site
condominium and at the intersection of alleys with the boundaries of the site
condominium; at the points of curvature, points of reverse curvature and angle
points in the side lines of streets and alleys; and at all angles of an
intermediate traverse line.
   (D)   If the required location of a monument is in an inaccessible place, or
where the locating of a monument would be clearly impractical, it is sufficient
to place a reference monument nearby and the precise location thereof be
clearly indicated on the plat and referenced to the true point.
   (E)   If a point required to be monumented is on a bedrock outcropping, a
steel rod, at least ½ inch in diameter shall be drilled and grouted into solid

proprietor selects, in an amount not less than $100 per monument and not less
than $400 in total, except that lot corner markers shall be at the rate of not
less than $25 per markers. Such cash, certified check or irrevocable bank
letter of credit shall be returned to the proprietor upon receipt of a
certificate by a surveyor that the monuments and markers have been placed as
required within the time specified. If the proprietor defaults the city shall
promptly require a surveyor to locate the monuments and markers in the grounds
as certified on the subdivision plan, at a cost not to exceed the amount of the
security deposited and shall pay the surveyor.

OFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING/UNLOADING AREA REQUIREMENTS
§ 155.340 OFF-STREET PARKING GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Parking spaces required. Parking spaces shall be provided and
adequately maintained in all applicable zoning districts, except within the
parking exemption zone, for the off-street storage of motor vehicles for the
use of occupants, employees, and patrons of each building and premise, and of
such extensions, alterations, additions or changes in use of such building or
premise as specified in §
155.342. These spaces shall be provided in amounts not less than hereinafter
specified which shall not subsequently be reduced below the requirements of
this chapter.
   (B)   Loading spaces not parking spaces. Loading space as required in §
155.344 shall not be construed as supplying required off-street parking space.
   (C)   Existing parking. Existing off-street parking facilities provided on
the effective date of this code and actually being used at that date for the
parking of automobiles in connection with the operation of an existing building
or use shall not hereafter be reduced below, or if already less than, shall not
be further reduced below the requirements of this chapter for a similar new
building or use.
   (D)   Change in requirements. Whenever after the effective date of this code
there is any change in use or any increase in number of employees, or an
increase in floor area, or in any other unit of measurement specified in §
155.342, additional off-street parking facilities shall be provided on the
basis of resultant change.
   (E)   Joint use and mixed use developments. The joint use of parking
facilities by two or more uses, including mixed uses on the same lot, is
recommended whenever such use is practicable and satisfactory to each of the
uses intended to be served, and when all requirements for location, design and
construction can be satisfied.
      (1)   In computing the minimum parking requirements of any joint use
parking lot, or parking lot for a mixed use development, the total spaces
provided shall not be less than 50% of the off-street parking facilities
required of the uses computed separately.
      (2)   A copy of an agreement among joint users shall be filed with the
application for a zoning permit. The agreement shall include a guarantee for
continued use of the parking facility for each party to the joint use.
   (F)   Floor area. For the purpose of §
155.342, the unqualified term "floor area" shall mean the sum of the gross
horizontal areas of the several floors of a building used or intended to be
used for office, merchandising or services to the public as customers, patrons,
clients, patients or tenants, including areas occupied for fixtures and
equipment used for display or sale of merchandise, but excluding floor areas
which are used exclusively for storage, for housing of mechanical equipment
integral with the building, for maintenance facilities, or for those areas so
restricted that customers, patients, clients, salesmen, and the general public
are denied access.
   (G)   Uses not mentioned. In the case of a use not specifically mentioned,
requirements for off-street parking for a use which is mentioned and which is
most similar to the use not mentioned shall apply, as may be determined by the
Zoning Administrator.
   (H)   Parking facilities allocated once. Off-street parking facilities for
one use shall not be considered as providing required parking facilities for
any other use except as specified in division (F) of this section for joint
use.
   (I)   Fractional spaces. When determination of the number of off-street
parking space required by this chapter results in a requirement of a fractional
space, any fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one parking
space.
   (J)   Location of parking areas. Off-street parking areas shall be located,
in relation to the use they are intended to serve:
      (1)   On the same or an adjoining lot or parcel of land.
      (2)   For industrial uses only on the same or an adjoining lot or parcel
of land, except that an area for joint operation of parking facilities shall be
located within desirable walking distance of the joint users' operations.
      (3)   In the parking reduction zone described in §
155.342(D), parking for a use may be located on a separate lot, up to 1,000
feet away from the use in question, if approved by the Planning Commission
based on the following criteria:
         (a)   Public right-of-way shall not be used to meet a minimum parking
requirement, and shall not be considered to meet the requirements of this
section.
         (b)   The owner of the land use utilizing the parking must own or
lease the parking spaces in question. In the event of a lease, the terms of the
lease must be submitted to the city and the lease must include language
granting the user of the parking spaces an easement over the parking spaces and
exclusive use of them. The easement shall not be revoked without approval of
the city; the lease shall explicitly state such.
         (c)   In the event that off-site parking that has been used to meet a
minimum parking requirement is no longer available to the land use in question,
the owner of the land use shall be required to make payment-in-lieu of parking,
as described in §
155.342(D)(1)(c)3. for all spaces lost, up to the minimum requirement of this
subchapter (as calculated for the parking reduction zone).
   (K)   Use of parking spaces. No required parking spaces shall be used for
storage of material, refuse, refuse containers, display of merchandise,
including vehicles, or for the repair or servicing of machinery.
   (L)   Barrier free parking spaces. Barrier free parking shall be provided in
accordance with the current standards and rules of the Michigan Department of
Labor, Construction Code Commission, Barrier Free Design Division.
   (M)   Off-street parking spaces shall not be built within a road or street
right-of-way.

§ 155.341 OFF-STREET PARKING REGULATIONS WITHIN A RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.
   (A)   Intent. These off-street parking regulations have been adopted to
improve safety, traffic circulation and aesthetics within residential districts
in the city. They are intended to regulate parking patterns and the location
and quality of parking areas in residential areas over the long term. It is not
the intent of these regulations to regulate temporary, infrequent and irregular
occurrences.
   (B)   All residential buildings or non-residential buildings in a
residential district shall be provided with required parking areas on the same
lot with the building or on a lot immediately adjacent to the lot with the
building intended to be served, but not more than 100 feet from the building it
is servicing.
   (C)   No repairing, modifying, or operations shall be allowed upon any
vehicle, otherwise properly parked on a residential property, for a period in
excess of 24 hours, except within fully enclosed buildings or if it is
determined that such repair, modification, or operation will not constitute a
nuisance or annoyance to adjoining property owners or occupants. Any such work
within any 24-hour period allowed under this provision shall not, however,
consist of any major repair, redesigning, modifying, or dismantling work but
only such occasional minor work as may he required to maintain a vehicle in
normal operating condition.
   (D)   In the event the foregoing regulations create any special hardship
beyond the control of a particular resident, the Zoning Administrator is hereby
given the authority to grant permission to an applicant to operate contrary to
the provisions hereof for a limited period of time not to exceed 14 days.
   (E)   Required parking areas, including driveways, shall be constructed from
materials that provide a hard surface (concrete, asphalt, or permeable pavement
material), shall be drained properly, and shall be maintained in a safe and
usable condition. Other hard surfaces, including, but not limited to, turf
pavers, paving stones, and open concrete grids, may be used with prior approval
from the Zoning Administrator. Gravel, dirt, crushed aggregate, and other non-
pavement surfaces shall not be permitted for required parking areas.
   (F)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.

   (C)   Parking exemption zone. The parking exemption zone is hereby
established, and shall be designated on the official City of St. Johns zoning
map. The purpose of the parking exemption zone shall be to maintain the
historic, walkable character of St. Johns, and recognize the public investment
in on-street and other public parking, by eliminating most parking requirements
within its boundaries.
      (1)   Within the parking exemption zone, there shall be no minimum
parking requirement for any land use, except that any lot containing ten or
more dwelling units must provide 1.15 off-street parking spaces per dwelling
unit.
      (2)   The City Commission, upon recommendation from the Planning
Commission and following the procedure in §§
155.385 -
155.389, may add a lot or group of lots to the parking exemption zone. In
making a recommendation to the City Commission, the Planning Commission shall
consider the following:
         (a)   The lot, or group of lots, must be adjacent to the existing
parking exemption zone.
         (b)   The lot, or group of lots, must be either developed with a
walkable, historic character similar to the core of St. Johns, or be subject to
a development proposal that would construct infill development with a similar
walkable, historic character to the existing core.
         (c)   Approving the expansion of the parking exemption zone shall not
place a burden on existing public or private on-street and off-street parking
spaces. In reviewing this criteria, the Planning Commission shall determine
where the residents, employees, and/or customers of the newly exempt lots would
park, and whether those parking areas have sufficient capacity.
         (d)   Approving the expansion of the parking exemption zone must
affirmatively further the goals of the City of St. Johns master plan, downtown
plan, or both.
   (D)   Parking reduction zone. The parking reduction zone is hereby
established, and shall be designated on the official City of St. Johns zoning
map. The purpose of the parking exemption zone shall be to recognize the
walkable character of the immediate surroundings of downtown St. Johns, and to
allow investment and development in that area without the need for large
parking areas which create hazards to walkability and harm economic vitality.
However, the parking reduction zone acknowledges the need for automobiles for
personal mobility, and therefore the need to require parking, even at a reduced
level compared to the base requirements of this subchapter.
      (1)   Within the parking exemption zone, the minimum parking requirements
shall be as follows. These requirements shall supersede the requirements in
division (B) above.
         (a)   Residential uses. 1.25 parking spaces per dwelling unit. This
may be reduced to 1.15 parking spaces per dwelling unit using the automatic
reductions in division (c) below.
         (b)   Non-residential uses. 85% of the minimum parking requirement as
described in division (B) above. This may be reduced to 75% of the minimum
parking requirement as described in division (B) above using the automatic
reductions in division (c) below.
         (c)   Automatic reductions. The following shall automatically reduce
the parking requirement as described in divisions (a) and (b) above.
            1.   Provision of bicycle parking. The minimum automobile parking
requirement shall be reduced by one space for every five spaces made available
for secured, on-site parking of bicycles.
            2.   "15 minute" spaces. For non-residential uses only, parking
spaces designated with a time of limit of 15 minutes or less shall each count
as 1.5 spaces towards the minimum parking requirement. Reserving spaces for
curbside pickup, ride sharing, and other short-term parking occupancy reduces
the overall parking need, and therefore qualifies for a reduction under this
subchapter.
            3.   Payment in lieu of parking. At the time of site plan approval,
an applicant may make payment to the city in lieu of providing parking. The
required fee per parking space removed from the minimum requirement shall be
set by the City Council by resolution. The city shall set aside all funds
received from payments in lieu of parking for improvements to the public
parking system, both on-street and off-street, in and around downtown St.
Johns.
      (2)   The City Commission, upon recommendation from the Planning
Commission and following the procedure in §§
155.385 -
155.389, may add a lot or group of lots to the parking reduction zone. In
making a recommendation to the City Commission, the Planning Commission shall
consider the following:
         (a)   The lot, or group of lots, must be adjacent to the existing
parking reduction zone.
         (b)   The lot, or group of lots, must be either developed with a
walkable, historic character similar to the core of St. Johns, or be subject to
a development proposal that would construct infill development with a similar
walkable, historic character to the existing core. In the context of the
parking reduction zone, the "walkable, historic character" shall include the
close-in neighborhoods of the city, which include single family homes and small
multi-family residential laid out in a grid pattern on small lots.
         (c)   Approving the expansion of the parking reduction zone shall not
place a burden on existing public or private on-street and off-street parking
spaces. In reviewing this criteria, the Planning Commission shall determine
whether the reductions included in the parking reduction zone would create
overflow parking needs, and how those overflow needs would impact other parking
areas in the vicinity.
         (d)   Approving the expansion of the parking reduction zone must
affirmatively further the goals of the City of St. Johns master plan, downtown
plan, or both.

the parking area may be used as required.
   (I)   Curb blocks are prohibited.
   (J)   Electric vehicle chargers. Electric vehicle chargers are permitted in
all parking lots, and are not subject to the regulations in §§
155.184 and
155.189 regarding accessory structures. No electric vehicle charger shall be
designed or located in such a way as to reduce the dimensions of a parking
space or drive aisle below the minimums established in this section, nor shall
any electric vehicle charger be designed or located to reduce the number of
parking spaces in a lot below the minimums established in this subchapter.
   (K)   Driveway approaches (between the sidewalk and the road) shall be
constructed from materials that provide a hard surface (concrete, asphalt, or
permeable pavement material), shall be drained properly, and shall be
maintained in a safe and usable condition. For any property with a driveway
approach that does not meet this requirement, the driveway shall be upgraded to
the required material at the time of zoning approval for any site improvement
that adds pavement or buildings, or any other improvement that requires site
plan approval (administrative, committee, or Planning Commission).

(Ord. 616, passed 9-23-2013)
§ 155.368 INTERPRETATION OF ZONING CHAPTER AND MAP.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals, upon proper application of appeal, shall have
the power to hear and decide upon appeals for the interpretation of the
provisions of this chapter as follows:
   (A)   So as to carry out the intent and purpose of this chapter.
   (B)   To determine the precise location of the boundary lines between zoning
districts. In interpreting the boundaries of zoning districts, the Board shall
assume, unless there is information indicating otherwise, that zoning district
boundaries follow lot lines, the centerline of creeks, streets, or alleys,
railroad right-of-ways, section lines one-quarter or one-eight section lines,
or corporate boundary lines as they existed when the zoning boundary line was
established.
   (C)   The Board shall have the authority to interpret the provisions of this
chapter when a requirement, standard, or other text is unclear, including
classifying a use which is not specifically mentioned as part of the use
regulations of any zoning district so that it conforms to a comparable
permitted or prohibited use, in accordance with the purpose and intent of each
district. When determining if a particular use is included in the definition of
a type or group of uses permitted in a district, it shall not interpret a use
specifically listed in one district as being inferred as permitted in another
district.
(Ord. 616, passed 9-23-2013)
§ 155.369 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Intent. These variance review procedures are instituted to provide an
opportunity for the relaxation of the terms of the Zoning Chapter through a
non-use variance, where such variance will not be contrary to the public
interest and where, owing to conditions peculiar to the property and not the
result of the actions of the applicant, or his or her predecessors in title, a
literal enforcement of the chapter would result in practical difficulty. As
used in this chapter, a variance is authorized only for dimensional
requirements such as height, area, and size of structure, or size of yards and
open spaces and for non-use requirements such as parking and landscape
requirements. The establishment or expansion of a use otherwise prohibited
shall not be allowed by use variance, nor shall a use variance be granted
because of the presence of non-conformities in the Zoning District or uses in
an adjoining Zoning District.
   (B)   Approval. The Board shall approve with or without conditions, or
disapprove the non-use variance application and shall communicate its action in
writing to the applicant and the City Commission shall not approve an
application for a non-use variance unless it has found positively that all of
the following standards for approval have been met:
      (1)   That compliance of the strict letter of the chapter would
unreasonably present the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose
or would render conformity with such restrictions unnecessarily burdensome;
      (2)   That a grant of the variance applied for would do substantial
justice to the applicant as well as to other property owners in the district,
and that a lesser relaxation than that applied for would give substantial
relief to the owner of the property involved and be more consistent with
justice to other property owners;
      (3)   That the plight of the landowner is due to the unique circumstances
of the property;
      (4)   That the problem is not self-created.
      (5)   In granting a non-use variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
ensure that the spirit of the chapter is observed, public safety secured, and
substantial justice done.
(Ord. 616, passed 9-23-2013)
§ 155.370 RULES FOR GRANTING OF VARIANCES.
   The following rules shall be applied in the granting of variances:
   (A)   In granting a variance, the Board may specify, in writing, to the
applicant such conditions in connection with the granting, that will, in its
judgement, secure substantially the objectives of the regulations or provisions
to which such variance applies. The breach of any such conditions shall
automatically invalidate the permit granted.
   (B)   Each variance granted shall become null and void unless the provisions
of the variance have been utilized by an applicant within 12 months after the
granting of the variance.
   (C)   No application for a variance which has been denied wholly or in part
by the Board shall be resubmitted for a period of one year, from the date of
the last denial, except on grounds and newly discovered evidence or proof of
changed conditions found upon inspection by the Board to be valid.
   (D)   In authorizing any variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals may require
that a bond be furnished to insure compliance with the requirements,
specifications and conditions imposed with the grant of variance.
   (E)   The granting of use variances shall be prohibited.
(Ord. 616, passed 9-23-2013)
§ 155.371 REMOVAL.
   (A)   Zoning Board of Appeals member shall disqualify himself or herself
from a vote in which that member has a conflict of interest. Failure to do so
shall constitute misconduct.
   (B)   A member of the Zoning Board of Appeals may be removed by the City
Commission for misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office upon written
charges and after a public hearing.
