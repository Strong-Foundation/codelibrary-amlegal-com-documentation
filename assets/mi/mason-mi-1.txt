PREFACE
This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of
the City of Mason, Michigan.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances
adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the
history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a
note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with
the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the
back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included
herein.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order,
and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate
usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to
relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations
and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of
this Code.
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system
used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of
two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter
number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section
within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and
the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is
identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted
in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example,
if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between
sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered
6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in
the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the
subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article
embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new
article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved
chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of
chapters is maintained when including new chapters.
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to
the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of
the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the
page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an
appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates
the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of
ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their
corresponding prefixes:
 
CODE                       CD1:1
CODE APPENDIX              CDA:1
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE     CCT:1
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLES SLT:1
CODE INDEX                 CDi:1
 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has
been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay
phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language
generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous
cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct
the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and
supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication
will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly
edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for
the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the
holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become
the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to
the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all
such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them
and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical
reference purposes.
Acknowledgments

citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of
the city's affairs.

CHARTER OF MASON, MICHIGAN*
* Editors Note: Printed herein is the Charter of the City of Mason, Michigan,
as adopted by electors on June 26, 1951. Amendments are indicated by
parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a

purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state
statutes have been used. Such stylistic change includes printing of catchlines
in boldface type, abbreviation of the word "Section" in catchlines as "Sec.,"
placement of the catchline after the section number (rather than before it),
substitution of a period for a colon in the punctuation ending the catchline
and starting the text of the next section on a new line. Additions for clarity
are indicated by brackets.

highest number of votes shall be elected.
If at any special election to be held pursuant to Section 5.4. of this Chapter,
there are vacancies to be filled in offices having different unexpired terms,
the number of candidates equal to the number of vacancies in the offices having
the longer unexpired terms who shall receive the highest number of votes at
such election shall be elected to fill the vacancies in the offices having the
longer unexpired terms and candidates equal to the number of vacancies in the
offices having the shorter unexpired terms who receive the next highest number
of votes in order shall be elected to fill the vacancies in the offices having
the shorter unexpired terms.

made. Ownership, individually or in a fiduciary capacity, by an officer or
member of his family of securities, or of any beneficial interest in
securities, of any corporation with which a contract is made or which is a

contract, unless the aggregate amount of such securities, or interest in such
securities, so owned by such officer and the members of his family, shall
amount to ten per cent of all classes of the securities of such corporation
then outstanding.
(c)   A contract, in which an officer or member of his family has a financial
interest, may be made by the City if the members of the Council having no such
interest shall unanimously determine that the best interest of the City will be
served by the making of such contract and if either such contract is made after
competitive bidding or if the members of the Council having no such interest
shall unanimously determine that competitive bidding is not feasible in such
particular case.
(d)   Any officer who knowingly permits the City to enter into any contract in
which he has a financial interest without disclosing such interest to the
Council prior to the action of the Council in authorizing such contract, shall
be guilty of misconduct in office. Except in the instances specified in
paragraph (b) of this Section, the unanimous determination, by vote or written
instrument, of all members of the Council that, in a particular case, an
officer or member of his family will not have a financial interest in any
contract to be entered into by the City shall be final and conclusive, in the
absences of fraud or misrepresentation.

give any bail for any other person which may be required by the Charter or any
ordinance of the City. Any officer of the City who violates the provisions of

Council, which rate shall not exceed the greater of six per cent per year or
the interest rate on any special assessment bonds sold for such improvement
plus one percent (1%). Any person shall have the right to make advance payment
of such installment with interest only to the date of payment;
   (5)   For making additional pro rata assessments when any special assessment
roll proves insufficient to pay for the improvement for which it was levied and
the expenses incident thereto; provided, that the additional pro rata
assessment shall not exceed twenty-five per cent of the assessment, as

(Amendment of 8-5-2003; Amendment of 8-2-2005)
Sec. 11.4. Disposition of excessive special assessments.
In the event that any special assessment proves larger than theactual cost of
the improvement and expenses incidental thereto, such excess may be placed in
the general fund of the City if such excess is five per cent or less of the
assessment, but should the assessment prove larger than necessary by more than
five per cent, the entire excess shall be refunded on a pro rata basis to the
then owners of the property assessed. Such refund may be made by credit against
future unpaid installments to the extent such installments then exist, and the
balance of such refund shall be in cash. No refunds may be made which
contravene the provisions of any outstanding evidence of indebtedness secured
in whole or part by such special assessment.
Sec. 11.5. Correction of invalid special assessments.
Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of theCouncil, be invalid
by reason of irregularity or informality in the proceedings, or if any court of
competent jurisdiction shall adjudge such assessment be illegal, the Council
shall, whether the improvement has been made or not, or whether any part of the
assessments have been paid or not, have power to cause a new assessment to be
made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was made. All
proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall be
conducted in the same manner as provided for the original assessment, except
that it shall not again be necessary to prepare plans and estimates of cost,
nor to hold any hearing on the necessity of the improvement, unless and to the
extent that the cause of the irregularity arose in such proceedings. Whenever
any sum or part thereof, levied upon any property for the assessment so set
aside, has been paid and not refunded, the payment so made shall be applied
upon the reassessment, or, if the payments exceed the amount of the
reassessment, refunds shall be made in the manner prescribed in Section 11.4 of
this Charter.
No judgment or decree, nor any act of the Council, vacating a special
assessment shall destroy or impair the lien of the City upon the premises
assessed for such amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged against
the same had such charge been lawfully assessed thereupon in accordance with
the procedure established or authorized herein.
Sec. 11.6. Contested assessments.
No suit or action of any kind shall be instituted or maintained for the purpose
of contesting or enjoining the collection of any special assessment, (1)
unless, within thirty days after the confirmation of the special assessment
roll, written notice is given to the Council of intention to file such suit or
action, stating the ground on which it is claimed such assessment is illegal,
and (2) unless such suit or action shall be commenced within sixty days after
confirmation of the roll for such assessment.
Sec. 11.7. Collection of special assessments.
Upon the confirmation of each special assessment roll the special assessments
thereon shall become a debt to the City from the persons to whom they are
assessed and shall, until paid, be a lien upon the property assessed for the
amount of such assessment and all interest and charges thereon. Such lien shall
be of the same character and effect as created by this Charter for city taxes.
Such assessments shall become due upon confirmation of the special assessment
roll, except as may be provided by the Council pursuant to Section 11.3(3).
Each special assessment, or each installment of such assessment, when
installment payments are provided for, shall be collected by the Treasurer
without collection fee for a period ending on the last day of the second month
following the due date of such assessment or installment. On the first day of
the third month following each such due date the Treasurer shall add to all
assessments or installments paid thereafter a collection fee of four per cent
of the amount of the assessment. All collection fees shall belong to the City
and be collectible in the same manner as the collection fee on city taxes.
Special assessments, or installments thereof, which become due on July 1 of any
year shall be collected in all respects as are city taxes which are due on such
date, and, if uncollected on the following first day of March, shall be
returned to the County Treasurer with unpaid taxes as provided in Section 9.18.
Special assessments which become due other than on July 1 shall, if unpaid for
ninety days or more on April 1 of any year, be certified as delinquent to the
Council by the Treasurer and the Council shall order such delinquent
assessments to be placed on the tax roll of the City for that year, together
with accrued collection fees. Thereafter, the total amount of such assessment
and fees shall be collected in all respects as are city taxes due on July 1 of
that year, and such total amounts shall be subject to the same fees and
penalties as are city taxes due on that date, and, if uncollected on the
following first day of March, shall be returned to the County Treasurer with
unpaid taxes, as provided in Section 9.18.
Sec. 11.8. Special assessments accounts.
Except as otherwise provided in this Charter, moneys raised by special
assessment for any public improvement shall be segregated in a special fund or
account and may be used only to pay for the costs of the improvement for which
the assessment was levied, and expenses incidental thereto, and to repay any
money borrowed therefor together with interest which has accrued thereon.
Sec. 11.9. Assessments for sidewalks and abatement of hazards or nuisance.
The assessment for the cost of the construction or maintenance of any sidewalk,
or the abatement of any hazard or nuisance, to be made pursuant to Section
2.2(18) or Section
2.2(19) shall be made by resolution of the Council. Notice of the time at which
the Council will act thereon shall be given by publication, and sent by
registered mail to all property owners of the property, constituting or
creating such nuisance or hazard, as shown by the current tax roll of the City,
but failure of any owner to receive such notice shall not invalidate any such
assessment. For the purposes of collection of such assessment, the adoption of
such resolution shall be equivalent to the confirmation of a special assessment
roll. The amount of any such assessment shall become a debt due to the City
upon adoption of such resolution, be payable and subject to the collection
fees, and shall become a lien, all as provided in Section
11.7. 
Every such assessment shall also be subject to Section
11.5 and
11.6 of the Chapter.

Attorney and his opinion obtained with respect to its legality and form, and
unless the officer charged with maintenance of the City's accounting system
shall first have certified that sufficient funds are available or that an
appropriation has been made for the payment thereof. In the case of a contract
obligating the City for periodic payments in future fiscal years for the
furnishing of a continuing service or the leasing or purchase of property, such
certification need not cover payments on the contract which will be due in
future fiscal years, but this exception shall not apply to a contract for the
construction of a public improvement. A copy of all contracts requiring such
opinion and certification shall be filed in the office of the Clerk.
No exclusive contract shall be made with any person, firm, association, or
corporation, except such as may be necessary for the normal purchasing of

expense of holding such election, as determined by the Council, shall have
first been paid to the Treasurer by the lessee.

ARTICLE I.  IN GENERAL
Sec. 2-1. Municipal ordinance violations bureau established.
There is established a Municipal Ordinance Violations Bureau ("Bureau") as
authorized under section 8396 of 1961 PA 236 (MCL 600.8396). The Bureau shall

Sec. 2-2. Location; supervision; employees; rules and regulations. 
The Bureau shall be located at city hall, and shall be under the supervision
and control of the city treasurer. The city treasurer, subject to the approval
of the city manager, shall adopt rules and regulations for the operation of the
bureau and appoint necessary qualified city employees to administer the Bureau.

The Bureau may dispose only of municipal civil infraction violations for which
a fine has been scheduled and for which a municipal civil infraction violation
notice (as distinguished from a citation) has been issued. The fact that a fine
has been scheduled for a particular violation shall not entitle any person to
dispose of the violation at the bureau. Nothing in this article shall prevent
or restrict the city from issuing a municipal civil infraction citation for any
violation or from prosecuting any violation in a court of competent
jurisdiction. No person shall be required to dispose of a municipal civil
infraction violation at the bureau and may have the violation processed before
a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The unwillingness of any person to dispose
of any violation at the bureau shall not prejudice the person or in any way
diminish the person's rights, privileges and protection afforded by law.
(Ord. No. 154, 5-7-2007)
Sec. 2-4. Bureau limited to accepting admissions of responsibility. 
The scope of the bureau's authority shall be limited to accepting admissions of
responsibility for municipal civil infractions and collecting and retaining
civil fines and costs as a result of those admissions. The bureau shall not
accept payment of a fine from any person who denies having committed the
offense or who admits responsibility only with explanation, and in no event
shall the bureau determine the truth or falsity of any fact or matter relating
to an alleged violation.
(Ord. No. 154, 5-7-2007)
Sec. 2-5. Municipal civil infraction violation notices. 
Municipal civil infraction violation notices shall be issued and served by
authorized city officials under the same circumstances and upon the same
persons as provided for citations in section 1-13 of Chapter 1. In addition to
any other information required by this article or other ordinance, the notice
of violation shall indicate:
   (1)   The time by which the alleged violator must appear at the bureau;
   (2)   The methods by which an appearance may be made;
   (3)   The address and telephone number of the bureau;
   (4)   The hours during which the bureau is open;
   (5)   The amount of the fine scheduled for the alleged violation; and
    (6)   The consequences for failure to appear and pay the required fine
within the required time.
(Ord. No. 154, 5-7-2007)
Sec. 2-6. Appearance; payment of fines and costs. 
An alleged violator receiving a municipal civil infraction violation notice
shall appear at the bureau and pay the specified fine and costs at or by the
time specified for appearance in the municipal civil infraction violation
notice. An appearance may be made by mail, in person or by representation.
(Ord. No. 154, 5-7-2007)
Sec. 2-7. Procedure where admission of responsibility not made or fine not

appropriation. For purchases of more than $5,000.00 and less than $20,000.00,
he shall be required to receive approval of the council; for purchases of more
than $20,000.00, he shall be required to receive sealed bids and shall present
such bids to the council for approval or rejection. He may let contracts not in

when sufficient funds for such purposes have been appropriated in the budget,
but the city council shall let all contracts for more than $5,000.00, all
contracts for new construction and all contracts which cannot be consummated
with funds provided in the current budget. The city manager shall advise the

DIVISION 3.
CODE OF ETHICS
Sec. 2-101. Purpose.
Public officials and employees, by virtue of their positions, are trustees of
the public, chargeable with honesty, integrity, and openness in their handling
of public affairs. Loyalty to the public interest requires that all matters
shall be handled with independent, objective judgment, free from avoidable
conflicts of interest, improper influences, and competing loyalties. When
conduct inconsistent with these expectations occurs, public suspicion is
heightened and, therefore, public confidence is jeopardized. Where government
is founded upon the consent of the governed, it is critical that each citizen
have complete confidence in the integrity of the government. Each public
official and employee must endeavor to earn and honor the public trust in the
conduct of all official duties and actions. The purposes of this division are
to define standards of ethical conduct that are clearly established and
uniformly applied and to establish procedures for evaluating ethical questions.
These standards and procedures will provide the public, as well as public
officials and employees, with guidance about ethical expectations for trustees
of the public good.
(Ord. No. 132, § 2, 9-7-1999; Ord. No. 233, 3-1-2021; Ord. No. 244, 8-21-2023;
Ord. No. 248, 5-20-2024)
Sec. 2-102. Definition.
In this division "city official" means a person elected to the city council or
appointed to the planning commission, zoning board of appeals, historic
district commission, building code board of appeals, downtown development
authority, local development finance authority or board of review. City
official shall not include city manager or city attorney.

order for boards and commissions approved by the city council. A member of the
board of appeals who has a pecuniary interest in any matter before the board
shall disclose that interest prior to the board's taking any action, which

the costs referred to in subsection
6-82(b) by first-class mail at the address shown on the record. If such person
(s) fails to pay the same within 30 days after mailing by the assessor of the
notice of the amount thereof, the assessor shall add the same to the next tax
roll of the city, and the same shall be collected and treated in the same
manner as provided by law for collection of property taxes under the General
Property Tax Act (MCL 211.1 et seq.), or may be collected by suit at law.

intended to be used to assist in the growing of medical marihuana, proof that
the fire department has inspected and approved the use or proposed use and that
any necessary permits for electrical alterations have been obtained.

Sec. 10-73. Conduct of licensee.
(a)    Each licensee shall, as a condition of obtaining and maintaining a
license, agree to comply at all times with all applicable local and state
building, zoning, fire, health, and sanitation statutes, ordinances, and
regulations.
(b)   The premises shall be operated and maintained at all times consistent
with responsible business practices and so that no excessive demands will be
placed upon public health or safety services, nor any excessive risk of harm to
the public health, safety, or sanitation.
(c)    The premises shall at all times be operated in compliance with all
applicable provisions of this code and the act.
(d)    The licensee shall immediately notify the city clerk of any changes in

of federal law. A license does not prohibit prosecution by the federal
government of its laws. Nor does a license prohibit prosecution by state

prosecution by the city of Mason for conducting a primary caregiver operation

(c)    Compliance with city ordinances and state statutes is a condition of
maintenance of a license and a license may be suspended for cause pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter.

that may have been the cause of the suspension or any other code violations not
protected by this act.
(e)    No person who has not been identified as a primary caregiver on an
application with the city clerk, or subsequent filing with the city clerk
pursuant to the requirements of this article, shall be deemed to be licensed.

jurisdiction which would render a license issued under this article void or
otherwise ineffective, shall result in the immediate expiration of any license
issued under this section.
(g)    Each day that a person shall conduct a primary caregiver operation or a
dispensary without a license shall constitute a separate offense.
(Ord. No. 196, 3-17-2014)
Sec. 10-75. Confidentiality.
Names and addresses of applicants and any licensed primary caregivers under
this article shall be confidential information and shall be maintained as

employees of various city departments as is necessary to perform their official
duties under this article. No records or information shall be released except
upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

the Act, are completely prohibited within the boundaries of the city.
(b)   Any applicant for a state or local license to establish a marihuana
establishment, as defined by the Act, within the boundaries of the city shall
be deemed to be not in compliance with this section or with the Code of
Ordinances amended by this section.
(c)   This section does not supersede rights and obligations with respect to
the transportation of marihuana through the city to the extent provided by the
Act, and does not supersede rights and obligations under the Michigan Medical
Marihuana Act, the Medical Marihuana Licensing Act, 2016 PA 281, or any other

$50.00, to be kept as a perpetual fund, the interest of which, at a rate to be
fixed as set forth in this section, shall be applied to the repair, improvement
and ornamentation of the lot or lots in the cemetery owned by the depositors of
the fund or on account of which the fund may be deposited or for any other
purpose for the improvement or beautifying of the cemetery as such depositor
may direct. The city treasurer is authorized to receive from any person, in
trust upon like conditions and for like purposes, a sum of money not less than
$25.00, the interest of which shall be used and applied for the perpetual
repair, improvement, beautification and ornamentation of any single burial lot

execute a receipt for the amount of the trust fund so deposited, which receipt
shall designate the name of the depositor, the amount deposited, and the

such deposit, in which case the fund shall be returned to the depositor, or to
his heirs, representatives or assigns.
(c)   It shall be the duty of the city treasurer to account for all such moneys
so deposited in his annual report; and it shall be one of the duties of his

purpose for which such deposits are made, and the amount of interest of such
fund expended; and he shall make an annual report to the city council.
(d)   The amount of money received by the city in trust may be used by the city
for any purpose not inconsistent with the provisions of the Charter and if so
used shall be charged to the fund for which it is used and credited to the
trust fund; and the city shall pay as interest for the use of the fund not less
than four percent per annum, payable annually; and when any part of the fund is
not used by the city, it shall be loaned by the city council upon good security
to be approved by it; and when so loaned, the rate of interest shall be at the

interest shall be credited to the trust fund and be used for the purposes set
forth for which the fund is created.

board of cemetery trustees upon the order of the board, and any excess of
interest not used in any year shall be credited by the treasurer to the general

DIVISION 1.
GENERALLY
Sec. 30-31. Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly
indicates a different meaning:
New construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced
on or after September 8, 1982.
Start of construction means the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure (other than a mobile home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or
footings or any work beyond the stage of excavation. Permanent construction
does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling, nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not as part of the main structure. For the structure (other
than a mobile home) without a basement or poured footing, the start of
construction includes the first framing or assembly of the structure or any
part of the structure on its piling or foundation. For mobile homes not within
a mobile home park or mobile home subdivision, start of construction means the
affixing of the mobile home to its permanent site. Mobile homes not within a
mobile home park or mobile home subdivision must be constructed in accordance
with accepted building standards for conventional homes. For mobile homes
within mobile home parks or mobile home subdivisions, start of construction is
the date on which the construction of facilities for servicing the site on
which the mobile home is to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
constructions of streets, either final grading or the pouring of concrete pads,
and installation of utilities) is completed.
Structure means a walled and roofed building, a mobile home, or a gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground.
Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value
of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started or, if the
structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred.
For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to
occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural
part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include
either:
   (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   (2)   Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places.
(Ord. No. 112, § 3, 8-16-1982)
Cross References: Definitions generally, §
1-2.
Sec. 30-32. Legislative findings of fact.
It has been found that there are specific flood hazard areas within the city
which are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards; the disruption of commerce and
governmental services; extraordinary public and private expenditure for flood
protection and relief; and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare; that these flood losses
are caused and increased by the cumulative effect of development in areas of
special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, damage uses
in other areas when inadequately anchored and themselves suffer inordinate loss
when inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood
damage; and that the general welfare of the residents and safety of all
structures located within or adjacent to flood hazard areas would substantially
benefit by the implementation of certain limitations upon development as set
forth in this article.
(Ord. No. 112, § 1, 8-16-1982)
Sec. 30-33. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (1)   Protect human life and health;
   (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding, generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer line and treatment facilities,
streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
   (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   (7)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
   (8)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. No. 112, § 2, 8-16-1982)
Sec. 30-34. Designation of regulated flood-prone hazardous areas.
This article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the city
as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) entitled “Flood Insurance Study, Ingham County, Michigan
(All Jurisdictions)”, having the flood insurance study number 26065CV000A dated
August 16, 2011, with the following accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRM), having FIRM numbers 26065C; 0252D, 0253D, 0254D, 0258D, 0260D, 0265D,
and 0270D dated August 16, 2011, all of which are adopted and incorporated in
this article by reference for the purposes of administration of the Michigan
Construction Code, and declared to be a part of Section 1612.3 of the Michigan
Building Code, and to provide the content of the “Flood Hazards” section of
Table 301.2(1) of the Michigan Residential Code.
(Ord. No. 112, § 4, 8-16-1982; Ord. No. 185, 8-1-2011)
Sec. 30-35. Conformance with other codes.
All uses located in areas of special flood hazard which are currently permitted
either by right or by special use permit, pursuant to the zoning code, shall
continue to be permitted, provided they conform to all requirements of the
zoning code, and the additional requirements set forth in this article when new
developments or substantial improvements are undertaken. This article is not
intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any rule, regulation or restrictions
arising by virtue of any easement, deed restriction, site plan approval or
plat. Where this article conflicts or overlaps with any other ordinance of the
city, the provisions of this article shall apply, except where other provisions
impose more stringent restrictions furthering the intent and purpose of this
article, in which case the more stringent restriction shall apply.
(Ord. No. 112, § 5, 8-16-1982)
Sec. 30-36. Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of this article, all provisions shall be:
   (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the city council; and
   (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
(Ord. No. 112, § 6, 8-16-1982)
Sec. 30-37. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Large floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not
imply that land outside the area of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article
shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee of
the city, or the Federal Insurance Administration for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully
made under this article.
(Ord. No. 112, § 7, 8-16-1982)
Sec. 30-38. Penalties for noncompliance.
No development, structure or land use shall be constructed, located, extended,
converted or altered by any person within areas of special flood hazard without
full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable
regulations. Violation of the provisions of this article by failure to comply
with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a civil infraction.

development;
   (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program of that area;
   (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
   (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
   (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.
(d)   Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (c) and the purposes of
this article, the building board of appeals may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
article.
(e)   The zoning and development director shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions, including technical information, and report any variances to
the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
(f)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing subsections (c)(1)--(c)(11) of this section have been
fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(g)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places,
without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section.
(h)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
significant increase in flood levels during the base flooding discharge would
result.
(i)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(j)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
   (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
   (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
   (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or extraordinary
public expense; create nuisances; cause fraud on or victimization of the
public; or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(k)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice
that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.

(b)   Construction materials and methods.
   (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
   (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
(c)   Utilities.
   (1)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
   (2)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and
   (3)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding.
(d)   Subdivision proposals.
   (1)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
   (2)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage;
   (3)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood damage; and
   (4)   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development which contain at least 50 lots or five acres

(Ord. No. 112, § 14, 8-16-1982)
Sec. 30-87. Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have been
provided, the following standards are required:
   (1)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above base flood elevation.
   (2)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level
of the base flood elevation, or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall:
      a.   Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      b.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
      c.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that
the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be
provided to the official as set forth in the development permit review.
   (3)   Floodways. Those areas located within areas of special flood hazard
are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous
area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential
projectiles, and erosion potential, the following additional provisions apply:
Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other developments unless a technical evaluation demonstrates
that encroachments shall not result in any significant increase in flood levels
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

(f)   The commission shall keep a record of its resolutions, transactions,
findings and determinations as minutes in accordance with the Michigan Open
Meetings Act, MCL 15.26 et seq.
(Ord. No. 143, 5-3-2004)
Sec. 32-4. Commission powers and duties.
The commission established by this chapter shall have the following duties and
powers:
   (1)   Carry out, assist, and collaborate in studies and programs designed to
identify and evaluate additional district resources and historic districts
worthy of preservation under this chapter as recommended by a duly appointed
historic district study committee.
    (2)   Consult with and consider the ideas and recommendations of civic
groups, public agencies, and citizens interested in historic preservation.
    (3)   Disseminate information to the public concerning those district
resources deemed worthy of preservation, and encourage and advise property
owners in the protection, enhancement, perpetuation, and use of property of
historic, architectural, and archaeological interest.
   (4)   Consider methods other than those provided for in this chapter for
encouraging and achieving historic preservation, and make appropriate
recommendations to the city council and other bodies and agencies, both public
and private.
    (5)   Establish such policies, rules, and regulations as it deems necessary
to administer its duties as herein provided.
    (6)   Maintain and use funds obtained by gift or grant from any public or
private source to acquire property for preservation purposes and administer
such funds and acquisitions in accordance with the purposes herein provided.
    (7)   Review plans and applications for all permits required by this
chapter for any work affecting the exterior appearance of any historic or non-
historic resource within a historic district. The commission shall have the
power to issue a certificate of appropriateness if it approves of the plans
submitted. The commission shall also have the power to issue a denial or a
notice to proceed. The commission may authorize the zoning official to review
and approve certain types of applications involving minor alterations,
additions or repair of district resources, with quarterly review by the
commission. The commission shall provide written standards that clearly
describe the type of minor work that the zoning official may review and
approve.
Sec. 32-5. Permit required; procedure for application review.
(a)   A permit shall be obtained from the zoning official before any work is
performed within a historic district affecting the exterior appearance of a
resource or affecting the interior arrangements of a resource that will cause
visible change to the exterior appearance of a resource.
(b)   Application for a permit for work on any resource in a historic district
shall be made to the zoning official before any such work is commenced. If the
proposed work requires a permit under other city codes or ordinances, no
separate application, permit, or fee shall be required under this chapter,
except that the approving authority shall not grant the permit until the
commission shall review and approve the application.
(c)   Before an application shall be accepted as complete, the zoning official
shall require that plans and elevations, as deemed necessary, be submitted
showing the extent of the proposed change to the district resource in question.
The zoning official will review the plans and elevations for compliance with
the general guidelines and the applicable preservation standards, and will
consult with the applicant in order that proper modifications to the plans or
elevations may be made. No permit shall be granted by the zoning official until
the commission has acted upon the application as prescribed by this chapter. If
the application is denied by the commission, the denial is binding upon the
building official and no building permit can be issued by the building
official.
(d)   The review of any application shall follow the U.S. Secretary of the
Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating
Historic Buildings, as set forth in 36 C.F.R. Part 67. Review standards and
guidelines that address special design characteristics of historic districts
administered by the commission may be followed if they are equivalent in
guidance to the Secretary of Interior's Standards and Guidelines and are
established or approved by the center.
(e)   In reviewing applications, the commission shall consider the following:
   (1)   The historical or architectural value and significance of the
structure and its relationship to the historical value of the surrounding area.
    (2)   The relationship of the exterior architectural features of the
structure to the rest of the structure and the surrounding area.
    (3)   The general compatibility of exterior design, arrangement, texture,
and materials proposed to be used.
    (4)   Other factors, including aesthetic value, which the commission
considers pertinent.
(f)   The commission shall meet within 45 days after the zoning official has
accepted the application as complete to consider the application for approval,
denial, or a notice to proceed.
   (1)   If approval is granted, a certificate of appropriateness shall be
issued by the zoning official.
    (2)   If the commission denies approval of the application, the commission
shall create a record of the reasons for denial. The zoning official shall
transmit notice of the denial in writing to the applicant by first-class mail,
including the reasons for denial and notification of the appeal process. The
applicant may make modifications to the application and shall have the right to
resubmit the application within 60 days from the date of denial for
reconsideration by the commission. No additional fee is required for an
application for reconsideration.
    (3)   The commission may grant a notice to proceed if any of the following
conditions prevail and the commission makes a written finding that the proposed
work is necessary to substantially improve or correct the conditions:
      a.   The structure constitutes a hazard to the safety of the public or
the occupants.
       b.   The structure is a deterrent to a major improvement program which
will be of substantial benefit to the community.
       c.   Retention of the structure would cause undue financial hardship to
the owner.
       d.   Retention of the structure would not be in the interest of the
majority of the community.
    (4)   The failure of the commission to take action on an application within
60 days from the date the zoning official accepts the application as complete,
unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the applicant and the commission,
shall be deemed to constitute approval and the zoning official shall process
the application without regard to a certificate of appropriateness.
(g)   Any person jointly or severally aggrieved by a decision of the commission
shall have the right to appeal the decision to the state historic preservation
review board of the Michigan historical commission within the department of
state. The appeal shall be filed within 60 days after the decision is furnished
to the applicant. The appellant may submit all or part of the appellant’s
evidence and arguments in written form. The review board shall consider an
appeal at its first regularly scheduled meeting after receiving the appeal but
may not charge a fee for considering an appeal. The review board may affirm,
modify or set aside a commission’s decision and may order a commission to issue
a certificate of appropriateness or a notice to proceed. A permit applicant
aggrieved by the decision of the state historic preservation review board may
appeal the decision to the circuit court having jurisdiction over the historic
district commission whose decision was appealed to the state historic
preservation review board. Any citizen or duly organized historic preservation
organization in the local unit, as well as resource property owners, jointly or
severally aggrieved by a decision of the historic district commission may
appeal the decision to the circuit court, except that a permit applicant
aggrieved by a decision of the historic district commission may not appeal to
the court without first exhausting the right to appeal to the state historic
preservation review board.
(h)   Deliberate or irresponsible neglect in maintaining, repairing, or
securing of a district resource resulting in any of the following conditions
shall constitute demolition by neglect and a violation of this chapter:
    (1)   The deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports.
    (2)   The deterioration of roofs or other horizontal members.
    (3)   The deterioration or crumbling of exterior plaster or mortar.
    (4)   The deterioration of exterior chimneys.
    (5)   The ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs and
foundations, including broken windows and doors.
    (6)   The deterioration of any other exterior architectural feature so as
to create or permit the creation of a hazardous or unsafe condition, or
conditions, which, in the judgment of the commission, produces a detrimental
effect upon the character of the district as a whole and the life and character
of the district resource.
    (7)   The loss of structural integrity of a resource.
(i)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent ordinary
maintenance or repair of any district resource within a historic district which
does not alter the exterior features of a structure or resource; nor shall
anything in this ordinance be construed to prevent work on a district resource
under a permit issued by the building official prior to the creation of a
historic district as provided herein, except as provided in section
32-6(g).
(j)   When work has been done upon a resource without a permit, and the
commission finds that the work does not qualify for a certificate of
appropriateness, the commission may require an owner to restore the resource to
the condition the resource was in before the inappropriate work or to modify
the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness. If the
owner does not comply with the restoration or modification requirement within a
reasonable time as prescribed by the commission, the commission may seek an
order from the circuit court to require the owner to restore the resource to
its former condition or to modify the work so that it qualifies for a
certificate of appropriateness. The owner shall be liable for reasonable
attorneys fees should the city receive an order for relief in the action. If
the owner does not comply or cannot comply with the order of the court, the
commission or its agents may enter the property and conduct work necessary to
restore the resource to its former condition or modify the work so that it
qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness in accordance with the court's
order. The costs of the work shall be charged to the owner, and may be levied
by the city as a special assessment against the property. When acting pursuant
to an order of the circuit court, the commission or its agents may enter a
property for purposes of this section.
(Ord. No. 142, 5-19-03)
Sec. 32-6. Historic districts–Establishment; study committee; adding,
modifying, or eliminating historic districts; permit required in proposed
historic district; emergency moratorium.
(a)   The city may establish by ordinance one or more historic districts.
Before such establishment, the city council shall appoint a historic district
study committee. The com- mittee shall contain a majority of persons who have a
clearly demonstrated interest in or knowledge of historic preservation and
shall contain representation from one or more duly organized local historic
preservation organizations. The committee shall do all of the following:
   (1)   Conduct a photographic inventory of resources within each proposed
historic district following procedures established or approved by the center.
    (2)   Conduct basic research of each proposed historic district and the
historic resources located within that district.
    (3)   Determine the total number of historic and non-historic resources
within a proposed historic district and the percentage of historic resources of
that total. In evaluating the significance of historic resources the committee
shall be guided by the selection criteria for evaluation issued by the United
States Secretary of the Interior for inclusion of resources in the National
Register of Historic Places as set forth in 36 C.F.R. part 60, and criteria
established or approved by the center, if any.
    (4)   Prepare a preliminary historic district study committee report that
addresses at a minimum all of the following:
       a.   The charge of the committee.
       b.   The composition of the committee membership.
       c.   The historic district or districts studied.
       d.   The boundaries for each proposed historic district in writing and
on maps.
       e.   The history of each proposed historic district.
      f.   The significance of each district as a whole as well as a sufficient
number of its individual resources to fully represent the variety of resources
found within the district relative to the evaluation criteria.
    (5)   Transmit copies of the preliminary report for review and
recommendations to the planning commission, to the center, to the state
historical commission, and to the state historic preservation review board.
    (6)   Make copies of the preliminary report available to the public
pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act.
(b) Not less than 60 days after the transmittal of the preliminary report, the
committee shall hold a public hearing in compliance with the Open Meetings Act.
Written notice shall be mailed by first-class mail not less than 14 days before
the hearing to the owners of properties within a proposed historic district as
listed on the tax rolls of the city.
(c) After the date of the public hearing, the committee and the city council
shall have not more than one year, unless otherwise authorized by the city
council, to take the following actions:
    (1)   The committee shall prepare and submit a final report with its
recommendations and the recommendations, if any, of the planning commission to
the city council. If the recommendation is to establish a historic district or
districts, the final report shall include a draft of a proposed ordinance or
ordinances.
    (2)   After receiving a final report that recommends the establishment of a
historic district or districts, the city council, at its discretion, may
introduce and pass or reject an ordinance or ordinances. If the city council
passes an ordinance or ordinances establishing one or more historic districts,
the city shall file a copy of that ordinance or those ordinances, including a
legal description of the property or properties located within the historic
district or districts, with the register of deeds. The city shall not pass an
ordinance establishing a contiguous historic district less than 60 days after a
majority of the property owners within the proposed historic district, as
listed on the tax rolls of the city, have approved the establishment of the
historic district pursuant to a written petition.
(d) The city may at any time establish by ordinance additional historic
districts, including proposed districts previously considered and rejected, may
modify boundaries of an existing historic district, or may eliminate an
existing historic district. Before adding, modifying or eliminating a historic
district, the city council shall establish a historic district study committee
as delineated in section
32-6(a).
(e) If considering the elimination of a historic district, the committee shall
follow the procedures set forth in section
32-6(a) to compile a report and conduct a public hearing, but with the intent
of showing one or more of the following:
    (1)   The historic district has lost the physical characteristics that
enabled establishment of the district.
    (2)   The historic district was not significant in the way previously
defined.
    (3)   The historic district was established pursuant to defective
procedures.
(f) Upon receipt of substantial evidence showing the presence of historic,
architectural, archaeological, engineering or cultural significance of a
proposed historic district, the city council may, at its discretion, adopt a
resolution requiring that all work within the proposed historic district shall
require a permit and be referred to the commission as prescribed in section
32-5. The commission shall review permit applications with the same powers that
would apply if the proposed historic district was an established historic
district. The review may continue in the proposed historic district for not
more than one year, or until such time as the city council approves or rejects
the establishment of the historic district by ordinance, whichever occurs
first.
(g) If the city council determines that pending work will cause irreparable
harm to resources located within an established historic district or a proposed
historic district, the city council may by resolution declare an emergency
moratorium of all such work for a period not to exceed six months. The city
council may extend the emergency moratorium for an additional period not to
exceed six months upon finding that the threat of irreparable harm to resources
is still present. Any pending permit application concerning a resource subject
to an emergency moratorium may be summarily denied.

(Ord. No. 85, § 1(A), 4-19-1971)
Sec. 38-33. Purpose.
The provisions of this article shall be deemed to be the minimum requirements
for the preservation of the public peace, health, safety and welfare; and
compliance with all terms of this article shall not be deemed to relieve any
person from any duty imposed by law to use all necessary care and take all
necessary precautions for the safeguarding of the public peace, health and
safety, and the rights of any individual or group of individuals; and it shall
be the duty of any person drilling, operating or maintaining any well to use
all necessary care and take all precautions of whatsoever nature which shall be
reasonably necessary under the circumstances to protect the public or the
rights of any part of the public.
(Ord. No. 85, § 1(B), 4-19-1971)
Sec. 38-34. Compliance and abatement.
(a)   The chief of the fire department, director of public works, or such other
employee of the city as shall be designated for that purpose by the city
council shall have the right and privilege at any time to enter upon the
premises covered by any permit issued under this article for the purpose of
making inspections to determine if the requirements of this article are
complied with, or the requirements of any other ordinance of this city are met
relating to the health, welfare, and safety of persons within the city.
(b)   All drilling operations for the discovery of oil, gas, petroleum or other
hydrocarbons; equipping of wells; producing and marketing of oil, gas,
petroleum and hydrocarbons; plugging of wells; and all material used and work
done in connection with the exploring for, producing and marketing of petroleum
products shall be in conformity with all pertinent state and federal laws and
statutes and rules and regulations and particularly with the statutes of the
state and the regulations of the supervisor of wells of the state.
(Ord. No. 85, § 8(A), (B), 4-19-1971)
Sec. 38-35. Required.
(a)   It shall be unlawful for any person to drill, explore or commence to
drill any well for oil, gas, petroleum or other hydrocarbons in any area within
the corporate limits of the city or for its secondary recovery, or to extend,
or to deepen one already drilled, without first having applied for and
receiving a permit by the authority of the city council in accordance with the
terms of this division and the applicant's having complied with the terms of
this article and having complied with the requirements of this section.
(b)   The producer or owner of any proposed well shall fill out, sign and file
an application in writing for a permit on forms provided by the city clerk,
accompanied with a nonrefundable filing fee in the amount established by
resolution. The application shall contain the information as to the location
where the proposed well is to be drilled, and attached to the application shall
be a map, plat or survey of the area to be drilled and the location of the well
on the spacing and the exact location of tanks, flowlines, fences, and details
incident to the proposed location. The location of the well shall be stated in
relation to established street or plat lines or, in lieu thereof, quarter
section lines. The application shall show the names of the owners of the oil
and gas in all of the area to be drilled and the lease on the area. The
application shall also be accompanied by the consent in writing of the owner of
the drill site to be drilled consenting to the drilling of the well on his
property. Attached to the application shall be duly certified, sworn or
photostatic copies of all leases for the discovery and removal of oil and gas,
and ratifications of oil and gas, executed by the owners of the oil or gas in
such area, owned or controlled by the applicant, setting forth the names of the
lessors and lessees of each such respective lease.
(c)   The application shall be forwarded to the city council for consideration
if it shall appear that all persons having an interest in the drilling unit or
area to be drilled have consented to such drilling, or a pooling order or
permit to drill an exploratory well has been issued by the supervisor of wells
of the state department of natural resources.
(d)   (1) Upon receipt of a completed application, the city council may elect
to schedule a public hearing before acting on the application. If a public
hearing is required, the applicant shall cause notice of such hearing on forms
to be furnished by the city clerk to be given by certified mail to all known
owners of the lands containing oil and gas within the area to be drilled and
the lessees under valid oil and gas leases of record addressed to their last
known place of residence, not less than seven days prior to the date of the
hearing. In addition, the applicant shall publish a notice in a public
newspaper published and printed in the city at least five days prior to the
hearing and shall post notices of the hearing in not less than five public
places in the city at least five days prior to the hearing. The applicant shall
file proof of compliance with the publication requirements of this division
with the city clerk at or prior to the time set for the hearing.
   (2)   No final action on the application shall be taken and no drilling
permit shall be issued until the applicant has filed with the city clerk a
permit to drill which has been granted by the supervisor of wells of the state
department of natural resources, together with a statement of all special
permit conditions or requirements imposed by the supervisor of wells.
   (3)   The city council shall have the power and reserves the authority to
refuse any application for a permit where, by reason of the location of the
proposed well, the character and value of the permanent improvements already
erected in or adjacent to the area in question, the use to which the land and
surroundings are adapted, or for health or sanitary reasons, the drilling of
any oil or gas well will cause a serious disadvantage or hazard to the city and
its inhabitants as a whole. It shall be discretionary with the city council to
grant or deny a permit in any industrial area or in any area in which
residences or other buildings may have been erected when the granting of the
permit shall create fire hazards; endanger the health, safety or welfare of
residents; or otherwise be destructive of property interests. The city council
may make and impose any and all reasonable requirements necessary to protect
and safeguard the property of all parties affected by such drilling or
production activities.
(e)   No permit for the drilling of any well shall be issued without a duly
executed bond given by the applicant as principal and executed by some bonding
or indemnity company authorized to do business in the state, as surety, running
to the city for the benefit of the city, and all persons concerned, conditioned
that if the permit is granted, the applicant and his assigns shall comply with
the terms and conditions of this article in the drilling and operation of the
proposed well; pay and discharge any liability imposed by law for damages on
account of injury to property, either public or private, or bodily injury, or
death, received or suffered by any person and resulting from the drilling
operation or maintenance of any well or any structures, equipment, machinery,
lines or appurtenances used or allowed in the drilling or producing operation;
and clear from the area to be drilled all litter, machinery, derricks,
trenches, pits, debris, oil and other substances used in the drilling or
producing operations, whenever the well shall be abandoned or its operation
discontinued. The maximum total liability under the bond, for loss or damage,
either to person or property shall be in the amount of $1,000,000.00. The bond
shall be made for a term of not less than one year, and a new bond shall be
furnished at the expiration of any existing one if the operation of such well
covered by the bond is continued. If at the time of such renewal all drilling
on such well has been completed, the amount of total liability under such bond
may be reduced to $500,000.00. If any bond required in this section shall lapse
or become void for any reason whatsoever, the permit issued under the terms of
this division shall immediately become inoperative and void until a new bond
shall have been provided and filed with the city clerk or the existing bond
reinstated in full force; and such well and the drilling operations and
production under the bond shall be shut down, suspended and discontinued until
the filing of such new bond or reinstatement of such existing bond. Each bond,
both original and renewal, shall be approved by the city council and shall be
filed with the city clerk.
(f)   (1)   All applicants for a permit to drill a well for oil or gas shall at
time of making such applications pay to the city clerk the sum established by
resolution as a nonrefundable application fee to apply on the cost and expenses
of the administration of this article.
   (2)   In addition, all applicants shall deliver to the city clerk a cash
deposit in the amount established by resolution to be held in escrow pending
completion of drilling operations or denial or abandonment of the permit
application. An additional permit fee shall thereafter be levied by the city
council against this deposit in an amount sufficient to reimburse the city for
its actual expenses incurred in investigating and processing the application,
planning and providing public safety services, the expenses of inspecting and
supervising completion operations, and litigation arising out of the approval
of the application. Following completion of drilling or denial or abandonment
of the permit application, the city clerk shall prepare and file with the city
council and the applicant a written itemization of all such expenses incurred
by the city. The city council shall then, by resolution, determine such amounts
as shall reasonably compensate the city for such necessary expenses and shall
order the city clerk to disburse that portion of applicant's escrow to the city
general fund and refund the balance to the applicant. The applicant shall be
provided notice of the meeting at which such action is to be taken and shall be
provided an opportunity to appear and present arguments and/or evidence in
opposition to the charges.
   (3)   On the January 2 after the completion of any producing well and
annually thereafter so long as production of oil or gas continues from such
well, the owner of each well shall pay to the city clerk a sum of $250.00 to
apply on the cost and expense of the administration of this article.
(g)   When a permit shall have been issued, it shall terminate and become
inoperative without any action on the part of the city council unless within 60
days from the date of the issue, actual drilling of the well shall have been
commenced; and after the drilling of a well shall be commenced, the cessation
of drilling for 60 days or the cessation of production of oil or gas from the
well after production shall have commenced shall operate to terminate and
cancel the permit; and the well shall be considered as abandoned for all
purposes of this article; and it shall be unlawful thereafter to continue the
operation, reworking or drilling of such well without the issuance of another
permit upon new application as provided in this division; however, there may be
granted additional periods of 60 days each, but not to exceed three in number,
upon application by the permittee to the city council requesting such extension
and good and reasonable cause shown.
(h)   A copy of the permit so granted shall be forwarded by the city clerk by
certified mail to the supervisor of wells of the state and a copy posted in the
location of such well.
(i)   The director of public works is granted the authority to suspend the
permit for the operation of any well where any of the provisions of this
article or any permit conditions are violated, which suspension of any such
license shall be effective until such time as that person shall comply with the
provisions of this article. Before suspending any such license, the city clerk
shall cause written notice to be served upon the permittee, advising such
permittee that a hearing will be had at a time and place fixed in the notice to
determine whether the permit held by such permittee shall be suspended. Five
days' notice of the time of the hearing shall be given. It shall be unlawful
and an offense for any person to operate any well during any period in which
the permit covering the operation of such well is so suspended. The provisions
of this section shall in no way limit or interfere with the enforcement of the
penalties for the violation or ordinances generally, but shall be cumulative
and in addition to such penalties.

works, and in such event for the limited period only.
(f)   If it shall appear from the application on file, and after notice and
hearing as provided in section
38-35(d), that the limitation and restrictions established in this article will
preclude drilling and operating in an area which should reasonably be drilled
and operated, the city council shall be authorized and empowered to make
exception from such limitations and restrictions set forth in subsections (b),
(c) and (d) of this section.
(Ord. No. 85, § 3, 4-19-1971)
Sec. 38-37. Production and operation.
(a)   In the drilling for oil and gas, petroleum or other hydrocarbons and
their production, the permittee shall use every precaution, equipment and

above the surface of the ground. All such flares shall be of approved
construction and shall be installed in a pit of sufficient depth and area to
provide adequate drainage and safety precautions. The location of all such
flares shall be completely enclosed by steel fencing of the same type and
dimensions as provided in this section for enclosing the drilling operation.
(d)   In all cases where an oil and gas well is being drilled in a
residentially zoned area, the drilling operator shall use a portable slush pit;
and all slush and waste shall be deposited in the pit and removed beyond the
corporate limits of the city for disposal. No open pits for the disposal of
slush, brine or salt water shall be permitted at any time after the completion
of the drilling operation in any area in the city.
(e)   All brine or salt water produced in the drilling for or production of oil
shall, under the supervision of the supervisor of wells of the state, be
returned to some underground formation or otherwise disposed of in order that
such brine, salt water, or refuse shall not do damage to any fresh water,
wells, lakes, ponds, or rivers.
(f)   The person in charge of the producing operations of a well shall keep the
fenced enclosure around such well free of all trash and flammable substances
not necessary in the operation of such well and shall keep the weeds cut and
otherwise keep the location in a clean and orderly condition. Machinery and
equipment not used in the operation of the well shall not be stored or left in
such enclosure. All oil tanks shall be painted or galvanized.
(g)   Except in emergency, at least six hours before any mud or fluid in any
well shall be removed, swabbed, baled or otherwise cleaned out, the chief of
the fire department or other officer in charge shall be served with written
notice of the hour that such cleaning, swabbing or bailing is done; and if in
his opinion the cleaning, swabbing or bailing shall be hazardous to the safety
of life or property, he is authorized to stop or prevent such cleaning,
swabbing or bailing until such time as conditions may become favorable to
continue such activity. It shall be unlawful to commence the testing of any
well from sundown until sunrise, or during a period when gas may settle on the
ground, or during any electrical storm. Before bringing in a well, all of the
control devices, including master gates and safety valves, shall be tested,
shall be in good working order, and shall comply with the provisions of this
article.
(h)   Drilling shall be done with mud-laden fluids of such weight and viscosity
as shall be required by and under good drill practices in the area in which
such drilling is being done.
(Ord. No. 85, § 4, 4-19-1971)
Sec. 38-38. Equipment.
(a)   All equipment and materials used in the drilling of a well for the
discovery of oil, gas, petroleum and hydrocarbons shall be modern and shall be
kept in good working condition at all times. All drilling rigs shall be of the
rotary type only to the production state of the well; and thereafter cable-tool
equipment may be used for swabbing, cleaning and completion of the well. All
drilling rigs shall be anchored or secured in accordance with good drilling
practices.
(b)   All drilling rigs or derricks shall be constructed with platform and
superstructure of sufficient height to accommodate a double ram automatic
blowout preventor or space-saver of "Shaffer" or "Cameron" type or the
equivalent, with hydraulic blowout preventor, "Hydril" or "Reagen" above, such
blowout preventors to be installed above the ground level, together with blow-
line of proper size and working pressure, and with choke-manifold installed on
each preventor. The blowout preventor shall be pressure tested prior to
drilling operations under surface pipe, and shall be closed periodically every
eight hours thereafter.
(c)   When cable-tool equipment shall be used for completion of the well, they
shall be equipped with master-gate, and the rig shall be equipped with
lubricators while the well is being tested, swabbed or bailed. Such master-gate
shall have a remote control located at least 20 feet from the well bore.
(d)   Every producer or operator who shall drill a well shall, as a minimum
requirement, set 500 feet of conductor pipe and cement it to the surface; then,
not less than 1,000 feet of intermediate casing and cemented with cement
circulated to the surface; then, a production string shall be set into or
through the producing formation and shall be cemented with sufficient cement to
fill up at least 300 feet above the producing formation, plus 20 percent excess
cement. Each string of casing within any well shall have the fittings securely
anchored to the casing immediately enclosing it.
(e)   Each well shall have a separator capable of caring adequately for the
production of the well, and both oil and gas, without spraying oil through the
separator vent line. No gas shall be produced, wasted or allowed to escape
through a separator vent line from any well. When it shall appear that an
explosive mixture of gas may be accumulating near the ground, the designated
city officer in charge may require that the well be shut down until such gas is
dissipated.
(f)   No tanks or other facility for the storage of oil, gas, petroleum or
hydrocarbons produced from any well within the corporate limits of the city
shall be kept, erected or maintained within the corporate limits of the city
except in areas zoned as industrial and agricultural areas where such storage
tanks shall be allowed. Such storage tanks shall be erected outside the
corporate limits of the city, except for such installation in industrially and
agriculturally zoned areas, and shall be connected to any well by pipes or
pipelines by the nearest possible route.
(g)   All tanks for the storage of oil permitted to be installed in
industrially and agriculturally zoned areas shall be located in a pit and
encircled by an embankment and a fire wall with a capacity of one and one-half
times the capacity of the tank. No tank shall be located nearer than 300 feet
from any building or industrial structure.
(h)   All pipes or pipelines leading to or from a well location shall be buried
underground to a minimum depth of 24 inches below normal surface of the ground;
and before a pipeline is laid in, down or along a street, the person or company
laying such line shall deposit with the city treasurer the sum established by
resolution for the laying of such line; and in the construction of such lines,
the permittee shall pay to the city all damages sustained by it by reason of
the construction of the lines and the repair of any streets crossed by or
extending along such pipelines in an amount sufficient to place the city
property in the same condition as prior to the laying of the lines and shall
pay to the city any and all damage incident to the taking up or repairing of
the lines thereafter. No concrete or asphalt paving shall be cut or disturbed
unless absolutely necessary, and then only under the supervision of the city;
and the permittee shall be required to replace and repair the paving at his own
expense and under the supervision of the director of public works.
(i)   No rigs or heavy machinery used in connection with the drilling or
operation of wells in the city shall be moved over the city streets from one
location to another without obtaining a permit, which permit shall set forth
the streets which may be used for that purpose.

the commencement of drilling operation. All equipment shall be removed from the
location promptly; and all machinery, tanks, pipes and tools shall be
transported from the well site and embankments leveled and the surface of the
land restored to its former condition.
(d)   The permittee shall not permit any undue accumulation of slush, salt
water or oil, or any other offensive or dangerous substances to accumulate, and
upon the completion of the well shall remove and eliminate all debris and
eliminate all conditions and circumstances contributing to the hazard of fire
or pollution.
(Ord. No. 85, § 6, 4-19-1971)
Sec. 38-40. Deepening, reworking.
If any person shall desire to deepen or extend a well below the depth of its
original objective, he shall make application to the city council the same as
if original application for permit were taken. In such deepening and reworking,
the same precautions shall be complied with as set forth in this article. If
such application for reworking or deepening shall be filed within 60 days from
the date of the completion or abandonment of the original drilling operation, a
reduced fee in the amount established by resolution shall be required.

ordinance.
   (2)   If a violation of section 42-93(a) occurs after 1 prior judgement, the
minor is guilty of a misdemeanor. A misdemeanor under this subsection is
punishable by imprisonment for not more than 30 days if the court finds the

probation, failed to successfully complete any treatment, screening or
community service ordered by the court, or failed to pay any fine for that
conviction, by a fine of not more than $500.00, or both, as applicable. A court

probation. The terms and conditions of that probation include, but are not
limited to, the sanctions set forth in section
42-93(h)(3), payment of the costs including any minimum state costs, and the
costs of probation. If a court finds that an individual violated a term or
condition of probation or that the individual is utilizing a corresponding
provision in another court, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and
proceed as otherwise provided by law. If an individual fulfills the terms and
conditions of probation, the court shall discharge the individual and dismiss
the proceedings. Discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without
adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of this section or
for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon
conviction of a crime. An individual may obtain only one discharge or dismissal
under this section as to an individual or any corresponding provision of the
state law or local ordinance. In accordance with the corresponding provisions
of state law, the court shall maintain a nonpublic record of the matter while
proceedings are deferred and the individual is on probation under this section.
The court shall provide the secretary of state with a record of the plea and
discharge under this section to allow the secretary of state to retain and
disseminate a nonpublic record of a plea and of the discharge and dismissal
under the procedures established for the corresponding state law provision.
   (5)   A misdemeanor violation of section
42-93(a) successfully deferred, discharged and dismissed under section
42-93(h)(4) is considered a prior judgment for the purposes of section
42-93(h)(3).
   (6)   As used in this section, prior judgment means a conviction, juvenile
adjudication, finding of responsibility, or admission of responsibility for any
of the following, whether under a law of this state, a local ordinance
substantially corresponding to a law of this state, a law of the United States

(Ord. No. 177, 10-5-2009; Ord. 222, § 20, 12-3-2018)
Sec. 42-207. Right of city to remove.
If graffiti is not removed by the perpetrator as required by section
42-206, graffiti shall be removed pursuant to the following provisions:
(a)   Property owner responsibility. It is unlawful for any person who is the
owner or who has primary responsibility for control of property or for repair
or maintenance of property in the city to permit property that is defaced with
graffiti to remain defaced for a period of ten days after service by first
class mail of notice of the defacement. The notice shall contain the following
information:
   (1)   The street address and legal description of the property sufficient
for identification of the property;
   (2)   A statement that the property is a potential graffiti nuisance
property with a concise description of the conditions leading to the finding;
   (3)   A statement that the graffiti must be removed within ten days after
receipt of the notice and that if the graffiti is not abated within that time
the city will declare the property to be a public nuisance, subject to the
abatement procedures in sections
2.2(19), and
11.9 of the city charter; and
   (4)   An information sheet identifying any graffiti removal assistance
programs available through the city and private graffiti removal contractors.
(b)   Exceptions to property owner responsibility. The removal requirements of
subsection (a) above shall not apply if the property owner or responsible party
can demonstrate to the chief of police or city manager that:
   (1)   The property owner or responsible party lacks the financial ability to
remove the defacing graffiti; or
   (2)   The property owner or responsible party has an active program for the
removal of graffiti and has scheduled the removal of the graffiti as part of
that program, in which case it shall be unlawful to permit such property to
remain defaced with graffiti for a period of 15 days after service by first
class mail of notice of the defacement.
(c)   Right of city to remove.
   (1)   Use of public funds. Whenever the city becomes aware or is notified
and determines that graffiti is located on publicly or privately owned property
viewable from a public or quasi-public place, the city shall be authorized to
use public funds for the abatement of the graffiti nuisance, but shall not
authorize or undertake to provide for the painting or repair of any more
extensive an area than that where the graffiti is located, unless the city
manager, or his designee, determines in writing that a more extensive area is
required to be repainted or repaired in order to avoid an aesthetic
disfigurement to the neighborhood or community, or unless the property owner or
responsible party agrees to pay for the costs of repainting or repairing the
more extensive area.
   (2)   Right of entry on private property. Prior to entering upon private
property or property owned by a public entity other than the city for the
purpose of graffiti removal, the city shall attempt to secure the consent of
the property owner or responsible party and a release of the city from
liability for property damage or personal injury. If the property owner or
responsible party fails to remove the offending graffiti within the time
specified by this article, or if the city has requested consent to remove or
paint over the offending graffiti and the property owner or responsible party
has refused consent for entry on terms acceptable to the city and consistent
with the terms of this section, the city shall commence abatement and cost
recovery proceedings for the graffiti removal according to the provisions
specified below.
(d)   Abatement and cost recovery proceedings.
   (1)   Notice of due process hearing. If the owner has refused consent and
the city intends to proceed with abatement, the city manager, or his designee,
serving as the hearing officer, shall provide the property owner of record and
the party responsible for the maintenance of the property, if a person
different from the owner, not less than 48 hours notice of the city's intent to
hold a due process hearing at which the property owner or responsible party
shall be entitled to present evidence and testimony that the property does not
constitute a public nuisance. Notice shall be served in the same manner as a
citation in a civil action in accordance with section
1-13(7) of the code. If the owner of record cannot be found after a diligent
search, the notice may be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous
place upon the property for a period of ten days and mailing by first-class
mail to the most current owner of record as shown on the city's tax rolls.
   (2)   Determination of hearing officer. The determination of the hearing
officer after the due process hearing shall be final and not appealable. If,
after the due process hearing, regardless of the attendance of the owner or the
responsible party or their respective agents, the hearing officer determines
that the property contains graffiti viewable from a public or quasi-public
place, the hearing officer shall give written notice in an abatement order
that, unless the graffiti is removed within ten days, the city shall enter upon
the property, cause the removal, painting over (in such color as shall meet
with the approval of the hearing officer), or such other abatement thereof as
the hearing officer determines appropriate, and shall provide the owner with an
accounting of the costs of the abatement on a full cost recovery basis.
   (3)   Abatement effort. Not sooner than the time specified in the order of
the hearing officer, the city manager, or the designee of the city manager,
shall implement the abatement order and shall mail an accounting to the owner
and the responsible party of the costs thereof.
   (4)   Cost hearing. The owner or responsible party may, within ten days
following date of mailing, request a hearing before the hearing officer on the
abatement cost accounting, and appropriate due notice and a due process hearing
shall be extended to the owner or responsible party. If, following the hearing,
or if no hearing is requested, after the implementation of the abatement order,
the total amount set forth in the abatement accounting, or an amount thereof
determined as appropriate by the hearing officer, shall be due and payable to
the city by the owner or responsible party within 30 days.
   (5)   Lien. If all or any portion of the abatement charges remain unpaid
after 30 days, the portion thereof that remains unpaid shall constitute a lien
on the property that was the subject of the abatement effort. The city
treasurer shall cause a notice of lien to be recorded with the Ingham County
Register of Deeds. If any such charges are not paid within six months after the
recording of the lien, the official in charge of the collection shall, prior to
May 1 of each year, certify to the tax assessing officer of the city of the
facts of such delinquency, whereupon the officer shall enter such delinquent
charges upon the next city tax roll as a charge against the premises pursuant
to sections
2.2(19) and
11.9 of the city charter and the lien shall be enforced in the same manner as
provided by law for delinquent and unpaid taxes.
   (6)   Suit. Unpaid abatement charges shall also constitute a debt owed to
the city by the owner or the person occupying and controlling the property
which may also be collected by the city by a suit in assumpsit brought in the
name of the city against the owner or person occupying or in control of the
premises, or both.

ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL
Sec. 52-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "City of Mason Post Construction Stormwater
Management Ordinance."
(Ord. No. 203, 10-17-2016)
Sec. 52-2. Findings.
The city finds that:
   (1)   The constitution and laws of the State of Michigan authorizes local
units of government to provide stormwater management services and systems that
will contribute to the protection and preservation of the public health,
safety, and welfare and to the protection of our natural resources.
   (2)   Water bodies, roadways, structures, and other property within and
downstream of city are at times subjected to flooding.
   (3)   Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds, which
may result in increased stormwater runoff rates volumes, and duration,
increased flooding, increased stream channel erosion, and increased sediment
transport and deposition.
   (4)   Stormwater runoff produced as a consequence of land development
contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants.
   (5)   Increases of stormwater runoff, soil erosion, and nonpoint source
pollution have occurred as a result of land development, and have impacted the
water resources of the Grand River Watershed.
   (6)   Increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments and
pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects
within the city will, absent reasonable regulation and control, adversely
affect the city water bodies and water resources, and those of downstream
communities.
   (7)   Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized by the regulation of stormwater runoff from
development.
   (8)   Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil,
thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow.
   (9)   Adopting the standards, criteria and procedures contained in this
chapter and implementing the same will address many of the deleterious effects
of stormwater runoff.
   (10)   Substantial economic losses can result from adverse impacts on the
waters of the city and the watershed.
   (11)   Improper design and construction of stormwater best management
practices (BMPs) can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation.
   (12)   The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities is necessary in order to control and minimize increases in
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint
source pollution associated with stormwater runoff.
   (13)   The regulation of land development by means of stormwater management
policy and procedures and effective site planning will produce development that
is compatible with the natural functions of the land or an entire watershed and
thereby mitigate the adverse effects of excessive stormwater runoff from
development.
(Ord. No. 203, 10-17-2016)
Sec. 52-3. Purpose.
(a)   The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management
requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety,
and welfare of the public residing in the city and the watersheds to which it
drains and to comply with the city's National Pollution Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit and other applicable federal and state regulations.
(b)   This chapter seeks to meet that purpose by minimizing the negative
impacts of increased stormwater discharges from new land development and
redevelopment through the following objectives:
   (1)   To minimize increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes from
identified land development and redevelopment.
   (2)   To minimize nonpoint source pollution.
   (3)   To minimize the deterioration of existing watercourses, culverts and
bridges, and other structures.
   (4)   To encourage water recharge where geologically favorable conditions
exists.
   (5)   To maintain the ecological integrity of stream channels.
   (6)   To minimize the negative impacts of development on downstream channel
stability.
   (7)   To preserve and protect water supply facilities and water resources by
controlling increased flood discharges, stream erosion, and runoff pollution.
   (8)   To reduce the adverse impact of changing land use on water bodies and,
to that end, this chapter establishes minimum standards to protect water bodies
from degradation resulting from changing land use where storm water management
controls may be insufficient to meet water quantity and quality goals.
   (9)   To ensure that storm drains and stormwater BMPs are adequate to
address stormwater management needs within a proposed development, and for
protecting downstream landowners from flooding and degradation of water
quality. The procedures, standards, and recommendations set forth in this
chapter and thecity's post construction stormwater management guidance manual
(guidance manual) are designed for these purposes.
   (10)   To ensure that all stormwater facilities necessary for a proposed
development will have an appropriate governmental unit responsible in
perpetuity for performing maintenance or; for overseeing the performance of
maintenance by other entities.
   (11)   To facilitate the integration of stormwater management and pollution
control with other ordinances, programs, policies, and the comprehensive plans
of the city.
   (12)   To establish legal authority to carry out all of the inspection and
monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.

runoff rates, volumes, and pollutant loads. Such techniques include, but are
not limited to, minimization and/or disconnection of impervious surfaces;
development design that reduces the rate and volume of runoff; restoration or
enhancement of natural areas such as riparian areas, wetlands, and forests; and
distributed practices that intercept and treat runoff from developed areas.
(b)   The stormwater plan shall be presented as follows:
   (1)   Through plans, illustrations, reports, and calculations, the
stormwater plan shall display the required information specified in the
guidance manual.
   (2)   The stormwater plan must be sufficiently detailed to specify the type,
location, and size of stormwater management facilities, using preliminary
calculations. Detailed construction drawings are not required at the stormwater
plan review stage.
   (3)   If it is proposed to develop a parcel in two or more phases, the
stormwater plan shall be prepared and submitted for the total project.
(c)   Plan preparation. The stormwater plan shall be prepared by a designer in
accordance with the requirements outlined in the city’s post construction
stormwater management guidance manual. Other persons and professionals may
assist in the preparation of the plan. All plans shall be properly sealed.
(Ord. No. 203, 10-17-2016; Ord. No. 245, 11-20-2023)
Sec. 52-11. Standards for post construction stormwater management concept plan
(stormwater plan) approval.
(a)   All developments requiring a stormwater plan shall be designed,
constructed, and maintained to prevent flooding, minimize stream channel
impacts, protect water quality, and achieve the purposes of this chapter, as
stated above. The city has adopted performance standards to meet the objectives
of managing the quantity and quality of stormwater runoff from a site as
detailed below and/or in the guidance manual.
(b)   Designers may select any combination of stormwater BMPs which meet the
performance standards provided the selections:
   (1)   Comply with the requirements identified in this chapter and the
guidance manual;
   (2)   Comply with all other local, county, state, or federal requirements;
and
   (3)   Do not conflict with the existing local stormwater management and
watershed plans.
(c)   The particular facilities and measures required on-site shall take into
consideration the natural features, upland areas, wetlands, and watercourses on
the site; the potential for on-site and offsite adverse stormwater impacts,
water pollution, and erosion; and the size of the site.
(d)   The following on-site stormwater management concepts shall be followed:
   (1)   Natural topography and site drainage shall be preserved and site
grading shall be minimized to the maximum extent reasonably achievable
considering the nature of the development.
   (2)   The preferred conveyance strategy is to transport, wherever possible,
untreated and treated runoff in conveyance facilities open to the atmosphere
(e.g. swales, vegetated buffer strips, energy-dissipating structures, etc.),
rather than through enclosed pipes, so as to decrease runoff velocity, allow
for natural infiltration, allow suspended sediment particles to settle, and to
remove pollutants.
   (3)   Watercourses shall not be deepened, widened, dredged, cleared of
vegetation, straightened, stabilized, or otherwise altered without applicable
permits or approvals from the utilities director, relevant county agencies and
the applicable State of Michigan department(s).
   (4)   The following channel protection criteria shall be met. There shall be
no net increase in runoff rate and volume from storm events up to the two-year,
24-hour event from predevelopment conditions. Specific details for compliance
with this requirement are outlined in the guidance manual.
   (5)   The following peak rate/flood control criteria shall be met. The peak
discharge rate from all storms up to the 100-year, 24-hour event shall not be
greater than predevelopment discharge rates. Where the runoff volume is not
increased from the predevelopment condition, the peak rate corresponding to the
same storms is considered controlled. If specific watershed conditions require
additional peak rate control, the city may, in its discretion, upon the
recommendation of its utilities director:
      a.   Restrict the peak discharge from the 100-year, 24 hour event to a
fixed release rate; or
      b.   Require additional runoff volume reduction.
      Specific details for compliance with this requirement are outlined in the
guidance manual.
   (6)   The following water quality criteria shall be met. Water quality
criteria are met when:
      a.   The minimum treatment volume control criteria of one inch of runoff
from the entire site is detained and
      b.   When the following total suspended solids criteria is met:
         1.   A minimum of 80% of total suspended solids has been removed as
compared with uncontrolled runoff, or
         2.   A maximum discharge concentration of TSS not to exceed 80 mg/l is
met.
      If the required minimum TSS levels are not met by the capture of one inch
of runoff from the entire site, then additional treatment methods must be
designed to meet the minimum TSS removal requirements. Specific details for
compliance with this requirement are outlined in the guidance manual.
   (7)   Under certain conditions, the city, upon recommendation by utilities
director, may impose the following additional restrictions on stormwater
discharges:
      a.   Peak discharge may be further restricted when it can be shown that a
probable risk to downstream structures or unique natural areas exists or that
existing severe flooding problems could be negatively impacted.
      b.   Measures may be imposed to protect against ground or surface water
pollution where the nature of the soils or bedrock underlying a stormwater
management structure constitutes substantial risk of contamination, such as
might be the case in limestone formations. Special provisions to be followed in
these cases will be provided by the utilities director.
      c.   Where groundwater yields are very low or where a groundwater supply
already is heavily used, the city may require that the entire volume of the
two-year, 24-hour rainfall event be retained and infiltrated. If substantial
irrigation needs are anticipated, portions of stored stormwater may be reused
for irrigation purposes.
   (8)   Stormwater "credits" for onsite stormwater management may be
considered in accordance with the provisions provided in the guidance manual.
(Ord. No. 203, 10-17-2016; Ord. No. 245, 11-20-2023)
Sec. 52-12. Stormwater management concept plan (stormwater plan) submission.
(a)   The stormwater plan shall be submitted to the department of utilities
director for review in accordance with the requirements specified in the
guidance manual, unless site plan review is required, in which case the

(b)   The utilities director shall forward the stormwater plan to the city
engineer for review, unless being reviewed by the planning commission in which
case the zoning and development director shall forward to the city engineer.
(c)   Compliance with the requirements of this chapter does not eliminate the
need for the proprietor to obtain required permits and approvals from county
and state agencies.
(d)   Compliance with the requirements of this chapter does not eliminate the
need for the proprietor to comply with other applicable city ordinances and
regulations.

signs which do not comply with the ordinance while avoiding any unreasonable
invasion of established property rights. Where a lawful sign exists on the
effective date of this chapter, or an amendment thereof, that is made no longer

(d)   Other refuse collection. This article shall not prohibit licensed haulers
from collecting refuse and rubbish from premises containing in excess of four

property and collected in the same manner as provided by law for delinquent and
unpaid taxes. If not paid on or before August 31, service to the property shall

shall not be granted further service in the collection and disposal of refuse
until the amount is paid, together with a reinstatement charge in the amount
established by resolution.
(d)   Legal remedy. The stoppage of service authorized for nonpayment of
collection charges shall be in addition to the right of the city to proceed for
the collection of such unpaid charges in any manner provided by law for the
collection of a municipal claim.

assessments to be placed on the tax roll of the city for that year, together
with accrued collection fees. Thereafter, the total amount of such assessment
and fees shall be collected in all respects as are city taxes due on July 1 of
that year, and such total amounts shall be subject to the same fees and

Sec. 66-13. Special assessment accounts.
Except as otherwise provided in the Charter, moneys raised by special

Sec. 66-14. Disposition of excessive special assessments.
If any special assessment proves larger than the actual cost of the improvement
and incidental expenses, such excess may be placed in the general fund of the
city if such excess is five percent or less of the assessment; but should the
assessment prove larger than necessary by more than five percent, the entire
excess shall be refunded on a pro rata basis to the then owner of the property
assessed. Such refund may be made by credit against future unpaid installments
to the extent such installments then exist, and the balance of such refund
shall be in cash. No refunds may be made which contravene the provisions of any
outstanding evidence of indebtedness secured in whole or part by such special
assessment.

court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge such assessment to be illegal,
the council shall, whether the improvement has been made or not, or whether any
part of the assessments have been paid or not, have power to cause a new
assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was
made. All proceedings on such reassessment and for its collection shall be
conducted in the same manner as provided for the original assessment; except it
shall not again be necessary to prepare plans and estimates of cost, nor to
hold any hearing on the necessity of the improvement, unless and to the extent
that the cause of the irregularity arose in such proceedings. Whenever any sum
levied upon any property for the assessment so set aside has been paid and not
refunded, the payment so made shall be applied upon the reassessment; or, if
the payments exceed the amount of the reassessment, refunds shall be made in
the manner prescribed in Section 11.4 of the Charter.
(b)   No judgment or decree, nor any act of the council, vacating a special
assessment shall destroy or impair the lien of the city upon the premises
assessed for such amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged against
the premises had such charges been lawfully assessed in accordance with the
procedure established or authorized in this chapter.

written notice is given to the council of intention to file such suit or
action, stating the ground on which it is claimed such assessment is illegal;
and
   (2)   Such suit or action shall be commenced within 60 days after
confirmation of the roll for such assessment.

at which the council will act shall be given by publication, and sent by
registered mail to all property owners of the property, constituting or
creating such nuisance or hazard, as shown by the current tax roll of the city;
but failure of any owner to receive such notice shall not invalidate any such
assessment. For the purposes of collection of such assessment, the adoption of
such resolution shall be equivalent to the confirmation of a special assessment
roll. The amount of any such assessment shall become a debt due to the city
upon adoption of such resolution, be payable and subject to the collection
fees, and shall become a lien, all as provided in Charter Section 11.7.
(b)   Every such assessment shall also be subject to Section 11.5 and 11.6 of
the Charter.

assessment roll proves insufficient to pay for the improvement for which it was
levied and the expenses incident thereto; but the additional pro rata

confirmed, unless a meeting of the council is held to review such additional
assessment. Notice of any such meeting shall be published as provided in the
case of review of the original special assessment roll.

   (1)   The payment of special assessment installments may be deferred for
owners who meet the terms and conditions of this section annually for a period
not to exceed ten years or until the property is sold or until one year after

of an assessment on homestead property owned by a husband and wife. The gross
amount of the annual special assessment installment eligible for deferment
under this section shall not be less than $300.00.
   (2)   To receive deferment, the owner shall annually certify to the city
manager on or before July 1st that his annual household income does not exceed
HUD Section 8 income limits.
   (3)   The owner shall execute and deliver to the city clerk a lien in
recordable form in favor of the City indicating the amount of the annual
special assessment deferred, plus interest as provided in subsection (4), and

   (5)   The city treasurer shall not report as delinquent any special
assessment installment which is deferred under this section for which a lien
has been recorded in favor of the city, until such time as the term of the
deferment expires as provided in subsection

street, alley or public place, such refilling shall be made only to the

governed in this article, which shall be borne by the person having such
permission; and such costs shall be deducted from the amount of the deposit so
made. If in the judgment of the director of public works such sum so required
to be deposited will not be sufficient to cover the probable cost of such work,
he may require a deposit sufficient, in his judgment, to cover such cost; and
on the completion of such work, any balance shall be returned to the person
entitled thereto. In case of a deficiency, such person shall pay the balance

suffered through the negligent exercise of the privilege granted under such
permit. If a bond or certificate of insurance is furnished, it shall be
conditioned to save harmless the permit applicant from loss resulting from the
death of or injury to persons or damage to property which is caused or is
occasioned by the doing of the thing or exercise of the privilege for which the
permit is required.

received a recommendation on the plat from the planning commission. Following
the receipt of such recommendations, the city council shall consider the
preliminary plat at a meeting at which the matter is placed on the regularly
scheduled meeting agenda. Such meeting shall be held within 30 days of the date
of the regular planning commission meeting at which the preliminary plat was
considered; except that the entire review process of the planning commission
and the city council, barring an extension agreed to in writing by the
proprietor, shall not exceed a period of 90 days from the date of submittal by
the proprietor to the planning commission, to the date of approval or rejection
by the city council.

of approval or rejection in writing and, if rejected, to give the reasons.
(d)   The city council shall instruct the city clerk to note all proceedings
relative to the preliminary plat in the minutes of the meeting, which minutes
shall be open for public inspection.
(e)   Final approval of the preliminary plat under this section shall confer
upon the proprietor for a period of two years from the date of approval the
conditional right that the general terms and conditions under which preliminary
plat approval was granted will not be changed. The two-year period may be
extended if applied for by the proprietor and granted by the city council in
writing. Written notice of such extension shall be sent by the city council via
the city clerk's office to all approving authorities.
(f)   After receiving final approval of his preliminary plat but before
proceeding with the construction of any public improvements, the proprietor
shall submit four copies of complete street, streetlighting, water, storm, and

objections are removed.
(Ord. No. 73, § 13, 3-4-1968)
Sec. 74-104. Review of the final plat by the city council.

DESIGN STANDARDS
Sec. 74-126. Generally.
The subdivision design standards set forth in this division are development
guides for the assistance of the developer. All final plans shall be reviewed
and meet the approval of the city council.
(Ord. No. 73, § 17, 3-4-1968)
Sec. 74-127. Streets.
(a)   Major streets. The proposed subdivision shall conform to the various
elements of the zoning ordinance and the comprehensive development plan and
shall be considered in relation to existing and planned major thoroughfares and
secondary thoroughfares; and such streets shall be platted in the location and
the width indicated on such plan.
(b)   Minor streets. The proposed subdivision street layout shall include minor
streets so laid out that their use by through traffic shall be discouraged. The
street layout shall provide for a continuation of streets adjoining
subdivisions or for the proper projections of streets into adjoining property
which may be subject to future subdivision.
(c)   Streets in relation to other right-of-way. Should a proposed subdivision
border on or contain an expressway or other limited access highway right-of-
way, the city council may require the location of a street approximately
parallel to and on each side of the right-of-way at a distance suitable for the
development of an appropriate use of intervening land as for residential parks
in residence districts, or for commercial, industrial or public purposes in
appropriate districts. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration
of the minimum distance required for approach grades and future grade
separation.
(d)   Marginal-access streets. Should a proposed subdivision border on or
contain an existing or proposed major thoroughfare, the city council may
require marginal-access streets, reverse frontages with approved screen
planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along real property line having a
minimum width of 15 feet, or such other treatment as may be necessary for
adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation and
reduction of traffic hazards.
(e)   Reserve strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be
prohibited.
(f)   Street rights-of-way widths. Street rights-of-way widths shall conform to
at least the following minimum standards:

   (7)   Turnaround or eyebrow   150
(g)   Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited, except where absolutely
essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with
the other requirements of this article and where the city council finds it will
be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is developed. Wherever there exists adjacent to the tract to be
subdivided a dedication or platted and recorded half street, the other half
will be platted.
(h)   Alleys. Alleys shall be prohibited.
(i)   Street grades. For adequate drainage, the minimum street grade of all
streets shall be no less than one-half of one percent and not greater than five
percent. The planning commission may approve an alteration of this standard
subject to the recommendation of the city engineer clearly indicating the
purpose for requiring the alteration.
(j)   Horizontal street curves. The radii of the minimum horizontal centerline
curvature for major, secondary, and minor thoroughfares shall be as follows:
 
    Street                 Curvature
(1) Major thoroughfare.... 750-foot radius
(2) Secondary street....   400-foot radius

shall have profile grade change, where the grade change is over two percent,
connected by vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent to the following
algebraic differences:
   (1)   Major thoroughfare, 800 feet.
   (2)   Secondary street, 500 feet.
   (3)   Minor street, 300 feet.
Distances required shall be measured between points five feet above the
centerline of the street.
(m)   Street intersections. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as
nearly as possible to 90 degrees. Curved streets intersecting with major
thoroughfares and secondary streets shall do so with a tangent section of
centerline 50 feet in length, measured from the right-of-way line of the major

of approval by the planning commission, or by the provision of a financial
guarantee of performance in the following manner:
   (1)   Performance guarantee.
      a.   Any requests made of the city council to accept a performance
guarantee deposit in lieu of completing all required improvements prior to
having the city council approve the final plat shall be confirmed in writing
and shall be accompanied by an estimate of costs of the remaining required
improvements. This estimate shall be furnished by the proprietor's engineer. It
shall be complete in all respects, including estimated quantities and unit
prices, and bear the engineer's seal of registration. If approved by the city
council, this estimate will provide the basis for the amount of performance
deposit and written agreement. Generally, the amount of performance guarantee
required will be equal to 100 percent of the proprietor's engineer's estimate,
following review by the city engineer's estimate and agreement, plus 25 percent
of such estimate for contingencies. The agreement may further stipulate that
the deposit shall be rebated to the proprietor, or an appropriate reduction in
the security, in the amounts equal to the cost of completed units of work
stipulated in the agreement prepared pursuant to this section, and satisfactory
accomplishment of the construction milestones.
      b.   The performance guarantee shall either be a cash deposit or a
certified check, or an irrevocable letter of credit, deposited by the
subdivider with the city treasurer or a responsible escrow agent or trust
company, subject to the approval of the city council and the city attorney.
      c.   The agreement will be so written that any part of the performance
deposit, as required, may be used to reimburse the city for costs incurred in
connection with the examination and inspection of the required improvements.
      d.   If the developer shall in any case fail to complete such work within
such period, as required by the conditions of the guarantee, the city shall
have such work completed. In order to reimburse itself for the cost expense,
the city council may appropriate funds from the deposit which the subdivider
deposits in lieu of the required improvements.
   (2)   Maintenance bond. Prior to acceptance by the city of required
improvements, a one-year maintenance bond in an amount set by the city council
shall be posted by the subdivider.
   (3)   Inspections.
      a.   Inspectors authorized by the city council shall be required to
review construction of all required improvements on a continuous basis. In no
case shall the same engineer provide services to both the city and the
subdivider.
      b.   It shall be the responsibility of the improvements contractors to
notify the office of the city manager at least three days in advance for the
following periodic inspections:
          1.   Storm and sanitary sewers, water lines, mains, laterals, and
catch basins before the trenches are backfilled.
          2.   Forms set for curb and gutter subbase has been put in place and
before the concrete is poured.

          4.   All subgrade that has been shaped and rolled, before compaction
test is made.
         5.   Forms for pavement before any concrete is poured.
           6.   All base courses.
       c.   No work covered by the bond shall be accepted or bond released
until these inspections have been made and work found satisfactory.
       d.   The agreement to install required public improvements shall also
provide for the checking of improvements and plans and continuous inspections
of all improvements by the city and for costs of such services which shall be
borne by the subdivider.
    (4)   Sidewalks and street trees.  For required improvements consisting of
sidewalk and street trees, the proprietor may elect to provide a performance
guarantee deposit in an amount equal to 15 percent of the engineers' estimates
of such cost, plus 25 percent of such deposit for contingencies, provided the
proprietor shall:
       a.   Submit for approval with the final plat building and use
restrictions in recordable form, approved by the city attorney, requiring that
each owner construct sidewalks to city specifications along all street rights-
of-way abutting the lot or parcel and to plant according to city specifications
required street trees within the right-of-way before occupying any residence on
any lot. These building and use restrictions shall be recorded with the
register of deeds with the final plat.
       b.   Provide to each purchaser of any undeveloped lot or parcel within
the subdivision prior to closing written notice that the owner shall bear the
legal and financial responsibility of constructing public sidewalks and
installing required street trees within the public right-of-way according to
city specifications as a prior condition to lawful occupancy of any dwelling to
be constructed. This duty shall be binding on the proprietor and his heirs,
personal representatives, successors or assigns; and no such person shall fail
to provide such notice.
       c.   Agree that should any required sidewalks or street trees within the
subdivision not be constructed or installed by subsequent purchasers within six
years following final plat approval, that the city may proceed to complete the
improvements; and the city council may appropriate the costs from the
performance guarantee deposit as provided in subsection (b)(1) of this section.

Sec. 75-56. Contractual effect of article.
(a)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 15(a)(5) of the Act to the
contrary, a contract between the city and the sponsor with the authority as
third party beneficiary thereunder to provide tax exemption and accept in lieu
of taxes, as previously described, is effected by enactment of this article.
(b)   Notwithstanding the contractual effect of this article, this article may
be repealed by further ordinance of the Mason city council in the event that

shall remain delinquent for more than two years.
(Ord. No. 253, 9-3-2024)
Sec. 75-57. Payment of service charge.
The service charge in lieu of taxes as determined hereunder shall be payable
and collected in the same manner as general property taxes are payable to the

the several units levying the general property tax in the same proportion as
prevailed with the general property tax in the previous calendar year. Failure
to pay the service charge on or before July 1 of each year shall result in the
service charge being subject to 1% interest per month until paid. If any amount
of the annual service charge or accrued interest shall remain unpaid as of
December 31 of each year, the amount unpaid shall be a lien upon the real
property constituting the Temple Senior housing development upon the city
treasurer filing a certificate of non-payment of the service charge, together
with an affidavit of proof of service of the certificate of non-payment upon
the sponsor with the Ingham County register of deeds, and proceedings may then
be had to enforce the lien as provided by law for the foreclosure of tax liens
upon real property.

loan, foreclosure of the mortgage loan or sale of the housing development to an

Revenue Code or an entity controlled by a 501(c)(3) organization, this article
shall automatically terminate.
(Ord. No. 253, 9-3-2024)
Sec. 75-59. Severability.
The various sections and provisions of this article shall be deemed to be
severable and should any section or provision of this article be declared by

conduct a public hearing to consider repeal of this article. Said public
hearing shall be held only after the owner(s) of said Temple Senior Housing
Apartments project and the Michigan state housing development authority have

(Ord. No. 144, 5-16-2005)
Sec. 82-157. State and local requirements.
State requirements and limitations on discharge shall apply in any case where
they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in
this division. Local requirements and limitations shall apply in any case where
they are more stringent than state or federal requirements.
(Ord. No. 144, 5-16-2005)
Sec. 82-158. Pretreatment required.
If any such wastewaters or waters as described in sections
82-151 through
82-156 are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the WWTP, which
contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in this
division, or which in the judgment of the Authority may have a deleterious
effect upon the WWTP or receiving waters, or which otherwise creates hazards to
life or constitute a public nuisance, the city may, where necessary in the
opinion of the Authority:
   (1)   Reject the waste.
   (2)   Require the owner to control the quantities and rates of discharge of
such waters or waste to meet all applicable state and federal regulations,
including the NPDES permit.
   (3)   Require the owner to provide, at the oswner' sole expense, such
preliminary treatment as may be necessary to:
      a.   Reduce the BOD to 300 parts per million, the suspended solids to 350
mg/l,and the chlorine demands to 50 mg/l; and/or
      b.   Reduce objectionable characteristics or constituents to within the
maximum limits provided in sections

(Ord. No. 144, 5-16-2005; Ord. No. 245, 11-20-2023)
Sec. 82-159. Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
If upon the promulgation of the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards for
a particular industrial subcategory the federal standard is more stringent,
then limitations imposed under the federal standard for sources in that
subcategory shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this
division. The Authority shall notify all affected users of the applicable
reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12.
(Ord. No. 144, 5-16-2005)
Sec. 82-160. Modification of Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
Where the city WWTP facility achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited
by pretreatment standards, the city may, at the request of a user, apply to the
Approval Authority for modification of specific limits in the pretreatment
standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean the reduction in the amount of a
pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater
treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is
achieved by the system in 95% of the samples taken measured according to the
procedures set forth in section 40 CFR 403.7(c)(2). The city may then modify
pollutant discharge limits and the pretreatment standards if the requirements
contained in 40 CFR 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the Approval
Authority is obtained. Any user requesting application for modification shall
reimburse the city for all costs of testing and data compilation required by 40
CFR 403.7.
(Ord. No. 144, 5-16-2005; Ord. No. 245, 11-20-2023)
Sec. 82-161. Construction and maintenance of pretreatment facilities.
(a)   Where pretreatment facilities are required by the city, plans,
specifications and other pertinent information relating to proposed preliminary
treatment, including a semiannual report of progress regarding compliance with
pretreatment standards, shall be submitted for approval by the city manager;
and no construction of such facility shall be commenced until such approvals
are obtained in writing.
(b)   Where pretreatment facilities are provided for any wastewater or waste,
they shall be maintained in satisfactory and effective operation at all times
by the owner at the owner's sole expense.
(c)   The owner shall regularly submit a wastewater treatment report to the
city as often as required by the permit. Such report shall include all
measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of wastewater and waste
as referred to in this section and any other pertinent information as may be
required by the city.
(d)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of wastewater
and wastes to which reference is made in this division shall be determined in
accordance with standard methods for examination of water and wastewater and
federal guidelines establishing the procedures for the analysis of pollutants,
and shall be determined at the monitoring facility provided for in section 82-
189 or upon suitable samples taken at such monitoring facility. If no special
monitoring facility is available, sampling shall be at the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected.
(e)   Every industrial or commercial entity operating a pretreatment or control
facility which discharges wastewater or liquid wastes into the public sewer
(sanitary, combined, or storm) shall have the waste treatment or control
facilities under the specific supervision and control of a person who has been
certified by the state department of environmental quality as being properly
qualified to operate the facilities under the requirements of law.
(Ord. No. 144, 5-16-2005; Ord. 222, § 53, 12-3-2018)
Sec. 82-162. Alternate calculation of limits.
(a)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only
in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Authority may convert
the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant
discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating
effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
(b)   When calculating equivalent mass-per-day limitations under this section,
the Authority shall calculate such limitations by multiplying the limits in the
standard by the industrial user's average rate of production. This average rate
of production shall be based not upon the designed production capacity but
rather upon a reasonable measure of the industrial user's actual long- term
daily production, such as the average daily production during a representative
year. For new sources, actual production shall be estimated using projected
production.
(c)   When calculating equivalent concentration limitations, the Authority
shall calculate such limitations by dividing the mass limitations by the
average daily flow rate of the industrial user's regulated process wastewater.
This average daily flow rate shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the
industrial user's actual long-term average flow rate such as the average daily
flow rate during the representative year.
(d)   Equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with this section shall
be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of Section 307(d) of the Act
and this Code. Industrial users will be required to comply with the equivalent
limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the
equivalent limitations were derived.
(e)   If categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating
maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum
monthly average, or four-day average limitations, where applied, the same
production of flow figure shall be used in calculating both types of equivalent
limitations.
(f)   Any industrial user operating under a control mechanism incorporating
equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production based
standard shall notify the Authority within two business days after the user has
a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change
within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the Authority of such
anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in
its control mechanism that were based on the original estimate of the long-term
average production rate.
(Ord. No. 144, 5-16-2005)
Sec. 82-163. Compliance deadline, existing source, new sources.
Compliance by existing sources with categorical pretreatment standards shall be
within three years of the date the standard is effective unless a shorter
compliance time is specified in the appropriate subpart of 40 CFR Chapter I,
Subchapter N. Existing sources which become industrial users subsequent to
promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall be
considered existing industrial users except where such sources meet the
definition of a new source. New sources shall install and have in operating
condition, and shall start up all pollution control equipment required to meet
applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the
shortest feasible time (not to exceed 90 days), new sources must meet all
applicable pretreatment standards.
(Ord. No. 144, 5-16-2005)
Sec. 82-164. Dilution prohibited.
Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment
standard or requirement, no industrial user shall ever increase the use of
process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial
or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a
pretreatment standard or requirement. The Authority may impose mass limitations
on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass
limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. No. 144, 5-16-2005)
Sec. 82-165. Accidental discharges, operating upsets and slug loads.
(a)   Protection. Each categorical and noncategorical user shall provide
necessary protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other
substances regulated by this division. Facilities to prevent accidental
discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the
owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city
for review when required, and shall be approved by the city before construction
of the facility. All existing users who are required to provide such a plan
shall complete such a plan by May 1, 1985. No user who commences contribution
to the WWTP after the effective date of this division shall be permitted to
introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have
been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating
procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to
modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this
division.
(b)   Oral notice. In the case of an accidental discharge or operations upset
which places the user in a temporary state of noncompliance with this division
or which could cause problems to the WWTP, including any slug loadings as
defined by section
82-153(14), it is the responsibility of the user to immediately (within 24
hours) telephone and notify the Authority of the incident. The notification
shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume,
and corrective actions.
(c)   Written notice.
   (1)   Within five days following oral notification of an accidental
discharge or operations upset, the user shall submit to the Authority a
detailed written report containing the following:
      a.   Description of the upset, cause and impact on the discharger's
compliance status.
      b.   Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times. If
noncompliance is to continue, a statement addressing when compliance can
reasonably be expected to occur.
      c.   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of noncompliance.
   (2)   Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to person
or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil
penalties or other liability which may be opposed by this section or other
applicable law.
(d)   Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the
event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who
may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the
emergency notification procedures.

   (11)   Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the city to ensure
compliance with this article.
(e)   Net/gross calculation of limits.
   (1)   Adjustment authorized. The Authority may adjust the categorical
pretreatment standards to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial
user's intake water in accordance with this subsection.
   (2)   Application. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake
pollutants must make application to the Authority. Upon request of the
industrial user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis
(i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the
requirements of subsections (d)(3)and (4) of this section are met.
   (3)   Criteria. The industrial user must demonstrate that the control system
it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards
would, if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the absence of
pollutants in the intake waters.
   (4)   Credit. Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be
granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the
generic measure in the user's effluent are substantially similar to the
constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate
additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall
or elsewhere.
(f)   Permit duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not
to exceed five years. A permit may be issued for a period less than a year or
may be stated to expire on a specific date. The user shall apply for permit
reissuance a minimum of 180 days prior to the expiration of the user's existing
permit. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification
by the city during the term of the permit as limitations or requirements as
identified in subsection (d)(2) are modified or other just cause exists. The
user shall be informed of any proposed changes in his permit at least 30 days
prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the
permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
(g)   Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific
user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be
reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new source, different
premises, or a new or changed operation without the approval of the city. Any
succeeding owner or user shall also comply with the terms and conditions of all
existing permits.
(h)   Permit fees and charges. Each user required to obtain a wastewater
discharge permit shall reimburse the city upon demand the reasonable and
necessary cost of monitoring, inspection, surveillance and review of accidental
discharges. Such expenses shall be charged to the user at 1.4 times the lowest
hourly rate of the person qualified to perform the service and shall include
necessary equipment expense and actual cost of outside testing and consulting
services.

Sec. 82-188. Reporting requirements for permittee.
(a)   Report required. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source,
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the WWTP, any
categorical user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall
submit to the Authority a report showing the measured average daily and maximum
daily flow, in gallons per day from regulated process streams and such other
streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40
CFR 403.6(e) and identifying the pretreatment standards applicable to each
regulated process. In addition the report shall include the results of sampling
and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass where required)
of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both
daily maximum and average concentration (or mass) shall be reported. The sample
shall be representative of daily operations and shall be taken in the frequency
and manner provided by 40 CFR 403(12)(b)(5). The report shall state whether the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent
basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to
bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements.
(b)   Periodic compliance reports.
   (1)   Any user subject to a pretreatment standard after the compliance date
of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new user, after
commencement of the discharge into the WWTP, shall submit to the Authority
during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently by the
city, a report indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or
regulated substances in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment
standard. In addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. Flows shall
be reported on the basis of actual measurement; however, where cost or
feasibility considerations justify, the city may accept reports of average and
maximum flows estimated by variable techniques. At the discretion of the
Authority in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates,
holidays, budget cycles, and the like, the Authority, for good cause shown, may
agree to alter the months during which the reports are to be submitted.
      a.   If the Authority has imposed mass limitations on users, the report
required by subsection (b)(1) of this section shall indicate the mass of
pollutants regulated by pretreatment standard in the effluent of the user. For
industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits, the report
required by subsection (b)(1) shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's
long-term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable
pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the
report shall include the user's actual average production rate for the
reporting period.
      b.   Reports of users shall contain the results of sampling and analysis
of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or
production and mass where requested by the Authority, of pollutants contained
in the discharge which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standard. The
report shall be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and
analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which data is
representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The
frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed by the Authority to assess and
assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements. All analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established by the Authority pursuant to Section 304(h) of the Act and
contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto, or with any other test
procedures approved by the Authority. Sampling shall be performed in accordance
with the techniques approved by the Authority.
      c.   Where 40 CFR, Part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical
technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication
"Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening" or amendments thereto, or with
any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the Authority.
   (3)   If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the
user shall notify the Authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the Authority within 30 days after becoming
aware of the violation.
(c)   Reporting requirements, noncategorical discharges. Industrial users with
discharges which are not subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall
submit at least once every six months (on dates specified by the Authority)
such reports as the Authority deems necessary to verify compliance with all of
the general discharge limitations and prohibitions of this article as required
by 40 CFR 403.12(h).
(d)   Base line monitoring report.
   (1)   At least 90 days prior to the commencement of discharge, new sources,
and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an
applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the Authority a
report which contains estimates of the measured average daily and maximum daily
flow of process streams and waste streams and flow and amount of regulated
pollutants in the form and containing the information required by the state
pretreatment standards Part 23, R 323.2310(a) - (e), and shall include in this
report information on the method of pretreatment intended to be used to meet
the applicable pretreatment standards.
   (2)   Industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall
report to the Authority any changes to the information requested in subsection
(d)(1) within 60 days of such change.
(e)   Report of substantial change in pollutants. Any industrial user shall
promptly notify the WWTP in advance of any substantial change in the volume or
character of pollutants in its discharge, including all of the following, if
applicable:
   (1)   Groundwaters that are purged for remedial action programs.
   (2)   Groundwaters containing pollutants that infiltrate into the sewers.
   (3)   The listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the
nondomestic user has submitted initial notification as required by 40 CFR Part
261 (1990) and the state pretreatment regulations Part 23, R 232.2310(15).
(f)   Hazardous waste report.
   (1)   Any industrial user shall notify the WWTP, the EPA regional waste
management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing
of any discharge into the WWTP of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of,
would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the
name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste
number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the
industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar
month to the WWTP, the notification shall also contain the following
information if known and readily available to the industrial user:
      a.   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes;
      b.   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in
the wastestream discharged during that calendar month; and
      c.   An estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream
expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
      Industrial users who commence discharging shall provide the notification
no later than 180 days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic
hazardous waste. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only
once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed
discharges must be submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(j). The notification
requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under
the self-monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b), (d), and (e).
   (2)   a.   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of this subsection
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-
acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a one-
time notification.
      b.   Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more
than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
   (3)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the
WWTP, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state
hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days
of the effective date of such regulations.
   (4)   In the case of any notification made under this subsection, the
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous waste generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
(g)   Signatory requirements. All reports required by this section shall
contain the certification statement as set forth in 40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii) and
shall be signed as follows:
   (1)   By a responsible corporate officer, if the industrial user submitting
the reports required by subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section is a
corporation. For the purpose of this subsection, a “responsible corporate
officer" means:
      a.   A president, secretary, treasurer or vice-president of the
corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who
performs similar policy or decision-making functions for the corporation; or
      b.   The manager of one or more manufacturing, production or operation
facilities employing more than 250 persons or having gross annual sales or
expenditures exceeding $25,000,000 in second-quarter 1980 dollars), if
authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in
accordance with corporate procedures.
   (2)   By a general partner or proprietor if the industrial user submitting
the reports required by subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section is a
partnership or sole proprietorship respectively.
   (3)   By a duly authorized representative of the individual designated in
subsection (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section if:
      a.   The authorization is made in writing by the individual described in
subsection (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section;
      b.   The authorization specifies either an individual or a position
having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility from which the
industrial discharge originates, such as the position of plant manager,
operator of a well, or well field superintendent, or a position of equivalent
responsibility for environmental matters for the company; and
      c.   The written authorization is submitted to the city.
   (4)   If an authorization under subsection (g)(3) of this section is no
longer accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility
for the overall operation of the facility, or overall responsibility for
environmental matters for the company, a new authorization satisfying the
requirements of subsections (g)(1), (2) or (3) of this section must be
submitted to the city prior to or together with any reports to be signed by an
authorized representative.

Sec. 82-189. Monitoring facilities.
(a)   The city shall require to be provided and operated at the user's own
expense monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises; but the
city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
(b)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to
allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
(c)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notifications by the city.
(Ord. No. 144, 5-16-2005)
Sec. 82-190. Inspection and sampling.
The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the
purpose of this article is being met and all requirements are being complied
with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the city or their representative ready access at all
reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of their duties. The
city, Approval Authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's
property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security
measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance
before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements
with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the city, Approval Authority and EPA will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.
(Ord. No. 144, 5-16-2005)
Sec. 82-191. Pretreatment.
(a)   Users shall provide necessary wastewater pretreatment as required to
comply with this division and shall achieve compliance with all Federal
Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as specified by
the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat
wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and
maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review
and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The
review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this division. Any
subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall
be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of
the changes.
(b)   The city shall annually publish in the county newspaper a list of the
users which were in significant noncompliance with any pretreatment
requirements or standards at least once during the 12 previous months in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(vii). For purposes of this section, the term
"significant noncompliance" shall have the meaning ascribed to it by 40 CFR
403.8(f)(2)(vii).
(Ord. No. 144, 5-16-2005)
Sec. 82-192. Bypass of pretreatment facilities.
(a)   Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this
section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except
where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an
industrial user's treatment facility.
Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to
the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial
and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic
loss caused by delays in production.
(b)   Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or requirements.
An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section.
(c)   Notice.
   (1)   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the Authority, if possible at least ten days
before the date of the bypass.
   (2)   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass
that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the Authority within 24 hours
from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial
user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including
exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Authority may
waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been
received within 24 hours.
(d)   Prohibition of bypass.
   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the city may take enforcement action against
an industrial user for a bypass unless:
      a.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or
severe property damage.
      b.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance.
      c.   The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection
(c) of this section.
   (2)   The Authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the Authority determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section.
(Ord. No. 144, 5-16-2005)
Sec. 82-193. Confidential information.
(a)   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires,
permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall
be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction
unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Authority that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection
as trade secrets of the user.
(b)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written
request to governmental agencies for uses related to this article, the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, state disposal system
permit and/or the pretreatment programs; however, such portions of a report
shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review
or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information.
(c)   Information accepted by the Authority as confidential shall not be
transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the city
until and unless a ten-day notification is given to the user.

Sec. 82-248. Additional water and sanitary sewer connection charges.
(a)   In cases where the property to be connected to the system has not
participated directly in the cost of the system improvements which specifically
benefit the property or been assessed the cost by special assessment, an
additional water and/or sanitary sewer connection charge shall be paid prior to
the making of any service connection, based upon a share of the total cost of
construction of such improvements as determined by the percentage by which the
frontage and/or acreage of the connecting property bears to the frontage and/or
acreage as determined by the city council, of all property which may
potentially connect to such improvements.
(b)   The city treasurer shall determine the total cost of construction,
including interest on bonded indebtedness, and shall establish a suspense
account. The total street frontage and/or acreage as determined by the city
council of all properties which may potentially connect to the system
improvement shall then be calculated, and the treasurer shall compute the
percentage of total frontage and/or acreage for each individual lot or parcel
of property which may be connected to the system improvement. Property owned by
the city shall be included in computing the total frontage and/or acreage but
shall not be subject to the additional charge. In the case of charges based on
frontage, the total cost for corner lots shall be determined by reference only
to the largest side. Each owner of property which may thereafter connect to the
system improvement, as determined from the assessor's records, shall then be
mailed a notice advising them that their property shall be subject to an
additional water and/or sanitary sewer connection charge if connected to the
system improvement in the future and stating the amount, or method of
calculating, such charge. The suspense account and the obligation to pay the
additional water and/or sanitary sewer connection charge shall expire 40 years
after completion of construction. The amount collected as an additional water
or sewer connection charge shall be placed in the capital improvement fund for
replacement, extensions, and improvements to the system.
(c)   In cases where the cost of a system improvement has been paid by a
private party directly or through special assessment, the city may enter into
an agreement with such party providing that future users who connect to the
system improvement shall be charged a capital connection fee in an amount
determined in accordance with subsection (b) above, and provide that a portion
of the additional capital charge, as determined by the city council, may be
collected and disbursed to the party paying for the construction of the

regulations shall be promulgated to provide safe transportation and shall
specify such safety equipment and regulatory devices as the police chief shall

Sec. 90-117. Designation of taxicabs.
Each taxicab shall bear on the outside of each rear door, in painted letters

vehicle shall, in the opinion of the police chief, conflict with or imitate any
color scheme, identifying design, monogram or insignia used on vehicles already
operating under this article, in such a manner as to be misleading or tend to
deceive or defraud the public. If, after a license has been issued for a
taxicab, the color scheme, identifying design, monogram or insignia is changed
so as to be, in the opinion of the police chief, in conflict with or imitate
any color scheme, identifying design, monogram or insignia used by any other
person, owner or operator, in such a manner as to be misleading or tend to

Sec. 90-118. Taximeter required.
All taxicabs operated under the authority of this article shall be equipped

illuminated. Taximeters shall be operated mechanically by a mechanism of
standard design and construction, driven either from the transmission or from
one of the front wheels by a flexible and permanently attached driving
mechanism. They shall be sealed at all points and connections which, if
manipulated, would affect their correct reading and recording. Each taximeter
shall have a flag to denote when the vehicle is employed and when it is not
employed, and it shall be the duty of the driver to throw the flag of such
taximeter into a nonrecording position at the termination of each trip.
Taximeters shall be subject to inspection by the police department. Any
inspector or other officer of the police department is authorized, either on
complaint of any person or without such complaint, to inspect any meter and,
upon discovery of any inaccuracy in the meter, to notify the person operating
the taxicab to cease operation. Thereupon the taxicab shall be kept off the

driver of any taxicab shall remain in the driver's compartment or immediately
adjacent to his vehicle at all times when such vehicle is upon the public
street; except when necessary a driver may be absent from his taxicab for not
more than five consecutive minutes; and nothing contained in this subsection
shall be held to prohibit any driver from alighting to the street or sidewalk
for the purpose of assisting passengers into or out of such vehicle.
(b)   Prohibited solicitation. No driver shall solicit patronage in a loud or

passengers, except upon one-way streets, where passengers may be discharged at
either the right- or left-hand sidewalk, or side of the roadway in the absence
of a sidewalk.
(d)   Cruising. No driver shall cruise in search of passengers except in such
areas and at such times as shall be designated by the police chief. Such areas
and times shall only be designated when the police chief finds that taxicab
cruising would not congest traffic or be dangerous to pedestrians and other
vehicles.
(e)   Solicitation of other common carrier passengers prohibited. No driver,
owner or operator shall solicit passengers at the terminal of any other common
carrier, nor at any intermediate points along any established route of any
other common carrier.
(f)   Additional passengers. No driver shall permit any other person to occupy
or ride in the taxicab unless the person first employing the taxicab shall
consent to the acceptance of additional passengers. No charge shall be made for
an additional passenger except when the additional passenger rides beyond the
previous passenger's destination, and then only for the additional distance so
traveled.
(g)   Restriction on number of passengers. No driver shall permit more persons
to be carried in a taxicab as passengers than the rated seating capacity of his
taxicab as stated in the license for the vehicle issued by the police
department. A child in arms shall not be counted as a passenger.
(h)   Refusal to carry orderly passengers prohibited. No driver shall refuse or
neglect to convey any orderly person, upon request, unless previously engaged
or unable or forbidden by the provisions of this article to do so.
(i)   Prohibitions of drivers. It shall be a violation of this article for any

patronage from one hotel to another. Neither shall such driver engage in
selling intoxicating liquors or solicit business for any house of ill repute or
use his vehicle for any purpose other than the transporting of passengers.

Sec. 90-145. Open stands; establishment; use.
(a)   The police chief of the city is authorized and empowered to establish
open stands in such places upon the streets of the city as he deems necessary
for the use of taxicabs operated in the city. The police chief shall not create
an open stand without taking into consideration the need for such stands by the
companies and the convenience to the general public. The police chief shall
prescribe the number of cabs that shall occupy such open stands. The police
chief shall not create an open stand in front of any place of business where
the abutting property owners object or where such stand would tend to create a
traffic hazard.
(b)   Open stands shall be used by the different drivers on a first come, first
served basis. The driver shall pull on to the open stand from the rear and
shall advance forward as the cabs ahead pull off. Drivers shall stay within
five feet of their cabs, and they shall not solicit passengers or engage in
loud or boisterous talk while at an open stand. Nothing in this section shall
be construed as preventing a passenger from boarding the cab of his choice that
is parked at open stands.
(Ord. No. 100, § 26, 10-3-1977)
Sec. 90-146. Call box stands; establishment; use.
(a)   Establishment. The police chief is authorized and empowered to establish
call box stands upon the streets of the city in such places as in his
discretion it deems proper. A holder desiring to establish a call box stand
shall make written application to the police chief. The applicant must attach
to the application the written approval of the abutting property owners of the
space, consenting to the creation of such stand. Upon filing of the
application, the police department shall make an investigation of the traffic
conditions at that place and shall thereafter file their written recommendation
to the police chief. The police chief shall then either grant or refuse the
application. When a call box stand has been established as provided in this
section, it shall be used solely by the holder to whom it was granted and his
agents and servants; and no other holder shall be permitted to use the stand;
however, no holder shall obtain permit for more than one such closed stand
within the downtown business area.
(b)   Use. A holder operating a call box stand as provided for in this section
shall be allowed to have on duty at such stand a starter, or other employee,
for the purpose of assisting in the loading or unloading of passengers from
cabs, for receiving calls and dispatching cabs, and for soliciting passengers
at such stand. The term "at such stand" means that part of the sidewalk
immediately adjacent to and of equal length with such call box stand. It shall
be unlawful for any such starter or other employee to go beyond the area
designated for the purpose of soliciting passengers or assisting them in
boarding such cabs.
(Ord. No. 100, § 27, 10-3-1977)
Sec. 90-147. Prohibitions of other vehicles.
Private or other vehicles for hire shall not at any time occupy the spaces upon

Sec. 90-148. Taxicab service.
All persons engaged in the taxicab business in the city operating under the

necessity shall maintain a central place of business and keep it open 24 hours
a day for the purpose of receiving calls and dispatching cabs. They shall
answer all calls received by them for services inside the corporate limits of
the city as soon as they can do so; and if services cannot be rendered within a
reasonable time, they shall notify the prospective passengers how long it will
be before the call can be answered and give the reason. Any holder who shall
refuse to accept a call anywhere in the corporate limits of the city at any
time when such holder has available cabs, or who shall fail or refuse to give
overall service, shall be deemed a violator of this article; and the
certificate granted to such holder shall be revoked at the discretion of the
police chief.
(Ord. No. 100, § 29, 10-3-1977)
Sec. 90-149. Manifests.
(a)   Every driver shall maintain a daily manifest upon which are recorded all
trips made each day, showing time and place of origin and destination of each
trip and amount of fare; and all such completed manifests shall be returned to
the owner by the driver at the conclusion of his tour of duty. The forms for
each manifest shall be furnished to the driver by the owner and shall be of a
character approved by the police chief.
(b)   Every holder of a certificate of public convenience and necessity shall
retain and preserve all drivers' manifests in a safe place for at least the
calendar year next preceding the current calendar year, and such manifests
shall be available to the police chief.

readily accessible for examination by the police chief.
(b)   Every holder shall submit reports of receipts, expenses and statistics of
operation to the police chief for each calendar year, in accordance with a
uniform system prescribed by the police chief. These reports shall reach the
police chief on or before March 1 of the year following the calendar year for
which such reports are prepared.
(c)   All accidents arising from or in connection with the operation of
taxicabs which result in death or injury to any person, or in damage to any
vehicle, or to any property in an amount exceeding the sum of $200.00 shall be
reported within 24 hours from the time of occurrence to the police department
in a form of report to be furnished by the department.
(d)   Service contract reports. It shall be mandatory for all holders of a
certificate of public convenience and necessity to file with the police chief
copies of all contracts, agreements, arrangements, memoranda or other writings
relating to the furnishing of taxicab service to any hotel, theater, hall,
public resort, railway station or other place of public gathering, whether such
arrangement is made with the holder or any corporation, firm or association
with which the holder may be interested or connected. Failure to file such
copies within seven days shall be sufficient cause for the revocation of a
certificate of any offending holder or the cancellation of any cab stand
privileges.
(Ord. No. 100, § 31, 10-3-1977)
Sec. 90-151. Advertising.
Subject to the rules and regulations of the city council, it shall be lawful
for any person owning or operating a taxicab or motor vehicle for hire to

Sec. 94-3. Legislative intent.
Zoning districts contained in this chapter each have a defined purpose and are
based upon the master plan for future development, improvement, and
redevelopment. The districts are sized to be adequate to accommodate long-term
needs, and yet must be monitored relative to any necessary changes or updating
in the future. While the various regulations limit the use of properties, the
chapter provides land owners with a range of choices, flexibility, and options

Sec. 94-62. Zoning district map.
The boundaries of the respective districts are defined and established as
depicted on the map entitled "Zoning Map of the City of Mason, Michigan," which
is an integral part of this chapter, and which, with the explanatory matter
thereon, shall be the official zoning map of the city and shall be published as
part of this chapter and is hereby incorporated by reference.
   (1)   The official zoning map of the city and subsequent amendments to the
map shall be dated, certified, and bear the signature of the city manager. The
map shall be attested to by the city clerk, and shall bear the following words:
"This is to certify that the above map is the Official Zoning Map of the City
of Mason".
    (2)   If amendments are made in district boundaries or other matters
depicted on the official zoning map, such changes shall not be considered
final, and a building permit shall not be issued, until the appropriate
amendments have been made on the official zoning map. Such amendments shall be
made within ten working days after the effective date of the ordinance
amendment. Each amendment shall be accompanied by a reference number on the map
which shall refer to the official ordinance amendment adopted by the city
council. One copy of the official zoning map shall be maintained and kept up-
to-date in the office of the city clerk.
    (3)   In the event that the official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed,
lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes made
thereto, the city council may, by ordinance, adopt a new official zoning map
which shall supersede the prior official zoning map. The new official zoning
map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions on the prior official
zoning map, but no such corrections shall have the effect of amending the
zoning ordinance or the prior official zoning map. The new official zoning map
shall comply with subsection (1) of this section. Unless the prior official
zoning map has been lost, or has been totally destroyed, the prior map or any
significant parts which remain, shall be preserved together with all available
records pertaining to its adoption or amendment.
    (4)   If because of the scale, lack of details, or illegibility of the
official zoning map, there is any uncertainty, contradiction, or conflict
regarding the intended location of any district boundaries shown on the map,
the following shall govern:
       a.   Where boundaries follow streets or highways, the centerline of the
street or highway shall be the boundary line or lines.
       b.   Where a zoning district is bounded by a stream, lake or other body
of water, and in the event of change in the shoreline, the boundary of said
district shall be the thread of a stream or the actual shoreline of a lake or
other body of water.
       c.   A boundary indicated as approximately following a recorded lot line
or the line bounding a tax parcel shall be construed as following such line.
       d.   A boundary indicated as following the municipal boundary line of
the city shall be construed as following such line.
       e.   A boundary indicated as following a railroad line shall be
construed as following the railroad right-of-way.
       f.   A distance not specifically indicated in the official zoning map
shall be determined by the scale of the map to the nearest foot.
      g.   Should the above not fully explain a question of boundaries, the
zoning board of appeals shall have the authority to make an interpretation
based upon the aforementioned standards and after receiving a recommendation
from the planning commission.

ARTICLE IV. ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS
Sec. 94-121. General intent and purpose, permitted uses, and dimensional
regulations.
(a)   General intent and purpose. It is the purpose of every district defined
in this article to protect sensitive environmental resources and to ensure that
all uses are adequately served by public facilities and services including
sewage disposal, potable water, fire protection, streets, and sidewalks. Each
district is intended to accommodate permitted uses and structures in a manner
that minimizes negative impacts on abutting properties and complements the
unique character and identity of the city through appropriate architectural
design including building size, building height, building materials, building
location, signage, landscaping, buffering, safe circulation of vehicular and
pedestrian traffic, and other pertinent development features.
(b)   Permitted uses. The use regulations established in this article are
uniform throughout this chapter for each zoning district and shall be applied
consistently to each class of land, building or structure within each district
in order to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the
residents of the city. A use of land or structures not specifically mentioned
in the provisions of this chapter shall, upon application, be classified by the
zoning official who may seek the recommendation of the planning commission
prior to making a final determination. Uses that are contrary to federal, state
or local laws or ordinances are prohibited. Within each zoning district there
are three permitted categories of use defined as follows:
   (1)   Uses permitted by right. No structure or land shall be used and no
structure constructed except for one or more of the uses specified as uses
permitted by right unless otherwise provided for in this chapter.
   (2)   Accessory uses. A use of land or of a structure, or portion thereof,
which is customarily and naturally incidental to, subordinate to, and devoted
exclusively to the principal use of the land or structure and located on the
same lot with the principal use.
   (3)   Uses authorized by special use permit. A use of land or of a
structure, or portion thereof, which may be permitted through the application
and approval of a special use permit as provided for in article VI of this
chapter.
(c)   General development standards. This subsection defines general
development standards for each zoning district. Any use of land or structures
shall comply with these development standards unless otherwise provided for in
this chapter in addition to all applicable federal, state, and local
requirements.
   (1)   Dimensional regulations.
      a.   Lot dimensional regulations.
         1.   See table 100-1 in chapter 100 and related footnotes.
         2.   See section
74-133(a) in chapter 74.
      b.   Building dimensional regulations. See table 100-2 in chapter 100 and
related footnotes.
   (2)   Site plan review. Refer to division 1 of article VII of this chapter.
   (3)   Signage requirements. Refer to chapter 58.

Sec. 94-122. AG: Single-family agriculture district.
(a)   Intent and purpose.  It is the primary purpose of this district to
provide opportunities for the continuation of agricultural activities while
also providing opportunities for single-family residential development patterns
and lifestyles of a more rural and suburban character than provided elsewhere
in the city. It is also expected that property within this district may
transition to other more intensive uses. It is the intent of this district that
development ensure a stable and healthy residential environment with suitable
open spaces. The lot area requirements contained herein are minimum
requirements but larger lot areas may be required where natural site conditions
dictate and/or public sewer or water is not available. Persons considering
residing within this district should be aware that the traditional odors,
noises, dust, pesticide applications, and other generally recognized
agricultural activities associated with farming may continue on a long term
basis in this district. However, in light of the comparatively high-density
character of the city and the associated concentration of persons and families,
including school and religious facilities, intensive agricultural activities
such as large concentrated livestock operations are not considered appropriate
uses in this district.
(b)   Uses permitted by right.
   (1)   Single-family dwelling.
   (2)   Farm as defined in chapter 1 that does not include farm animals except
as specified in section 122(c).
   (3)   Public and private conservation areas and structures for the
conservation of water, soils, open space, forest, and wildlife resources (refer
to section
94-192(8)).
   (4)   Public areas, such as forest preserves, game refuges, forest type
recreation areas, and similar public uses of low intensity residential

Secs. 94-153—94-160. Reserved.
Sec. 94-161. PUD: Planned unit development district.
(a)   Intent and purpose. It is the purpose of this district to establish
provisions for the submission, review and approval of applications for specific
development proposals that rely on more flexible land use and development
standards than would normally be permitted by other districts. Such
developments shall be authorized as "planned unit developments" pursuant to
Section 4b of the City/Village zoning Act. It is the purpose of this district
that such PUD districts and development be established only where it is
determined that such approval supports the objectives of this chapter and
results in a benefit to the community that would not otherwise be realized
under traditional district provisions. Such benefit may address innovation in
land use and site layout; economy and efficiency in the use of land, natural
resources, energy, and the providing of public services and utilities; useful
open space; improved housing, employment, and shopping opportunities; and
greater compatibility of design and use with the characteristics of the project
area and between neighboring properties. This district and its provisions is
not intended as a device for ignoring this chapter or the planning upon which
it is based. To this end, the provisions of this section are intended to result
in land use and development substantially consistent with the planned
development pattern for the city, with modifications and departures from
generally applicable chapter requirements made in accordance with standards
provided in this section to ensure appropriate, fair, and consistent decision
making.
(b)   Uses permitted by right. Any land use authorized in this chapter is
permitted in this district as a principal use provided that public health,
safety, and welfare are not impaired and the essential character of the
proposed development meets the general intent of the Master Plan. Where the
Master Plan provides for residential development patterns, commercial and other
non-residential uses may be permitted as part of a development which also
contains a residential component, provided that the applicant demonstrates that
the residential uses will be predominant. The planning commission shall
determine predominance of use after taking into account the following criteria:
   (1)   The extent to which a non-residential use serves residents in the
development compared to others who travel to the site.
   (2)   The amount of traffic generated by the non-residential use.
   (3)   The operational hours of the non-residential use.
   (4)   The proportional land area allocated to the non-residential use.
   (5)   The building area allocated to the non-residential use.
(c)   Permitted accessory uses. Any accessory use authorized in this chapter is
permitted in this district if such use is consistent with the requirements of
subsection (b).
(d)   Uses authorized by special permit. Any use authorized by special use
permit in this chapter is permitted in this district as if such uses were
permitted by right. No special use permits are required in this district.
(e)   Site development standards and deviations. The site development standards
for all proposed individual land uses and facilities in this district shall
conform to this chapter and any applicable sections of this code, including
such standards pertaining to lot area and dimensions, density, lot coverage,
setbacks, building height, parking, loading, landscaping and screening, road
widths, and similar requirements, except that the city council may permit
deviations from such standards where such deviations will result in a higher
quality of development than would be possible without the deviations.
   (1)   Except where a deviation is granted, standards pertaining to lot area
and dimensions, density, lot coverage, and setbacks shall comply with those
standards of the district which most closely characterizes the dominant
character of the development.
   (2)   Except where a deviation is granted, mixed uses shall comply with the
regulations applicable for each individual use, including those standards
contained in article VI, of this chapter. If regulations are inconsistent with
each other, the regulations applicable to the most dominant use shall apply.
   (3)   Deviation from development standards may be authorized only upon a
finding by the city council that there are adequate features or planning
mechanisms designed into the project to achieve the objectives intended to be
accomplished with respect to each of the standards from which a departure is
sought.
(f)   PUD is a separate district. A PUD is permitted only in association with a
PUD District. The approval of a PUD shall require an amendment to the Zoning
Map constituting a part of this chapter so as to designate the property "PUD",
and the PUD shall be subject to the approved PUD application including a site
plan.
(g)   Minimum eligibility criteria. The following minimum eligibility criteria
shall be met for PUD approval.
   (1)   Recognizable and substantial benefit. The development shall result in
a recognizable and substantial benefit to the ultimate users of the project and
to the community. Such benefit must otherwise be unfeasible or unlikely under
the regulations of other districts.
   (2)   Availability and capacity of public services. The proposed type and
intensity of use shall not result in an unreasonable burden on public services,
facilities, and utilities.
   (3)   Compatibility with the master plan. The proposed development shall be
in accordance with the goals and policies of the City of Mason Master Plan.
   (4)   Compatibility with the intent and purpose. The proposed development
shall be consistent with the intent and purpose as stated in subsection (a).
   (5)   Economic impact. The proposed development shall not impede the
continued use or development of surrounding properties for uses permitted on
such properties.
   (6)   Unified control of property. The proposed development shall be under
single ownership or control such that there is a single person or entity having
responsibility for completing the project in conformity with this chapter and
the specifications of the PUD approval. This provision shall not prohibit a
transfer of ownership or control, upon due notice to the zoning official.
(h)   Approval procedure.
   (1)   Optional preapplication conference. Prior to the submission of a
preliminary site plan for PUD approval, the applicant may request a meeting
with one or more representatives of the planning commission and city council,
together with such consultants and other officials and staff as either the city
or the applicant deem appropriate. The purpose of the meeting is to inform city
officials of the general theme for the proposed development and to provide the
potential applicant with information regarding land development policies,
procedures, standards and requirements of the city pertaining to the proposed
development. Statements made in the course of a preapplication conference shall
not be legally binding commitments. At or prior to the preapplication
conference (or conferences), the applicant may present a general sketch plan of
the proposed PUD that provides an overview of the proposed project.
   (2)   Preliminary plan: application, public hearing, and action.
      a.   The applicant shall submit to the zoning official 20 copies of a PUD
application supplied by the zoning official, which shall also include a
preliminary site plan. The zoning official shall forward copies to the planning
commission. The preliminary site plan shall comply with the requirements of
division 1 of article VII of this chapter and include a detailed text
description of the proposed development and all requirements from which the
applicant is seeking a departure. The zoning official shall transmit copies of
the PUD application to other agencies and individuals selected to review such
plans including city staff, city consultants, the county drain commissioner,
and the county road commission.
      b.   The planning commission shall review the application, including
comments by any reviewing agencies or individuals, and shall be entitled to
make reasonable inquiries of and receive answers from the applicant. Following
review of the application, including the preliminary site plan, the planning
commission shall act on the application as if it were an application for
rezoning, and in doing so, shall follow the provisions of article XII of this
chapter.
      c.   Following the public hearing and any fact finding and additional
studies, the planning commission shall prepare written findings regarding the
application's conformance with the applicable requirements of this chapter,
including the site plan approval standards of division 1 of article VII of this
chapter and the special use approval standards of section 94-191(f). The
planning commission shall recommend to the city council to approve, deny, or
approve with conditions the application, including the preliminary site plan.
The planning commission shall prepare and transmit a report to the city council
stating its conclusions and recommendation, the basis for its decision, and any
recommended conditions relating to an affirmative decision.
      d.   After holding a public hearing on the application with notice as
provided in section
94-101 of this chapter, the city council shall take final action to approve,
deny, or approve with conditions the application, including the preliminary
site plan. In reviewing the application, the city council shall consider the
applicable requirements of this chapter, including the site plan approval
standards of division 1 of article VII of this chapter and the special use
approval standards of section
94-191(f). The city council shall prepare and transmit a report to the
applicant stating its conclusions and decision, the basis for its decision, and
any conditions relating to an affirmative decision. The effect of city council
approval of the application shall be:
         1.   To authorize the fundamental PUD character and layout embodied in
the preliminary plan, including any conditions applied to the approval, prior
to the preparation of a final site plan.
         2.   To authorize a change to the zoning map to classify the subject
property as PUD upon approval of the final site plan by the city council.
   (3)   Final plan and permit issuance:
      a.   Within 24 months following receipt of preliminary plan approval, the
applicant shall submit to the zoning official 20 copies of a final plan, or
phase one of a final plan, including a final site plan conforming with division
1 of article VII of this chapter and including a detailed text description of
the proposed development and all regulations from which the applicant is
requesting a departure. If the final plan has not been submitted within such
period, the preliminary plan approval shall become null and void unless the
city council extends the time for submission of the final plan upon a showing
by the applicant that no material change of circumstances has occurred having
bearing on the original action of the city council.
      b.   The zoning official shall record the date of the receipt of the
final site plan and transmit copies to the planning commission and other
agencies or individuals selected to review such plans including city staff,
city consultants, the county drain commissioner, and the county road
commission.
      c.   The planning commission shall review the final plan and shall be
entitled to make reasonable inquiries of and receive answers from the
applicant. The planning commission shall prepare and transmit a report to the
city council stating its conclusions and recommendation, the basis for its
recommendation, and any conditions relating to an affirmative decision. The
planning commission shall recommend to the city council to approve, deny, or
approve with conditions the final plan. The city council shall take final
action to approve, deny, or approve with conditions the final plan. In
reviewing the final plan, the city council shall consider the applicable
requirements of this chapter, including the site plan approval standards of
division 1 of article VII of this chapter and the special use approval
standards of section 94-191(f). The city council shall prepare and transmit a
report to the applicant stating its conclusions and decision, the basis for its
decision, and any conditions relating to an affirmative decision.
      d.   If and when the final site plan is approved, all improvements and
use of the property shall be in conformity with the final site plan and any
conditions imposed. The applicant shall record an affidavit with the register
of deeds containing the legal description of the entire project, specifying the
date of approval, and declaring that all future improvements will be carried
out in accordance with the approved PUD unless a revision is approved by the
city council upon request or approval of the applicant or applicant's
transferee and/or assignees. Upon receipt of the recorded documents, the zoning
official shall issue a permit for that portion of the PUD project receiving
final site plan approval and the city administrator shall amend the zoning map
of the city.
(i)   Phasing.
   (1)   Where a project is proposed for construction in phases, the project
shall be so designed that each phase, when completed, shall be capable of
standing on its own in terms of the presence of services, facilities, and open
space, and shall contain the necessary components to insure protection of
natural resources and the health, safety and welfare of the users of the PUD
and residents, businesses and properties of the surrounding area.
   (2)   In developments that include mixed components such as residential and
commercial, the city council may require that a specified portion of one
component be constructed prior to the initiation of construction of other
components, to ensure the intent and spirit of the PUD as approved. For
example, if a city area is planned for predominantly residential development
and a PUD application is approved that consists of both residential and
commercial components, the city council may require that a certain portion of
the residences be constructed prior to the initiation of construction of the
commercial component.

(d)   Wireless telecommunications towers and antennas. The purpose of this
section is to establish the procedures and guidelines for the siting of
wireless communications towers and antennas. In furtherance of this purpose,
the city shall give due consideration to the master plan, zoning map, existing
land uses, and environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites for the
location of towers and antennas, subject to the following definitions, review
requirements, and criteria. The objectives of this section are to:
   (1)   Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts
of towers and antennas;
   (2)   Direct the location of towers to appropriate nonresidential areas;
   (3)   Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
   (4)   Encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a primary
option rather than construction of additional single-use towers;
   (5)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent
possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
   (6)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that
minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through careful
design, positioning, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging
techniques;
   (7)   Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to
provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently;
   (8)   Consider the public health and safety of communication towers;
   (9)   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through engineering and careful siting of tower structures.
   (10)   Applicability. All towers or antennas in the city shall be subject to
these regulations, except as provided in the following.
      a.   Amateur radio station operators/receive-only antennas. Other than
the provisions of subsections
94-173(d)(11)e. and f., this chapter shall not govern any tower, or the
installation of any antenna, that is under 70 feet in height and is owned by or
operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator or is used
exclusively for receive-only antennas.
      b.   AM array. For purposes of implementing this chapter, an AM array,
consisting of one or more tower units and supporting ground system which
functions as one AM broadcasting antenna, shall be considered one tower.
Measurements for setbacks and separation distances shall be measured from the
outer perimeter of the towers included in the AM array. Additional tower units
may be added within the perimeter of the AM array by right.
   (11)   General requirements.
      a.   Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered
either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use of an existing
structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or
tower on such lot.
      b.   Lot size. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a
tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including
setback requirements, lot-coverage requirements, and other such requirements,
the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or
towers may be located on leased parcels within such lot.
      c.   Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following
requirements:
         1.   Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or,
subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so
as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
         2.   At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related
structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures,
screening, and landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting and
surrounding buildings.
         3.   If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral
color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the
supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
      d.   Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required
by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting
alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the
surrounding views.
      e.   State or federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed
current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of
the state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and
antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the
towers and antennas governed by this chapter shall bring such towers and
antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six
months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a
different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal
agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised
standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower
or antenna at the owner's expense.
      f.   Building codes and safety standards. To ensure the structural
integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in the state construction codes and the
applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries
Association. If, upon inspection, the city concludes that a tower fails to
comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or
property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner
shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards.
Failure to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days shall
constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna as a public nuisance
at the owner's expense.
      g.   Not essential services. Towers and antennas shall be regulated and
permitted pursuant to this chapter and shall not be regulated or permitted as
essential services, public utilities, or private utilities.
      h.   Signs. No signs shall be allowed on an antenna or tower.
      i.   Buildings and support equipment. Buildings and support equipment
associated with antennas or towers shall comply with the requirements of
subsection
94-173(d)(13)b.
   (12)   Uses permitted by administrative review. The zoning official may
administratively approve a permit for any wireless communication facility for
which all support equipment is screened from view and which complies with one
of the following criteria:
      a.   A roof mounted antenna not exceeding ten feet in height and located
on a nonresidential structure.
      b.   Antennas and supporting equipment cabinets and structures which are
architecturally integrated with a principal building or structure so as not to
be recognized as antennas.
      c.   Up to three whip antennas with a maximum height of 20 feet.
      d.   Collocation of a wireless communication antenna on an existing
monopole support structure, on a public water tower, athletic field light
standard, electrical utility transmission tower or distribution pole, or on an
existing tower or pole within the right-of-way or easement of an electrical
utility company in any district of the city, provided:
         1.   The antenna does not extend more than 30 feet above the highest
point of the structure;
         2.   The antenna complies with all applicable FCC and FAA regulations;
and
         3.   The antenna complies with all applicable building codes.
   (13)   Uses permitted by special use permit. No wireless communications
facilities other than those permitted by administrative review by subsection
94-173(d)(12) of this chapter shall be permitted except subject to the granting
of a special use permit after review and approval by the planning commission
pursuant to article VI of this chapter, subject to the general standards
applicable to a special use permit as set forth at subsection
94-191(f), the goals set forth at subsection
94-191(a), and the following additional standards:
      a.   Location criteria.

         3.   Mounted wireless communication facilities are permitted in all
districts except single-family and two-family districts, except that roof-
mounted antennas are not permitted in any residential district.
         4.   Monopoles and similar support structures are permitted as a
principle or accessory use only in the M-2 general manufacturing district, and
those portions of the M-1 light manufacturing district, and those commercial
districts lying south of a line created by Kipp Road extended and north and
west of lines created by North Street and Buhl Street extended.
         5.   Monopoles not to exceed 150 feet in height are also permitted in
the C-1 central business district by special use permit, provided the structure
is located on publicly-owned property and is constructed and maintained for
joint use by three or more users, at least one of which shall be a local or
state governmental agency operating communication facilities for public safety
services as defined under the Homeland Security Act.
         6.   Monopoles and similar support structures are prohibited in parks,
school grounds or other areas heavily trafficked by children.
         7.   Lattice or guyed towers or antennas or similar structures are
prohibited in all districts.
      b.   Development and design standards.
         1.   Setbacks.
            i.   Wireless communications facilities including all anchors or
pads shall be sited so that the anchors and pads for the structure meet the
minimum setback requirements of the zoning district where they are located and
do not cross into another zoning district.
            ii.   Separation requirements for towers shall comply with the
minimum standards shown in table 100-3 in chapter 100.
            iii.   Mounted wireless communication facilities shall meet the
required setbacks for the structure upon which they are located and shall be
situated to provide for maximum safety on the site.
         2.   Spacing requirements. Monopole tower structures shall be

not to exclude, adult businesses in the city by preventing the concentration of
such uses in close proximity to each other and to minimize the negative impacts
of their operation by separating such uses from residential, office/commercial
and other areas of public congregation. This regulation is done with the
understanding that the city recognizes that there are some uses which, because
of their very nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics,
particularly if several of them are concentrated under circumstances having a
deleterious effect upon adjacent residential, office and commercial areas. The
city recognizes that the regulation of such uses is necessary to ensure that
adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of
surrounding residential neighborhoods, nonresidential areas or other places of
public congregation.

   (2)   An access point serving a single-family dwelling shall be a minimum of
15 feet from the nearest right-of-way line of an intersecting street.
   (3)   A driveway serving a single-family or two-family dwelling shall be a
minimum of 9 feet wide.
   (4)   A lot containing one single-family dwelling or one two-family dwelling
shall have no more than one access point to the street upon which it relies for
access.
   (5)   No more than 25 dwellings shall be served by a single access point
except upon finding that a second alternative and reasonable means of emergency
vehicle access is available.
   (6)   In the case of the development of a platted or condominium
subdivision, all lots made part of such subdivision shall have their access
point from roads within such subdivision.
(f)   Standards for Office, Commercial and Industrial Uses.
   (1)   The minimum distance an access point may be located from an adjoining
non-residential property line shall be 15 feet. The minimum distance an access
point may be located from an adjoining residential property line shall be 25
feet.
   (2)   An access point shall be a minimum of 25 feet from the nearest right-
of-way line of an intersecting street.
   (3)   No parcel shall be provided more than one access point for the first
150 feet of parcel frontage, and no more than one access point shall be
provided for parcels with additional frontage except upon a showing that the
projected trip generation necessitates additional access points and no feasible
alternative exists such as the reliance on shared access as provided in sub-
sections (4), (5) and (6) below.
   (4)   The sharing or joint use of a driveway by two or more property owners
shall be encouraged. The sharing or joint use of a driveway by two or more
property owners may be required in association with the approval of a site plan
where such a shared or joint use driveway is feasible and practical, and where
the lack of such a shared or joint use driveway would result in inappropriately
spaced access points that are contrary to nationally-recognized engineering
standards and public safety and welfare. The shared driveway shall be
constructed along the midpoint between the two properties unless a written
easement is provided that allows traffic to travel across one parcel to access
another, and/or access the public street.
   (5)   The use of front or rear service drives shall be encouraged. The use
of front or rear service drives may be required in association with the
approval of a site plan where such a drive is feasible and practical, and where
the lack of such drive would result in inappropriately spaced access points
that are contrary to nationally-recognized engineering standards and public
safety and welfare.
   (6)   Where a proposed parking lot is adjacent to an existing parking lot of
a similar use, or of a differing use, and traffic flow between the two uses is
anticipated, there shall be a vehicular connection between the two parking lots
where determined physically feasible by the site plan approving body. For
developments adjacent to vacant properties, the site shall be designed to
provide for future connection. A written access easement signed by both
landowners shall be presented as evidence of the parking lot connection prior
to the issuance of any building permit.
(g)   Traffic impact study. In the case of a proposed use that is likely to be
characterized by trip generation rates in excess of 100 trips per peak hour,
the applicant shall submit a traffic impact study with the building permit/site
plan application for the use. The preparer of the study shall be either a
registered traffic engineer or transportation planner. If the study involves
geometric design, the study shall be prepared or supervised by a registered
engineer with a background in traffic engineering. The qualifications of the
author of the study shall be included in the application. The applicant may be
required by a reviewing body to submit a traffic impact study though the use
may be characterized by less than 100 trips per peak hour in the case where a
reviewing body determines existing conditions warrant a study such as existing
traffic conflicts in the immediate area, the proximity of existing access
points, the lack of a left turn lane for the road providing access to the site,
or other factors deemed to be relevant by the reviewing body. The traffic
impact study shall address, at a minimum:
   (1)   Description of the proposed internal vehicular circulation system
including the location of all access points into the project; parking and drop-
off circulation; loading/unloading circulation; and pedestrian, bicycle, and
transit circulation.
   (2)   Analysis of existing traffic conditions in the immediate area, based
on current data.
   (3)   Projected trip generation at the project site or along the roads
abutting the site, based on the most recent edition of the Institute of
Transportation Engineers Trip Generation manual, or more recent studies of a
minimum of three similar uses with similar surroundings in Michigan.
   (4)   Illustrations of current and projected turning movements at access
points into the project.
   (5)   Description of the anticipated impact of the projected trip generation
on abutting and nearby streets, including increases in congestion, available
capacity of streets and impacts on levels of service of such streets, and
proposed mitigation measures to minimize any conflict issues.
   (6)   Justification for the need of the number and location of proposed
access points into the project.

Secs. 94-178—94-190. Reserved.
ARTICLE VI. USES AUTHORIZED BY SPECIAL USE PERMIT
Sec. 94-191. General standards and requirements.
(a)   Intent and purpose. The intent of this article is to provide a set of
procedures and standards for specific uses of land or structures that will
allow, on one hand, practical latitude for the developer, but that will at the
same time, maintain sound provisions for the protection of the health, safety
and general welfare of the inhabitants of the city. In order to provide
controllable and reasonable flexibility, this article permits detailed review
of certain specified types of land use activities which, because of their
particular and unique characteristics, require special consideration in
relation to the welfare of adjacent properties and to the community as a whole.
Uses possessing these characteristics may be authorized within certain zoning
districts by the issuance of a special use permit. By such a procedure, the
city has the opportunity to impose conditions and safeguards upon each use
which are deemed necessary for the protection of the public welfare. The
following sections, together with previous references in other articles of this
chapter, designate specific uses that require a special use permit and, in
addition, specify the procedures and standards which must be met before such a
permit can be issued.
(b)   Permit procedures. An application for a special use permit for any use
shall be submitted and processed under the following procedures:
   (1)   Submission of application. An application shall be submitted on a form
through the zoning official for consideration by the planning commission. The
application shall be accompanied by payment of a fee as established by
resolution of the city council to cover costs of processing the application as
well as site plan review fees that may be required. No part of any fee shall be
refundable.
   (2)   Required information. One copy of an application for a special use
permit shall be submitted to the zoning official and accompanied by 20 copies
of a preliminary site plan in compliance with division 1 of article VII of this
chapter. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to furnish sufficient
evidence to demonstrate compliance of the proposed use with the provisions of
this chapter.
   (3)   Acceptance of application.
      a.   Upon receipt of an application for a special use permit, the zoning
official shall review the application for completeness. If the application is
found to be complete, the zoning official shall issue a dated receipt of
acceptance to the applicant and schedule consideration of the application by
the planning commission. If the application is found to be incomplete, the
zoning official shall return the application to the applicant with a written
description of what additional information is required.
      b.   The planning commission reserves the right to find that an
application is incomplete. An application which is found to be incomplete shall
be returned to the applicant with a written description of what additional
information is required and the previously issued receipt of acceptance shall
be considered void.
   (4)   Time frame.
      a.   Acceptance of application. The zoning official shall issue a receipt
of acceptance or return the application as incomplete within ten business days
after submission.
      b.   Meeting date. The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on
the application within 45 days of the date of the receipt of acceptance by the
zoning official.
   (5)   Notice for review. The zoning official shall notify the agencies and
individuals identified in section 94-394(d), or other agencies or individuals,
of receipt of the special use application as deemed appropriate by the zoning
official or the planning commission.
   (6)   Written comments. Any person may present any petition or document
supporting a position for or against an application. All documents shall be
submitted to the zoning official no later than 4:00 p.m. the day of the public
hearing at which the application will be considered. Documents so submitted
will be provided to the planning commission at the public hearing.
   (7)   Project start. Until a special use permit has been issued for any use
requiring the same in this chapter, and until a proper building permit has been
granted pursuant to the special use permit, there shall be no construction or
excavation on said land, nor shall there be made any use of land related to the
request for the special use permit.
(c)   Public hearing. After accepting an application for a special use permit
as complete, the planning commission shall hold a public hearing on the special
use request and the preliminary site plan. Notice of the public hearing shall
be pursuant to section 94-101.
(d)   Review and decision. The planning commission may approve, approve with
conditions, or deny an application for special use permit. The review of a
special use permit application and the associated site plan shall be made by
the planning commission in accordance with the procedures and standards
specified in this chapter.
   (1)   An application for special use permit and the associated preliminary
site plan shall be approved if both are found to be in compliance with the
requirements of this chapter, and other applicable local, county, state, or
federal laws, rules or regulations. The planning commission may defer a
decision in order to obtain that information deemed necessary to making an
informed decision.
   (2)   The applicant may make changes to the application and site plan in
order to achieve compliance with this chapter. Such changes shall be noted on
the application or site plan or the planning commission may require that these
documents be resubmitted incorporating said changes.
   (3)   Approval and issuance of a special use permit shall signify concurrent
approval of the application and preliminary site plan, therefore any subsequent
authorized modification to the site plan shall become part of the special use
permit and shall be enforceable as such.
   (4)   The decision to approve or deny a request for a special use permit
shall be retained as a part of the record of action on the request and shall
incorporate a statement of conclusions which specifies the basis for the
decision, any changes to the originally submitted application and site plan
necessary to insure compliance with the chapter, and any conditions imposed
with approval.
   (5)   Once a special use permit is issued, all site development and use of
land on the property affected shall be consistent with the approved special use
permit unless a change conforming to chapter requirements is approved by the
planning commission.
   (6)   The concurring vote of a majority of the members appointed to and
serving on the planning commission shall be necessary to approve a special use
permit.
   (7)   The planning commission shall defer all proceedings on an application
for a special use permit upon the request of the applicant when less than eight
members of the planning commission are present for consideration of and voting
on said special use. The right of deferment shall be considered waived by the
applicant if deferment is not requested immediately upon the opening of the
hearing conducted pursuant to section 94-191(c). When deferment is requested as
required, the planning commission shall, at that time, determine the date of a
future regular or special meeting for the continuation of the hearing and
consideration of the matter. Notice previously given for the original hearing
date shall constitute notice of the future hearing date with no further notice
required.
(e)   Required site plan review. A preliminary site plan must be submitted with
the application for a special use permit. After approval and before issuance of
a building permit or certificate of occupancy, a final site plan shall be
submitted for review by the zoning official. The zoning official may request
review by the planning commission of the final site plan. The site plan review
shall be in conformance with division 1 of article VII of this chapter.
(f)   Basis of determination. Before approving a special use permit, the
planning commission shall find by clear and convincing proof that the
applicable standards set forth by this chapter shall be satisfied by the
completion and operation of the proposed development. The planning commission
shall review the particular circumstances and facts of each proposed use in
terms of these standards and shall make written findings showing that such use
shall:
   (1)   Be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and that such a use will not change the
essential character of adjacent property or the zoning district in which it is
proposed.
   (2)   Not be hazardous or disturbing to uses in the same general vicinity
and will be a substantial improvement to property in the immediate vicinity and
to the community as a whole.
   (3)   Be served adequately by essential facilities and services, such as
highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures, refuse
disposal, water and sewage facilities, and schools.
   (4)   Not create additional requirements at public cost for public
facilities and services.
   (5)   Not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, and equipment or
conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any person, property, or
the general welfare by noise, fumes, glare, or odors.
   (6)   Not be located such that it will directly or indirectly have a
substantial adverse impact on the natural resources of this city.
   (7)   Be in compliance with other applicable local, county, state, or
federal rules and regulations.
(g)   Conditions. The planning commission may impose such reasonable conditions
upon the approval of a special use permit as are deemed necessary to protect
the general welfare, protect individual property rights, and insure that the
intent and objectives of this chapter will be satisfied.
   (1)   The conditions may include those necessary to insure that public
services and facilities affected by a proposed use will be capable of
accommodating the increased service and facility loads caused by the use.
   (2)   The conditions may include those necessary to protect the natural
environment and conserve natural resources and energy, to insure compatibility
with adjacent uses, and to promote the use of land in a socially and
economically desirable manner.
   (3)   The conditions shall be designed to protect natural resources, the
public health, safety, and welfare, as well as the social and economic well-
being of those who will use the land or engage in the activity under
consideration, residents and landowners immediately adjacent to the proposed
land use or activity, and the community as a whole.
   (4)   The planning commission may require a performance guarantee in
accordance with section 94-100 of this chapter.
   (5)   The special use permit may be limited for a specified period of time
only where the subject use has some naturally limiting factor.
   (6)   The conditions may include that a specified percentage of the
authorized construction and/or development be completed within a specified
period of time. Failure to meet this requirement shall invalidate special use
authorization for only that portion of the project not developed as required.
(h)   Effective date of special use permit. The special use permit shall become
effective when the application has been approved by the planning commission.
   (1)   A building permit shall not be issued until approval of such special
use permit by the planning commission.
   (2)   Land subject to a special use permit may not be used or occupied for
purposes of such special use until after a certificate of occupancy for same
has been issued pursuant to this chapter.
(i)   Transfer and expiration of special use permit. The city shall notify the
applicant, in writing mailed to the address listed on the application, that a
special use permit has become invalid.
   (1)   A special use permit shall be valid for as long as the permitted use
continues in accordance with the terms stated therein unless otherwise stated
in the special use permit. If the use permitted by the special use permit is
not established in compliance with the terms of the special use permit within
12 months from the date of its issuance, then the special use permit shall
automatically expire and be of no further effect or validity. This period of
time may be extended by the planning commission for good cause for an
additional six months.
   (2)   Approval of a special use permit shall be valid regardless of change
of ownership provided that all terms and conditions of the permit are met by
subsequent owner.
   (3)   If the use permitted under the special use permit ceases or is vacated
for 12 months, the special use permit shall automatically expire and be of no
further effect or validity.
(j)   Re-application. No application for a special use permit which has been
denied, wholly or in part, shall be resubmitted until the expiration of one
year from the date of such denial except on the grounds of newly discovered
evidence or proof of changed conditions, as determined by the planning
commission.
(k)   Compliance with requirements. It shall be the duty and obligation of the
owner and operator of the property to at all times be in compliance with the
use requirements of this chapter and the stipulations of the special use permit
under which their particular use is governed. Failure thereof shall be a
violation of this chapter and may subject the owner and/or operator to the
penalties and remedies provided in article III of this chapter and the
continuance thereof is hereby declared to be a nuisance per se.
(l)   Special use deemed a conforming permitted use. Any use for which a
special use permit has been granted shall be deemed a conforming permitted use
provided that the proposed use is subsequently built, operated, and maintained
in compliance with this chapter, including conditions approved as part of the
special use permit.
(Ord. No. 152, 5-1-2006)
Sec. 94-192. Listed special uses.
Special land uses listed in this section shall satisfy the supplementary
standards found in this section in addition to the general standards found in
section
94-191U The following are the listed special uses subject to this section:
   (1)   Planned residential developments (PRD).
      a.   Intent and purpose. The intent and purpose of a PRD shall be the
same as that described for a PUD under section
94-161(a) insofar as subsection
94-161(a) is consistent with other requirements of this section.
      b.   Permitted uses. Only the following uses may be permitted in a PRD:
         1.   All uses permitted by right in the district in which the PRD is
proposed.
         2.   Any additional uses which can be shown to be compatible with the
general objectives of the Master Plan as well as integral to the specific PRD
scheme in which they are contained. For the purpose of this section, an
integral use shall be defined as a use which has a specific functional
relationship with other uses contained in the development, such as a day care
center which serves primarily the needs of residents of the development.
      c.   Site development standards and deviations. All proposed individual
land uses and facilities in a PRD shall be in conformance with the standards of
the district in which the PRD is proposed and any other applicable sections of
this code, including such standards pertaining to lot area and dimensions,
density, lot coverage, setbacks, building height, parking, loading, landscaping
and screening, road widths, and similar requirements, except that the planning
commission may permit deviations from such standards where such deviations will
result in a higher quality of development than would be possible without the
deviations.
         1.   Any deviation from applicable standards affecting density shall
not result in an increase in density in excess of 30% of the density allowed in
the district in which the PRD is proposed.
         2.   Except where a deviation is granted, mixed uses shall comply with
the regulations applicable for each individual use, including applicable
standards for special uses contained in Article VI of this chapter. If
regulations are inconsistent with each other, the regulations applicable to the
most dominant use shall apply.
         3.   Deviation from development standards may be authorized only upon
a finding by the planning commission that said deviation will encourage
creative design including the enhancement of open space and the protection of
natural features, and that there are adequate features or planning mechanisms
designed into the project to achieve the objectives intended to be accomplished
with respect to each of the standards from which a deviation is sought.
      d.   Minimum eligibility criteria. A PRD shall satisfy the minimum
eligibility criteria for a PUD as provided by section
94-161(g) insofar as such criteria are consistent with this section.
      e.   Phasing. A PRD may be constructed in phases in the manner described
for a PUD as provided by section
94-161(i) insofar as such phasing is consistent with this section.
   (2)   Auto service station. Location and special needs for auto service
stations require careful planning to properly integrate this type of use into
the pattern of other commercial and retail activities and special
consideration, therefore, must be given to location, site, layout, use and
storage facilities, traffic safety and compatibility with surrounding uses. The
following are minimum requirements:
      a.   Site size of 20,000 square feet with a minimum width of 150 feet of
frontage on a major street.
      b.   Buildings shall be set back 50 feet from all street right-of-way

modifications to the structure may be permitted including the provision of
barrier free access in order to meet building code requirements.
      g.   Meals for bed and breakfast patrons shall be prepared using the same
kitchen facilities as are used for the residents. Kitchen facilities shall
comply with all appropriate city, county and state regulations.
      h.   One off-street parking space per room to be rented shall be
provided, in addition to the parking required for a single-family dwelling.
Parking shall be arranged so as not to pose negative impacts on adjacent

      p.   All dimensional requirements and setbacks shall be maintained for
the district in which the bed and breakfast is located. No unique or special
equipment or mechanical devises shall be permitted that are not common for
single-family dwelling use.
   (8)   Institutional structures and uses. In recognition of the institutional
types of nonresidential uses which may be found compatible with and useful in
residential areas, and in recognition of the peculiar and unique functional
requirements of certain types of institutional uses, the planning commission
may authorize such uses by special use permit when in compliance with the
general standards and specific requirements of this article.
      a.   Institutional uses include the following:
         1.   Institutions for human care including hospitals, sanitariums, day

residential district, or abutting a business or industrial district or public
open space.
         2.   All means shall be utilized to face an institutional use on a
major street with motor vehicle egress and ingress thereon to avoid the impact
of traffic generated by the institutional use in the surrounding area.

offers natural or manmade barriers that will lessen the effect of the
institutional use on the surrounding area.
         4.   A proposed institutional use shall not require costly or
uneconomical extensions of public services inconsistent with the growth of the
district.
   (9)   Racetrack, racing theater, and casino. To recognize and accommodate
the unique and functional requirements of this use, the intensity of the use,
the exceptional demands on transportation facilities and public services that
may be generated, the potential for excessive light, noise, dust, odors and
fumes, all of which require that special consideration be given to siting,
location, layout, parking, storage, traffic circulation, hours of operation,
and to ensure compatibility with neighboring uses, such uses shall be subject
to the following additional requirements:

ARTICLE IX. OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REGULATIONS
Sec. 94-291. Intent and purpose.
It is the intent of this article that automobile parking spaces shall be
provided and adequately maintained for the off-street storage of motor vehicles
by occupants, employees, and patrons of each building and premise constructed,
altered or enlarged under the provisions of this chapter. The number of off-
street parking spaces prescribed in conjunction with all land or building uses
shall be provided prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
(Ord. No. 152, 5-1-2006)
Sec. 94-292. General off-street parking and loading requirements. 
(a)   Application of floor area. The term usable floor area (UFA) shall be
applied as defined in chapter 1.
(b)   Fractional space. When units of measurement determining the number of
required parking spaces result in a fractional space, any fraction above one-
half shall require one parking space.
(c)   Requirements for a use not mentioned. In the case of a use not
specifically mentioned in this article, the zoning official shall determine the
requirements of off-street parking based upon a similar listed use.
(d)   Use of parking areas.
   (1)   The storage of merchandise, inoperable motor vehicles, motor vehicles
for sale, and the commercial service or repair of vehicles in parking areas is
prohibited.
   (2)   Parking areas once designated shall not be changed to any other use
unless and until equal space facilities are provided elsewhere subject to
planning commission approval.
   (3)   Parking and storage of certain vehicles. In residential zoning
districts, the storage of commercial vehicles shall be limited to one vehicle
per residential dwelling which shall not exceed a G.V.W.R. of 15,000 pounds.
Further, such commercial vehicles must be owned and operated by a member of the
family residing in said dwelling and shall not be used for hauling garbage or
refuse or other objectionable matter.
(e)   Building additions or other changes in floor area. Whenever a use
requiring off-street parking is increased in floor area, or when interior
building modifications result in an increase in capacity for any such use,
additional parking shall be provided and maintained in the proper ratio to the
increased floor area or capacity.
(f)   Joint use of parking areas. The joint use of parking facilities by two or
more uses may be granted by the zoning official or the planning commission for
uses requiring site plan review by the planning commission whenever such joint
use is practical and satisfactory to each of the uses intended to be served,
and when all requirements for location, design, and construction are met.
   (1)   Computing capacities. The space requirement for jointly used parking
facilities shall be the sum of the individual requirements. If space
requirements for individual uses occur at distinctly different times, the total
of such off-street parking facilities required for joint use may be reduced
below the sum total of the individual space requirements at the sole discretion
of the zoning official, but shall not be reduced below the largest single use
requirement.
   (2)   Record of agreement. An agreement between joint users shall be made a
condition of site plan approval and a copy of such agreement shall be filed
with the application for a building permit and recorded with the Register of
Deeds of Ingham County. The agreement shall include a guarantee for continued
use and maintenance of the parking facility by each party.
(g)   Parking space requirements.
   (1)   Table 100-5 in chapter 100 sets forth the minimum standards for the
number of parking spaces required by type of land use.
   (2)   Parking space deferment. Where the property owner can demonstrate that
the required amount of parking is excessive, the site plan approving body may
waive the parking requirement and approve a parking area smaller than required.
The parking area waived shall be designated as reserved parking area for
possible future use. The site plan approving body may subsequently require the
applicant to construct additional parking spaces upon a determination by said
body that the reduced number of parking spaces is not adequate to meet the
parking needs of the use and public safety and welfare is at risk. Upon such a
determination, the applicant shall convert the reserved parking area into
available parking spaces in compliance with said determination and the
requirements of this article within six months of being so directed in writing
by the zoning official. The approved site plan shall clearly identify the
location of this reserved parking area including dimensions and dotted parking
space layout, and no buildings, structures, or similar improvements shall be
established in the reserved parking area. A notice clearly identifying the
location and number of reserved parking spaces should be recorded with the
Ingham County Register of Deeds by the owner as a condition of final site plan
approval. This discretion shall be guided by the basis of determination set
forth at section 94-191(f). This subsection shall apply only to office,
commercial, and industrial uses that are required to provide more than 50
parking spaces.
(h)   Location of parking areas. All off-street parking areas shall be located
on the same lot, or on the adjacent premises in the same district as the use
they are intended to serve, with the following exceptions:
   (1)   Uses in the C-1 district. There shall be no off-street parking space
requirements in the C-1 district for those uses which require 20 or less off-
street parking spaces. Uses requiring more than 20 off-street parking spaces
shall have their parking requirement determined by the planning commission. In
making such a decision, the planning commission shall consider the availability
of both public and private parking spaces.
   (2)   Uses in C-2 and C-3 districts. Parking on the premises or within 400
feet.
   (3)   Uses in M-1 and M-2 districts. Parking on the premises or within 800
feet.
   (4)   Public and quasi-public buildings, places of assembly, private clubs,
associations and institutions. Parking on the premises or within 400 feet.
(i)   Parking lot plan review. Whenever six or more off-street parking spaces
are required for a given use, plans and specifications for the construction or
alteration of an off-street parking area shall be submitted to the zoning
official before a building permit can be issued. Such plans and specifications
shall indicate, to the satisfaction of the zoning official, the location, basis
of capacity calculation, size, site design, surfacing, marking, lighting,
drainage, curb cuts, entrances, exits, landscaping, and any other detailed
feature essential to the complete design and construction of the parking area.
(j)   Site development standards. All off-street parking areas shall be
designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with the following standards
and requirements:
   (1)   Parking in the required front yard is prohibited in the RM, C-1, O-1,
and O-2 districts. For residential uses in the AG, RS-1, RS-2, RS-3, and R2F
districts, that portion of a regularly constructed driveway extending in front
of the required front yard setback line may be used for parking by up to two
passenger vehicles. Front yard parking in the C-2, C-3, M-1, and M-2 districts
is prohibited except upon a finding by the planning commission that such
parking is a critical component of the operation of the particular use and that
adequate provisions are included for the screening and landscaping of such
parking area.
   (2)   Required parking areas including driveways shall be constructed from
materials that provide a durable smooth and dustless surface, shall be drained
properly, and shall be maintained in a safe and usable condition.
   (3)   A minimum area of 200 square feet with a minimum width of ten feet
shall be provided for each vehicle parking space. Each space shall be
definitely designated and reserved for parking purposes exclusive of space
requirements for adequate ingress and egress. The planning commission may allow
up to 20 percent of the spaces to be a minimum of 180 sq. ft. with a minimum
width of nine feet in those cases where more than 40 spaces are required. For
property zoned or used as single-family or two-family residential, the required
minimum width shall be nine feet.
   (4)   Parking areas shall be so designed and marked as to provide for
orderly and safe movement and storage of vehicles.
   (5)   Adequate ingress and egress to the parking area by means of clearly
limited and defined drives shall be provided. Except for parking space provided
for residential uses in the RS-1, RS-2, and RS-3 zones, drives for ingress and
egress to the parking area shall be not less than 20 feet wide. For parking
space provided for residential uses in the R2F zone, the zoning official may
require a specified minimum drive width up to 20 feet for ingress and egress to
the parking area if found necessary to ensure public safety due to the drive
location, configuration, and visibility along the drive.
   (6)   Each parking space, within an off-street parking lot, shall be
provided with adequate access by means of maneuvering lanes. Backing directly
onto a street shall be prohibited. The width of required maneuvering lanes may
vary depending upon the proposed parking pattern, as follows:
      a.   For right angle parking patterns 75 to 90 degrees, the maneuvering
lane width shall be a minimum of 20 feet for one-way traffic movement or a
minimum of 24 feet for two-way traffic movement.
      b.   For parking patterns 54 to 74 degrees, the maneuvering lane width
shall be a minimum of 15 feet.
      c.   For parking patterns 30 to 53 degrees, the maneuvering lane width
shall be a minimum of 12 feet.
      d.   All maneuvering lane widths shall permit one-way traffic movement,
except for the 90-degree pattern which may provide for two-way traffic
movement.
      e.   Except for property used as residential in the RS-1, RS-2, RS-3, and
R2F districts, adequate lighting shall be provided throughout the hours when
the parking area is in operation. All lighting shall be so arranged as to
reflect light away from any residential property adjacent to the parking area
and any adjacent road or street.
      f.   Where a parking area or drive with a capacity of six or more
vehicles adjoins a residential district, a landscaped buffer strip at minimum
equivalent to the requirements of subsection
94-241(f)(1)b. of this chapter shall be provided between the parking area and
the adjoining property.
   (7)   Parking for the disabled shall comply with the State of Michigan
Barrier Free Rules, Public Act No. 1 of 1966, as amended. For uses where there
may be a higher number of persons with disabilities, such as medical uses or
senior housing, the site plan approving body may require a larger proportion of
the parking spaces be barrier-free.
(k)   Signs. Parking area signage shall comply with applicable local, state and
federal regulations.
(Ord. No. 152, 5-1-2006; Ord. No. 230, 9-28-2020)
Sec. 94-293. Loading and unloading space requirements.
(a)   Intent and purpose. Every manufacturing, storage, warehouse, department
store, wholesale store, retail store, hotel, hospital, laundry, dairy,
mortuary, restaurant, tavern and other uses similarly and customarily receiving
or distributing goods by motor vehicle shall provide space on the premises for
that number of delivery vehicles that will be at the premises at the same time
on an average day of full use.
(b)   Additional parking space. Loading space required under this chapter shall
be in addition to off-street parking space required under this chapter.
(c)   Space requirements. Adequate space shall be provided for loading and
unloading services not less than 12 feet in width, 25 feet in length, and 14
feet in height, open or enclosed, for uses listed in table 100-6 in chapter
100, or for similar uses involving the receipt or distribution by vehicles of
materials or merchandise. There shall be no requirement of loading or unloading
space in the C-1 district for property with direct access to an alley.
(d)   Access. Access to loading and unloading space shall be provided directly
from a public street or alley and such space shall provide sufficient off-
street maneuvering space as well as adequate ingress and egress to and from a
street or alley.
(e)   Site requirements. Off-street loading spaces and access drives shall be
paved, drained, lighted, and shall have appropriate bumper or wheel guards
where needed. Any light used for illumination shall be so arranged as to
reflect the light away from adjoining premises and streets. Where any off-
street loading space adjoins or abuts a lot used for residential, educational,
recreational, or religious purposes, or abuts a residential district, a wall or
solid fence not less than four feet in height shall be provided between the
off-street loading space and said residential, educational, recreational, or
religious lot or residential zone.

ARTICLE X. NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND AND STRUCTURES
Sec. 94-321. Intent and purpose.
The intent of this article is to regulate an existing use, structure, or lot,
or any combination thereof, which does not conform to the terms and conditions
provided in this chapter. Further this article intends to allow the
continuation of lawful nonconforming uses while securing the gradual
elimination of all such uses over time. It is recognized that lots, structures,
and uses of land and structures exist which were lawful before this chapter was
adopted, or amended, and which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted
under the terms of this chapter or future amendments.

Sec. 94-323. Nonconforming use of land.
Where a lawful use of land exists on the effective date of this chapter, or an
amendment thereof, that is made no longer permissible under the requirements of
this chapter, such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, and provided no such nonconforming use, structure, or lot shall be
enlarged, increased or extended.
(Ord. No. 152, 5-1-2006)
Sec. 94-324. Nonconforming structure.
Where a lawful structure exists on the effective date of this chapter, or an
amendment thereof, that is made no longer permissible under the requirements of
this chapter by reason of dimensional restrictions on lot area coverage,
height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or location on the lot,
such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject
to the following provisions:
   (1)   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases
its nonconformity, but the use of a structure and/or the structure itself may
be changed or altered to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located, provided that all such changes are also in conformance with the
requirements of the district in which it is located.
   (2)   Should such a structure be destroyed by any means to an extent
equivalent to more than 50 percent of twice the state equalized value (SEV) at
the time of destruction, it shall be reconstructed only in conformance with the
provisions of this chapter except that a nonconforming structure used as a
single-family dwelling may be reconstructed as a single-family dwelling
provided the nonconformity is not enlarged or increased.
   (3)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
(Ord. No. 152, 5-1-2006)
Sec. 94-325. Change in nonconforming use.
In any nonresidential district, notwithstanding other requirements of this
chapter, a nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use of the
same or a lesser intensity of use, provided that no structural alterations are
made and that a special use permit is granted in accordance with article VI of
this chapter.
(Ord. No. 152, 5-1-2006)
Sec. 94-326. Repair and maintenance.
On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may
be done in any period of 12-consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on
repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an
extent not exceeding 50 percent of twice the state equalized value (SEV) of the
building, provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the
time of passage or amendment of this chapter shall not be increased. Nothing in
this article shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a
safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any
official charged with protecting the public safety.
(Ord. No. 152, 5-1-2006)
Sec. 94-327. Change of tenancy or ownership.
As long as there is no change in the characteristics or increase in the
intensity of the nonconforming use, a change of tenancy or ownership is
allowed.
(Ord. No. 152, 5-1-2006)
Sec. 94-328. District zoning change.
Whenever the boundaries of a zoning district shall be changed, the provisions
of this article shall also apply to any existing uses that become nonconforming
as a result of the boundary changes.
(Ord. No. 152, 5-1-2006)
Sec. 94-329. Increase in nonconformity.
Nonconforming buildings or structures may be structurally changed, altered, or
enlarged in a way which increases nonconformity only with the approval of a
variance by the zoning board of appeals in accordance with the provisions of
article XI of this chapter and Section 5 of the City and Village Zoning Act
(MCL 125.585). When considering such a request, the proofs the board shall
accept as proof of practical difficulty, shall include the following:
   (1)   A board finding that failure to grant the relief requested would
unreasonably restrict continued use of the property or would restrict valuable
benefits that the public currently derives from the property as used in its
nonconforming status.
   (2)   A board finding that the subject structure possesses historical
significance and that the requested variance is necessary to maintain or
enhance the utility or safety of the structure.
(Ord. No. 152, 5-1-2006)
Sec. 94-330. Illegal use.
Uses of structures or land existing on June 10, 2001 that were established
without approval of zoning compliance or without a valid building permit or
special use permit, and those uses which cannot be proved conclusively as
existing prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be declared illegal
uses and are not entitled to the status and rights accorded legally established
nonconforming uses.
(Ord. No. 152, 5-1-2006)
Sec. 94-331. Abandonment of use.
(a)   A nonconforming use, land, or structure which is discontinued for 12-
consecutive months shall lose its nonconformity status, shall not be resumed
and shall thereafter only be used in a manner which meets all the provisions of
the district in which it is located.
(b)   Failure to continue to use any nonconforming land or structure for 12-
consecutive months, shall be prima facie proof of an intention to legally
abandon the nonconformity.
(c)   If a nonconformity is in probate, foreclosure or bankruptcy, and during
the period of probate, foreclosure or bankruptcy the use is abandoned, such
period of abandonment shall not be used to calculate the time described in
subsections
94-331(a) and
94-331(b) hereof, up to a maximum of three years.

ARTICLE XI. ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS
Sec. 94-361. Creation and membership.
The zoning board of appeals is hereby established in accordance with Public Act
No. 207 of 1921 (MCL 125.581 et seq.). In the performance of assigned duties
and the exercise of assigned powers, the zoning board of appeals shall function
such that the objectives of this chapter may be equitably achieved.
   (1)   Members. The zoning board of appeals shall consist of seven members
each appointed by the city council for a term of three years, except that the
term of a member serving because of their being a member of the city council
shall be limited to the time they are a member of the council. One regular or
alternate member may be a member of the city council but shall not serve as
chairperson of the zoning board of appeals. The remaining members shall be
selected from the electors of the city. The members selected shall be
representative of the population distribution and of the various interests
present in the city.
   (2)   Alternate members. The city council may appoint not more than two
alternate members for the zoning board of appeals each appointed for a term of
three years. An alternate member shall be called on a rotating basis to sit as
a regular member of the zoning board of appeals in the absence of a regular
member. An alternate member may also be called to serve in the place of a
regular member for the purpose of reaching a decision on a particular case in
which the regular member has abstained for reasons of conflict of interest.
Once having been called to serve, an alternate member shall serve as a regular
member in the consideration of that particular case until a final decision has
been made.
   (3)   Removal. A member of the zoning board of appeals may be removed by the
city council for misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office upon
written charges and after public hearing. A member shall disqualify himself or
herself from a vote in which the member has a conflict of interest. Failure of
a member to disqualify himself or herself from a vote in which the member has a
conflict of interest constitutes malfeasance in office.
   (4)   Participation by dual members. A member of the zoning board of appeals
who is also a member of the planning commission or the city council shall not
participate in a public hearing on or vote on the same matter that such member
voted on as a member of the planning commission or city council. However, such
member may consider and vote on other unrelated matters involving the same
property.

Sec. 94-362. Organization and procedure.
(a)   Meetings. Four members of the zoning board of appeals shall comprise a
quorum for the purpose of conducting a meeting. Meetings shall be held at the
call of the chairman or the zoning official in writing delivered to the
addresses of each member of the board. All meetings shall be open to the
public. The city manager or a designee shall act as secretary of the board.
(b)   Records. Minutes of all meetings shall be recorded and made available in
accordance with the Michigan Open Meetings Act (MCL 15.261 et seq.) and shall
contain the grounds of every determination made by the zoning board of appeals
including all evidence and data considered, all findings of fact and
conclusions drawn, the votes of the members and the final disposition of each
case. Such minutes shall be filed in the office of the city clerk and shall be
available to the public. The record of proceedings for the zoning board of
appeals shall contain the following information when applicable:
   (1)   The application for an appeal, variance, or interpretation.
   (2)   Any reports, plans, surveys or photos.
   (3)   Notice of public hearing delivered to affected parties and published
in a newspaper.

(a)   Variance application and fee. An application for variance shall be filed
with the zoning official along with a fee as established by resolution of the
city council. The application shall specifically state the requirement(s) of
this chapter or chapter 58 from which the variance is requested. The zoning
official shall immediately forward the application for variance to the
secretary of the zoning board of appeals. The secretary of the zoning board of
appeals shall determine, pursuant to this chapter, if the application is
accepted as being filed in proper form, including the required data and fee. If
the application is not accepted as being in proper form, the application and
fee shall be returned to the appellant within seven days of filing with the
zoning official along with a written explanation of the insufficiency of the
letter of appeal.
(b)   Public hearing.
   (1)   When an application for variance has been accepted by the secretary of

94-101(1).
(c)   Basic conditions, zoning variance from requirements of this chapter. A
variance may be granted only when the variance application and other factual
evidence demonstrate all of the following:
   (1)   The variance must be granted in order to avoid practical difficulties
not created by the applicant that would result from strict application of the
letter of this chapter.
   (2)   A variance will not permit the establishment within a zoning district
of any use not permitted within the district.
   (3)   A variance will not cause a substantial adverse effect to property or
improvements in the zoning district and the immediately surrounding
neighborhood.
   (4)   A variance will not be contrary to the public interest and will insure
that the spirit and intent of this chapter will be observed, public safety
secured, and substantial justice done.
   (5)   There is no lesser variance than that applied for which would give
substantial relief to the applicant.
(d)   Basic conditions, sign variance from requirements of chapter 58. A
variance may be granted only when the variance application and other factual
evidence demonstrate all of the following:
   (1)   That the alleged practical difficulties are exceptional and peculiar
to the property of the person requesting the variance and result from
conditions which do not exist generally throughout the city.
   (2)   That the alleged practical difficulties which will result from a
failure to grant the variance include substantially more than mere
inconvenience or mere inability to attain a higher financial return.
   (3)   That allowing the variance will result in substantial justice being
done, considering the public benefits intended to be secured by this chapter,
the individual difficulties that will be suffered by a failure of the board to
grant a variance, and the rights of others whose property would be affected by
the allowance of the variance.
(e)   Additional conditions.
   (1)   The zoning board of appeals may specify reasonable conditions on the
approval of a variance which will substantially secure the objectives of the
regulations to which the variance applies, be related to the standards
established in the chapter for the land use or activity under consideration,
and be necessary to ensure compliance with those standards. The conditions may
include those necessary to ensure the public services and facilities affected
by a proposed land use or activity will be capable of accommodating increased
service and facility loads caused by user activity, to protect the natural
environment and conserve natural resources and energy, to ensure compatibility
with adjacent uses of land, and to promote the use of land in a socially and
economically desirable manner. The breach of any condition shall invalidate the
variance.
   (2)   The zoning board of appeals may require that a performance guarantee
be provided as a condition of approval in granting any variance as allowed in
this article. The performance guarantee shall be provided in accordance with
section
94-100 of this chapter.
(f)   Majority vote. The concurring vote of a majority of the members appointed
to and serving on the zoning board of appeals shall be necessary to grant a
variance.
