PRELIMINARY INFORMATION
   EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is consistent with
the best accepted practice for codification. Each section is self-identifying
as to code, chapter and section number. For example, 238.02 indicates that the
code number is 2, the chapter number is 238 (or the 38th chapter within code
2), and the section number is .02. The code and chapter numbers appear left of
the decimal, with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the
decimal, and the chapter number being the first two digits left of the decimal.
The section number appears to the right of the decimal. As another example,
408.01 indicates that the code number is 4, the chapter number is 408 (or the
8th chapter within code 4), and the section number is .01.
   With this number system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are, for the most part, initially even-
numbered, thus reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation.
Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty
provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.041, 660.042 and 660.043
follow 660.04 and precede 660.05 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the adopting ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

Chapter V
LEGISLATION
Sec. 5.1. Prior Legislation.
   All bylaws, ordinances, resolutions, rules, and regulations of the City of

effect on the effective date of this Charter shall continue in full force and
effect until repealed or amended.
Sec. 5.2. Ordinances and Resolutions.
   All legislation of the City of Hart shall be by ordinance or by resolution.
The word "Resolution" as used in this Charter shall be the official action of
the Council in the form of a motion and such action shall be limited to matters
required or permitted to be done by resolution by this Charter or by State or
Federal law and to matters pertaining to the internal affairs or concerns of
the City government. All other acts of the Council and all acts carrying a
penalty for the violation thereof shall be by ordinance. Ordinances may be
enacted, amended, or repealed by the affirmative vote of not less than four (4)
members of the Council. Ordinances shall be amended or repealed only by
adoption of an ordinance. Each ordinance shall be identified by a number and a
short title. Each proposed ordinance shall be introduced in written or printed
form. The style of all ordinances passed by the Council shall be: "The City of
Hart Ordains:." Except in the case of ordinances which are declared to be
emergency ordinances, no ordinance shall be finally passed by the Council at
the same meeting at which it was introduced. No ordinances shall be revised,
altered, or amended by reference to its title only, but the section or sections
of the ordinance revised, altered, or amended shall be re-enacted and published
at length.
Sec. 5.3. Ordinance Record.
   All ordinances when enacted shall be recorded by the Clerk in a book called
"The Ordinance Book," and it shall be the duty of the Mayor and the Clerk to
authenticate such record by their signatures.
Sec. 5.4. Technical Codes.
   All technical codes and other ordinances subject matter which are or may be
permitted by law to be adopted by reference shall be adopted and published in
the manner permitted and required by law.
Sec. 5.5. Publication and Effective Date of Ordinances.
   Before an ordinance may become operative, it shall be published in a legal
newspaper to be selected by the Council which is published in the City. If
there be no newspaper published in the City, the Council may direct that such
ordinances be published in any newspaper generally circulated in the City. The
effective date of the ordinance shall be stated therein but shall not be less
than ten days after publication unless the Council shall, upon attaching a
declaration of emergency affecting the public peace, health or safety, fix an
earlier date, but no ordinance shall take effect until after publication
thereof. Immediately after such publication, the Clerk shall enter in his
records a certificate of publication made by the printer of the newspaper or by
some person of the newspaper in his employ knowing the facts, stating the date
and the name of the newspaper in which such publication was made. The
certificate of publication of ordinances shall be entered in the "The Ordinance
Book" in the blank space which shall be left for such purpose just following
the ordinance to which it refers. Such certificate shall be prima-facie
evidence of the due publication of such notice, proceedings, or ordinance.
Sec. 5.6. Penalties.
   All offenses by officers of the City declared by this Charter to constitute
misdemeanors or misconduct in office and all violations of City ordinances
shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars or by
imprisonment for a period not exceeding ninety (90) days, or both in the
discretion of the court.
Sec. 5.7. Initiative and Referendum.
   An ordinance may be initiated by petition. A referendum on an ordinance
enacted by the Council may be had by a petition filed within twenty (20) days
subsequent to enactment of the ordinance as hereinafter provided.
Sec. 5.8. Initiatory or Referendary Petitions.
   An initiatory or a referendary petition shall be signed by registered
qualified electors of the City in number equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of
the vote cast for the Councilman receiving the highest number of votes at the
last regular City election prior to the filing of the petition. Before being
circulated for signatures, all such petitions shall be approved as to form by
the Clerk. No such petition need be on one paper, but may be the aggregate of
two or more petition papers. Each signer of a petition shall sign his name in
ink or indelible pencil and shall place thereon, after his name, the date and
his place of residence by a street and number, or by other customary
designation. To each petition paper there shall be attached a sworn affidavit
by the circulator thereof stating the number of signers thereto and that each
signature thereon is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports
to be and that is was made in the presence of the affiant. Any such petition
shall be filed with the Clerk who shall, within ten (10) days, determine the
sufficiency thereof and so certify. If found to contain an insufficient number
of signatures of qualified electors of the City or to be improper as to form or
compliance with the provisions of this section, ten (10) days shall be allowed
for the filing of supplemental petition papers. When found sufficient and
proper, the Clerk shall present the petition to the Council at its next regular
meeting.
Sec. 5.9. Council Procedure on Initiatory and Referendary Petitions.
   Upon receiving a certified initiatory or referendary petition from the
Clerk, the Council shall, within thirty (30) days, either, (a) if it be an
initiatory petition, adopt the ordinance; (b) if it be a referendary petition,
repeal the ordinance; or (c) in either case, submit the proposal to the
electors.
Sec. 5.10. Submission to Electors.
   Should the Council submit the proposal to the electors, it shall be
submitted at the next election held in the City for any other purpose, or, in
the discretion of the Council, at a special election. The result shall be
determined by a majority vote of the electors voting thereon except in cases
where otherwise required by law.
Sec. 5.11. General Provisions.
   The certification by the Clerk of the sufficiency of a referendary petition
shall automatically suspend the ordinance in question pending repeal by the
Council or final determination by the electors as the case may be. An ordinance
adopted by the electorate through initiatory proceedings may not be amended or
repealed by the Council for a period of two (2) years, and then only by the
affirmative vote of not less than five (5) Councilmen. Should two (2) or more
ordinances adopted at the same election have conflicting provisions, the one
receiving the highest vote shall prevail as to those provisions.
Chapter VI
ELECTIONS
Sec. 6.1. Qualifications.
   Each person who meets the qualifications of an elector of the State of
Michigan or who will have such qualifications at the next ensuing regular or
special election shall be entitled to register as an elector of the City of
Hart in the voting district in which such person resides.
Sec. 6.2. Election Procedure.
   The general election laws of the State shall apply to and control as near as
may be all procedure relating to elections except as such laws relate to
political parties or partisan procedure. In any circumstances, where the
application of said laws may be uncertain, the Election Commission shall
construe the same and prescribe the procedure.
Sec. 6.3. Regular Elections.
   A nonpartisan regular City election shall be held on the first Monday in
April in each year for the election of City officers.
Sec. 6.4. Special Elections.
   Special elections shall be held when called by resolution of the Council at
least sixty (60) days in advance of such election, or when required by this
Charter or the general laws of the State. Any resolution calling a special
election shall set forth the purpose of such election. No more than two (2)
special elections shall be held in any one calendar year.
Sec. 6.5. Notice of Elections.
   Notice of the time and place of holding any election and the officer to be
elected and the question to be voted upon shall be given by the City Clerk as
provided for by State law.
Sec. 6.6. Voting Hours.
   The polls of all elections shall be opened at 7:00 a.m. on election day and
shall remain open until 8:00 p.m. of the same day. Every qualified elector
present and in line at the polls at the hour prescribed for the closing thereof
shall be allowed to vote.
Sec. 6.7. Nominations.
   The method of nomination for all candidates for City election shall be by
petition. Such petitions for each candidate shall be signed by not less than
twenty (20) nor more than forty (40) registered electors of the City and shall
be filed with the Clerk not more than sixty (60) days and not later than 4:00
p.m. on the fortieth day preceding either a regular or special election. No
person shall sign his name to a greater number of petitions for any one office
than there are persons to be elected to said office at the following City
election. Where the signature of any individual appears on more petitions than
he is permitted to sign, the signatures bearing the most recent date shall be
invalidated. The Clerk shall publish notice of the last day permitted for
filing nominating petitions and of the number of persons to be elected to each
office at least one week before, and not more than three (3) weeks before, the
filing deadlines. The form of petition shall be substantially as that
designated by the Secretary of State for the nomination of nonpartisan
officers. The Clerk shall provide and maintain a supply of official petition
forms.
Sec. 6.8. Form and Approval of Petition.
   The Clerk shall accept for filing only nominating petitions on official
blanks containing the required number of signatures for candidates having those
qualifications required for elective City officers by this Charter. When
petitions are filed by persons other than the person whose name appears thereon
as a candidate, they may be accepted for filing only when accompanied by the
written consent of the person in whose behalf the petition or petitions were
circulated. The Clerk shall forthwith determine the sufficiency of the
signatures on each petition filed, and if he finds that any petition does not
contain the required number of qualified signatures, he shall immediately
notify the candidate, who may file an amended petition not later than five (5)
days after the date for filing the original petition. Each petition which is
found by the Clerk to contain the required number of signatures shall be marked
"in order" with the date thereof, and the Clerk shall so notify the candidate
whose name appears thereon, in writing. All nominating petitions filed shall be
open to public inspection in the office of the Clerk.
Sec. 6.9. Form of Ballot.
   The form of the ballot used in any City election shall conform as nearly as

   After extending the taxes on the assessment roll and certifying to such roll
in the manner required of assessing officers by State law the Assessor shall on

Clerk together with a copy or duplicate thereof. The Clerk shall forthwith
annex his warrant to the original roll, directing and requiring the Treasurer
to collect from the several persons named in such roll the several sums, or the
total thereof, opposite their respective names. The taxes thus assessed shall
become at once a debt to the City from the persons to whom they are assessed;
and the amount assessed, together with all charges thereon, shall on the first
(1st) day of July become a lien, until paid, on the property assessed of the
same character and effect as a lien created by general law for State and County
taxes.
Sec. 10.11. When Taxes Due.
   City taxes shall be due and payable on July 1st of each year. All taxes paid
on or before the 31st day of August shall be collected by the City Treasurer

Treasurer shall add to all taxes paid thereafter the maximum collection charges
as provided by State law, and on the first (1st) day of each succeeding month
he shall add the maximum monthly tax delinquency charged provided by State law.
Such collection charges shall not exceed the maximum allowed by State law and
shall belong to the City and constitute a charge and shall be a lien against
the property to which the taxes apply, collectible in the same manner as the
taxes to which they are added.
   If mailing of the tax bills is delayed for any reason for more than fifteen
(15) days after July 1st, the application of the collection charge provided
herein shall be postponed thirty (30) days for each thirty (30) days or major
fraction thereof of such delay.
   City taxes which remain unpaid on the 31st day of October, together with the
penalties added thereto, shall be spread on the December tax roll for the
collection of County and School taxes, and shall be collected in the same
manner and subject to the same collection charges as said County and School
taxes. The collection fees herein provided and all penalty charges shall be
credited to the general fund. In the collection of taxes, both real and
personal property, the Treasurer shall have and exercise all the powers
possessed by City and Township Treasurers for the collection of taxes.

   All City taxes on real property remaining uncollected by the City Treasurer
at the end of the last day for collection of County and School taxes shall be
returned to the County Treasurer in the manner and with like effect as provided
by statute for returns by Township Treasurers of Township, School and County
taxes. Such returns shall include all the additional assessments, charges and
fees hereinbefore provided which shall be added to the amount assessed in said
tax roll against each property or person. The taxes thus returned shall be
collected in the same manner as other taxes returned to the County Treasurer
are collected, in accordance with statute, and shall be and remain a lien upon
the property against which they are assessed until paid. If by change in
statute or otherwise, the County Treasurer is no longer charged with the
collection of delinquent real property taxes, such delinquent taxes shall be
collected in the manner then provided by statute for the collection of
delinquent Township, School and County taxes.
Sec. 10.13. State, County, and School Taxes.
   For the purpose of assessing, levying, and collecting taxes for State,
County, and school purposes, the City shall be considered the same as a
Township, and all provisions of law relative to the collection of and
accounting of such taxes shall apply. For these purposes the City Treasurer
shall perform the same duties and have the same powers as are granted and
imposed upon Township Treasurers by law.
Sec. 10.14. Erroneous Assessment.
   If it shall be found at any time within one (1) year after the date City tax
notices are mailed that any property has been subjected to an erroneous
assessment or tax by reason of errors in computations, decimal misplacements,
double entries, and the like, so that the same amounts to a constructive fraud
upon the taxpayer, and if the City Attorney shall file a written opinion with
the Council indicating that under current law relief would be granted by a
court of competent jurisdiction, then the Council may so determine and declare
by resolution without requiring the commencement of court proceedings, and any
necessary adjustment may be taken from the general fund of the City.

electors of the City at its next regular election or at a special election
called for that purpose by the Council. The Council may make any improvements

203.05   MUNICIPAL ORDINANCE VIOLATIONS BUREAU.
   (a)   Establishment. The City hereby establishes a Municipal Ordinance
Violations Bureau (the Bureau) as authorized under Section 8396 of the Act to
accept admissions of responsibility for Municipal civil infractions in response
to Municipal civil infraction violation notices issued and served by authorized
City officials, and to collect and retain civil fines and costs as prescribed
by these Codified Ordinances or any other ordinance.
   (b)   Location; Supervision; Rules and Regulations; Employees. The Bureau
shall be located at Hart City Hall and shall be under the supervision and
control of the City Treasurer. The City Treasurer, subject to the approval of
the City Council, shall adopt rules and regulations for the operation of the
Bureau and appoint any necessary qualified City employees to administer the
Bureau.
    (c)   Disposition of Violations. The Bureau may dispose only of Municipal
civil infraction violations for which a fine has been scheduled and for which a
Municipal civil infraction violation notice (as compared with a citation) has
been issued. The fact that a fine has been scheduled for a particular violation
shall not entitle any person to dispose of the violation at the Bureau. Nothing
in this chapter shall prevent or restrict the City from issuing a Municipal
civil infraction citation for any violation or from prosecuting any violation
in a court of competent jurisdiction. No person shall be required to dispose of
a Municipal civil infraction violation at the Bureau and may have the violation
processed before a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The unwillingness of any
person to dispose of any violation at the Bureau shall not prejudice the person
or in any way diminish the person's rights, privileges and protection accorded
by law.
    (d)   Scope of Authority. The scope of the Bureau's authority shall be
limited to accepting admissions of responsibility for Municipal civil
infractions and collecting and retaining civil fines and costs as a result of
those admissions. The Bureau shall not accept payment of a fine from any person
who denies having committed the offense or who admits responsibility only with
explanation, and in no event shall the Bureau determine, or attempt to
determine, the truth or falsity of any fact or matter relating to an alleged
violation. 
   (e)   Municipal Civil Infraction Violation Notices. Municipal civil
infraction violation notices shall be issued and served by authorized City
officials under the same circumstances and upon the same persons as are
provided for citations in Section
203.03(f) and (g). In addition to any other information required by these
Codified Ordinances or any other ordinance, the notice of violation shall
indicate the time by which the alleged violator must appear at the Bureau, the
methods by which an appearance may be made, the address and telephone number of
the Bureau, the hours during which the Bureau is open, the amount of the fine
scheduled for the alleged violation and the consequences for failure to appear
and pay the required fine within the required time.
   (f)   Appearances; Payment of Fines and Costs. An alleged violator receiving
a Municipal civil infraction violation notice shall appear at the Bureau and
pay the specified fine and costs at or by the time specified for appearance in
the Municipal civil infraction violation notice. An appearance may be made by
mail, in person or by representation.
    (g)   Filing and Service of Municipal Civil Infraction Citations. If an
authorized City official issues and serves a Municipal ordinance violation
notice, and if an admission of responsibility is not made and the civil fine
and costs, if any, prescribed by the schedule of fines for the violation are
not paid at the Bureau, a Municipal civil infraction citation may be filed with
the District Court, and a copy of the citation may be served by first-class
mail upon the alleged violator at the alleged violator's last known address.
The citation filed with the Court does not need to comply in all particulars
with the requirements for citations as provided by Sections 8705 and 8709 of
the Act, but shall consist of a sworn complaint containing the allegations
stated in the Municipal ordinance violation notice and shall fairly inform the
alleged violator how to respond to the citation.

208.01   SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Special Assessment
Ordinance of the City.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.02   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Cost," when referring to the cost of any public improvement, shall
include the cost of services, plans, condemnation, financing, construction and
legal fees and all other costs incident to the making of such improvement, the
special assessments therefor and the financing thereof.
   (b)   "Public improvement" means any improvement upon public property which
results in special benefit to the real property in the vicinity of such
improvement.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.03   SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS AUTHORIZED.
   The entire cost and expense or any part thereof of all public improvements
may be defrayed by special assessment upon the lands especially benefited by
the improvement in the manner hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.04   INITIATION OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   Proceedings for making public improvements may be initiated by resolution of
the Council or by petition of a majority of the owners of land liable to be
assessed in any proposed special assessment district.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.05   FORM OF PETITIONS.
   All petitions for public improvements shall be on a form supplied by the
City Clerk and shall include an affidavit by one or more of the circulators
that the signatures appearing thereon are genuine and each signer declares
himself to be the owner of the interest in the land indicated. All such
petitions shall be filed with the City Clerk and referred to the City Manager
and City Assessor for investigation and report, and the City Clerk shall report
the receipt of all such petitions to Council at the next regular meeting
following a receipt of any such petition.
208.06   INVESTIGATION BY CITY ASSESSOR.
   All petitions for public improvements shall be investigated by the City
Assessor to determine whether a sufficient number of valid signatures has been
obtained and, if such investigation discloses a deficiency, the said petition
shall be returned to the circulator with notice of that fact. Where any lot or
parcel of land is owned by more than one person, each person having an interest
must join in the petition.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.07   DUTIES OF CITY MANAGER AND CITY ASSESSOR.
   Whenever the City Assessor shall determine that a petition containing the
required number of valid signatures has been received, or whenever Council
shall, by resolution, so direct, the City Manager and City Assessor shall make
an investigation of the proposed public improvement and report their findings
to Council. The report shall include an analysis of the following:
   (a)   Tax delinquency in the proposed special assessment district;
   (b)   Present land use and potential use;
   (c)   Present assessed value of the land;
   (d)   The estimated cost of the proposed project; and
   (e)   The need for the improvement and the necessity, feasibility and
desirability of the proposed improvement.
208.08   FILING OF REPORT AND NOTICE OF HEARING.
   Upon receipt of the report of the City Manager and City Assessor, if the
Council shall determine to proceed with the said improvement it shall order the
said report filed with the City Clerk for public examination and shall publish
notice of its intention to make the said public improvement at least once in a
newspaper published and generally circulated in the City. Said notice shall
describe the property to be included in the proposed special assessment
district, the nature of the improvement and the estimated cost of the same, and
shall set a time, not less than one week following the date of publication
thereof, when the Council will meet and hear objections to the proposed
improvement or to the inclusion of any property within the proposed district.
208.09   MODIFICATION.
   The Council may, at or after the said public hearing, modify the said
proposed improvements or district in any respect which it deems in the best
interests of the City at large, provided that in the event the amount of work
is increased or the boundaries of the district enlarged, then another hearing
shall be held pursuant to notice required by Section 252.08. Any hearing may be
adjourned from time to time without further notice.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.10   DETERMINATION TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS; OBJECTIONS.
   If, after hearing any objections, the Council shall determine to proceed
with the improvement, it shall so determine by resolution. Such resolution
shall include the determination of the necessity for the improvement, set forth
the nature hereof, designate the limits of the special assessment district to
be affected, describe the lands to be assessed, determine the part or
proportion of the cost to be paid by the lands especially benefited thereby,
and the part or proportion, if any, to be paid by the City at large, determine
the number of installments in which the said assessment may be paid and the
rate of interest, not exceeding six percent, to be charged if the payment of
any balance is to be deferred, and shall order the City Manager to prepare
plans, profiles and specifications for the work to be done. If there are any
objections in writing filed with the City Clerk prior to the said hearing, the
passage of such resolution shall require the concurrence of two-thirds of the
Council members elected.
208.11   COMPLETION OF PLANS; ADVERTISEMENT FOR BIDS.
   When the said plans, profiles and specifications have been completed, the
City Manager shall return the same to the Council and the Council shall, if the
work is to be done by independent contractors, order the advertisement for
sealed bids for the work in accordance with the purchasing procedure. In
addition, such advertisement shall specify that no contract shall be let until
the special assessment roll has been confirmed and no bid may be withdrawn for
forty-five days after the opening thereof. In the event the work is to be done
by the City, the Manager shall present a revised estimate of costs at the time
the said plans, profiles and specifications are returned to the Council.
208.12   DETERMINATION OF COSTS.
   After the opening of the said bids, the Council shall revise the estimated
cost of the said improvement upon the basis of the bids received or, where the
work is to be done by the City, shall revise the estimated cost on the basis of
the estimate of the City Manager, and shall direct the Board of Special
Assessors to make a special assessment roll of the part of proportion of the
costs to be borne by the lands especially benefited as determined by the
Council.
208.13   NOTICE AND HEARING ON ROLL.
   When the special assessment roll shall have been reported to Council by the
Board of Special Assessors, the Council shall order the same filed in the
office of the City Clerk for public examination, and shall order publication of
a notice of public hearing when the Council will meet and review the said roll.
Such notice shall be made by at least one publication in a newspaper printed
and circulated in the City, at least one week prior to the time set for the
said hearing.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.14   HEARING; CORRECTIONS OR CHANGES IN ROLL; CONFIRMATION; OBJECTIONS.
   The Council shall meet and review the said special assessment roll at the
time and place appointed or at an adjourned meeting thereof and shall consider
any objections thereto. The Council may correct said roll as to any assessment
or description of any lot or parcel of land or other errors appearing therein.
After such hearing and review, the Council may confirm such special assessment
roll with such corrections as it may have made, if any, or may refer it back to
the Board of Special Assessors for revision, or may annul it or any proceedings
in connection therewith. No special assessment roll shall be finally confirmed,
except by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Council members elected, if
prior to said hearing written objections to the proposed improvement have been
filed with the City Clerk by the owners of the property which will be required
to bear more than twenty-five percent of the amount of such special assessment.
The City Clerk shall endorse the date of confirmation upon each assessment.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.15   ROLL TO BE FINAL AND CONCLUSIVE.
   The special assessment roll shall be, upon confirmation, final and
conclusive.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.16   LIEN; DATE ASSESSMENTS DUE; INSTALLMENTS.
   All special assessments contained in any special assessment roll, including
any part thereof to be paid in installments, shall, from the date of
confirmation of such roll, constitute a lien upon the respective lots or
parcels of land assessed and until paid shall be a charge against the
respective owners of the several lots and parcels of land and a debt to the
City from the persons to whom they are assessed. Such liens shall be of the
same character and effect as the lien created by the City Charter for City
taxes and shall include accrued interest and fees. No judgment or degree nor
any act of the Council vacating a special assessment shall destroy or impair
the lien of the City upon the premises assessed for such amount of the
assessment as may be equitably charged against the same or as by a regular mode
of proceeding upon confirmation of the special assessment roll or in annual
installments, not to exceed ten in number, as the Council may determine at the
time of confirmation, and, if in annual installments, the Council shall
determine the first installment to be due upon confirmation and the subsequent
installments to be due on July 1 in each succeeding year.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.17   REPORT TO CITY TREASURER.
   Whenever any special assessment roll shall be confirmed and be payable, the
Council shall direct the City Clerk to transmit the said assessment roll to the
City Treasurer for collection. The City Treasurer shall mail statements of the
several assessments to the respective owners of the several lots and parcels of
land assessed, as indicated by the records of the Board of Special Assessors,
stating the amount of the assessment and the manner in which it may be paid,
provided, however, that failure to mail any such statement shall not invalidate
the assessment or entitle the owner to an extension of time within which to pay
the assessment.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.18   PAYMENT WITHOUT PENALTY OR INTEREST.
   The whole or any part of any such assessment may be paid at any time after
the date of confirmation of the special assessment roll until the tenth day of
the second calendar month following such confirmation without interest or
penalty.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.19   SPREADING UPON THE ROLLS.
   The second installment shall be spread upon the City tax roll for the year
in which it falls due in a column headed "Special Assessments," together with
interest upon all unpaid installments from the date of the confirmation of the
roll to July 1 in the year in which the said installment is spread upon the
roll, provided, that any fraction of a month shall be considered a full month.
Thereafter, one installment shall be spread in the same manner upon each annual
tax roll together with the accumulated interest upon all unpaid installments.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.20   COLLECTION; FEES.
   After each special assessment or installment has been placed on the tax
rolls, the same shall be collected by the City Treasurer with the same rights
and remedies as provided in the Charter for the collection of taxes. The City
Treasurer shall add to all assessments or installments paid during the month of
July, when currently due, one percent of the amount of the assessment or
installment, and, on the first day of each succeeding month, one percent of
such assessment or installment, through and including October 1, and thereafter
a collection fee of four percent of the amount of the assessment or
installment.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.21   PREPAYMENT.
   After the expiration of the period provided in Section
208.18 for payment without interest or fees, any installment which has not been
spread upon the tax rolls may be discharged by paying the face amount thereof
together with interest thereon from the date of confirmation to the date of
payment, provided, however, that if the public improvement has been financed by
the sale of noncallable bonds or other evidences of indebtedness which are not
prepayable, then the interest shall be computed from the date of confirmation
to the date upon which such installment would have fallen due had it not been
prepaid. The Board of Special Assessors shall report to the City Assessor all
advance payments on installments, so that the said Board shall have such
information before spreading installments on the next City tax roll.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.22   CERTIFICATION OF COSTS.
   Upon completion of the improvement, the financing thereof and the payment of
the cost thereof, the City Clerk shall certify to the Council the total cost of
said improvement, together with the amount of the original roll for said
improvement.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.23   DEFICIENCY IN ASSESSMENTS.
   Should the assessments in any special assessment roll, including the amount
assessed to the City at large, prove insufficient for any reason to pay the
cost of the improvement for which they were made, then the Council may make
additional assessments to supply the deficiency against the City and the
several lots and parcels of land in the same ratio as the original assessments,
but the total amount assessed against any lot or parcel of land shall not
exceed twenty-five percent of the value of such lot or parcel of land, as
valued and assessed for State and County taxation in the last preceding tax
roll, in reference to any one improvement.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.24   LANDS DIVIDED AFTER ASSESSMENTS; APPORTIONMENT OF ASSESSMENT.
   Should any lots or lands be divided after a special assessment thereon has
been confirmed and divided into installments, the City Assessor shall apportion
the uncollected amounts upon the several lots and lands so divided, and shall
enter the several amounts upon the next tax roll. The apportionment, when the
tax roll shall have been reviewed and confirmed, shall be final and conclusive
on all parties.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.25   EXCESS OF ASSESSMENTS.
   The excess by which any special assessment proves larger than the actual
cost of the improvement and expenses incidental thereto may be placed in the
General Fund of the City if such excess is five percent or less of the
assessment, but should the assessment prove larger than necessary by more than
five percent, the entire excess shall be refunded on a pro rata basis to the
owners of the property taxed. Such refund shall be made by credit against
future unpaid installments in the inverse order in which they are payable to
the extent such installments shall exist, and the balance of such refund shall
be paid in cash to the owners of the property as shown by the last tax roll. No
refunds may be made which contravene the provisions of any evidence of
indebtedness secured in whole or in part by such special assessments.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.26   ILLEGAL ASSESSMENT; REASSESSMENT PROCEDURE.
   Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of the Council, be
invalid by reason of irregularity or informality in the proceedings, or if any
court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge such assessment to be illegal,
the Council shall, whether the improvement has been made or not, or whether any
part of the assessments have been paid or not, have power to cause a new
assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was
made. All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall
be conducted in the same manner as provided for the original assessment, and
whenever any assessment or part thereof levied upon any premises has been set
aside, if the same has been paid and not refunded, the payment so made shall be
applied upon the reassessment on said premises, and the reassessment shall to
that extent be deemed satisfied.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)
208.27   ASSESSMENT IRREGULARITIES; EFFECT.
   If in any action it shall appear that by reason of any irregularities or
informalities, the assessment has not been properly made against the defendant
or upon the lot or premises sought to be charged, the court may nevertheless,
on satisfactory proof that expense has been incurred by the City, which is a
proper charge against the defendant or the lot or premises in question, render
judgment for the amount properly chargeable against such defendant or upon such
lot or premises.
(Ord. 46. Passed 7-17-56.)

(Ord. 155. Passed 10-23-84; Ord. Unno. Passed 12-9-03.)
210.04   PURCHASES OR CONTRACTS OVER ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,000).
   Any expenditure for non-routine or non-operational supplies, materials,
equipment, construction projects or contracts obligating the City, where the
amount of the City's obligation is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, and
any expenditure of routine or operational supplies, materials or equipment
where the amount of the City's obligation is over five thousand dollars
($5,000) shall be approved by the City Council and shall be governed by the
provisions of this section and Section
15.2 of the City Charter.
   (a)   The City Manager shall solicit bids from at least two of such
qualified prospective bidders as are known to him or her by sending each a copy
of the notice requesting bids and notice thereof shall be posted in the City
Hall. Bids shall be solicited by newspaper advertisement when directed by the
City Council.
   (b)   Unless prescribed by the Council, the City Manager shall determine the
amount to be deposited with any bid, which deposit shall be in the form of
cash, certified or cashier's check or bond written by a surety company
authorized to do business in the State of Michigan. The amount of such deposit
shall be expressed in terms of percentage of the bid submitted. Unless fixed by
the Council, the Manager shall fix the amount of the performance bond and in
the case of construction contracts, the amount of the labor and materials bond
to be required of the successful bidders.
   (c)   Bids shall be opened in public, at the time and place designated in
the notice requesting bids, in the presence of the City Manager and at least
one other City official, preferably the head of the department most closely
concerned with the subject of the contract. The bids shall thereupon be
carefully examined and tabulated and reported to the Council, with the
recommendation of the City Manager, at the next Council meeting. After
tabulation, all bids may be inspected by the competing bidders. In lieu of the
procedure for opening bids herein specified, the Council may direct that bids
be opened at a Council meeting.
   (d)   When such bids are submitted to the Council, if the Council shall find
any of the bids to be satisfactory, it shall award the contract to the lowest
competent bidder meeting specifications, unless the Council shall determine
that the public interest will be better served by accepting a higher bid. Such
award may be by resolution. The Council shall have the right to reject any or
all bids and to waive irregularities in bidding and to accept bids which do not
conform in every respect to the bidding requirements.
   (e)   All bids and deposits of certified or cashier's checks may be retained
until the contract is awarded and signed. If any successful bidder fails or
refuses to enter into the contract awarded to him or her within five days after
the same has been awarded, or file any bond required within the same time, the
deposit accompanying his or her bid shall be forfeited to the City, and the
Council may, in its discretion, award the contract to the next lower competent
bidder meeting specifications, or to another competent bidder meeting
specifications if the Council shall determine that the public interest will be
better served by accepting such other bid, or said contract may be re-
advertised.

remained on public property or private property for a period of 48 hours after
a police agency or other governmental agency designated by the police agency
has affixed a written notice to the vehicle.
   (2)   If a vehicle has remained on public or private property for a period
of time so that it appears to the police agency to be abandoned, the police
agency shall do all of the following:
      (a)   Determine if the vehicle has been reported stolen;
      (b)   Affix a written notice to the vehicle. The written notice shall
contain the following information:

notice.

stored, at the owner's expense, or scrapped if the vehicle is not removed.
         (v)   The year, make and vehicle identification number of the vehicle,
if available.
   (3)   If the vehicle is not removed within 48 hours after the date the

vehicle identification numbers or because a check with the records of the
secretary of state does not reveal ownership, the police agency may sell the

intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, or a combination of intoxicating
liquor and a controlled substance, shall not operate a vehicle upon a highway
or other place open to the general public, including an area designated for the

   (4)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person who is
convicted of a violation of subsection (1), (2) or (3) hereof is guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 90 days or a fine of

specified portion of the period of suspension, to drive only to and from the
person's residence and work location; in the course of the person's employment
or occupation; to and from an alcohol or drug education program or treatment
program as ordered by the court; to and from the person's residence and an
educational institution at which the person is enrolled as a student; or
pursuant to a combination of these restrictions. The court shall not order the
secretary of state to issue a restricted chauffeur's license which would permit
a person to operate a truck or truck tractor, including a trailer, which hauls
hazardous material. The court shall not order the secretary of state to issue a
restricted license unless the person states under oath and the court finds that
the person is unable to take public transportation to and from his or her work
location, place of alcohol or drug education or treatment, or educational
institution, and does not have any family members or others able to provide
transportation. The court order and license shall indicate the person's work
location and the approved route or routes and permitted times of travel. For

years of a prior conviction may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than
one year or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both. As part of the sentence,
the court shall order the secretary of state to revoke the operator's or
chauffeur's license of the person. For purposes of this section, "prior
conviction" means a conviction under subsection (1) or (2) hereof, a local
ordinance substantially corresponding to subsection (1) or (2) hereof, or a law
of another state substantially corresponding to subsection (1) or (2) hereof.
   (6)   As part of the sentence for a violation of subsection (1) or (2)
hereof, or a local ordinance substantially corresponding to subsection (1) or

days. The person shall reimburse the City for the cost of insurance incurred by
the City as a result of the person's activities under this subsection.
   (7)   Before imposing sentence for a violation of subsection (1) or (2)
hereof, or a local ordinance substantially corresponding to subsection (1) or
(2) hereof, the court shall order the person to undergo screening and
assessment by a person or agency designated by the office of substance abuse
services, to determine whether the person is likely to benefit from
rehabilitative services, including alcohol or drug education and alcohol or
drug treatment programs. As part of the sentence, the court may order the
person to participate in and successfully complete 1 or more appropriate
rehabilitative programs. The person shall pay for the cost of the screening,
assessment and rehabilitative services.
   (8)   Before accepting a plea of guilty under this section, the court shall
advise the accused of the statutory consequences possible as the result of a

   (9)   The operator's or chauffeur's license of a person found guilty of
violating subsection (1) or (2) hereof, or a local ordinance substantially
corresponding to subsection (1) or (2) hereof, shall be surrendered to the
court in which the person was convicted, and the court shall immediately
forward the surrendered license and an abstract of conviction to the secretary
of state. The abstract of conviction shall indicate the sentence imposed. Upon
receipt of, and pursuant to, the abstract of conviction, the secretary of state
shall suspend or revoke the person's license and, if ordered by the court and
the person is otherwise eligible for a license, issue to the person a
restricted license stating the limited driving privileges indicated on the
abstract. If the license is not forwarded to the secretary of state, an
explanation of the reason why the license is absent shall be attached. If the
conviction is appealed to the circuit court of the county, that court may, ex
parte, order the secretary of state to rescind the suspension, revocation or
restricted license issued pursuant to this section.
   Sec. 5.15a. Criminal prosecutions for operating under the influence of
intoxicating liquor; tests; admissibility; presumption; liability for
withdrawing blood; refusal to take test; other evidence. (Amended)
   (1)   The amount of alcohol or presence of a controlled substance, or both,
in a driver's blood at the time alleged, as shown by chemical analysis of the
person's blood, urine or breath, shall be admissible into evidence in a
criminal prosecution for any of the following:
      (a)   A violation of section 5.15(1), (2) or (3), 5.15b or a local
ordinance substantially corresponding to section 5.15(1), (2) or (3) or 5.15b;
or
      (b)   Felonious driving, negligent homicide or manslaughter resulting
from the operation of a motor vehicle while the driver is alleged to have been
impaired by or under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a controlled
substance, or a combination of intoxicating liquor and a controlled substance,
or to have had a blood alcohol content of 0.10 percent or more by weight of
alcohol.
   (2)   If a test is given, the results of the test shall be made available to
the person charged or the person's attorney upon written request to the
prosecution, with a copy of the request filed with the court. The prosecution
shall furnish the report at least 2 days before the day of the trial and the
results shall be offered as evidence by the prosecution in a criminal
proceeding. Failure to fully comply with the request shall bar the admission of
the results into evidence by the prosecution.
   (3)   Except in a prosecution relating solely to a violation of section 5.15
(2), the amount of alcohol in the driver's blood at the time alleged, as shown
by chemical analysis of the person's blood, urine or breath, shall give rise to
the following presumptions:
      (a)   If there was at the time 0.07 percent or less by weight of alcohol
in the defendant's blood, it shall be presumed that the defendant was not under
the influence of intoxicating liquor.
      (b)   If there was at the time in excess of 0.07 percent but less than
0.10 percent by weight of alcohol in the defendant's blood, it shall be
presumed that the defendant's ability to operate a vehicle was impaired, within
the provisions of section 5.15b, due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor.
      (c)   If there was at the time 0.10 percent or more by weight of alcohol
in the defendant's blood, it shall be presumed that the defendant was under the
influence of intoxicating liquor.
   (4)   A sample or specimen of urine or breath shall be taken and collected
in a reasonable manner. Only a licensed physician, or a licensed nurse or
medical technician under the direction of a licensed physician and qualified to
withdraw blood acting in a medical environment, at the request of a peace
officer, may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the amount of
alcohol or presence of a controlled substance, or both, in the person's blood,
as provided in this code. Liability for a crime or civil damages predicated on
the act of withdrawing blood and related procedures shall not attach to a
qualified person who withdraws blood or assists in the withdrawal in accordance
with this code, unless the withdrawal is performed in a negligent manner.
   (5)   The tests shall be administered at the request of a peace officer
having reasonable grounds to believe the person has committed a crime described
in subsection (1) hereof. A person who takes a chemical test administered at
the request of a peace officer, as provided in this section, shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to have a person of his or her own choosing administer
one of the chemical tests described in this section within a reasonable time
after his or her detention, and the results of the test shall be admissible and
shall be considered with other competent evidence in determining the innocence
or guilt of the defendant. If the person charged is administered a chemical
test by a person of his or her own choosing, the person charged shall be
responsible for obtaining a chemical analysis of the test sample. The person
charged shall be informed that he or she has the right to demand that a person
of his or her choosing administer one of the tests provided for in subsection
(1) hereof, that the results of the test shall be admissible and shall be
considered with other competent evidence in determining the innocence or guilt
of the defendant, and that the person charged shall be responsible for
obtaining a chemical analysis of the test sample.
   (6)   The person charged shall be advised that if the person refuses the
request of a peace officer to take a test described in this section, a test
shall not be given without a court order. The person charged shall also be
advised that the person's refusal of the request of a peace officer to take a
test described in this section will result in the suspension of his or her
operator's or chauffeur's license or operating privilege and in the addition of
6 points to his or her driver record.
   (7)   This section shall not be construed as limiting the introduction of
any other competent evidence bearing upon the question of whether or not the
person was impaired by or under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a
controlled substance, or a combination of intoxicating liquor and a controlled
substance, or whether or not the person had a blood alcohol content of 0.10
percent or more by weight of alcohol.
   (8)   If a jury instruction regarding a defendant's refusal to submit to a
chemical test under this section is requested by the prosecution or the
defendant, the jury instruction shall be given as follows:
   "Evidence was admitted in this case which, if believed by the jury, could
prove that the defendant had exercised his or her right to refuse a chemical
test. You are instructed that such a refusal is within the statutory rights of
the defendant and is not evidence of his guilt. You are not to consider such a
refusal in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant."
   (9)   If, after an accident, the driver of a vehicle involved in the
accident is transported to a medical facility and a sample of the driver's
blood is withdrawn at that time for the purpose of medical treatment, the
results of a chemical analysis of that sample shall be admissible in a criminal
prosecution for a crime described in subsection (1) hereof to show the amount
of alcohol or presence of a controlled substance, or both, in the person's
blood at the time alleged, regardless of whether the person had been offered or
had refused a chemical test. The medical facility or person performing the
chemical analysis shall disclose the results of the analysis to a prosecuting
attorney who request the results for use in a criminal prosecution as provided
in this subsection. A medical facility or person disclosing information in
compliance with this subsection shall not be civilly or criminally liable for
making the disclosure.
   (10)   If, after a highway accident, the driver of a vehicle involved in the
accident is deceased, a sample of the decedent's blood shall be withdrawn in a
manner directed by the medical examiner for the purpose of determining blood
alcohol content or presence of a controlled substance, or both.
   Sec. 5.15b. Operating while ability impaired. (Amended)
   (1)   A person shall not operate a vehicle upon a highway or other place
open to the general public, including an area designated for the parking of
vehicles, within the City, when, due to the consumption of an intoxicating
liquor, a controlled substance, or a combination of an intoxicating liquor and
a controlled substance, the person has visibly impaired his or her ability to

(2), a finding of guilty is permissible under this section.
   (2)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person convicted of a
violation of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by

both, together with costs of the prosecution. As part of the sentence, the
court shall order the secretary of state to suspend the operator's or
chauffeur's license of the person for a period of not less than 90 days nor
more than 1 year. The court may order the secretary of state to issue to the

occupation; to and from an alcohol or drug education program or treatment
program as ordered by the court; to and from the person's residence and an
educational institution at which the person is enrolled as a student; or
pursuant to a combination of these restrictions. The court shall not order the
secretary of state to issue a restricted chauffeur's license which would permit
a person to operate a truck or truck-tractor, including a trailer, which hauls
hazardous material. The court shall not order the secretary of state to issue a
restricted license unless the person states under oath and the court finds that
the person is unable to take public transportation to and from his or her work
location, place of alcohol or drug education or treatment, or educational
institution, and does not have any family members or others able to provide
transportation. The court order and license shall indicate the person's work
location and the approved route or routes and permitted times of travel. For
purposes of this subsection, "work location" includes, as applicable, either or
both of the following:
      (i)   The specific place or places of employment; and/or
      (ii)   The territory or territories regularly visited by the person in
pursuance of the person's occupation.

court may order the secretary of state to issue to the person a restricted
license as provided in subsection (2) hereof, except that a restricted license
shall not be issued during the first 60 days of the suspension period. For
purposes of this section, "prior conviction" means a conviction under this
section, section 5.15(1) or (2), or a local ordinance substantially
corresponding to this section or section 5.15(1) or (2) or a law of another
state substantialaly corresponding to this section or section 5.15(1) or (2).
   (4)   A person who violates this section, or a local ordinance substantially
corresponding to this section, within 10 years of 2 or more prior convictions,
may be sentenced as provided in subsection (3) hereof, except that as part of
the sentence the court shall order the secretary of state to revoke the

compensation, for a period not to exceed 12 days. The person shall reimburse
the City for the cost of insurance incurred by the City as a result of the
person's activities under this subsection.
   (6)   Before imposing sentence for a violation of this section, or a local
ordinance substantially corresponding to this section, the court shall order
the person to undergo screening and assessment by a person or agency designated
by the office of substance abuse services, to determine whether the person is
likely to benefit from rehabilitative service, including alcohol or drug
education and alcohol or drug treatment programs. As part of the sentence, the
court may order the person to participate in and successfully complete one or
more appropriate rehabilitative programs. The person shall pay for the costs of
the screening, assessment and rehabilitative services.
   (7)   Before accepting a plea of guilty under this section, the court shall
advise the accused of the statutory consequences possible as a result of a plea
of guilty with respect to suspension or revocation of an operator's or
chauffeur's license, the penalty imposed for violation of this section and the
limitation on the right of appeal.

petition was filed, not less than 10 days before the matter is set for review,
the original or a certified copy of the official record of the proceedings.
Proceedings at which evidence was presented need not be transcribed and

the court in which the petition is filed for the additional costs. The court
may permit subsequent corrections to the record.

provided for shall further state the nature of the violation and where it
occurred. It shall state that, unless the offender appears before the Bureau
within the designated period, a complaint will be made before the District

814.02   PURPOSES; IMPLEMENTATION AND INTERPRETATION.
   The purposes of this chapter are to:
   (a)   Adopt regulations consistent with the Act and the FCC Rules with
respect to basic cable service rate regulation; and
   (b)   Prescribe procedures to provide a reasonable opportunity for
consideration of the views of interested parties in connection with basic cable
service rate regulation by the City.
   This chapter shall be implemented and interpreted consistent with the Act
and the FCC Rules.
(Ord. 173. Passed 9-28-93.)
814.03   COMPLIANCE WITH FCC RULES.
   In connection with the regulation of rates for basic cable service and
associated equipment, the City shall follow all FCC Rules.
(Ord. 173. Passed 9-28-93.)
814.04   FILING OF RATE SCHEDULES OR INCREASES BY OPERATORS; ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION; BURDEN OF PROOF.
   (a)   A cable operator shall submit its schedule of rates for the basic
service tier and associated equipment or a proposed increase in such rates in
accordance with the Act and the FCC Rules. The cable operator shall include, as
part of its submission, such information as is necessary to show that its
schedule of rates or its proposed increase in rates complies with the Act and
the FCC Rules. The cable operator shall file ten copies of the schedule of
rates or proposed increase in such rates with the City Manager. For purposes of
this chapter, the filing of the cable operator shall be deemed to have been
made when at least ten copies have been received by the City Manager. Council
may, by resolution or otherwise, adopt rules and regulations as allowed by law
prescribing the information, data and calculations which must be included as
part of the cable operator's filing of the schedule of rates or proposed
increase in such rates.
   (b)   In addition to information and data required by rules and regulations
of the City adopted pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, a cable operator shall

specific, identified portions of its response be treated as confidential and
withheld from public disclosure. The request must state the reason why the
information should be treated as proprietary and the facts that support such
reason. The request for confidentiality will be granted if the City determines
that the preponderance of the evidence shows that nondisclosure is consistent
with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 USC 522. The City
shall place in a public file for inspection any decision that results in
information being withheld. If the cable operator requests confidentiality and
the request is denied:
      (1)   Where the cable operator is proposing a rate increase, it may
withdraw the proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary information will
be returned to it; or
      (2)   The cable operator may seek review within five working days of the
denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the information will be stayed
pending review.
   (b)   Any interested party may file a request to inspect material withheld
as proprietary with the City. The City shall weigh the policy considerations
favoring nondisclosure against the reasons cited for permitting inspection in
light of the facts of the particular case. It will then promptly notify the
requesting entity and the cable operator that submitted the information as to
the disposition of the request. It may grant, deny or condition a request. The
requesting party or the cable operator may seek review of the decision by
filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Disclosure will be stayed pending
resolution of any appeal.
   (c)   The procedures set forth in this section shall be construed as
analogous to, and consistent with, the rules of the FCC regarding requests for
confidentiality, including, without limitation, 47 CFR 0.459.

818.01   REGULATION OF MARIHUANA BUSINESSES, SALE, POSSESSION AND CONSUMPTION.
   Any and all types of a “marihuana establishment,” as that term is defined
and used in Michigan Initiated Law 1 of 2018, commonly known as the Michigan
Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act, are completely prohibited in the City
and may not be established or operated in any zoning district, by any means,
including by way of a variance. The City of Hart has determined that the
licensing of marihuana facilities or establishments within the City should not
be permitted for policy reasons, including public safety, law enforcement
concerns and the limited amount of appropriately zoned space for certain of
these facilities and establishments. Pursuant to this chapter, the City
specifically prohibits, and does not in any way authorize, the issuance of
licenses authorizing state-licensed marihuana facilities or establishments to
locate and operate within the City. This prohibition shall also include all
marihuana establishment licenses and activities established by rules
promulgated under the Initiated Law 1 or associated statutes. The Zoning Board
of Appeals shall not have jurisdiction to consider a use variance that would
allow the licensing or operation of a marihuana establishment.
(Ord. 19-03. Passed 10-8-19.)
818.02   MEDICAL MARIHUANA FACILITIES PROHIBITED.
   Public Act 281 of 2016 provided for state licensing of certain defined
marihuana facilities, including growers, processors, provisioning centers,
safety compliance facilities and secure transporters (“marihuana facilities”).
Section 205 of Act 281 provides that a marihuana facility shall not operate in
a municipality unless the municipality has adopted an ordinance that authorizes
that type of facility. Pursuant to this chapter, the City specifically
prohibits, and does not in any way authorize, the issuance of licenses
authorizing state-licensed marihuana facilities or establishments to locate and
operate within the City. This prohibition shall also include all marihuana
establishment licenses and activities established by rules promulgated under
the Initiated Law 1 or associated statutes. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall
not have jurisdiction to consider a use variance that would allow the licensing
or operation of a marihuana facility, and unless this chapter is amended,
nothing in the ordinances of the City of Hart shall be construed as satisfying
the requirement in M.C.L.A. Sec. 333.27205(1)(a), which requires that prior to
issuance of a license, a copy of the local ordinance authorizing a marihuana
facility be submitted to the State of Michigan.
(Ord. 19-03. Passed 10-8-19.)
818.03   MEDICAL MARIHUANA RIGHTS NOT AFFECTED.
   Nothing in this chapter shall limit any privileges, rights, immunities or
defenses of a person as provided in the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act,
Michigan Initiated Law 1 of 2008, M.C.L.A. Secs. 333.26421 et seq.
(Ord. 19-03. Passed 10-8-19.)
818.04   TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER RIGHTS NOT AFFECTED.
   This section shall not limit or supersede any privileges, rights, immunities
or defenses of a person to transport marihuana into or through the City to the
extent such right is protected by the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of
Marihuana Act or other state laws, nor does it supersede rights and obligations
with respect to the transfer and consumption of marihuana on private property
to the extent authorized by the person who owns, occupies or operates such
property, as provided in and authorized by the Act. This chapter does not
supersede rights and obligations with respect to the use of marihuana for
medical purposes as provided by any law of the State of Michigan allowing for
or regulating marihuana for medical use.
(Ord. 19-03. Passed 10-8-19.)
818.05   USE OR POSSESSION OF MARIHUANA ON CITY PROPERTY IS PROHIBITED.
   No person shall possess, use, be impaired by or distribute marihuana on City
property.
(Ord. 19-03. Passed 10-8-19.)
818.06   PROHIBITION ON SALE AND CONSUMPTION OF MARIHUANA IN PUBLIC PLACES.
   In conformance with Sections 4.1(e) and 6.2(b) of the Michigan Regulation
and Taxation of Marihuana Act, the sale, possession or consumption of marihuana
in any form, the smoking of marihuana, and the sale or display of marihuana
accessories, as defined by the Act, is prohibited in any public place within
the boundaries of the City.
(Ord. 19-03. Passed 10-8-19.)
818.07   MUNICIPAL CIVIL INFRACTION.
   Any person who violates any of the provisions of this
Chapter 818 shall be responsible for a municipal civil infraction punishable by
a civil fine of $500, plus court-imposed costs.
(Ord. 19-03. Passed 10-8-19.)
818.08   AUTOMATIC EXPIRATION OF CHAPTER.
   Unless confirmed, extended or revised within three (3) years of the
effective date of this chapter, the provisions contained in Sections
818.01 through
818.07 shall expire and be of no further force and effect within the City, as
if they had never been adopted. No action shall be required for this expiration
to be effective.

(Ord. 163. Passed 1-23-90.)
1040.23   REJECTION OR PRETREATMENT OF WASTES AUTHORIZED.
   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to
the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section
1040.22 and which, in the judgment of the Manager, may have a deleterious
effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or
which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
City may:
   (a)   Reject the wastes;
   (b)   Require pretreatment to the level defined as "normal strength sewage;"
or
   (c)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable level (other than normal
strength sewage) and in accordance with applicable Federal and State
pretreatment regulations for discharge to the public sewers.

design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Manager and subject to the requirements of all
applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
(Ord. 163. Passed 1-23-90.)
1040.24   APPLICATION OF FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   Upon the promulgation of the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards for
a particular industrial subcategory, the Federal standard, if more stringent
than limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory,
shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this chapter. The
Superintendent shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting
requirements under 40 C.F.R. Section 403.12.
(Ord. 163. Passed 1-23-90.)
1040.25   MODIFICATION OF FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   Where the City's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of
pollutants limited by Federal Pretreatment Standards, the City may apply to the
approval authority for modification of specific limits in the Federal
Pretreatment Standards. "Consistent removal" means reduction in the amount of a
pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater
treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is
achieved by ninety-five percent of the samples taken, when measured according
to the procedures set forth in 40 C.F.R. Section 403.7(c)(2) "General
Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution,"
promulgated pursuant to the Act. The City may then modify pollutant discharge
limits in the Federal Pretreatment Standards if the requirements contained in
40 C.F.R. Section 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval
authority is obtained.
(Ord. 163. Passed 1-23-90.)

any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the City or State.
(Comment: Dilution may be an acceptable means of complying with some of the
prohibitions set forth in Section
1040.21, e.g. the pH prohibition, at the discretion of the City.)
(Ord. 163. Passed 1-23-90.)
1040.29   ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES.
   Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharges of prohibited
materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. Facilities to prevent
accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained
at the owner or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities
and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the
City for review and shall be approved by the City before construction of the
facility. All existing users shall submit such a plan along with their permit
application. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective
date of this section (Ordinance 163, passed January 23, 1990) shall be
permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge
procedures have been approved by the City. Review and approval of such plans
and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter. In the case of an accidental discharge or
operations upset, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone
and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include the
location of the discharge, the type of waste, the concentration and volume, and
corrective actions.
(Ord. 163. Passed 1-23-90.)

   Within five days following an accidental discharge or operations upset, the
user shall submit to the Superintendent a detailed written report describing
the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor
shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.
(Ord. 163. Passed 1-23-90.)
1040.31   NOTICE TO EMPLOYEES RE PROCEDURE ON ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE.
   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other
prominent place advising employees of whom to call in the event of an
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by
this chapter. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer
such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(Ord. 163. Passed 1-23-90.)
1040.32   WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REQUIRED.

   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit
applications, permits and monitoring programs, and inspections shall be
available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction,
unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the City, that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade
secrets of the user.
   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report
which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon
written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, the State
disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs. However, such portions
of a report shall be available for use by the State or any State agency in
judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information.
   Information accepted by the City as confidential shall not be transmitted to
any governmental agency or to the general public by the City until and unless a
ten-day notification is given to the user.

sampling and chemical analyses made by or in behalf of a discharger in
connection with its discharge. All records which pertain to matters which are
the subject of administrative adjustment or any other enforcement or litigation
activities brought by the Approval Authority pursuant hereto shall be retained
and preserved by the discharger until all enforcement activities have concluded
and all periods of limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired.
(Ord. 163. Passed 1-23-90.)
1040.44   SPECIAL AGREEMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS AUTHORIZED.
   No provision contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the City and any industry, after
recommendation by the Manager, whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength
or character may be accepted by the City for treatment, subject to equitable
payment therefor by the industry, or whereby any other provision of this
chapter may be so varied.
(Ord. 163. Passed 1-23-90.)
1040.45   INDUSTRIAL WASTE CONTROL PROGRAM.
   (a)   One person from each industry shall be delegated to the Manager to be
responsible for industrial wastes admitted to the City sewers. He or she shall
be involved with maintaining any pretreatment facility operations and assuring
a continual high level of performance. In case no pretreatment is provided, he
or she shall be involved with prevention of accidental discharges of process
wastes admitted to the sanitary sewer system. He or she must become aware of
all potential and routine toxic wastes generated by his or her industry. He or
she must be informed of all process alterations which could, in any manner,
increase or decrease normal daily flow or waste strength discharged to the
sanitary sewers.
   (b)   This industrial representative shall catalog all chemicals stored,
used or manufactured by his or her industry. Such a listing shall include
specific chemical names, not manufacturer's codes. Those wastes admitted to the
sanitary sewer are a prime concern. However, all discharges shall be cataloged.
An estimate of daily average flows and strengths shall be made, including
process, cooling, sanitary, etc. Such a determination should separate the flows
according to appropriate categories. The aforementioned flow and chemical
listing is to be sent to the Manager and shall be treated as confidential
information.
   (c)   The industrial representative should attempt to determine whether or
not large process alterations may occur during the next few years, i.e. one
year, two years, five years. He or she should consult with management to
determine if such alterations are scheduled and forthcoming.
   (d)   A sketch of the plant buildings shall be made, including a diagram of
process and chemical storage areas. Location of any pretreatment equipment must
be indicated and floor drains located near process and storage areas must be
noted. Manhole and sewer locations at the industry's point of discharge into
the Municipal collection system must be included on the plant layout sketch.
   (e)   There shall be separation of spent concentrates from the sanitary
sewer to prevent toxic wastes from upsetting the treatment plant. Supervision
and operation of the pretreatment equipment to treat spent concentrates, toxic
wastes and high strength organic wastes to an acceptable level is the
responsibility of the industrial representative. All sludges generated by such
treatment must be handled in an acceptable manner, such as in a designated area
of a sanitary landfill or by a licensed waste hauler.
   (f)   Adequate secondary containment or curbing shall be provided to protect
all floor drains from accidental spills and discharges to the receiving sewers
in excess of acceptable levels. For incompatible pollutants, such curbing
should be sufficient to hold 150 percent of the largest tank volume where that
tank is located, such that a leak or rupture could enter the POTW. For
compatible pollutants, such curbing should be sufficient to hold 100 percent of
the total process area tank volume. All floor drains within the containment
area must be plugged and sealed. Spill-throughs or sumps within process areas
must discharge to appropriate pretreatment tanks.
   (g)   If so directed by the City, an adequate sampling vault or manhole
shall be provided in a fully accessible place for City personnel to obtain
samples and flow measurement data. The complexity of the vault will vary with
the sampling requirements the Manager determines necessary to protect the
treatment plant and receiving streams. Should the Manager desire continual flow
recording and twenty-four hour composite sampling, then a more complex manhole
would be mandatory, complete with 110 volt AC electric service. Samples
collected may be divided between the industry and the Manager for analysis if
so desired by the industry.
(Ord. 163. Passed 1-23-90.)
1040.46   POWERS AND AUTHORITY OF INSPECTORS.

percent of debt service.
   (g)   "Replacement costs" means expenditures made during the service life of
the system to replace equipment and appurtenances necessary to maintain the
intended performance of the system.
   (h)   "Residential equivalent unit," as reflected in Appendix II, codified
at the end of this chapter, shall be related to the quantity of sanitary sewage
ordinarily arising from the occupancy of a residence building by a single
family of ordinary size and the benefit derived therefrom, and shall be defined
or determined from time to time by the City.
   (i)   "Revenues" and "net revenues" shall have the meanings as defined in
Section 3 of Act 94, of the Public Acts of 1933, as amended.
   (j)   "System" means all facilities of the City and all subsequent
additions, including all sewers, pumps, lift stations, and all other facilities
used or useful in the collection, treatment and disposal of domestic,
commercial or industrial wastes, including all appurtenances thereto and
including all extensions and improvements thereto which may hereafter be
acquired.

furnished to a premises shall be a lien on the premises, and those charges
delinquent for six months or more shall be certified by the City Council on or
before April 1 each year to the City tax assessing officer who shall enter the
lien on the next tax roll against the premises to which the service shall have
been rendered, and the charges shall be collected and the lien shall be
enforced in the same manner as provided for the collection of taxes assessed
upon the roll and the enforcement for the lien for the taxes. However, that the
charges shall not become a lien against the premises from and after the date of
written notice to the City that a tenant is responsible for the charges in
accordance with Section 21 of said Act (MCL 141.121), except that, in the event
of filing of the notice, no further service shall be rendered to such premises
until a cash deposit, as established by the City shall have been paid to the
City as security for the payment of such charges. The cash deposit shall be in
an amount of the projected billing for not less than a one-month period and not
more than a three-month period, said determination of deposit to be solely at
the discretion of the City. In the event that more than one residential unit or

of larger diameter than that required to service the subdivision, but the
additional cost of installing a main larger than that required to service the
subdivision shall be borne solely by the City, the proprietor and the City to
share in the actual expense of the cost of a main of the diameter required to
service the subdivision. In the event other persons, firms or corporations
require water use from such water mains, the City shall have the privilege of
furnishing water from such mains to the persons requesting the same, charging
such costs to the user thereof in proportion to the City's expense in the
installation of such water main.

Council in its judgment believes it is economically possible for the City to do
so, such decision to be made solely by said City Council, the City shall

proprietor of the plat or any subsequent purchaser or purchasers of lands
within the plat.

the terminus of the existing City trunk line sewer to the subdivision and the
entire cost of all lateral sewers within the subdivision shall be paid for by
the owners of all the lands within said subdivision at the time of the
installation thereof, collection of the landowner's share to be made by a
special assessment as provided by statute and in accordance with the terms of
any ordinance thereafter enacted by the City of Hart. In the event the City
deems it advisable to install a trunk line sewer from the terminus of the then
existing trunk line sewer to the subdivision, of a diameter greater than
necessary to service said subdivision, the owners of the lands within said
subdivision shall be liable for only one-half of the cost of a sewer of
sufficient diameter to service the subdivision. The matter of deciding the
diameter necessary to service the subdivision shall rest solely in the judgment
of the City Council. All costs and expenses of installation of the trunk line
sewer to the subdivision, which are not imposed upon the owners of the lands
within said subdivision, as hereinbefore provided, shall be borne by the City.
In the event persons, firms or corporations occupying lands which are not
located within the plat of said subdivision desire the use of sewer facilities
discharging into the trunk line financed and paid for equally by the owners of
the lands in the subdivision and by the City, the City shall have the privilege
of allowing use thereof by such occupants of lands not included in the
subdivision, on the condition such users pay to the City a proportionate cost
of the City's expense in the installation thereof.
   (b)   The City, at no cost or expense to the proprietor of the plat or to
any subsequent purchasers of lands within said plat, shall install necessary
storm sewers in said subdivision when, in the judgment of the City Council, it

Council, economically possible for said City to make the installation thereof.

and the resulting lots shall be not less than sixty-five feet at the front line
or less than 12,000 square feet in area.
   (d)   The minimum width and area requirements of subsection (c) hereof shall

   (i)   Procedure for review of private roads.
      (1)   An application to establish, extend, improve, or relocate a private
road shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator along with a fee as set by
the City Council. The application shall contain the following information: the
name of the owners and any other parties having any legal interest in the
private road or property across which it is to be constructed; permanent parcel
number or legal description of the property over which the private road is to
be constructed; a site location map to scale which shows the location of the
parcel containing the road relative to surrounding properties and roadways; a
scaled drawing prepared by a registered engineer showing the precise location,
route, elevations, dimensions, specifications, extensions, and design of the
private road; existing or proposed curb cuts and the location and distance to
any public street which the private road is to intersect; a road maintenance
agreement and access easement agreement as required herein.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall review this information to determine
compliance with the standards and requirements for private roads. The Zoning
Administrator may consult with the Fire Chief, Attorney, Engineer, or Planner
as deemed necessary.
      (3)   If the Zoning Administrator finds that the application meets the
requirements of this section, the application shall be approved and a permit
shall be issued for the construction of the private road. Two copies of the
private road plans shall be stamped for approval. One copy shall be kept by the
applicant, and one by the City. This construction permit is not a private road
permit and does not authorize the construction of any buildings on the private
road. The construction permit is valid for a period of one year from the date
of approval. If construction of the private road has not commenced before this
date, the permit shall expire. A new permit shall be required before
construction can begin.
      (4)   If the Zoning Administrator denies the application, the written
reasons for denial shall be provided to the applicant within five working days
of the date of denial.
      (5)   Upon completion of construction of the private road, the applicant
shall provide to the Zoning Administrator a letter from a registered
professional engineer that the road has been constructed in compliance with the
approved plans, and documentation that the road maintenance agreement,
easement, and deed restrictions have been recorded with the County Register of
Deeds.
      (6)   Private road permit issuance. Upon approval of all items required
for final compliance, the Zoning Administrator shall issue a private road
permit.
      (7)   Permits for buildings on private roads. A building permit shall not
be issued for any principal building, dwelling, or structure which derives its
primary access from a private road unless a private road permit has been issued
by the City and the road has either been completed in accordance with the
approved permit or the applicant for the building permit or owner of the
private road right-of-way have provided the City with cash or irrevocable
letter of credit in an amount determined by the City, to insure construction of
the private road in accordance with the approved private road construction
permit within one year from the issuance of the building permit. The letter of
credit shall contain a provision that the City shall have the right to access
the letter of credit if such letter is not renewed thirty days before the
expiration date of the letter.

28-06.)
1243.22   LANDSCAPE REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The intent of this section is to set forth minimum standards for
landscaping. Landscaped areas are intended to maintain or improve air quality,
stabilize soils, increase groundwater infiltration, decrease wind velocity,
reduce noise, and create zones of privacy.
   (b)   For site plans requiring Planning Commission review, buffer strips
shall be required where an industrial use abuts any other nonindustrial use or

orderly manner. Dead plant materials shall be replaced within a reasonable
period of time but no longer than one growing season.
   (c)   Landscaping shall be located so it does not obstruct the vision of
drivers or pedestrians entering or leaving a site.
   (d)   Parking area landscaping.
      (1)   All parking areas more than 5,000 square feet in area, except those
parking areas for industrial uses which are located in the rear yard, shall be
landscaped with one canopy and one evergreen tree for every ten parking spaces,
with a minimum of two trees shall be planted, adjacent to the parking area.
      (2)   Landscape islands or peninsulas shall be installed at the end of
those parking rows which are more than twenty spaces long. Within such rows a
landscaped island shall be installed every twenty spaces.
      (3)   Landscape islands or peninsulas at the end of parking rows shall be
a minimum of ten feet in width by the length of the parking space or spaces,
with an appropriate curb radius. Islands within parking rows shall be a minimum
of six feet wide by the length of the parking space or spaces. Islands shall be
separated from the parking area by a rolled or stand-up curb.
      (4)   Each island or peninsula within a parking area shall contain a
minimum of one canopy tree.
      (5)   Landscaping in and adjacent to parking areas shall be of a height
and location which will not block the vision of drivers or pedestrians.

may be modified by the Planning Commission or Zoning Administrator in
consideration of existing trees on site, proposed building setbacks, existing
and proposed uses on adjacent lands, topographical elevations on a site and on
adjacent lands. In deciding whether to modify the landscape regulations of this
section the Planning Commission or Zoning Administrator shall determine that
the intent of the regulations will still be met if modifications are allowed.

decks that are no more than two feet above grade may be built up to the rear or
side property line where an established fence line exists. Otherwise, uncovered
terraces, patios, porches and decks less than two feet high shall be a minimum

shall meet the setback requirements of the main structure.
   (b)   Unenclosed structures, front yard: Unenclosed porches, steps or
similar facilities may project into a required front setback for a distance not
to exceed five feet. In the case of a handicap wheelchair ramp, the Zoning
Administrator may waive setback requirements at his or her discretion, if no
other options are available to provide a ramp, provided that the applicant
agrees to remove the ramp if it is no longer necessary on the property. A
performance letter or performance guarantee may be required.
(Ord. 06-02. Passed 11-28-06.)
1243.24   REDUCTION OF FRONT YARD SETBACK AND MAXIMUM SETBACK.
   Except for lots with waterfront access, newly constructed principal
structures in the A Residential and B-1 Zones shall align with existing
structures in proximity to the building site. If neighboring structures are not
present, then the district setback shall apply. In no case shall structures in
the B-1 Zone be set back more than fifteen feet.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98; Ord. 06-02. Passed 11-28-06.)
1243.25   ACCESSORY APARTMENTS.
   (a)   Intent.
      (1)   It is the intent of this section to permit the establishment of
accessory apartments in owner occupied single family dwelling units which will
provide older homeowners with a means of obtaining, through tenants in
accessory apartments, rental income, companionship, security, and services;
provide a means for homeowners to care for elderly or ailing relatives and
still allow them to maintain the independence and comfort of separate living
quarters; and add inexpensive rental units to the housing stock to meet the
smaller household needs of both young and old.
      (2)   These regulations are also designed to protect the stability,
property values, and single family residential character of a neighborhood by
ensuring that accessory apartments are installed only in owner occupied houses
in such a manner that the appearance of the building remains that of a single
family residence.
      (3)   For purposes of this section, an accessory apartment is defined as
a dwelling unit designed for and occupied by one family which is a separate
housekeeping unit complete with kitchen and bathroom facilities contained
within or attached to the structure of a single family dwelling and which is
accessory to it.
   (b)   Authorization and Development Standards. The Zoning Administrator
shall only issue a permit for an accessory apartment in those zoning districts
which permit single family dwelling units when the following development
standards have been met:
      (1)   The accessory apartment shall be a complete housekeeping unit,
containing kitchen and bathroom facilities, which is separate from the
principal single family dwelling unit.
      (2)   Only one accessory apartment shall be created within or attached to
the principal single family dwelling unit.
      (3)   The accessory apartment and principal single family dwelling unit
shall be attached by a common wall, ceiling, or floor and shall be contained
within a single building.
      (4)   The owner(s) of a single family dwelling unit in which the
accessory apartment is created or to which it is attached shall occupy one of
the dwelling units in the building.
      (5)   The entire accessory apartment shall consist of no more than
thirty-five percent of the total square footage of the principal single family
dwelling unit but shall not result in the floor area of the principal building
being reduced below the requirements of the zoning district in which it is
located.
      (6)   A minimum of three parking spaces shall be provided on the premises
for use by occupants of the accessory apartment and the principal single family
dwelling unit.
      (7)   The accessory apartment shall be installed or constructed so that,
to the degree reasonably feasible, the appearance of the building remains that
of a single family residence. Exterior doorways constructed to serve the
accessory apartment shall, where possible, be located on the side or rear of
the building. If an exterior doorway is to be constructed to face the street,
it shall be subject to review and approval of the Zoning Administrator.
      (8)   An accessory apartment shall be constructed in compliance with all
applicable Zoning Code regulations as contained herein.
      (9)   Occupancy of an accessory apartment shall be subject to the City
Rental Code.
   (c)   General Regulations. Accessory apartments shall also comply with the
following general regulations:
      (1)   The establishment of an accessory apartment in a single family
dwelling unit shall not result in any building site or use situation which is
nonconforming.
      (2)   An accessory apartment shall not be subject to the regulations
contained herein which are applicable to two-family dwelling units.
      (3)   The following shall not be considered as accessory apartments:
         A.   A single family dwelling unit whose occupants share kitchen and
bathroom facilities.
         B.   A detached single family dwelling unit located on the same lot
with an existing single family dwelling unit.
      (4)   The accessory apartment shall comply with all applicable
requirements of the City Building Code as amended, and shall consist of a
minimum of 300 square feet of floor area.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98.)
1243.26   OUTDOOR WOOD FURNACES.
   Due to the nuisance smoke and concerns regarding the public safety and
welfare of residents living in relatively close proximity to one another,
outdoor wood furnaces are prohibited in all zoning districts within the City.
(Ord. 2005-4. Passed 6-28-05.)

(Ord. 168. Passed 10-9-90; Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98; Ord. 184. Passed 5-25-99.)
1254.06   DEVELOPMENT PLAN REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   (a)   The Planning Commission may require, in reviewing a plan, independent
professional studies, including, but not limited to, traffic studies, soil
borings, and/or floodplain determinations to evaluate the suitability of the
plan.
   (b)   Prior to reaching a finding, the Commission shall conduct a
development plan review hearing, subject to publication of notices and mailing
of notice to all properties within 300 feet of the parcel to be developed,
provided however, that in concurrent rezoning and plan approval, one hearing
shall suffice. It shall be the responsibility of the Planning Commission to
approve the development plan as submitted, to approve the plan subject to
modification deemed necessary to protect public health, safety or welfare, or
to disapprove the plan for cause. In the case of plans submitted in conjunction
with rezoning, the recommendations for the Commission shall be forwarded to
Council, and final plan approved shall be deemed effective upon rezoning
approval by Council. In the case of properties already zoned PUD, a
determination by the Planning Commission on a development plan shall be deemed
final, and a report of the Commission's findings shall be submitted to Council
in accordance with statutory requirements. The development plan, if granted as
submitted or modified, shall become a part of the record of the Planning
Commission and subsequent Council action.
(Ord. 168. Passed 10-9-90; Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98; Ord. 184. Passed 5-25-99.)
1254.07   DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   Any PUD development plan shall comply with the following minimum standards:
   (a)   Utilities. All buildings shall be served by public sewers and water
and shall comply with Municipal drainage requirements.
   (b)   Streets. A PUD shall provide either unobstructed frontage on a public
street or shall develop a public street to assure public access to the project
site. The Planning Commission may require public street dedication within the
site and, in any event, streets must be adequate for the provisions of routine
and emergency services. Where a PUD includes or abuts an incomplete street,
such street shall either be extended or properly terminated in an approved
turnaround. When a PUD site is so located as to allow more than one means of
ingress and egress, and where additional access has been recommended by the
Police and/or Fire Departments to improve the safety of life and property, such
additional access shall be provided. Drives and streets within the PUD shall
discourage outside traffic to traverse the development and create unnecessary
fragmentation of the development into small blocks.
   (c)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be required when developing a PUD, where
appropriate, or when deemed necessary for public safety on any existing street
adjacent to a PUD site. The planned unit development shall provide for public
safety on any existing street adjacent to a PUD site. The planned unit
development shall provide for pedestrian circulation within and adjacent to the
site.
   (d)   Building Restrictions. In an effort to allow the flexibility in a PUD,
building restrictions should be kept to a minimum. Several essential aspects
must be adhered to as follows:
      (1)   Building setbacks shall be determined by the Planning Commission
according to the use of the buildings and character of the neighborhood.
      (2)   All portions of the land not developed must be landscaped with
trees, shrubs and suitable ground cover.
      (3)   Portions of a commercial structure or parking area must be screened
from any abutting residential area by a wall or berm measuring not less than
four feet in height.
      (4)   No portion of the off-street parking area shall be any closer than
twenty-five feet to any property line adjoining a street or sidewalk where
appropriate. The remaining twenty-five feet between the parking and property
line shall be landscaped.
   (e)   Environmental Quality. Any development within a PUD District shall be
so designed as to reasonably protect residents of such development and
residents or occupants of neighboring premises with respect to the emission and
transmission of noise, smoke, dust, dirt, litter, odor or light glare and with
respect to traffic congestion, ease of routine and emergency services,
drainage, erosion, light and ventilation, surface and ground water quality,
overcrowding of persons, sanitation, property values, general appearance and
character and other similar considerations.
   (f)   Signs. Signs shall be in accordance with the City Sign Ordinance.

This chapter insures that a site condominium development shall be reviewed with
the objective and intent of achieving many of the same characteristics and land
use results as if the proposed development and improvements were being reviewed

condominium unit.
   (c)   Either the condominium unit by itself, or the condominium unit taken
together with any contiguous, appurtenant limited common element, shall be
considered to constitute a building site which is the functional equivalent of
a "lot" for purposes of determining compliance with the requirement of the
Zoning Code and other applicable laws, ordinances and regulations. Site
condominium projects may also include general common elements consisting of
common open space, recreational areas, streets, and other areas available for

projects may be approved as provided by this chapter in any zoning district for
the uses permitted in the zoning district in which the project is located.

Fences, walks, barriers, and landscaping shall be used, as appropriate, to
accomplish these purposes.
   (f)   All buildings shall be arranged so as to permit necessary emergency
vehicle access.
   (g)   A pedestrian circulation system, separated from the vehicular
circulation system, may be required. To ensure public safety, special
pedestrian measures may be required in the vicinity of schools, playgrounds,
shopping areas, and other uses which generate a considerable amount of
pedestrian traffic.

1258.09   VALIDITY OF SITE PLANS.
   (a)   Approval of a site plan is valid for a period of one year unless
extended as allowed. The one year period shall commence on the date when the
site plan is signed by the Zoning Administrator. If actual physical
construction of a substantial nature of the improvements included in the
approved site plan has not commenced and proceeded meaningfully toward
completion during that period, the approval of the site plan shall be null and
void.
   (b)   Upon written application, filed prior to the termination of the one
year period, the Planning Commission or Zoning Administrator may authorize a
single extension of the time limit for approval of a site plan for a period of
not more than one year. Such extension shall only be granted based upon

by the Planning Commission. Such arrangements shall have such sureties or
guarantors as are satisfactory to the Planning Commission and shall be
conditioned upon faithful compliance with all of the provisions and
requirements of the approved site plan and construction and placement of all of
the improvements. In its discretion, the Planning Commission may reduce a
proportionate share of the amount specified in a performance bond, a letter of
credit, or other written assurance based upon the percent or other portion of
improvements completed, as verified by the Planning Commission. The Planning
Commission may rebate or refund a proportionate share of an escrow cash bond.

shall also have the authority to limit the number of driveways for a site, to
require that parking lots on contiguous parcels be connected, that driveways
for contiguous parcels be shared, and that opposite driveways be directly
aligned. In determining whether the above or other access control measures are
necessary, the following criteria shall be considered:
      (1)   The type and location of commercial uses on the site and adjacent
to the site.
      (2)   The location, size and design of existing and proposed parking
areas.
      (3)   The existing and projected traffic volume on the roadway and
adjacent roadways.
      (4)   Compatibility between adjacent land uses and likelihood of change
or expansion.

as a principal use.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98.)
1260.04   LOCATION.
   Off-street parking facilities shall be located on the same lot with or on an
adjacent lot to the parking generator they are required to serve. The Zoning
Administrator, upon application, can permit the location of parking facilities

functional value of such parking facilities.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98.)
1260.05   UNITS OF MEASUREMENT.
   For the purpose of this chapter, "floor area," in the case of commercial and

hereinafter for the purpose of determining the number of required off-street
parking spaces, and such change or increase creates a need for an increase of
more than ten percent in the number of off-street parking spaces as determined
by the requirements of this chapter, additional off-street parking spaces shall
be provided on the basis of the increased requirements of the new use or on the
basis of the increase in floor area or in number of employees or in other units
of measurement.

separately.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98.)
1260.08   COLLECTIVE PROVISIONS.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent collective provision
of off-street parking facilities for two or more buildings or uses, provided

not be less than the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed
separately.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98.)

and similar uses which are not normally open, used or operated during the same
principal operating hours of churches, theaters or the aforementioned
establishments. Such joint use may be authorized by the Zoning Administrator
upon application showing that participating uses will be adequately served by
such joint facilities, and which application shall be accompanied by a properly
drawn legal instrument executed by the parties concerned for the joint use of
off-street parking facilities. In no case will the number of required car
spaces permitted to serve jointly be less than the greatest requirement of this
chapter for any one participating establishment.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98.)
1260.10   PARKING SPACES REQUIRED.
   The number of off-street parking spaces required shall be as follows:
   (a)   Residential. Two spaces for the first dwelling unit in a building and
one space for each additional dwelling unit, or one space for each sleeping
unit of a tourist home, motel, or boarding house.
   (b)   Commercial. One space required for each 300 square feet of floor space
or fraction thereof, and/or each employee on the maximum working shift,
whichever produces the greater number of spaces required.
   (c)   Industrial. One space required for each 600 square feet of floor
space, or for each two employees on the maximum working shift, whichever
produces the greater number of spaces required.
   (d)   Places of Public Assembly. One parking space for each five seats.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98.)
1260.11   EXCEPTIONS.
   The Planning Commission, in consultation with other City departments and
agencies concerned, shall make studies, as found advisable, of various areas
within which there is need for the establishment of off-street parking
facilities to be provided by the City and to be financed wholly or in part by a
special assessment district or by other means. When such need is found, the
Planning Commission shall report its recommendation for the acquisition of such
off-street parking facilities to the City Council. This report shall include
recommendations on the type, size, location and other pertinent features of the
proposed off-street parking facilities and the area they are intended to serve.
Wherever, pursuant to this procedure, the demand for parking space is satisfied
by such a City program, all participating users shall be exempt from the
requirements of this chapter for privately supplied off-street parking
facilities.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98.)
1260.12   DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF PARKING AREAS.
   Every parcel of land hereafter used as a public or private parking area
shall be developed and maintained in accordance with the following
requirements:
   (a)   Minimum Distances and Setbacks.
      (1)   No part of any parking area for five or more vehicles shall be
located within a required front yard abutting on a public street of the
district in which it is located.
      (2)   When an off-street parking area for five or more vehicles faces
across a street or an alley or abuts on a lot in a residential district, the
parking area shall adhere to the front yard requirements of the district on
which it faces or abuts.
   (b)   Restricted Accessory Parking Areas. The establishment and operation of
a restricted accessory parking area may be authorized by the Zoning
Administrator as a conditional use in such part of a residential zone as abuts,
either directly or across an alley, on land in commercial or industrial zone.
In serving the needs of commercial or industrial establishments, accessory
parking areas shall be so designated and operated as to have a minimum
detrimental effect on adjoining residential properties. The requirements such
as surfacing, lighting, screening and landscaping shall be as the Zoning
Administrator may deem necessary for the protection of neighboring property and
the public interest. It is the intent of this chapter that such accessory
parking lots shall be so arranged to provide effective buffer zones between
commercial and industrial and residential districts.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98.)
1260.13   REQUIRED LOADING AND UNLOADING SPACES.
   There shall be provided adequate space for standing, loading and unloading
services of not less than twelve feet in width, twenty-five feet in length and
fourteen feet in height, open or enclosed for all uses permitted which involve
the receipt and distribution by vehicles of materials, merchandise or bussed
passengers.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98.)
1260.14   DECISIONS BY ZONING ADMINISTRATOR; REDUCTION OF REQUIRED SPACES.
   (a)   The decision as to meeting the required parking and loading
requirements shall be made by the Zoning Administrator, subject to appeal to
the Zoning Board of Appeals.
   (b)   The Zoning Administrator may reduce the required parking spaces upon
written application of the owner or occupant of a building or buildings and a
positive showing that the requirements of this chapter are excessive for the
use intended for the building or buildings. Such reduction shall be placed in
writing and continue in force only so long as the use does not change and the
owner or occupant remains the same. No waiver granted pursuant to this section
shall be transferable.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98.)

(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98.)
1261.02   JURISDICTION.
   (a)   Subject to the provisions of this chapter, the Board of Appeals, after
public hearing, shall have the jurisdiction to decide applications for a
variance filed as provided.
      (1)   Where it is alleged by the appellant that there is an error in any
order, requirement, permit, interpretation, decision, or refusal made by the
Zoning Administrator or any other official or agency in enforcing the
provisions of this Zoning Code. The Board of Appeals may reverse, affirm,
wholly or in part, or may modify the order, requirement, permit,
interpretation, decision, or refusal as in its opinion ought to be done, and to
that end shall have the powers of the administrative official from whom the
appeal was taken.
      (2)   Where by reason of the shape, topographical condition,
extraordinary situation, or condition of the land, structure, use, or
development of property immediately adjoining the property in question, the
literal enforcement of the requirements of this Zoning Code would involve
practical difficulties or would cause undue hardships.
   (b)   The Board of Appeals shall interpret zoning district boundaries.
   (c)   The Board of Appeals shall consider and decide upon applications for
expansion of non-conforming buildings and structures.
   (d)   The Board of Appeals shall hear and decide any other matter referred
to it by this Zoning Code or any other City ordinance.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98.)
1261.03   PROCEDURES.
   (a)   The Board of Appeals shall adopt rules and regulations to govern its
procedures and shall determine a chair and vice-chair. Neither the City Council
nor Planning Commission member shall serve as chair.
   (b)   Upon receipt of a written request seeking an interpretation of the
zoning ordinance or an appeal of an administrative decision, a notice stating
the time, date, and place of the public hearing shall be published in a
newspaper of general circulation within the City and shall be sent to the
person requesting the interpretation not less than fifteen days before the
public hearing. In addition, if the request for an interpretation or appeal of
an administrative decision involves a specific parcel, written notice stating
the nature of the interpretation request and the time, date, and place of the
public hearing on the interpretation request shall be sent by first-class mail
or personal delivery to all persons to whom real property is assessed within
300 feet of the boundary of the property in question and to the occupants of
all structures within 300 feet of the boundary of the property in question. If
a tenant's name is not known, the term "occupant" may be used.
   (c)   The concurring votes of a majority of the members (three out of five)
shall be necessary to revise any order, requirements, decision, or
interpretation of the Zoning Administrator or any other City official or
agency, or to decide in favor of an applicant on any matter upon which they are
required to pass, or to effect any variation of the Zoning Code.
   (d)   All meetings and records shall be open to the public. A verbatim
record of any public hearing shall be kept for no less than thirty days
following the hearing. All minutes shall be filed in the office of the City
Clerk and shall be made available to interested parties upon request.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98; Ord. 06-02. Passed 11-28-06.)
1261.04   FILING OF APPEALS.
   (a)   Appeals by any person or agency aggrieved shall be made by filing a
notice of appeal with the Zoning Administrator on a form provided for that
purpose.
   (b)   A fee, the amount of which shall be set by the City Council from time
to time, shall be paid at the time of the filing of the appeal.
   (c)   The filing of an appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the
action from which appealed, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the
Board of Appeals that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay
would, in his or her opinion, cause an imminent peril to life or property. In
such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order
which may be granted by the Circuit Court on application, on notice to the
Zoning Administrator and on due cause shown.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98.)

   (c)   All notices of a hearing shall be mailed and published not more than
ten days nor less than five days prior to the date on which the hearing is to
be held.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98.)
1261.06   DECISIONS OF THE BOARD OF APPEALS.
   (a)   The Board of Appeals shall have the power to authorize variances from
the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   A variance shall not be granted by the Board of Appeals unless
evidence is submitted demonstrating that both of the following basic conditions
are met:
      (1)   Shall not be contrary to the public interest or to the intent and
general purpose of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   Shall not cause a substantial adverse effect upon properties in the
immediate vicinity or in the zoning district in which the subject parcel is
located.
   (c)   When both of the foregoing basic conditions can be satisfied, a
variance may be granted when any one of the following special conditions can be
met:
      (1)   Where there are practical difficulties which prevent carrying out
the strict letter of this Zoning Code. These difficulties shall not be deemed
solely economic, but shall be evaluated in terms of the use of a particular
parcel of land.
      (2)   Where absent a variance, a significant natural feature would be
negatively affected or destroyed.
      (3)   Where absent a variance, public health, safety, and welfare would
be negatively affected.
      (4)   Where such variation is necessary for the preservation of a
substantial property right possessed by other properties in the same zoning
district.
   (d)   A non-conforming use of land, structure, or building shall not solely
constitute grounds for the issuance of a variance.
   (e)   The Board of Appeals shall find that the variance is the minimum
variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or
structure. The Board of Appeals may authorize a lesser variance than that
requested by the applicant.
   (f)   In granting any variance or any other ruling the Board of Appeals may
prescribe reasonable conditions and safeguards necessary to meet the spirit and
intent of this Zoning Code. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when
made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a
violation of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98.)
1261.07   LAND USE VARIANCES.
   An application of a land use variance to permit a use not otherwise
permitted in that zoning district may be considered by the Zoning Board of
Appeals but only according to the following procedures.
   (a)   Such application shall be made to the City Clerk and an application
fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule established by the City Council.
   (b)   The City Clerk shall forward the application materials to the Planning
Commission for consideration at it's next regularly scheduled meeting. The
Planning Commission shall review the request with attention to the
recommendations of the Hart Master Plan for the property in question. The
Planning Commission shall then make a recommendation to the Zoning Board of
Appeals.
   (c)   The variance request shall then be considered by the Board of Appeals
in accordance with the hearing procedures set forth in this chapter.
   (d)   In order to approve a use variance request, the Board of Appeals shall
determine that an unnecessary hardship exists and that the variance request
meets all of the following conditions. The Board of Appeals must ensure that
the spirit of the Zoning Code is observed, public safety secured, and
substantial justice done.
      (1)   The property could not be used or be put to a reasonable use for
the purposes permitted in that zone.
      (2)   The plight is due to unique circumstances peculiar to the property
and not to general neighborhood conditions.
      (3)   The use would not alter the essential character of the area.
      (4)   The problem is not self-created.
   (e)   In granting a use variance, the Board of Appeals may prescribe
reasonable conditions and safeguards necessary to meet the spirit and intent of
this Zoning Code.
   (f)   A two-thirds vote of the membership of the Zoning Board of Appeals is
necessary to approve a use variance.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98; Ord. 06-02. Passed 11-28-06.)
1261.08   FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (a)   A verbatim record shall be made of the entire hearing. Minutes shall
be kept of each meeting by the City Clerk or appointed agent. The Board of
Appeals shall record into the minutes all relevant findings, conditions, facts,
and other relevant factors, including the vote of each member upon each
question, or if absent, or failing to vote, and all of its official actions.
   (b)   The Board of Appeals shall prepare an official record for all appeals
and shall base its decision on the record. The official record shall, at a
minimum, include the following:
      (1)   The relevant administrative records and orders issued relating to
the appeal.
      (2)   The notice of the appeal.
      (3)   Such documents, exhibits, photographs, or written reports as may be
submitted to the Board of Appeals for its consideration.
      (4)   The findings of the Board of Appeals shall state the facts of the
appeal, the decision, any conditions of the decisions, and the reasons for
reaching such a decision, including compliance with the standards of Section
1261.06.
   (c)   The Board of Appeals shall decide upon all matters within a reasonable
time, not to exceed thirty days from the closing of the public hearing. The
time limit may be extended by written agreement between the applicant and the
Board of Appeals.
   (d)   Decisions and orders of the Board of Appeals shall become effective
five days after the decision is reached, unless the Board shall find immediate
effect is necessary to preserve a substantial property right and shall so
certify in the record.
   (e)   If the Board of Appeals determines that a particular variance request
occurs so often as to necessitate an amendment to the Zoning Ordinances, the
Board shall so advise the City Council.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98.)
1261.09   TIME LIMIT FOR VARIANCE GRANTED.
   (a)   Each variance granted under the provisions of this Zoning Code shall
terminate unless the construction, occupancy, or other actions authorized by
such variances have commenced within one year of the granting of such
variances.
   (b)   Upon written application filed with the City Clerk prior to the
termination of the one year time period, the Board of Appeals may authorize a
single extension of the time limit for an additional period of not more than
one year upon the finding by the Board of Appeals that the project has a
reasonable expectation of being continued to construction.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98.)
1261.10   RESUBMISSION.
   No application for a variance which has been denied wholly or in part by the
Board of Appeals shall be resubmitted within one year from the date of the
original filing of an application for the variance, except on grounds of new
evidence or proof of changed conditions relating to the reasons for the denial
of the original appeal found by the Board of Appeals to be valid.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98.)
1261.11   APPEALS OF BOARD OF APPEAL DECISIONS.
   The decision of the Board of Appeals shall be final. Appeals from decisions
of the Board of Appeals shall be to the Circuit Court of Oceana County, as
provided by law.

1262.01   PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to provide regulations governing lots,
buildings, structures and the uses thereof, which were legal before this Zoning
Code was adopted or amended, including legal nonconforming lots, uses,
buildings and structures, that would be prohibited, regulated or restricted
under the provisions of this Zoning Code. It is the intent of this chapter to
permit these buildings and structures, herein referred to as nonconformities,
to remain until the nonconformity is discontinued or removed.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98; Ord. 184. Passed 5-25-99.)
1262.02   NONCONFORMING USES.
   (a)   Where, on the date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code, a
lawful principal use of a parcel or lot exists but is no longer permissible
under the provisions of this Zoning Code, such principal use may be continued
so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the provisions of this
chapter.
   (b)   Nonconforming uses shall not be changed to another nonconforming use,
except after approval of the Board of Appeals. Before granting such approval,
the Board of Appeals shall determine that such change in use will be more
conforming to the intent of the zone district in which it is located than the
existing nonconforming use.
   (c)   A nonconforming use which has been changed to a use as per subsection
(b) hereof or to a use permitted in its zoning district shall not be re-
established.
   (d)   A nonconforming use which has been discontinued for more than twelve
consecutive months shall not be re-established. Discontinuance may be defined
as the vacating of land or buildings or the non-operative status of the uses
which were normally carried on upon the property.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98; Ord. 184. Passed 5-25-99.)
1262.03   NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   Nonconforming buildings and structures may be altered or expanded in size
provided that such alteration or expansion shall not increase the extent of the
nonconformity and shall satisfy all site development regulations which are
applicable.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98; Ord. 184. Passed 5-25-99.)
1262.04   REPAIR, MAINTENANCE AND RECONSTRUCTION.
   Buildings or structures which are damaged or destroyed by any means,
regardless of the extent of damage or destruction, may be repaired, maintained,
or reconstructed up to the same size and use as prior to the damage or
destruction provided that such are reconstructed or repaired in such a manner
which shall not increase the extent of the nonconformity which existed prior to
the damage or destruction and that such repair, maintenance, or reconstruction
shall have commenced no later than one year from the date of damage or
destruction and completed within one year. A one year extension may be granted
by the Planning Commission providing such request is filed with the City Clerk
prior to the expiration of the first year. Obtainment of the required zoning
and building permits along with the physical start of repair, maintenance, or
reconstruction and diligently pursued shall be evidence of the commencement of
repairs, maintenance, or reconstruction. The right to rebuild under this
section applies only to the property owner and not the property.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98; Ord. 184. Passed 5-25-99.)
1262.05   STRUCTURES UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
   The provisions of this chapter shall not affect any structure, the
construction of which was commenced or contracted for as of the effective date
of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98; Ord. 184. Passed 5-25-99.)
1262.06   BUILDINGS BECOMING NONCONFORMING.
   The foregoing provisions of this chapter shall also apply to buildings,
structures, land or uses which hereafter become nonconforming due to any
reclassification of districts under this Zoning Code or any subsequent change
in the regulations of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 144. Passed 10-12-82; Ord. 182. Passed 5-12-98; Ord. 184. Passed 5-25-
99.)
1262.07   NONCONFORMING RESIDENTIAL LOTS OF RECORD.
   A lot existing on the effective date of this Zoning Code which does not have
sufficient land to conform to the requirements of this Zoning Code relating to
minimum lot area or width, or both, shall be nonconforming. Such lot may be
used as a building site, provided that the other provisions and requirements of
this Zoning Code are complied with, except that the side yard setback for a lot
which is nonconforming due to lot width shall be ten percent of the lot width
but in no case shall the side yard setback be less than five feet.
