Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Such other supporting information as the Commission may request.
Budget Hearing:
Â Â Â Section 10.3. A public hearing on the proposed budget shall be held before

on file for public inspection during office hours at such office for a period
of not less than one week prior to such hearing.
Adoption of Budget:
Â Â Â Section 10.4. Not later than the second week in May of each year, the
Commission shall by resolution adopt a budget for the next fiscal year, shall
appropriate the money needed for municipal purposes during the next fiscal year

limitations contained in Section 11.1.
Clerk to Certify Tax Levy: Budget Control:
Â Â Â Section 10.5. Except for purposes which are to be financed by the issuance
of bonds or by special assessment, or for other purposes not chargeable to a
budget appropriation, no money shall be drawn from the treasury of the city
except in accordance with an appropriation thereof for such specific purpose,
nor shall any obligation for the expenditure of money be incurred without an
appropriation covering all payments which will be due under such obligation in
the current fiscal year. The Commission by resolution may transfer any
unencumbered appropriation balance, or any portion thereof from one account,
department, fund, or agency to another.
Â Â Â The Commission may make additional appropriations during the fiscal year for
unanticipated expenditures required by the city, but such additional
appropriations shall not exceed the amount by which actual and anticipated
revenues of the year are exceeding the revenues as estimated in the budget
unless the appropriations are necessary to relieve an emergency endangering the
public health, peace or safety.
Â Â Â Except in those cases where there is no other logical account to which an
expenditure can be charged, expenditures shall not be charged directly to the
contingency fund (or other similar fund). Instead, the necessary part of the
appropriation for the contingency fund (or other similar fund) shall be
transferred to the logical account and the expenditure then charged to such
account.
Â Â Â At the beginning of each quarterly period during the fiscal year, and more
often if required by the Commission, the City Manager shall submit to the
Commission data showing the relation between the estimated and actual revenues
and expenditures to date; and if it shall appear that the revenues are less
than anticipated, the Commission may reduce appropriations, except amounts
required for debt and interest charges, to such a degree as may be necessary to
keep expenditures within the revenues.
Â Â Â The balance in any budget appropriation which has not been encumbered at the
end of the fiscal year shall revert to the general fund.
Depository:
Â Â Â Section 10.6. The Commission shall designate depositories for city funds and
shall provide for the regular deposit of all city moneys. The Commission shall
provide for such security for city deposits as is authorized or permitted by
statute, except that personal surety bonds shall not be deemed proper security.

including a financial report. Copies of such audit and annual report shall be
made available for public inspection at the office of the city manager within

shall not exceed one and four-fifths percent of the assessed value of all real
and personal property subject to taxation in the City.
Subject of Taxation:
Â Â Â Section 11.2. The subjects of ad valorem taxation for municipal purposes
shall be the same for state, county and school purposes under the general law.
Except as otherwise provided by this Charter, City taxes shall be levied,

Preparation of the Assessment Roll:
Â Â Â Section 11.5. On or before the first Monday in March in each year the
Assessor shall prepare and certify an assessment roll of all property in the
city subject to taxation. Such roll shall be prepared in accordance with
statute and this Charter. Values shall be estimated according to recognized
methods of systematic assessment. The records of the Assessor shall show
separate figures for the value of the land, of the building improvements and of
personal property; and the method of estimating all such values shall be as
nearly uniform as possible.
Â Â Â On or before the first Monday in March the Assessor shall give by first
class mail, a notice of any increase over the previous year in the assessed
value of any property or of the addition of any property to the roll to the
owner as shown by such assessment roll. The failure to give any notice or of
the owner to receive it shall not invalidate any assessment roll or assessment
thereon.
Board of Review:
Â Â Â Section 11.6. The Board of Review shall be composed of three freeholders of
the city who shall meet the eligibility requirements for elective officers
contained in Section 6.1 and who during their term of office shall not be city
officers or employees. The appointment to a city office or the election to a
city office by a member of the Board of Review shall constitute resignation
from the Board of Review. The appointment of members of such Board shall be
based upon their knowledge and experience in property valuation. Three members
of the Board shall be appointed by the Commission in January, 1959, one of said
members to serve for one year, another to serve for two years and another to
serve for three years, and in each January thereafter one person shall be
appointed to the Board of Review to fill the vacancy of the member whose term
expires that year. The Commission shall fix the compensation of the members of
the Board. The Board of Review shall annually in February select its own
chairman for the ensuing year, and the Assessor shall be Clerk of the Board and
shall be entitled to be heard at its sessions, but shall have no vote.
Meetings of the Board of Review:
Â Â Â Section 11.7. The Board of Review shall convene in its first session on the
second Monday in March of each year at such time of day and place as shall be
designated by the Commission and shall remain in session for at least eight
hours for the purpose of considering and correcting the roll. In each case in
which the assessed value of any property is increased over the amount shown on
the assessment roll as prepared by the Assessor or any property is added to
such roll by the Board, or the Board has resolved to consider at its second
session such increasing of an assessment or the adding of any property to such
roll, the Assessor shall give notice thereof to the owners as shown by such
roll by first class letter mailed not later than the second day following the
end of the first session of the Board. Such notice shall state the date, time,
place and purpose of the second session of the Board. The failure to give any
such notice or of the owner to receive it shall not invalidate any assessment
roll or assessment thereon.
Â Â Â The Board of Review shall convene in its second session on the fourth Monday
in March of each year at such time of day and place as shall be designated by
the Commission and shall continue in session until all interested persons have
had an opportunity to be heard, but in no case for less than six hours. At the

Review shall be published by the Clerk at least ten days prior to each session
of the Board.
Duties and Functions of Board of Review:
Â Â Â Section 11.9. For the purpose of revising and correcting assessments the
Board of Review shall have the same powers and perform like duties in all
respects as are by statute conferred upon and required of Boards of Review in
townships, except as otherwise provided in this Charter. It shall hear the
complaints of all persons considering themselves aggrieved by assessments, and
if it shall appear that any person or properly has been wrongfully assessed or
omitted from the roll, the Board shall correct the roll in such manner as it
deems just. In all cases the roll shall be reviewed according to the facts
existing on the tax day and no change in the status of any properly after said
day shall be considered by the Board in making its decisions. Except as
otherwise provided by statute, no person other than the Board of Review shall
make or authorize any change upon, or additions or corrections to the
assessment roll. It shall be the duty of the Assessor to keep a permanent
record of all proceedings and to enter therein all resolutions and decisions of
the Board.
Endorsement of Roll:
Â Â Â Section 11.10. After the Board of Review has completed its review of the
assessment roll, and not later than the first Monday in April, the majority of
its members shall endorse thereon and sign a statement to the effect that the
same is the assessment roll of the city for the year in which it has been
prepared. The omission of such endorsement shall not affect the validity of
such roll.
Clerk to Certify Levy:
Â Â Â Section 11.11. Within three days after the Commission has adopted the budget
for the ensuing year, the Clerk shall certify to the Assessor the total amount
which the Commission determines shall be raised by general ad valorem tax. He
shall also certify all amounts of current or delinquent special assessments and
all other amounts which the Commission requires to be assessed, reassessed or
charged upon any property or against any person.
City Tax Roll:
Â Â Â Section 11.12. After the Board of Review has completed its review of the
assessment roll, the Assessor shall prepare a copy of assessment roll to be
known as the â€œCity Tax Rollâ€, and upon receiving the certification of the
several amounts to be raised, as provided in Section 11.11, the Assessor shall
spread upon said tax roll the several amounts determined by the Commission to
be charged, assessed or reassessed against persons or property. He shall also
spread the amounts of the general ad valorem city lax and school tax according
to and in proportion to the several valuations set forth in said assessment
roll. To avoid fractions in computation on any tax roll, the assessor may add
to the amount of the several taxes to be raised not more than the amount
prescribed by statute. Any excess created thereby on any tax roll shall belong
to the city.
Tax Roll Certified for Collection:
Â Â Â Section 11.13. After spreading the taxes, the Assessor shall certify the tax
roll and the Mayor shall annex his warrant thereto directing and requiring the
Treasurer to collect prior to March 1st of the following year from the several
persons named on said roll the several sums mentioned therein opposite their
respective names as a tax or assessment and granting to him for the purpose of
collecting the tax assessments and charges on said roll such powers and
immunities necessary to collect same. On or before June 1st the roll shall be
delivered to the Treasurer for collection.
Tax Lien on Property:
Â Â Â Section 11.14. On July first the taxes thus assessed shall become a debt due
to the city from the persons to whom they are assessed, and the amounts
assessed on any interest in real property shall become a lien upon such real
property, for such amounts and for all interest and charges thereon, and all
personal taxes shall become a first lien on all personal property of such
persons so assessed. Such lien shall take precedence over all other claims,
encumbrances and liens to the extent provided by statute and shall continue
until such taxes, interest and charges are paid.
Taxes Due: Notification Thereof:
Â Â Â Section 11.15. City taxes shall be due on July first of each year. The
Treasurer shall not be required to call upon the persons named in the city tax
roll, nor to make personal demand for the payments of taxes, but he shall (a)
publish, between June fifteenth and July first, notice of the time when said
taxes will be due for collection and the penalties and fees for late payment of
same, and (b) mail a bill to each person named in said roll, but in case of
multiple ownership of property only one bill need be mailed.
Â Â Â Failure on the part of the Treasurer to publish said notice or mail such
bills shall not invalidate the taxes on said tax roll nor release the person or
property assessed from the penalties and fees provided in this chapter in case
of late payment or non-payment of the same.
Interest on Late Payment of Taxes:
Â Â Â Section 11.16. All taxes paid on or before the thirty-first day of August
shall be collected by the Treasurer without additional charge. On September
first he shall add to all taxes paid thereafter four percent of the amount of
said taxes and on the first day of October and of each succeeding month he
shall add an additional one-half of one percent of said taxes that remain
unpaid. Such interest shall not exceed six percent and shall belong to the city
and constitute a charge and shall be a lien against the property to which the
taxes themselves apply, collectable in the same manner as the taxes to which
they are added. It is provided, however, that if delivery of the tax roll to
the Treasurer, as provided in Section 11.13 is delayed for any reason by more
than thirty days after June first, the application of the interest charge
provided herein shall be postponed thirty days for the first thirty days of
such delay and shall be postponed an additional thirty days for each additional
thirty days, or major fraction thereof, of such delay.
Failure or Refusal to Pay Personal Property Tax:
Â Â Â Section 11.17. If any person, firm or corporation shall neglect or refuse to
pay any personal property tax assessed to him or them by October first, the
Treasurer shall collect the same by seizing the personal property of such
person, firm or corporation to an amount sufficient to pay for such tax, fees
and charges for subsequent sale, wherever the same may be found in the state,
and from which seizure no property shall be exempt. He may sell the property
seized to an amount sufficient to pay the taxes and all charges in accordance
with statutory provisions. The Treasurer may, if otherwise unable to collect a
tax on personal property, sue, in accordance with statute, the person, firm or
corporation to whom it is assessed.
Delinquent Tax Roll to County Treasurer:
Â Â Â Section 11.18. All city taxes on real property remaining uncollected by the
Treasurer on the first day of March following the date for returns by township
treasurers of township, school and county Treasurer in the manner and with like
effect as provided by statute for returns by township treasurers of township,
school and County taxes. Such returns shall include all the additional
assessments, charges and fees hereinbefore provided, which shall be added to
the amount assessed in said tax roll against each property or person. The taxes
thus returned shall be collected in the same manner as other taxes returned to
the County Treasurer are collected, in accordance with statute, and shall be
and remain a lien upon the property against which they are assessed until paid.
If by change in statute or otherwise, the Treasurer of the County of Mason, is
no longer charged with the collection of delinquent real property taxes, such
delinquent taxes shall be collected in the manner then provided by statute for
the collection of delinquent township, school and county taxes.
State, County and School Taxes:
Â Â Â Section 11.19. For the purpose of assessing and collecting taxes for state,
county and school purposes, the city shall be considered the same as a
township, and all provisions of statute relative to the collection of and
accounting for such taxes shall apply. For these purposes the Treasurer shall
perform the same duties and have the same powers as township treasurers under
statute; Provided that nothing in this section shall deter the City
Commissionâ€™s power to determine the Treasurerâ€™s salary.

city.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Mortgage bonds for the acquiring, owning, purchasing, constructing,
improving or operating of any public utility which the city is authorized by
this Charter to acquire or operate; provided such bonds shall not impose any

revenues of such public utility, including a franchise, stating the terms upon
which, in case of foreclosure, the purchaser may operate the same, which
franchise shall in no case extend for a longer period than twenty years from
the date of the sale of such utility and franchise on foreclosure. A sinking
fund shall be created in the event of the issuance of such bonds, by setting
aside such percentage of the gross or net earnings of the public utility as may
be deemed sufficient for the payment of the mortgage bonds at maturity, unless
serial bonds are issued of such a nature that no sinking fund is required.

Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Bonds for the refunding of the funded indebtedness of the city.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â Revenue bonds as authorized by statute which are secured only by the

Section 12.1 (c), special assessment bonds issued under Section 12.1 (d),
refunding bonds issued under Section 12.1 (g) or to bonds the issuance of which

issue of bonds which constitute a general obligation of the city, but no person
may so vote unless he is a registered elector.
Applicable of Other Statutory Restrictions:
Â Â Â Section 12.3. The issuance of any bonds not requiring the approval of the
electors shall be subject to applicable requirements of statute with regard to
public notice in advance of the authorization of such issues, filing of
petitions for a referendum on such issues, holding of such referendum and other
applicable procedural requirements.

notes), 12.1 (c) (emergency loans), 12.1 (d) special assessment bonds even
though they are also a general obligation of the city), 12.1 (e) (mortgage

as allowed by statute of the assessed value of all the real and personal
property in the City.
Â Â Â The total amount of special assessment bonds pledging the full faith and
credit of the City shall at no time exceed that percentage as allowed by
statute of the assessed value of all the real and personal property in the City
nor shall such bonds be issued in any consecutive period of twelve months in
excess of that amount as allowed by statute of the assessed value unless
authorized by a majority vote of the electors voting thereon at any general or
special election.
Preparation and Record of Bonds:
Â Â Â Section 12.5. Each bond or other evidence of indebtedness shall contain on
its face a statement specifying the purpose for which the same is issued and it
shall be unlawful for any officer of the city to use the proceeds thereof for
any other purpose, and any officer who shall violate this provision shall be
deemed guilty of misconduct in office. All bonds and other evidence of
indebtedness issued by the City shall be signed by the Mayor and countersigned

CHAPTER 13.
SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS
General Power Relative to Special Assessments:
Â Â Â Section 13.1. The Commission shall have the power to determine by resolution
that the whole or any part of the expense of any public improvement be defrayed
by special assessment upon the property especially benefitted in proportion to
the benefits derived or to be derived.
Detailed Procedure to be Fixed by Ordinance:
Â Â Â Section 13.2. The Commission shall prescribe by ordinance the complete
special assessment procedure governing the initiation of projects, preparation
of plans and cost estimates, creation of districts, making and confirming of
assessment rolls, correction of errors in the rolls, collection of assessments
and any other matters concerning the making of improvements by the special
assessment method.
Â Â Â Such ordinance shall be subject to the following provisions:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â No resolution finally determining to proceed with establishing any
special assessment district for the making of any public improvement shall be
enacted until cost estimates have been prepared and a public hearing has been
held on the advisability of so proceeding, which hearing shall be held not less
than ten days after notice thereof has been published and sent by first class
mail to all property owners in the proposed district as shown by the current
assessment roll of the city.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â No special assessment roll shall be finally confirmed until after a
meeting of the Commission has been held for the purpose of reviewing such roll,
which meeting shall be held not less than ten days after notice thereof has
been published and sent by first class mail to all property owners in the
proposed district as shown by the current assessment roll of the City.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â No original special assessment roll shall be confirmed except by the
affirmative vote of five members of the Commission if prior to such
confirmation written objections to the proposed improvement have been filed by
the owners of property in the district which will be required to bear more than
fifty percent of the amount of such special assessment.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â No public improvement to be financed in whole or part by special
assessment shall be made before the confirmation of the special assessment roll
for such improvement.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â No special assessment district or districts shall be created by the
Commission for any one public improvement which includes property having an
area in excess of twenty-five per cent of the total area of the City. No public
improvement project shall be divided geographically for the purpose of
circumventing this provision.
Special Assessment Powers:
Â Â Â Section 13.3. The Commission shall, in the exercise of its powers of special
assessment, have power to provide for the following, but this list shall not be
exclusive:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â For the construction of public parking facilities as a public
improvement financed in whole or part by the special assessment method.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â For installing a boulevard lighting system on any street as a public
improvement to be financed in whole or part by special assessment upon the
lands abutting thereupon, provided, that the property owners of a majority of
the frontage on such street or part thereof to be so improved shall petition
therefor.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â For the payment of special assessments in annual installments not to
exceed ten in number. The first such installment to be due upon confirmation of
the special assessment roll, and subsequent installments to be due on July
first of succeeding years and to be placed upon the annual city tax roll, if
delinquent, and for an interest charge only until the due date of each such
deferred installment not to exceed six per cent per year, subject to the right
of advance payment of any such installment with interest only to the date of
payment.
Disposition of Excessive Special Assessments:
Â Â Â Section 13.4. The excess by which any special assessment proves larger than
the actual cost of the improvement and expenses incidental thereto may be
placed in the general fund of the city if such excess is three percent or less
of the assessment, but should the assessment prove larger than necessary by
more than three per cent, the entire excess shall be refunded on a pro rate
basis to the owners of the property assessed as shown by the current assessment
roll of the city. Such refund shall be made by credit against future unpaid
installments to the extent such installments then exist and the balance of such
refund shall be in cash. No refunds may be made which contravene the provisions
of any outstanding evidence of indebtedness secured in whole or in part by such
special assessment.
Additional Assessments: Correction of Invalid Special Assessments:
Â Â Â Section 13.5. Additional pro rate assessments may be made when any special
assessment roll proves insufficient to pay for the improvement for which it was
levied and the expenses incident thereto, or to pay the principal and interest
on bonds or other evidences of obligation issued therefor; provided that the
additional pro rate assessment shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the
assessment as originally confirmed unless a meeting of the Commission be held
to review such additional assessment, for which meeting notices shall be
published and mailed as provided in the case of review of the original special
assessment roll.
Â Â Â Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of the Commission, be
invalid by reason of irregularity or informality in the proceedings, or if any
court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge such assessment to be illegal,
the Commission shall, whether the improvement has been made or not, or whether
any part of the assessments have been paid or not, have power to cause a new
assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was
made. All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall
be conducted in the same manner as provided for the original assessment, and
whenever any sum or part thereof levied upon any property in the assessment so
set aside has been paid and not refunded, the payment so made shall be applied
upon the reassessment or if the payments exceed the amount of the reassessment,
refunds shall be made.
Â Â Â No judgment or decree nor any act of the Commission vacating a special
assessment shall destroy or impair the lien of the city upon the premises
assessed for such amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged against
the same or as by regular mode of proceedings might have been lawfully assessed
thereupon.
Contested Assessments:
Â Â Â Section 13.6. No suit or action of any kind shall be instituted or
maintained for the purpose of contesting or enjoining the collection of any
special assessment (a) unless within thirty days after the confirmation of the
special assessment roll written notice is given to the Commission of intention
to file such suit or action stating the grounds on which it is claimed such
assessment is illegal and (b) unless such suit or action shall be commenced
within sixty days after confirmation of the roll.
Collection of Special Assessments:
Â Â Â Section 13.7. Upon the confirmation of each special assessment roll the
special assessments shall become a debt to the city from the persons to whom
they are assessed and shall until paid by a lien upon the property assessed for
the amount of such assessment and all interest and charges thereon. Such lien
shall be of the same character and effect as created by this Charter for city
taxes.
Â Â Â Special assessments, or installments thereof, which become due on July first
of any year shall be collected in all respects as are city taxes due on July 1
of the same year, and if uncollected on the following first day of March, shall
be returned to the County Treasurer with unpaid taxes as provided in Section
11.18.
Â Â Â The initial special assessment installments which become due other than on
July first shall, if unpaid for ninety days or more on May first of any year,
be certified as delinquent to the Commission by the Treasurer and the
Commission shall place such delinquent assessments on the tax roll for that
year together with accrued interest to July first of such year. The total
amount of such assessment and interest shall thereafter be collected in all
respects as are city taxes due on July first of that year and shall be subject
to the same fees and penalties as are city taxes due on that date and if
uncollected on the following March first shall be returned to the County
Treasurer with unpaid taxes as provided in Section 11.18.
Special Assessment Accounts:
Â Â Â Section 13.8. Except as otherwise provided in this charter, moneys raised by
special assessment for any public improvement shall be credited to a special
account and shall be used to pay for the costs of the improvement for which the
assessment was levied and expenses incidental thereto or to repay any money
borrowed therefor.
Assessments for Renewal of Hazards, Etc.:
Â Â Â Section 13.9. The assessment for the cost of the construction of any
sidewalk or the abatement of any hazard or nuisance to be made pursuant to
Section 2.3 (u) or Section 2.3 (v), or for the cost of removing snow, ice or
other obstructions from sidewalks or trimming and removal of hazardous trees to
be made pursuant to Section 2.3 (w) or Section 2.3 (x), shall be made by
resolution of the Commission. Notice of the time at which the Commission will
act thereon shall be given by first class mail to the owner of the property to
be assessed as shown by the current tax roll of the city, except that no notice
shall be required in the case of assessments for the removal of weeds, snow or
ice. For the purpose of collection of such assessments, the adoption of such
resolution shall be equivalent to the confirmation of a special assessment
roll. The amount of any such assessment shall become a debt to the city upon
adoption of such a resolution, be due at such time as the Commission shall
prescribe and shall be subject to the collection fees and become a lien as
provided in Section 13.7. Every such assessment shall also be subject to
Section 13.4, 13.5, and 13.6.

special assessment roll.
CHAPTER 14
PURCHASES â€” CONTRACTS â€” LEASES
Purchase and Sale of Property:
Â Â Â Section 14.1. The City Manager shall be responsible for the purchase and
sale of all city property, subject to the restrictions of statutes and
ordinances.
Â Â Â Comparative prices shall be obtained for the purchase or sale in amount not
in excess of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) of all materials, supplies and
public improvements except (a) in the employment of professional services and
(b) when the City Manager shall determine that no advantage to the city would
result.
Â Â Â In all sales or purchases in excess of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00), (a)
the sale or purchase shall be approved by the Commission, (b) sealed bids shall
be obtained, and (c) the requirements of Section 14.2 shall be complied with.

dollar value limitation contained in this section. The Commission may authorize
the making of public improvements or the performance of any other city work by
any city agency without competitive bidding.
Â Â Â Purchases shall be made from the lowest competent bidder meeting
specifications unless the Commission shall determine that the public interest
will be better served by accepting a higher bid. Sales shall be made to the
bidder whose bid is most advantageous to the city.
Â Â Â All purchases and sales shall be evidenced by written contract or purchase
order.
Â Â Â The city may not sell any park, cemetery or any part thereof except in

statute and of this Charter, provided that purchases and sales may be made by
the City Manager subject to the provisions of Section 14.1.
Â Â Â Any contract or agreement in an amount of two thousand dollars or more made
with form or terms other than the standard city purchase order shall before
execution be submitted to the Attorney and his opinion obtained with respect to
its form and legality. A copy of all contracts or agreements requiring such
opinion shall be filed in the office of the Clerk together with a copy of the
opinion.
Â Â Â Before any contract, agreement or purchase order obligating the city to pay
an amount of two thousand dollars or more is executed, the accounting officer
of the city shall first have certified that an appropriation has been made for
the payment thereof, or, that sufficient funds will be available if it be for a
purpose being financed by the issuance of bonds or by special assessments or
for some other purpose not chargeable to a budget appropriation. In the case of
a contract or agreement obligating the city for periodic payments in future
fiscal years for the furnishing of a continuing service or the leasing of
property, such certification need not cover those payments which will be due in
future fiscal years, but this exception shall not apply to a contract for the
purchase or construction of a public improvement unless such purchase or
construction is being financed by an installment contract under authority of
Section 12.7. Certification by the accounting officer of the city shall be
endorsed on each contract, agreement or purchase order requiring same or shall
be filed as an attachment thereto.
Â Â Â No contract or purchase order shall be subdivided for the purpose of
circumventing the dollar value limitations contained in this Section.

authority of the Commission, provided that the City Manager may amend contracts
for those purchases and sales made by him under the authority of Section 14.1.

the terms of the contract.
Â Â Â No contract shall be made with any person, firm or corporation in default to
the city.
Â Â Â An individual agreement of employment shall not be deemed a contract
requiring opinion by the Attorney or certification by the accounting officer of
the city.
Editorâ€™s note:
Â Â Â This section was by amended by city election on August 8, 2000.
Restriction on Powers to Lease Property:
Â Â Â Section 14.3. The Commission may not rent or let public property for a
period longer than three years unless such rental or lease agreement shall have
been referred to the people at a regular or special election and shall have
received the approval of a majority of the electors voting thereon at such
election. No such lease shall be approved by the Commission for presentation to
the electorate before thirty days after application therefore has been filed
with the Commission nor until a public hearing has been held thereon. No such
lease shall be submitted to the electors unless the party leasing or renting
the property has filed with the Clerk his unconditional acceptance of all terms
of such lease or rental agreement.

reference.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The sanction for a violation which is a municipal civil infraction
shall be a civil fine in the amount as provided by this code or other city
ordinance, plus any costs, damages, expenses and other sanctions, as authorized

or other city ordinance continues or is permitted to exist constitutes a
separate offense and shall be subject to penalties or sanctions as a separate
offense.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â The imposition of a fine, penalty or other sanction shall not excuse
any person from compliance with the requirements of this code or other city
ordinance.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â The remedies, penalties and sanctions provided by this code and other
city ordinances are cumulative. In addition to any remedies provided by this
section or otherwise available to the city at law, the city may revoke or
suspend any permit or license or bring an action for an injunction or initiate
other available processes against a person to restrain, prevent or abate any
violation of this code or other city ordinance. The city may also seek orders
from courts of competent jurisdiction to compel compliance with this code to
abate a nuisance or other condition violating this code, to provide for
restitution or for other equitable relief. The city shall also have a cause of
action to recover as damages any cost incurred by the city resulting from the
violation of this code.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â The remedies, penalties and sanctions provided by this section, unless
another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any
section of this code or other city ordinance, whether or not the remedy,
penalty or sanction is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance.

misdemeanor violation shall be a fine not exceeding $500, plus costs of
prosecution, or jail time not exceeding 90 days or both, a fine, plus costs,
and jail time in the discretion of the court, unless another maximum fine or
term of jail time and/or imprisonment is otherwise specifically provided for
the violation by this code or other city ordinance or authorized by state law.

151.01, the International Property Maintenance Code, 2018 edition, as published
by the International Code Council, was adopted by reference, for regulating and

making of the improvement, special assessments therefor, and the financing
thereof.
Â Â Â IMPROVEMENT. Any public improvement, any part of the cost of which is to be
assessed against one or more lots or parcels of land to be especially benefited
thereby, in proportion to the benefit to be derived therefrom.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.15)
Â§ 33.02 AUTHORITY TO ASSESS.
Â Â Â The Commission shall have power to determine by resolution that the whole or
any part of the cost or expense of any improvement shall be defrayed by special
assessments upon the property especially benefited, in proportion to the
benefits derived or to be derived.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.16)
Â§ 33.03 PETITION FOR IMPROVEMENT.
Â Â Â The Commission, in order to ascertain whether or not a reasonable number of
property owners to be assessed desire any particular improvements to be made,
may request and receive a petition therefor, or may receive such a petition
voluntarily presented; but in either event, the petition shall be advisory only
and shall not be jurisdictional.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.17)
Â§ 33.04 REPORT BY MANAGER.
Â Â Â Before determining to make any improvement, any part of the cost of which is
to be defrayed by special assessment, the Commission shall require the City
Manager to ascertain the assessment valuation of all property affected by the
proposed improvement, the number of parcels which show tax delinquencies, the
number of parcels owned by public authorities, and the number of parcels which
are vacant, and to prepare, or cause to be prepared, plans and specifications
therefor and an estimate of the cost thereof, and to file the same with the
Clerk, together with his or her recommendation as to what proportion of the
cost should be paid by special assessment and what part, if any, should be a
general obligation of the city, the number of installments in which assessments
may be paid and the lands which should be included in the special assessment
district.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.18)
Â§ 33.05 NOTICE OF HEARING.
Â Â Â After the filing, a public hearing shall be held before the Commission,
which hearing shall be held not less than ten days after notice of the time and
place thereof has been published and sent by the Clerk by first class mail to
all property owners in the proposed district as shown by the current assessment
roll of the city.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.19)
Â§ 33.06 HEARING ON NECESSITY.
Â Â Â At the time and place specified in the notice for public hearing, the

improvement. The hearing may be adjourned from time to time by the Commission.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.20)
Â§ 33.07 COMMISSION DETERMINATION.
Â Â Â After the public hearing, the Commission may by resolution determine to make
the improvement and to defray the whole or any part of the cost of the
improvement by special assessment upon the property especially benefited in
proportion to the benefits derived or to be derived. By this resolution the
Commission shall approve the plans and specifications for the improvement;
determine the estimated cost therefor; determine what proportion of the cost
shall be paid by special assessment upon the property especially benefited and
what part, if any, shall be a general obligation of the city; determine the
number of installments in which assessments may be paid; determine the rate of
interest to be charged on installments, not to exceed 6% per annum; designate
the district or land and premises upon which special assessment shall be
levied; and direct the Assessor to prepare a special assessment roll in
accordance with the Commissionâ€™s determination.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.21)
Â§ 33.08 PREPARATION OF ROLL.
Â Â Â The Assessor shall thereupon prepare a special assessment roll including all
lots and parcels of land within the special assessment district designated by
the Commission, and shall assess to each lot or parcel of land such relative
portion of the whole sum to be levied against all the lands in the special
assessment district as the benefit to the lot or parcel of land bears to the
total benefits to all lands in the district. There shall also be entered upon
the roll the amount which has been assessed to the city at large.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.22)
Â§ 33.09 ASSESSORâ€™S CERTIFICATE.
Â Â Â When the Assessor shall have completed the assessment roll, he or she shall
attach thereto, or endorse thereon, his or her certificate to the effect that
the roll has been made by him or her pursuant to a resolution of the Commission
(giving date of adoption of same) and that in making the assessments therein he
or she has, as near as may be, according to his or her best judgment, conformed
in all respects to the directions contained in the resolution, and to the City
Charter and the provisions of this chapter. Thereupon he or she shall file the
special assessment roll with the Clerk who shall present the same to the
Commission.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.23)
Â§ 33.10 NOTICE OF HEARING.
Â Â Â Upon receipt of the special assessment roll, the Commission shall order it
filed in the office of the Clerk for public examination; shall fix the time and
place when it will meet and review the roll, which meeting shall be held not
less than ten days after notice thereof has been sent by the Clerk, by first
class mail to all property owners in the proposed district as shown by the
current assessment roll of the city. The notice shall specify the time and
place of the meeting. The Commission may, in its discretion, publish notice of
the meeting not less than ten days prior to date of the meeting.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.24)
Â§ 33.11 HEARING ON ROLL.
Â Â Â Any person deeming himself or herself aggrieved by the special assessment

respect he or she deems himself or herself aggrieved.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.25)
Â§ 33.12 CONFIRMATION OF ROLL.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Review. The Commission shall meet and review the special assessment
roll at the time and place appointed, or at any adjourned date therefor, and
shall consider any written objections thereto. The Commission may correct the
roll as to any assessment or description of any lot or parcel of land, or other
errors appearing therein. Any changes made in the roll shall be noted in the
Commissionâ€™s minutes. After the hearing and review the Commission may confirm
the special assessment roll with such corrections as it may have made, if any;
may refer it back to the Assessor for revision; or may annul it and any
proceedings in connection therewith. No original special assessment roll shall
be finally confirmed except by the affirmative vote of five of the members of
the Commission if, prior to the confirmation, written objections to the
proposed improvement have been filed by the owners of property which will be
required to bear more than 50% of the amount of the special assessment. The
Clerk shall endorse the date of confirmation upon each special assessment roll.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Roll final on confirmation. The roll shall, upon confirmation, be
final and conclusive.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.26)
Â§ 33.13 LIEN ESTABLISHED; WHEN PAYMENT DUE.
Â Â Â All special assessments contained in any special assessment roll, including
any part thereof deferred as to payment, shall, from the date of confirmation
of the roll, constitute a lien upon the respective lots or parcels of land
assessed and until paid shall be a charge against the respective owners of the
several lots and parcels of land and a debt to the city from the persons to
whom they are assessed. The lien shall be of the same character and effect as
the lien created by the City Charter taxes and shall include accrued interest
and penalties. No judgment or decree, nor any act of the Commission vacating a
special assessment, shall destroy or impair the lien of the city upon the
premises assessed for the amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged
against the same, or as by a regular mode of proceeding might be lawfully
assessed thereon. All special assessments shall become due upon confirmation of
the special assessment roll or in annual installments, not to exceed ten in
number, as the Commission may determine at the time of confirmation and, if in
annual installments, the Commission shall determine the first installment to be
due upon confirmation or on the following July 1, and subsequent installments
on July 1 of succeeding years.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.27)
Â§ 33.14 COLLECTION BY TREASURER.
Â Â Â The assessment roll shall be transmitted by the Clerk to the Treasurer for
collection immediately after its confirmation. The Treasurer shall give notice
by one publication in a newspaper which shall meet the requirements of the City
Charter concerning the publication that the special assessment roll identifying
it has been filed in his or her office, and specifying when and where payments
may be made thereon. He or she may mail statements of the several assessments
to the respective owners, as indicated by the records of the Assessor, of the
several lots and parcels of land assessed, stating the amount of the
assessment, and the manner in which it may be paid; provided, however, that
failure to mail the statement shall not invalidate the assessment or entitle
the owner to an extension of time within which to pay the assessment.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.28)
Â§ 33.15 EARLY PAYMENT; DIVISION INTO INSTALLMENTS.
Â Â Â The whole or any part of any assessment may be paid during the period of 60
days from the date of confirmation of the special assessment roll without
interest or penalty. Not later than 15 days after the end of the 60-day period,
the Treasurer shall transmit the roll to the Assessor with all payments upon
assessments noted thereon. The Assessor shall then divide any remaining balance
of each assessment into a number of equal installments as shall have been fixed
by the Commission; provided, that if the division operates to make any
installment less than $10, then the Assessor shall reduce the number of
installments so that each installment shall be above and as near to $10 as
possible.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.29)
Â§ 33.16 SPREADING ON TAX ROLL.
Â Â Â The first installment shall be spread upon the next city tax roll in a
column headed â€œSpecial Assessments,â€ together with interest upon all unpaid
installments from the date of the confirmation of the roll to July 1 of the
year in which the tax roll is made; provided, that any fraction of a month
shall be considered as a full month. Thereafter one instalment shall be spread
upon each annual tax roll, together with one yearâ€™s interest upon all unpaid
installments; provided, that when any annual installments shall have been
prepaid as hereinafter provided, then there shall be spread upon the tax roll
for the year only the interest upon all unpaid installments.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.30)
Â§ 33.17 COLLECTION FROM TAX ROLL.
Â Â Â After each installment has been placed on the tax rolls, the same shall be
collected by the Treasurer with the same rights and remedies, and the same
penalties and interest, as provided in the Charter for the collection of taxes.
On the first day of the third month following due date, the Treasurer shall add
to all assessments or installments paid on the first day of the third month and
thereafter a collection fee of 4% of the amount of the assessment, and on the
first day of each succeeding month he or she shall add an additional 0.5% as a
collection fee. All collection fees shall belong to the city and be collectible
in the same manner as the collection fee on city taxes.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.31)
Â§ 33.18 PAYMENT OF FUTURE INSTALLMENTS.
Â Â Â After the expiration of the 60-day period provided for in Â§
33.10, any installment which has not been spread upon the tax rolls may be
discharged by paying the face amount thereof plus interest thereon to date of
payment. Any person desiring to pay the installment in advance shall first
secure the proper statement from the Assessor to permit the Treasurer to
compute the amount to be paid. The Treasurer shall report to the Assessor all
advance payments on installments so that the Assessor shall have the
information before spreading installments on the next city tax roll.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.32)
Â§ 33.19 REPORT ACTUAL COST.
Â Â Â Upon completion of the improvement and the payment of the cost thereof, the
City Manager shall certify to the Commission the total cost of the improvement,
together with the amount of the original roll for the improvement.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.33)
Â§ 33.20 DEFICIENCY ASSESSMENTS.
Â Â Â Should the assessments in any special assessment roll, including the amount
assessed to the city at large, prove insufficient for any reason to pay the
cost of the improvement for which they are made, then the Commission shall make
additional assessments against the city and the several lots and parcels of
land, in the same ratio as the original assessments, to supply the deficiency;
but the total amount assessed against any lot or parcel of land shall not
exceed the value of the benefits received from the improvement, provided that
the additional pro rata assessment shall not exceed 25% of the assessment as
originally confirmed, unless a meeting of the Commission be held to review the
additional assessment, for which meeting notices shall be mailed as provided in
the case of review of the original special assessment rolls.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.34)
Â§ 33.21 REFUNDS.
Â Â Â The excess by which any special assessment proves larger than the actual
cost of the improvement and expenses incidental thereto may be placed in the
General Fund of the city if the excess is 3% or less of the assessment, but
should the assessment prove larger than necessary by more than 3%, the entire
excess shall be refunded on a pro rata basis to the owners of the property
assessed. The refund shall be made by credit against future unpaid installments
in the inverse order in which they are payable to the extent the installments
then exist, and the balance of the refund shall be in cash. No refunds may be
made which contravene the provisions of any outstanding evidence of
indebtedness secured in whole or part by the special assessment.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.35)
Â§ 33.22 EFFECT OF INVALIDITY.
Â Â Â Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of the Commission, be
invalid by reason of irregularity or informality in the proceedings, or if any
court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge the assessment to be illegal, the
Commission shall, whether the improvement has been made or not, or whether any
part of the assessment has been paid or not, have power to cause a new
assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was
made. All proceedings on the reassessment and for the collection thereof shall
be conducted in the same manner as provided for in the original assessment; and
whenever the assessment, or any part thereof, levied upon any premises has been
so set aside, if the same has been paid and not refunded, the payment so made
shall be applied upon the reassessment, and the reassessment shall to that
extent be deemed satisfied.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.36)
Â§ 33.23 COLLECTION BY SUIT.
Â Â Â In addition to any other remedies, and without impairing the lien therefor,
any delinquent special assessment, together with interest and penalties, may be
collected in an action in assumpsit in the name of the city against the person
assessed, in any court having jurisdiction of the amount. If, in any such
action, it shall appear that by reason of any irregularities or informalities
the assessment has not been properly made against the defendant or upon the
premises sought to be charged, the court may, nevertheless, on satisfactory
proof that expense has been incurred by the city, which is a proper charge
against the defendant or the premises in question, render judgment for the
amount properly chargeable against the defendant or upon the premises.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.37)
Â§ 33.24 SIZE OF DISTRICT.
Â Â Â No special assessment district shall be created by the Commission for any
one public improvement which includes property having an area in excess of 25%
of the total area of the city. No public improvement project shall be divided
geographically for the purpose of circumventing this provision.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.38)
Â§ 33.25 ASSESSMENT TO PRECEDE CONSTRUCTION.
Â Â Â No public improvement is to be financed in whole or in part by special
assessment roll for the improvement.
(1993 Code, Â§ 33.39)
DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND TAX INCREMENT FINANCING PLAN
Â§ 33.40 DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND TAX INCREMENT FINANCING PLAN;
ESTABLISHED.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The city determines that the Downtown Development Plan and Tax
Increment Financing Plan are necessary to make public improvements which will
facilitate increased property tax valuation in the business district. It is
determined that these public improvements constitute a public purpose which is
in the best interest of the citizens of the city.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The city hereby establishes the Tax Increment Financing Plan approved
on April 18, 1988 by the City Council. The city affirms that this plan is in
conformance with Public Act 197 of 1975, being M.C.L.A. Â§Â§ 125.1651 through
125.1657 and 125.1659 through 125.1680, and the Master Plan of the city.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â All amendments to the Tax Increment Financing Plan must be submitted
by the Downtown Development Authority to the City Commission for approval.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Termination of this plan may be by repealing the ordinance upon which
this section is based.

premises may be enforced by discontinuing either the water service or the
sewage disposal service to the premises, or both, and an action may be
instituted by the city against the customer. The charges for water service and

which furnished. The Superintendent of the Water Department shall certify all
unpaid charges for the service furnished to any premises which have remained
unpaid for a period of 60 days to the City Assessor, who shall place the same
on the next tax roll of the city. These charges so assessed shall be collected

deposits may be applied against any delinquent water or sewage disposal service
charges, and the application thereof shall not affect the right of the Water
Department to turn off the water service and/or sewer service to any premises
for any delinquency thereby satisfied. No deposit shall bear interest and the
deposit, or any remaining balance thereof, shall be returned to the customer
making the same when he or she shall discontinue receiving water and sewage
disposal service.

animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or to
exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic
pollutant shall include but not be limited to any pollutant identified pursuant
to Â§ 307(a) of the Act;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which, either
singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public
nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers
for maintenance and repair;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Any substance which may cause the POTWâ€™s effluent or any other
product of the POTW, such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for
reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case
shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance
with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines, or regulations developed
under Â§ 405 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines, or regulations affecting
sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the
Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act; or state criteria applicable
to the sludge management method being used;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES and/or

activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case
wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the POTW which causes
the treatment plant influent to exceed 104ÂºF;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD and the
like) released at a flow rate or pollutant concentration that a user knows or
has reason to know will cause interference to the POTW. In no case shall a slug
load have a flow rate or contain concentration or qualities of pollutants that
exceed, for any time period longer than 15 minutes, more than five times the
userâ€™s average 24-hour concentration, quantities, or flow during normal
operation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of a
half-life or concentration that may exceed limits established by the
Superintendent in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a
public nuisance.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â When the Superintendent determines that a user is contributing to the
POTW any of the above substances enumerated in division (A) of this section in
such amounts as to interfere with the operation of the POTW, the Superintendent
shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Advise the user of the impact of the contribution on the POTW; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Develop effluent limitations for the user to correct the
interference with the POTW.

Â§ 54.61 FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
Â Â Â Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for
a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent
than limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory,
shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this chapter. The
Superintendent shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting
requirements under 40 C.F.R. Â§ 403.12.
(Ord. 02-03, passed 7-15-2002)
Â§ 54.62 MODIFICATION OF FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
Â Â Â Where the cityâ€™s wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of
pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the
approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal
pretreatment standards. CONSISTENT REMOVAL shall mean reduction in the amount
of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater
treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is
achieved by the system in 95% of the samples taken when measured according to
the procedures set forth in 40 C.F.R. Â§ 40.37(c)(2), general pretreatment
regulations for existing and new sources of pollution, promulgated pursuant to
the Act. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal
pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 C.F.R. Â§ 403.7 are
fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained.

Â§ 54.67 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Protection required.  Each user shall provide protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by
this chapter. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the ownerâ€™s or userâ€™s own cost
and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be
approved by the city before construction of the facility. All users shall
submit a plan along with their permit application. No user who commences
contribution to the POTW after the effective date of the ordinance from which
this chapter derives shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system
until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city. Review
and approval of these plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the
industrial user from the responsibility to modify the userâ€™s facility as
necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. If an accidental discharge
or operations upset occurs, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately
telephone and notify POTW of the incident. The notification shall include
location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective
actions.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Written notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge or
operations upset, the user shall submit to the Superintendent a detailed
written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be
taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. This notification
shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability
which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any
other damage to person or property, nor shall the notification relieve the user
of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this
subchapter or other applicable law.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
userâ€™s bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call
if an accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances
regulated by this chapter occurs. Employers shall ensure that all employees who

the owner shall pay the other half. The owner may enter into an agreement with
the city prior to construction to spread such payment over two years at an
interest rate of 6% and have such amounts included on the tax bill each year,
or the owner may pay the owner's share in cash prior to construction. In the
event the owner does not pay or agree to pay their one-half share prior to

attorney to show cause why the decision should be modified or withdrawn. The
failure of the petitioner or representative to appear shall constitute an
abandonment of the petition. After a hearing, the City Commission shall

its finds. If it clearly appears that, by reason of special conditions, undue
hardship would result from the strict application of any section of this
chapter, the City Commission may permit a variance from the mandatory
provisions in such a manner that the public safety shall be secured,
substantial justice done, and the spirit of the provisions of this chapter
upheld. Any decision to permit a variance under this section shall be by a

establishment of marihuana operations to the extent permissible under state and
federal laws and regulations and to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare of the residents of the city.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The City Commission finds that the activities subject of this chapter
are not inconsistent with state and federal law and it regulation would
contribute to the residents health, public safety, security and welfare, by
keeping a close scrutiny to activities that otherwise would have gone
unregulated. Further, the City Commission finds that regulating these
activities would be cost-effective, at the same time that said regulation can
serve as an economic development tool benefitting all the residents of the
city.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â In exercising its powers, privileges and immunities the City
Commission does not intend to diminish, abrogate, or restrict the protections

marihuana use under the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act.

place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect's escape.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, or where a â€œno loiteringâ€ sign or signs have been posted, to

free passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any
person to block, obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any
building open to the public.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACEÂ has the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles

DESIGN STANDARDS
Â§ 152.035 TRAFFIC WAYS â€” STREETS, ROADS, AND CROSSWALKS AND PEDESTRIAN
WALKWAYS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Intent. The standards set forth in this subchapter shall be considered
the minimum standards for streets, roads, and intersections.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Street location and arrangement. Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Street Plan.  The subdivision of land for the dedication of land
for streets, highways, and alleys shall conform to the Major Street Plan as
adopted by the Planning Commission.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Local or minor streets. The streets shall be so arranged as to
discourage their use by through traffic. Nevertheless, dead-end streets are
prohibited except those designed as cul-de-sacs and those required for future
access to adjacent unplatted properties. Temporary turn-around arrangements for
stubbed dead-end streets to unplatted properties may be required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Street continuation and extension. The arrangement of streets shall
provide for continuation of existing streets from adjoining areas into the new
subdivision, unless otherwise approved. Streets shall be arranged with respect
to topography so as to result in usable lots, safe streets, and reasonable
gradients.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Alleys. Alleys shall not be permitted in plats in areas intended
for single- or two-family residential development. Alleys may be provided in
commercial subdivisions. Dead-end alleys shall be prohibited.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Marginal access streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an
arterial street, the city may require a marginal access street approximately
parallel to the arterial streets, or other treatment as it deems necessary for
adequate protection for residential properties and local access, and to afford
separation of through and local traffic.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Cul-de-sac streets. Cul-de-sac streets shall not extend more than
700 feet from the centerline of the nearest intersecting street. Special
consideration shall be given to longer cul-de-sacs under unfavorable
topographical conditions or other unusual circumstances. Cul-de-sac streets
shall terminate with an adequate turn-around with a minimum right-of-way
diameter of 120 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited, except where
unusual circumstances make it essential to the reasonable development of a
tract in conformance with these regulations and where satisfactory assurance
for dedication of the remaining part of the street is provided. Whenever a
tract to be subdivided borders on an existing street or partial street, the
other part of the street shall be dedicated within the plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Shape. In an attempt to provide a more pleasing appearance and an
attractive vista and to discourage excessive vehicular speeds, residential
streets shall be curvelinear.

dedicate additional right-of-way for the widening of the right-of-way.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Increased width. The city may require right-of-way greater than
that provided for above, to assure public safety with regard to subdivision
access, traffic circulation, and parking in the subdivision.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Railroad ROW. Whenever a subdivision abuts or contains a railroad
right-of-way, a parallel street bordering on or parallel to the railroad right-
of-way shall be provided to serve as an interceptor street for minor streets,

of more than two streets are prohibited. Curved streets, intersecting with
major thoroughfares and collector streets shall do so with a tangent section of
centerline not less than 50 feet in length, measured from the right-of-way line
of the major or collector street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Horizontal alignment.  Centerline of pavement shall coincide with
the centerline of the right-of-way, except for irregular right-of-way widths,
or as otherwise allowed by the city.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Intersections. Streets shall intersect at 90 degrees, or as closely
thereto as feasible but in no case at less than 80 degrees; provided, however,
that this standard may be modified in individual cases by the city.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Sight distances. A subdivision street which intersects with primary
highways must make provision for adequate and safe sight distances.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Centerline offsets. Street jogs at intersections shall be avoided.
Where jogs are unavoidable, street centerlines shall be offset by a distance of
150 feet or more.

not specifically indicated on the official Zoning Map shall be determined by
the scale of the official Zoning Map; and
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at
variance with those shown on the Zoning Map, or in other circumstances not

(1993 Code, Â§ 154.017) (Ord. 84-1, passed 1-3-1984)
Â§ 153.023 DISTRICT CLASSIFICATIONS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â R-1, Low Density Residential. This is a single-family housing area.
While all of the city is serviced with utilities, the low density status is
intended to preserve and protect that character which typifies a conventional
single-family neighborhood. No further subdividing of existing single-family
lots shall be permitted which creates lots substandard to the minimum required
lot area.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â R-2, Low/Medium Density Residential (One- and Two-Family). The
character and living environment of this district is somewhat similar to the R-
1 District; however, the housing density shall be slightly higher. Two
alternative forms of housing are permitted:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Single-family dwellings on smaller lots; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Duplex dwellings on sufficiently sized lots.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â R-3, Medium Density Residential (Multiple-Family). The R-3 District is
intended for multiple-family uses and structures such as apartment buildings of
three or more dwelling units, specialized housing for seven or more unrelated
individuals, and senior citizen housing. Compliance with site design standards
and requirements shall be required in order to safeguard against any
potentially adverse impacts.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â R-4, Mobile Home Park. The Mobile Home Park District is intended for
those who prefer mobile home living. Although a single-family unit, the Mobile
Home Park has essentially a higher density impact than the conventional single-
family development. In order not to adversely affect other areas of the city,
certain land areas to be designated by the City Commission shall be deemed as
appropriate for mobile home development. All site design standards and
requirements shall be met.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â CBD, Central Business District.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â This district refers to the commercial pattern presently
encompassing the intersection of U.S. 10 and U.S. 31, and which extends along
Main Street both north and south of the intersection. Parts of U.S. 10 just
east and west of the intersection are also part of the CBD.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â This district is identified as the hub of the cityâ€™s daily activity
through which major traffic passes and where people shop for everyday needs.
The prevailing appearance of the city as a small rural city situated at an
important crossroads is dominant for this district. It is the intent of the
city to promote, preserve, and protect this city character in accordance with
city land use goals and policies.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The kinds of CBD uses permitted are general, retailing, personal
services, offices, and uses which are supportive of a â€œpedestrian scale with
store windows and sidewalk shopping.â€
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â HC, Highway Commercial. The HC District is intended to provide limited
highway oriented services to through traffic beyond the Central Business
District. This highway oriented district shall be limited in scale in order not
to detract from the CBD District. The kinds of uses permitted here are
generally characterized as automobile oriented, and they have a high impact on
through traffic in terms of access and egress into a heavily used roadway.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â I-1, Light Industrial.Â Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â This district is intended to include light manufacturing,
assembling, and finishing activities which have minimal or no nuisance
potential to the surrounding areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Available for use in this district would be the â€œindustrial parkâ€
concept. The overall character may be a combination of light industrial uses
supplemented by office complexes. Local, state, and federal environmental
regulations and constraints, however, would have to be observed.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â I-2, Heavy Industrial. This district is in contrast to the I-
1 District and is intended to provide for heavier, more intense industrial uses
which are primarily of a manufacturing, assembling, and fabricating character,
including the processing of raw materials, junkyards, and specialized
industrial processing which may require special sites, facilities, and
services.

or function shall conform to the provisions of the district in which it is
located and of this chapter, and be built so as to conform with the surrounding

annoyance to residents or occupants of adjoining premises or to the traveling
public or public highways.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Screening of nonresidential uses which abut transitional and
residentially zoned lots. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, all
premises used for business, commercial, or industrial purposes shall be
screened from all abutting residential districts or uses. Screening shall be
any of the following and shall apply to side yards and rear yards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A natural buffer ten feet wide measured at the property line and
planted with evergreens or shrubbery which maintains their density and
screening effect throughout the calendar year, not less than four feet in
height at the time of planting and maintained in a neat and attractive manner
commensurate with the adjoining residential district; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â An artificial wall or fence of sufficient density or compactness to
screen the structures and activities of the business from the view of occupants
of adjoining premises, not less than five feet in height and maintained in a
neat and attractive manner, commensurate with the adjoining residential
district. No wall or fence shall terminate closer than ten feet from any
adjoining street right-of-way line.

shall follow the same limitations as provided for residential front yard
screening.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Barbed wire. Barbed wire fences are prohibited in all â€œRâ€ zoning
districts. Barbed wire strands may be used to enclose storage areas or other
similar agricultural, industrial, and commercial uses. The strands shall be
restricted to the uppermost portion of the fence and shall not extend lower
than a height of six feet from the nearest ground level.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Electric fence. It shall be unlawful to install, construct, or

NONCONFORMITIES
Â§ 153.060 NONCONFORMING BUILDING AND USES.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Except as herein provided, no building, structure, or land or part
thereof, shall be used, altered, constructed, or reconstructed except in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter which apply to the district in
which it is located.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The lawful use of a building, structure, or land existing at the time
of the adoption of this chapter (January 3, 1984) may be continued although the
use does not conform with the provisions hereof, and the use may be extended
throughout a building, provided no structural alterations or changes are made
therein, except those required by law or ordinance, or any as may be required
for safety. If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of one year or
more, any further use of the building, structure, or land shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter; provided, however, that this
division shall not apply to the discontinuance of a use which arises as a
result of the existence of a state of war and in that event, a discontinuance
of use not to exceed one year from termination of hostilities shall be
permitted without working a forfeiture of the use.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a
building may be changed to a use of the same or higher classification according
to the provisions of this chapter. Whenever a nonconforming use of a building
has been changed to a higher classification or to a conforming use, the use
shall not revert or be changed to a use of a lower classification.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Whenever a district shall hereafter be changed, any then existing
nonconforming use in the changed district may be continued or changed to a use
of a similar or higher classification, provided in any case all other
regulations governing the new use are complied with.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â No building which has been damaged by fire or other causes to the
extent of more than 75% of its value shall be repaired or rebuilt except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
(1993 Code, Â§ 154.050)
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â When a building or structure is nonconforming solely because it did
not meet the front yard setback requirement at the time of the adoption of this
chapter, it shall be lawful to make structural alterations or changes therein,
provided that the structural alterations or changes are in conformity with all
other provisions of this chapter, including any structural alterations or
changes [that] do not further infringe upon the front yard setback requirement.

Â§ 153.061 CONDEMNATION OF NONCONFORMING USES.
Â Â Â The City Commission may acquire by purchase, condemnation, or otherwise
private property for the removal of nonconforming uses and structures. The City
Commission shall have the authority to institute and prosecute proceedings for
the condemnation of nonconforming uses and structures under the power of
eminent domain in accordance with the laws of the state relative to
condemnation. The City Commission may in its discretion and by proper
resolution provide that the whole or any part of the cost and expenses of
acquiring the private property be paid from the General Funds or be assessed to
a special district.
(1993 Code, Â§ 154.051) (Ord. 84-1, passed 1-3-1984)
Â§ 153.062 NONCONFORMING LOT OF RECORD (SUBSTANDARD LOTS).
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In any district, a structure and accessory building may be
erected on a lot which fails to meet the district requirements for bulk
regulations, provided that the lot existed at the effective date of this
chapter or an affecting amendment. In these instances, requirements for each
yard in a substandard lot may be reduced proportionally, by the ratio of the
actual lot size to the minimum lot size specified for the district. However, in
no case shall the required yard be less than the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Front yard, 25 feet;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Side yard, five feet each; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Rear yard, 25 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The lots must be in separate ownership at the time of application,
undeveloped, and certified by the applicant as not being contiguous with other
lots under the same ownership, and shall meet all current minimum space
requirements for a legal health disposal system.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Substandard lots which are contiguous and under the same ownership
will henceforth be required to conform to the area requirements of this chapter
in a manner which shall leave no lot substandard.

unless each extension, alteration, or addition is intended to bring the
structure into conformity with the provisions of this chapter.

Â§ 153.095 SPECIAL USE PERMIT.
Â Â Â In order that this chapter be flexible and reasonable, special uses are
provided for in Appendix A and require special use permits by the Planning
Commission. Conformance to special use standards is required, in addition to
all other requirements of this chapter. All these uses are hereby declared to

shall be considered on an individual basis. The granting of a special use
permit does not negate the requirement for any other required permit(s).
(1993 Code, Â§ 154.075) (Ord. 84-1, passed 1-3-1984)
Â§ 153.096 STANDARDS FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF SPECIAL USES.
Â Â Â The following standards shall be met:
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The special use in combination with the location proposed for the use

fire and police protection;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â No dangerous or hazardous area traffic circulation on and off the
site, which either now exists or will be created by the proposed use;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Transportation design proposals by the applicant, if necessary,
which will be needed to mitigate any potential traffic impact by the proposed
use; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â An appropriate relationship, similarity, and compatibility between
the location and scale of the proposed use to the size and type of uses,
structures, and buildings currently existing in the immediate vicinity, and
which collectively comprise the overall character of the area.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The special use shall not decrease the market value of adjacent
buildings, uses, and structures which are permitted by right under current
zoning, if the proposed use is granted;
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The special use shall be in harmony with the Land Use Plan of the
city. This considers whether the location and size of the proposed use, the
nature and intensity of the activities involved, the size of the site with
respect to existing and future streets giving access to it, parks and drainage
systems will be in harmony with the Land Use Plan and the character of land use
which is intended by the plan for the area or district in question;
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â The applicantâ€™s proposed use, its location and intensity, and the
height of its buildings, walls, fences, and other structures shall not
adversely impact the appropriate character of development intended for the area

use of flammable fluids; and
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â The special use shall not be environmentally objectionable to nearby
properties by reason of noise, fumes, pollution, vibration, or lights to an
extent which is more than would be the operations of any use permitted by right
for that district wherein the special use is proposed.

increased service and facility loads caused by the land use or activity, to
protect the natural resources and energy, to ensure compatibility with adjacent
uses of land, and to promote the use of land in a socially and economically
desirable manner. Conditions imposed shall meet all of the following
requirements:

welfare, and the social and economic well-being of those who will use the land
use or activity under consideration, residents and landowners immediately
adjacent to the proposed land use or activity, and the community as a whole;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Be related to the valid exercise of the police power and purposes

within 500 feet; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â There will be no adverse effect upon public health, safety, or
general welfare, and that it will not impair the intent of this chapter.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Compliance with performance standards for certain uses enumerated in
this chapter is required.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Site plan approval by the Planning Commission is required for all
special use permits. Site plans may be initially reviewed by the Zoning

SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES AND RELATED ACTIVITIES
Â§ 153.270 PREAMBLE.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â There is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented
businesses, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both the
existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent
to them; and have serious, harmful, negative, and objectionable operational
characteristics, particularly when they are located in close proximity to each
other.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â It is not the intent of this subchapter to suppress any activity
protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article
I, Â§ 5 of the State Constitution of 1963, but to enact content-neutral
regulations which address the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses in order to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the
city.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The city recognizes that state and federal law prohibit the
distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages state enforcement
officials to enforce state and federal obscenity statutes against any such
illegal activities that may occur within the city.
(Ord. 02-05, passed 8-5-2002)
Â§ 153.271 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
Â Â Â It is the purpose of this subchapter to regulate sexually oriented
businesses and related activities to promote and ensure the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious effects of sexually oriented
businesses within the city. The provisions of this subchapter do not have the
purpose of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative material, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is
not the intent of this subchapter to restrict or deny access by adults to
sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment of the United
States Constitution, and Article I, Â§ 5 of the State Constitution of 1963, or
to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented
entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent of this
subchapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials.

standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The conditions imposed with respect to the approval of a special
land use shall be recorded in the record of the approval action, and shall
remain unchanged except upon the mutual consent of the Zoning Board of Appeals
and the land owner. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall maintain a record of
conditions which are changed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â In the event the Zoning Board of Appeals grants a variance, the
individual or his or her successor in interest shall not use the property in
question such that it would exceed those rights given by this chapter or the
variance, or fail to follow any conditions placed thereon by the Zoning Board
of Appeals. In the event the use of the property exceeds those rights given by
this chapter or the variance, or fails to follow the conditions placed upon the
variance, the variance shall immediately terminate and it shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Time limit on decision of ZBA. Any decision of the Zoning Board of
Appeals on an appeal or application for a variance which has resulted in
granting a zoning approval, special use permit, or variance shall be valid for
a period of one year with an additional one-year extension granted by the
Zoning Administrator. This is construed to be a reasonable period of time
within which to acquire county permits and to implement the provisions of the
variance.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Final action on appeals. The decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall not be final, and any person having an interest affected by that decision
shall have the right to the courts on questions of law and fact. The records of
the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be made available for the courtâ€™s review.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â Effect of appeals proceedings (stay of proceedings). An appeal shall
stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the
officer or body from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board of
Appeals, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with that officer or
body, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would cause
immediate peril of life or property.

Â§ 153.310 APPLICATION PROCEDURE FOR APPEALS/VARIANCES AND THE DECISION PROCESS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Filing for an appeal/variance. When any order, requirement, decision,
or determination is subsequently appealed to the Zoning Board of Appeals or
when a variance is requested, as provided for in this chapter, the appellant
shall file a notice of appeal with fee to the Zoning Administrator, who shall
forward all records and materials to the Zoning Board of Appeals. If appealing
a determination or orders, the Zoning Administrator shall also send copies of
all materials to the official or body of officials from whom the appeal is
taken. The body or official shall also make all records available to the ZBA
for review.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â General procedural steps by ZBA.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If an appeal, it must be filed within 30 days from the date of the
action being appealed. If request is for a variance or interpretation, no time
limit for filing is required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The ZBA reviews the appeal form to make sure that it is the proper
form for the action requested, and to see that all required information is
submitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The City Clerk shall place the appeal form on the calendar for
hearing at the next meeting of the ZBA, and shall cause notice stating the
time, place, and object of the hearing to be served. Notice of the hearing
shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation not less than 15 days
before the date of the hearing. These notices shall be served personally or by
mail at least 15 days prior to the hearing upon the applicant or appellant, the
Zoning Administrator and the owners of record of property within 300 feet of
the premises in question, which notices, if by mail, shall be addressed to the
respective property owners of record at the address given in the last
assessment roll. In the event property immediately adjacent to the premises
shall be part of a different governmental subdivision, the owner of the
property shall nevertheless receive notice and shall be entitled to be heard.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â At the hearing, rules and procedures for the conduct of the hearing
as may be established in the bylaws of the ZBA shall be followed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Any party may be heard in person or by agent or attorney.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The ZBA may adjourn the hearing in order to permit the obtaining
of additional information or to cause any further notice as it deems proper to
be served upon other property owners as it decides may be interested in the
application or appeal. If the hearing is adjourned, persons previously notified
and persons already heard, need not be notified of the time of resumption of
the hearing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Following the hearing, the ZBA shall formulate its decision.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The ZBA shall consider the merits of the individual application
or appeal within the context of any and all standards and considerations
established in this chapter. In the case of variances, the standards of Â§
153.311 shall control.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The Zoning Board of Appeals may reverse or affirm, wholly or
part, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination of
issue, as in its opinion ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the
powers of the official or body of officials from whom the appeal was taken, and
may direct the issuance of a permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The written decision of the ZBA shall not be final until five
days after it is made unless the ZBA shall find the immediate effect of the
order is necessary for the preservation of property or personal rights, and
shall so certify on the record. In the written decision on the application or
appeal, the ZBA must include the reasons for decision and facts supporting
those reasons.
(1993 Code, Â§ 154.225) (Ord. 84-1, passed 1-3-1984)
Â§ 153.311 STANDARDS FOR VARIANCES.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the
way of carrying out the strict letter of this chapter, the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall have the power, in passing on appeals, to vary or modify any of
its rules, regulations, or provisions of this chapter, by granting variances
only when any of the following conditions of divisions (A)(1) and (2) exist:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Zoning requirements cannot be met by an existing lot or that the
physical topography inhibits the lawful location of a structure or its
accessories such as garage, sheds, and the like. If the Zoning Board of Appeals
finds that local requirements, as written, can be met, variance must be denied;
and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The hardship is unique and does not affect the entire surrounding
area. If it is found that the hardship is not unique, but common, there may be
cause for amending this chapter or the map.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â In addition to meeting any of the conditions of division (A)(1) or (2)
above, the appellant must show that a variance:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Will not be contrary to the public interest and it is not for a
self-made hardship;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Will not cause a substantially adverse effect upon adjacent
property values;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Will relate only to the property under control of the appellant;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Will not jeopardize the preservation of a substantial right,
although the spirit of the chapter shall be observed, public safety secured,
and substantial justice be done;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Will not adversely affect or diminish the purpose of this chapter;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Will not increase the hazard from fire, flood, or similar dangers;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Will not increase traffic congestion;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Will not produce nuisance conditions to occupants or nearby
premises, whether by reason of dust, noise, fumes, odor, vibrations, smoke, or
lights; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â Will not otherwise impair public health, safety, comfort, or
general welfare of the residents of the city.
(1993 Code, Â§ 154.226) (Ord. 84-1, passed 1-3-1984)
Â§ 153.312 VIOLATIONS.
Â Â Â Any building erected, moved, altered, razed, or converted, or any use of
land which is begun or changed subsequent to the effective date of this
chapter, or its amendment, and is in violation of any provision of this chapter
or the requirements thereof or any condition attached to a zoning approval,
occupancy permit, site plan, special use permit, decision of the ZBA, or a
variance, is hereby declared to be a public nuisance per se, and shall be
abated by any court of competent jurisdiction. Any person, corporation, or firm
who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with any
provision of this chapter or any condition attached to a zoning approval,
certificate of occupancy, special use permit, Zoning Board of Appeals decision,
or variance granted hereunder shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Notice shall be
given in writing by the Zoning Administrator and shall be served by registered
mail or personal service.

shall refer every proposed amendment, supplement, or change to the Planning
Commission for the holding of a required public hearing thereon and for review
and recommended action.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Planning Commission recommendation. The Planning Commission shall
consider each proposal for amendment in terms of its own judgment on particular
factors related to the individual proposal and in terms of the likely effect of
the proposal upon the Land Use Plan of the city. The Planning Commission may
recommend any additions or modifications to the original amendment proposal.
The Planning Commission shall transmit a written report with recommendation
within 60 days to the City Commission setting forth the reasons for the
acceptance, denial, or modification of the amendment proposal.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Action by City Commission. If the City Commission deems any amendment,
changes, additions or departures are advisable to the proposed text or district
boundaries recommended by the Planning Commission, it shall refer the same back
to the Planning Commission for a further report thereon within a time specified
by the City Commission. Before any amendments shall become effective, the City
Commission may on its own conduct a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
Thereafter, the City Commission may adopt the amendment with or without any
changes or may refer the same again to the Planning Commission for further
report.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Public hearing procedure and notification. For any required public
hearing conducted by the Planning Commission or any additional public hearings
by the City Commission on a proposed amendment to this chapter, the following
procedure and notice requirements shall apply.

affidavit of mailing shall be maintained.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If a change in zoning boundaries is proposed, notice shall also be
made by the City Clerk, with notification by first class mail to the person or
firm to whom the property is assessed, and to all persons or firms to whom
property within 300 feet is assessed. An affidavit of mailing shall be
maintained.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The owners of at least 20% of the area of land included in the
proposed change; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The owners of at least 20% of the area of land included within an
