their respective names. The taxes thus assessed shall become at once a debt to

on real property to the County Treasurer in the same manner as returns made by
township treasurers of State and County taxes. These returns shall be made on a
delinquent tax roll which the City Treasurer shall make in duplicate. This roll
shall include all the additional charges previously provided by this Charter.
The additional charges on the roll shall be added to the amount assessed
against each description in the roll. The taxes thus returned shall be
collected in the same manner as other taxes returned to the County Treasurer
are collected under the provisions of the general tax laws of the State, and

purposes of this chapter, "local vendors" are vendors with a business location

and submitted with the recommendations to Council.

more supplies or contractual services when the public interest will be served

awarded, shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder or submitter of
proposal. A contractor who is in default on the payment of taxes, license fees,
or other moneys due the City shall not be considered a lowest responsible
bidder. In determining lowest responsible bidder or submitter of proposal, the
purchasing agent and Council shall consider, in addition to price:
      (1)   The ability, capacity, and skill of the bidder or submitter of
proposal to perform the contract or provide the service required;
      (2)   Whether the bidder or submitter of proposal can perform the
contract or provide the service promptly, or within the time specified, without
delay or interference;
      (3)   The quality or performance of previous contract or services;
      (4)   The previous and existing compliance by the bidder or submitter of
proposal with laws and ordinances relating to the contract or service;
      (5)   The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the
bidder or submitter of proposal to perform the contract or provide the service;
      (6)   The ability to secure sufficient bonding and insurance as required;
      (7)   The quality, availability, and adaptability of the supplies or
contractual services to the particular use required;
      (8)   The ability of the bidder or submitter of proposal to provide
future maintenance and service for the use of the subject of the contract; and
      (9)   The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid or proposal.
   (c)   Tie Bids or Proposals.
      (1)   Local vendors. The City has a responsibility to its residents to
obtain the maximum value for each public dollar spent. Therefore, if two or
more bids or proposals received are for the same total amount or unit price,
quality and service being equal, the contract shall be awarded to a local
bidder or request submitter. If two or more local vendors have submitted equal
bids or requests for proposals, unit price, quality, and service being equal,
the award of the contract shall be to one of the bidders or proposal submitters
by drawing lots in public.
      (2)   Outside vendors. If there are no local bidders or submitters of
proposals, the award of the contract shall be to one of the bidders or proposal
submitters by drawing lots in public.
   (d)   Performance Bonds. The purchasing agent may require a prospective
contractor or supplier to post a performance bond before entering into a
contract with the City or at any time during the contract in such amount as
seems reasonably necessary to protect the best interests of the City.

are paid.

(Ord. 81-7. Passed 7-13-81.)
248.06 TENTATIVE DETERMINATION OF ASSESSMENT ROLL.
   Upon receipt of the report of the City Manager, if Council decides to

mailed by first-class mail to each property owner in the special assessment
district as shown by the current assessment rolls of the City at least ten days
prior to the time of the hearing, such notice to be mailed to the addresses
shown on the current assessment rolls of the City. Such notice shall state that
the plans, estimates of cost and special assessment rolls are on file with the
City Clerk.
(Ord. 81-7. Passed 7-13-81.)
248.08 HEARING.
   Council shall meet and hear objections to the public improvement, the
special assessment district and the special assessment roll therefor at the
time and place appointed or at an adjourned meeting thereof and shall consider
any objections thereto. Council may revise, correct or amend the plans, the
estimates of cost, the special assessment district or the special assessment
roll. If any changes are made which result in additions to the special
assessment district or increases in the special assessment roll, then a second

corrections as it may have made, if any, or may refer it back to the Assessor
for revision, or may annul it or any proceedings in connection therewith. If
the owners of more than one-half of the property to be assessed shall object in
writing to the improvement at or prior to the meeting of the Board of Review,
the assessment shall not be made without a four-fifths vote of the members of
the Council. The City Clerk shall endorse the date of confirmation upon each
special assessment roll.
(Ord. 81-7. Passed 7-13-81; Ord. 2003-05. Passed 1-27-03.)

(Ord. 81-7. Passed 7-13-81; Ord. 2003-13. Passed 3-24-03.)
248.10 HAZARDS AND NUISANCES.
   When any lot, building or structure, because of the accumulation of refuse
or debris, the uncontrolled growing of weeds, the accumulation of ice or snow
or the failure to maintain sidewalks, or because of age or dilapidation or
because of any other condition or happening, becomes a public hazard or
nuisance which is detrimental to the health or safety of the inhabitants of the
City, or of those residing or habitually going near such lot, building or
structure, Council may order such hazard or nuisance abated and the cost of
such abatement assessed as a single lot assessment against the lot, premises or
description of real property upon which such hazard or nuisance was located.
(Ord. 81-7. Passed 7-13-81.)
248.11 SINGLE LOT ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE.
   When any expense is incurred by the City upon or with respect to any
separate or single lot, parcel of land or premises, which, by the provisions of
this chapter, Council may charge and collect as a single lot special assessment
against the same, and which is not of that class of special assessments
required to be made pro rata upon several lots or parcels of land in a special
assessment district, an account of the labor or services for which such expense
was incurred, verified by the officer or person performing the labor or
services, or causing the same to be done, shall be reported to Council in the
manner it prescribes. The accounting reported to Council shall include a
description of the lot or premises on or in respect to which the expense was
incurred, the name of the owner or person chargeable therewith and the cost of
labor or services performed. The provisions of the preceding sections of this
chapter, with reference to pro rata special assessments generally and the
proceedings necessary before making the improvement, shall not apply to single
lot assessments contemplated in this section. Council, after review of the
single lots assessment account, shall determine what amount or part of every
such reported expense shall be charged and the premises upon which the same
shall be levied as a single lot special assessment. As often as Council may
deem it expedient, it shall require all of the several amounts so reported and
determined and the several lots or premises chargeable therewith, respectively,
to be reported by the City Clerk to the Assessor who shall spread such amounts
against the real property chargeble therewith on the next tax roll for the
collection of general City taxes.
(Ord. 81-7. Passed 7-13-81.)
248.12 CREATION OF LIEN; INSTALLMENTS; INTEREST.
   Upon the confirmation of each special assessment roll, the special
assessments will become a debt to the City owed by the persons to whom they are
assessed and shall, until paid, be a lien upon the property assessed for the
amount of such assessments and all interest and charges thereon. Such lien
shall be of the same character and effect as created by the City Charter for
City taxes.
   Special assessments shall become due on such date as Council prescribes.
   Any assessment may be made payable in not more than thirty annual
installments. The initial installment shall be due on such date as Council
prescribes. Subsequent annual installments shall be spread on the annual City
tax roll. The second installment shall be collected as part of the first City
tax roll which becomes due six months or more after the date of the initial
installment. All unpaid future installments, from such date as Council
prescribes, shall bear interest at a rate not exceeding six percent per year,
which interest computed to the following September 1 shall be spread yearly
upon the City tax roll together, as one item, with the amount of the
installment then being spread. Council may provide for advance payment of
unpaid installments with interest computed to such date as Council prescribes.
   Each special assessment, or the initial installment of each assessment when
installment payments are provided for, shall be collected by the Treasurer
without a collection fee for a period ending on the last day of the second
month following the month in which the assessment or initial installment falls
due. On the first day of the third month following each due date, the Treasurer
shall add to such assessment or initial installment a collection fee of four
percent of the amount thereof and on the first day of each succeeding month he
or she shall add an additional one-half of one percent collection fee. All
collection fees shall belong to the City and be collectible in the same manner
as a collection fee on City taxes.
   Special assessments or initial installments which become due other than on
July 1 shall, if unpaid for thirty days or more, on May 1 of each year be
certified as delinquent to Council by the Treasurer and Council shall place
such delinquent assessments on the tax roll for that year together with accrued
collection fees to September 1 of such year.
   Special assessments or installments thereof which become due on July 1 of
any year, and delinquent assessments together with accrued interest and
collection fees thereon which have been placed on the City tax roll, shall be
collected in all respects as are City taxes due on such date and shall be
returned to the County Treasurer with such taxes, if unpaid, on the following
March 1.
   Any proceedings for special assessment underway, or completed, upon the
effective date of this section (Ordinance 82-8, passed June 14, 1982), if in
conformity with this section, are hereby validated, ratified and confirmed.
(Ord. 82-8. Passed 6-14-82; Ord. 2003-07. Passed 1-27-03.)
248.13 COLLECTION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
   Whenever any special assessment roll is confirmed and payable, Council shall
direct the City Clerk to transmit such assessment roll to the Treasurer for
collection. The Treasurer shall mail statements of the assessments to the
respective owners of the lots and parcels of land assessed, as indicated by the
records of the Assessor, stating the amount of the assessment and the manner in
which it may be paid. Failure to mail any such statement shall not invalidate
the assessment or entitle the owner to an extension of time within which to pay
the assessment.
(Ord. 81-7. Passed 7-13-81.)
248.14 PAYMENT; INTEREST AND FEES.
   After the expiration of any period provided by Council for payment without
interest or fees, any installment may be discharged by paying the face amount
thereof together with fees and interest thereon from the date of confirmation
to the date of payment, except that if the public improvement has been financed
by the sale of noncallable bonds or other evidences of indebtedness which are
not prepayable, then the interest shall be computed from the date of
confirmation to the date upon which such installment would have fallen due had
it not been prepaid.
(Ord. 81-7. Passed 7-13-81.)
248.15 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.
   Each special assessment shall be collected by the Treasurer with the same
rights and remedies as provided in the City Charter for the collection of
taxes, except as otherwise herein provided. All collection fees shall belong to
the City and be collectible in the same manner as the collection fee for City
taxes.
(Ord. 81-7. Passed 7-13-81.)
248.16 COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENT.
   Upon completion of the improvement, the financing thereof and the payment of
the cost thereof, the City Clerk shall certify to Council the total cost of
such improvement together with the amount of the original roll for such
improvement.
(Ord. 81-7. Passed 7-13-81.)
248.17 ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS.
   Should the assessments on any special assessment roll, including the amount
assessed to the City at large, prove insufficient for any reason to pay the
cost of the improvement for which they were made, Council may make additional
pro rata assessments to supply the deficiency against the City and the several
lots and parcels of land in the same ratio as the original assessments, but the
total amount assessed against any lot or parcel of land shall not exceed the
value of the benefits received from such improvement.
(Ord. 81-7. Passed 7-13-81.)
248.18 REFUNDS.
   Should the special assessment or the proceeds of sale of any special
assessment bonds prove larger than necessary to meet the costs of the
improvement, or to meet the principal and interest requirements of any special
assessment bonds and expenses incidental thereto, the excess shall be placed in
the City Treasury. If such excess is more than five percent, the excess shall
be returned pro rata according to assessments, except as otherwise provided in
Section
248.20. No refunds may be made which contravene the provisions of any evidence
of indebtedness secured in whole or in part by such special assessment.
(Ord. 81-7. Passed 7-13-81.)
248.19 DIVISION OF PARCELS.
   Should any lot or land be divided after a special assessment thereon has
been confirmed and divided into installments, the Assessor shall apportion the
uncollected amounts upon the several lots and lands so divided and shall enter
the several amounts as amendments upon the special assessment roll. The
Treasurer shall, within ten days after such apportionment, send notice of such
action to the persons concerned at their last known address by first-class
mail. Such apportionment shall be final and conclusive on all parties unless
protest in writing is received by the Treasurer within twenty days of the
mailing of such notice.
(Ord. 81-7. Passed 7-13-81.)
248.20 REASSESSMENT FOR BENEFITS.
   Whenever Council deems any special assessment invalid or defective, or
whenever a court adjudges an assessment to be illegal in whole or in part,
Council may cause a new assessment to be levied for the same purpose, whether
or not the improvement or any part thereof has been completed or any part of
the special assessment collected. All proceedings on such reassessment and the
collection thereof shall be conducted in the same manner as provided for the
original assessment. If any portion of the original special assessment is
collected and not refunded, it shall be applied upon the reassessment, and the
reassessment shall, to that extent, be deemed satisfied. If more than the
amount reassessed is collected, the balance shall be refunded to the person
making such payment.
(Ord. 81-7. Passed 7-13-81.)
248.21 JUDGMENT FOR BENEFITS.
   If, in any action, it appears that, by reason of any irregularity or
informality, the assessment has not been properly made against the person
assessed or upon the lot or premises sought to be charged, the court may
nevertheless, on satisfactory proof that expense has been incurred by the City
which is a proper charge against the person assessed or the lot or premises in
question, render judgment for the amount properly chargeable against such
person or upon such lot or premises.
(Ord. 81-7. Passed 7-13-81.)
248.22 ADDITIONAL PROCEDURE.
   If the provisions of this chapter are insufficient to carry into full effect
the making of any improvement or the special assessment therefor, Council may
provide any additional steps or procedure required to effect such improvement
by special assessment in the resolution declaring the determination of Council
to make such improvement in the first instance.
(Ord. 81-7. Passed 7-13-81.)

252.04.      COST RECOVERY AUTHORIZATION AND PROCEDURE.

parties jointly or severally.
   (b)   The City Manager or designee shall determine the total assessable
costs and shall, in consultation with other personnel involved in responding to
a public safety or fire emergency incident determine whether to assess any, all
or part of such costs against any of the responsible parties. In making such
determination, the following may be considered:
      (1)   The total assessable costs;
      (2)   The risk the public safety or fire emergency incident imposed on
the City, its residents and their property;
      (3)   Whether there was any injury or damage to person or property;
      (4)   Whether the public safety or fire emergency required evacuation;

set forth in the cost recovery schedule.
   (d)   The City Manager or designee may allocate assessable costs among and
between responsible parties, including allocating all or some of such costs
jointly and severally against more than one responsible party regardless of
whether a responsible party has other legal liability therefor or is legally at
fault.
   (e)   If the City Manager or designee determines not to assess all or a part
of assessable costs against a responsible party, such determination shall not
in any way limit or extinguish the liability of the responsible party to other
parties.
(Ord. 2005-10. Passed 1-9-06.)
252.05.      BILLING AND COLLECTION OF ASSESSABLE COSTS.
   (a)   After determining to assess assessable costs against a responsible
party, the City of Davison shall prepare and mail an itemized invoice to the

thirty (30) days after the date of billing shall have imposed a late charge
thereon that shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted by law until said
account shall be paid in full.
   (b)   If a responsible party shall appeal assessable costs, such costs, if
upheld, in whole or in part, shall be due and payable thirty (30) days from the
date of determination of the appeal and any late payment fees shall apply
thereafter.
   (c)   Any additional expense that becomes known following the transmittal of
the bill to the responsible party shall be billed in the same manner on a
subsequent bill to the responsible party.
(Ord. 2005-10. Passed 1-9-06.)
252.06.      NO ADMISSION OF LIABILITY.
   The payment of expenses determined to be due and owing under this chapter
does not constitute an admission of liability or negligence in any criminal
action or any other action for damages.
(Ord 2005-10. Passed 1-9-06.)
252.07.      SEVERABILITY.
   Should any provision of this chapter be declared by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the same shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of any other provision or part, which shall remain
in full force and effect. Further, if there is any conflict between the
provisions of this chapter and the provisions of Part 201 of the Natural
Resources and Environmental Protection Act (MCL 324.20101 et seq.) (NREPA), the
provisions of the NREPA shall take precedence and the provisions of this
chapter in conflict therewith shall be deemed non-enforceable, but only to the
extent to avoid said conflict.

the City or have an office within the City limits. Each member of the
Construction Board of Appeals should have at least five years of professional

concurrence, are qualified with experience and training to pass upon pertinent
matters.
   (b)   Such members shall be appointed for terms three years except that the
initial appointments shall provide for one three-year term, two two-year terms,
and two one-year terms so that subsequent appointments shall not occur at the
same time.

Board of Appeals may be determined periodically by the City Council.
(Ord. 2008-04. Passed 7-14-08.)
294.03 QUORUM, VOTES NECESSARY FOR DECISION.
   A majority of the members of the Construction Board of Appeals shall
constitute a quorum. A majority of the members is required to take action on
all matters not of an administrative nature, but a majority of a quorum may
deal with administrative matters.
(Ord. 2008-04. Passed 7-14-08.)
294.04 SECRETARY; MINUTES OF MEETINGS; RECORDS OF HEARINGS.
   (a)   The City Manger, or his or her designee, shall serve as secretary of

minutes of the meetings shall be in writing, but may state the substance of any
matter considered.
   (b)   Official records of all hearings shall be prepared to include the

      (1)   Notices, pleadings, motions, and intermediate rulings.
      (2)   Questions and offers of proof, objections, and rulings thereon.
      (3)   Evidence presented.
      (4)   Matters officially noticed (except matters so obvious that a

      (5)   Findings and exceptions.
      (6)   Decisions and reasons for the decision.
(Ord. 2008-04. Passed 7-14-08.)
294.05 GENERAL POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (a)   The Construction Board of Appeals shall act as a quasi-judicial body
in deciding matters brought before it which involve interpretation of any
provision of the City's building, plumbing, mechanical, electrical, and fire
codes. The Construction Board of Appeals shall also act as an advisory board to
the City Council. The Construction Board of Appeals shall have the following
powers and duties:
      (1)   To provide for reasonable interpretation of the provisions of the
City building codes, plumbing codes, mechanical codes, electrical codes, and
fire codes. The Construction Board of Appeals shall have no authority to waive
requirements of any City codes.
      (2)   To hear and decide appeals from and review any order, requirement,
decision or determination made by an administrative official charged with the
enforcement of the City building, plumbing, mechanical, electrical and fire
codes.
      (3)   To approve alternate materials and methods of installation.
      (4)   To do acts, make decisions and make such determinations as
authorized by State law or the Davison City Code.
      (5)   After a public hearing, the Construction Board of Appeals may grant
a specific variance to a substantive requirement of the codes, if the literal
application of the substantive requirement would result in exceptional
practical difficulty to the applicant, and if both of the following
requirements are satisfied:
         A.   The performance of the particular item or part of the building or
structure with respect to which the variance is granted shall be adequate for
its intended use and shall not substantially deviate from performance required
by the code of the particular item or part for the health, safety, and welfare
of the people of the City and the intent of the code is observed, public safety
secured and substantial justice done.
         B.   The specific condition justifying the variance shall be neither
so general nor recurrent in nature as to make an amendment to the code with
respect to the condition reasonably practical or desirable.
   (b)   The Construction Board of Appeals may attach in writing any condition
in connection with the granting of a variance that, in its judgment, is
necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the people of the City.
The breach of a condition shall automatically invalidate the variance and any
permit, license, and certificate granted on the basis of it. In no case shall
more than the minimum variance from the code be granted that is necessary to
alleviate the exceptional practical difficulty.
(Ord. 2008-04. Passed 7-14-08.)
294.06 PROCEDURE FOR APPEALS TO THE CONSTRUCTION BOARD OF APPEALS.

chapter. The appellant shall file, with the official from whose decision the
appeal is taken and with the Construction Board of Appeals, a notice of appeal,

to all interested parties. The Construction Board of Appeals shall hear such
matter and decide the same not later than thirty days after submission of the
appeal. Failure by the Construction Board of Appeals to hear an appeal and file
a decision within the time limit shall be deemed a denial of the appeal, for
the purposes of instituting an appeal to the State Construction Code Commission
or circuit court.
   (b)   Within the limits of its jurisdiction, as prescribed in this chapter,
the Construction Board of Appeals may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part,
or may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as, in its
opinion, ought to be made in the premises, and to that end shall have all the
powers of the official from whom the appeal is taken. The final disposition of
such appeal shall be in writing and shall state the grounds therefor and shall
be forthwith delivered to the appellant at his last known address.
(Ord. 2008-04. Passed 7-14-08.)
294.07 REQUEST FOR INTERPRETATION, APPROVAL OF MATERIALS, ETC.

400.05 STATE OF SNOW EMERGENCY.
   "State of snow emergency" means either a limited snow emergency or a full
snow emergency, defined as follows:
   (a)   A limited snow emergency is a temporary measure necessary to ensure
that snow and ice are removed from City streets, City parking lots and the
sidewalks around the Municipal complex. In a limited snow emergency, which may
be imposed by the City Manager's office, the Police Department may remove
vehicles that affect snow and ice removal and City employees and/or residents
may be utilized to facilitate snow and ice removal as necessary. A limited snow
emergency is to be imposed only for the removal of snow and ice that would
affect the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City and differs
from a full snow emergency.
   (b)   A full snow emergency is that state which is obtained when snow and
ice have not been effectively removed and, as a result thereof, vehicular
traffic through the City is not possible. At such times, therefore, the travel
by specially designed and specifically made vehicles is essential to preserve
the health, education, safety and welfare of the residents of the City.
(Ord. 2002-02. Passed 2-25-02.)
400.06 CITY MANAGER TO BE TRAFFIC ENGINEER.
   The City Manager is hereby appointed Traffic Engineer for the City, with all

400.07 LOADING ZONES; PERMITS; FEES.
   Any person may make application, in writing, for a loading zone space, to
the Chief of Police on prescribed forms. The Chief of Police shall have the
authority to grant, refuse or modify the application and, if granted, may at
any time further limit or withdraw the permit at his or her discretion. The
applicant, upon receipt of the permit for a loading zone, shall pay to the City
Clerk a service fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) or the total cost for the
installation, whichever is greater, of two designatory signs. The service fee
is not refundable after the installation is made even though the permit is
withdrawn. A loading zone shall not be established in an existing prohibited
zone unless confined to a recessed area.
(Ord. 2002-02. Passed 2-25-02.)
400.08 TRAFFIC RESOLUTIONS.
   Council shall adopt traffic resolutions establishing no parking zones, stop
signs, yield signs, speed limits, crosswalks, loading zones, one-way streets
and alleys and other similar regulations upon concurrence with the
recommendations of the Traffic Engineer. The passage of such resolutions shall
be authorized for the erection of necessary signs and/or traffic control
devices appropriate to each given instance. Existing traffic resolutions
adopted under authority of previous Traffic Code(s) of the City shall remain in
effect until rescinded by specific action of Council.
(Ord. 2002-02. Passed 2-25-02.)
400.09 OBSTRUCTIONS AND HAZARDS ON STREETS AND SIDEWALKS.
   (a)   All persons in possession of any premises which abut or are adjacent
to any public sidewalk shall remove all snow and ice from such sidewalks within
a reasonable time after a snowfall or the formation of ice.
   (b)   No person shall, by any act or failure to act, allow water or any
liquid capable of freezing to drain onto any public sidewalk, street, alley or
parking area during the months of November, December, January, February and
March.
   (c)   No person shall pile, dump or place snow, ice or any other material
upon any sidewalk, public street or other place so as to create a safety hazard
to the residents of the City.
(Ord. 2002-02. Passed 2-25-02.)
400.10 DISPLAY OF ADVERTISING OR OTHER UNOFFICIAL SIGNS PROHIBITED WITHIN
RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   No person shall place, maintain or display within the right-of-way of any
highway, street or other public way any advertising or other unofficial sign,
except as provided for herein, without first obtaining a permit therefor from
the Chief of Police. Such permit may be granted by the Chief of Police only
when such sign will not obscure the view of on-coming cross traffic to the
driver of any vehicle crossing or entering the highway, street or other public
way in which such sign is displayed from any semi-public, commercial or private
driveway. For the purposes of this section, any sign which prevents a clear
view of on-coming cross traffic for 500 feet in either direction by the driver
of a motor vehicle legally stopped, with its front bumper even with the edge of
the right-of-way of the highway, street or other public way on which such sign
is displayed, shall be deemed to obscure the view.
(Ord. 2002-02. Passed 2-25-02.)
400.11 NON-OBSCURED VIEW REQUIRED AT CORNER LOTS.
   No person shall place, erect, plant or maintain any sign, fence, wall,
hedge, shrub, tree or other thing between the minimum building setback line and
the edge of the right-of-way of any highway, street or other public way on a
corner lot in such a location as will obscure the view of on-coming cross
traffic to the driver of any vehicle crossing or entering the highway, street
or other public way from any semi-private or commercial driveway which shall be
deemed to create a corner lot for the purposes of this section. For the
purposes of this section, any sign, fence, wall, hedge, shrub, tree or other
thing which prevents a clear view of on-coming cross traffic for 500 feet in
either direction by the driver of a motor vehicle legally stopped with its
front bumper even with the edge of the right-of-way of the highway, street or
other public way, shall be deemed to obscure the view. However, nothing in this
section shall be construed to require the alteration of the natural grade of
the land without due process of law even though such natural grade may result
in an obscured view across a corner lot as defined herein.
(Ord. 2002-02. Passed 2-25-02.)
400.12 CROSSWALKS MAY BE CLOSED.
   Crosswalks may be closed to pedestrian traffic in order to promote the safe
and orderly flow of traffic, upon resolution by Council. Any person crossing a
street or other public way at a closed crosswalk shall be deemed to be
jaywalking.
(Ord. 2002-02. Passed 2-25-02.)
400.13 CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOLIC LIQUOR ON A HIGHWAY, PUBLIC PLACE OR AREA
GENERALLY ACCESSIBLE TO MOTOR VEHICLES, INCLUDING AN AREA DESIGNATED FOR
PARKING OF VEHICLES; VIOLATION PUNISHABLE AS A MISDEMEANOR.

alley or any public or private property which is open to the general public and
which is not licensed to sell alcoholic liquor for consumption on the premises,
or within the passenger compartment of a moving vehicle upon a public highway,
or in any place open to the general public or generally accessible to motor
vehicles, including an area designated for the parking of vehicles in the City.
   (b)   A person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor,
punishable by a term of imprisonment for not more than 90 days and a fine of
not more than $100.00 or both.
(Ord. 2002-02. Passed 2-25-02.)
400.14 PARADES AND PROCESSIONS; PERMITS.
   (a)   No procession or parade shall occupy, march or proceed along any
street except in accordance with a permit issued by authority of Council and
such other regulations as are set forth herein which may apply.
   (b)   Application for the permit shall be made to the office of the City
Clerk. The applicant must state the date, time, place and itinerary of the
proposed parade or procession. The Police Department is hereby authorized to
impose reasonable and necessary regulations to protect the interests of the
public.
(Ord. 2002-02. Passed 2-25-02.)
400.15 PARKING ON LAWN EXTENSION OR PARKWAY.
   No person shall drive upon, park or stand any vehicle between the curb or
curb line and the lot line nearest the street, such area being commonly known
as the lawn extension or parkway, whether or not any sidewalk or curb is
actually in place on such street.
(Ord. 2002-02. Passed 2-25-02.)
400.16 PARKING ON ALL STREETS PROHIBITED AT CERTAIN HOURS.
   There shall be no parking on any City street between the hours of 2:00 a.m.

   (a)   No person shall operate a snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle (ATV) in
the City on any street or highway or upon any sidewalk, parkway or island
situated within any divided or other roadway unless a state of snow emergency,
as defined in Section
400.05, has been declared by the City Manager or the Chief of Police.
   (b)   No person shall operate a snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle (ATV) in
the City in any public park or on any public grounds unless the surface of the
soil is firmly frozen, and then only on designated snowmobile trails or in
designated snowmobile areas within such park or grounds. The City Manager shall
have the authority to authorize exceptions to this division by posting signs
indicating such exceptions when, in his or her opinion, no damage to City
property will result.
   (c)   No person shall operate a snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle (ATV)
within the City upon or across any private property without the written
permission of the owner or his or her agent in advance of such operation.
   (d)   No person shall operate a snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle (ATV)

within the City, except on private property with permission as provided for
herein, while towing any sled, toboggan, skier, or any other snow vehicle or
other conveyance or device, unless such towed vehicle is designated for such
use and is attached to the snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle (ATV) by means of
a hitch mechanism designed and manufactured for such purpose.
   (f)   No person shall operate a snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle (ATV)
within the City in such a manner as to endanger the life or property of
another, in such a manner as to emit radio frequency electromagnetic radiation
such as to cause radio frequency interference to normal radio or television, or
in such a manner as to constitute a nuisance by reason of excessive noise or
otherwise.
(Ord. 2002-02. Passed 2-25-02.)
400.18 FIRE LANES.

caused damage by trespassing on the property of a person who is not the owner.

   (a)   Declaration of Nuisance. All species and varieties of elm trees (trees
of genus elmus) infected with the fungus known as Dutch elm disease
(certostomella Ulmi), as determined by laboratory analysis by the Michigan
Department of Agriculture, are hereby declared to be a public nuisance. All
species and varieties of elm trees that are dead or substantially dead and all
dead elm wood to which the bark is still attached, which, because of their
condition, may serve as a breeding place for the European elm bark beetle
(Scolytusmultistriatus), and the native elm bark beetle (Hylurgopinusrufites),
or any other carrier of such disease, are hereby declared to be public
nuisances.
   (b)   Abatement of Nuisance by Owner. No owner of any lot or parcel of land
in the City shall permit or maintain on any such lot or parcel of land any dead
elm wood or elm tree which is a public nuisance, as defined in subsection (a)
hereof. It shall be the duty of the owner to promptly remove and burn any such
elm tree or dead elm wood under the supervision and direction of the City
Manager.
   (c)   Inspections. The City Manager is hereby authorized to enter upon any
lot or parcel of land in the City at any reasonable hour for the purpose of
inspecting any elm trees or dead elm wood situated thereon and may remove such
specimens from any such trees as are required for the purposes of laboratory
analysis, or to determine whether or not such tree, because it is dead, or
substantially dead, may serve as a breeding place for any carrier of Dutch elm
disease. No person shall take any action to prevent the City Manager from
entering on any lot or parcel of land in the City for the purpose of such
inspection or interfere with the City Manager in the performance of any of his
or her duties provided for in this subsection.
   (d)   Notice to Owner to Abate; City's Remedy for Noncompliance. If, as a
result of a laboratory analysis of specimens removed from any elm tree by the
City Manager, it is determined that such tree is a public nuisance, as provided
in this section, or if the City Manager determines that any dead or
substantially dead elm tree or dead elm wood is a public nuisance, as provided
in this section, the City Manager shall serve or cause to be served upon the
owner of record of the parcel of land on which such tree or dead elm wood is
located, a written notice requiring such owner to comply with the provisions of
this section. If any person, upon whom such notice is served, fails, neglects
or refuses to remove such elm tree or dead elm wood and to destroy the same by
burning, within ten days after service of such notice, the City Manager may
proceed to remove and burn such tree or dead elm wood and assess the cost
thereof against the owner of such lot or parcel of land and the amount of such
cost shall be paid by the owner to the City. Such notice shall be served in the
manner prescribed in Section
202.04 of the Administration Code.
   (e)   Payment of Cost. If the City removes from any lot or parcel of land in
the City, any infected, dead or substantially dead elm tree or dead elm wood,
which is a public nuisance as provided by this section, the assessment of the
cost of the work done by the City against the owner of the lot or parcel of
land involved shall be in addition to the penalties imposed in Section

The cost shall be assessed in the manner prescribed in

laws and rules promulgated by the State of Michigan and the City of Davison
regarding medical marihuana. Nothing in this chapter is intended to provide any
approvals, permits or licenses for any other type of establishments other than
those specifically designated as permitted by ordinance.
   (c)   By accepting a permit issued pursuant to this chapter, the holder
waives and releases the City, its officers and employees from any liability for
injuries, damages or liabilities of any kind that result from the arrest or
prosecution of marihuana establishment owners, operators, employees, clients or
customers for a violation of state or federal laws, rules or regulations.
Further, the holder agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, its
officers, elected officials, employees and insurers against all liability,
claims or demands, including, but not limited to, arising as a result of any
claim of diminution of property value by a property owner whose property is
located in proximity to a permitted marihuana establishment, arising out of,

a marihuana establishment.

of any marihuana establishment in the City. Compliance with any applicable
state law or regulation shall be deemed an additional requirement for issuance

applicable state law or regulation shall be grounds for revocation or
suspension of any permit issued hereunder.

permit inspections or are denied access by the applicant or permit holder;
      (6)   The applicant or permit holder, or his or her agent, manager or

   (a)   Adopt regulations consistent with the Act and the FCC Rules with
respect to basic cable service rate regulation; and
   (b)   Prescribe procedures to provide a reasonable opportunity for
consideration of the views of interested parties in connection with basic cable
service rate regulation by the City.
   This chapter shall be implemented and interpreted consistent with the Act
and the FCC Rules.
(Ord. 93-5. Passed 9-13-93.)
816.09 COMPLIANCE WITH FCC RULES.
   In connection with the regulation of rates for basic cable service and

(Ord. 93-5. Passed 9-13-93.)
816.10 FILING OF RATE SCHEDULES OR INCREASES BY OPERATORS; ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION; BURDEN OF PROOF.
   (a)   A cable operator shall submit its schedule of rates for the basic
service tier and associated equipment or a proposed increase in such rates in
accordance with the Act and the FCC Rules. The cable operator shall include, as
part of its submission, such information as is necessary to show that its
schedule of rates or its proposed increase in rates complies with the Act and
the FCC Rules. The cable operator shall file ten copies of the schedule of
rates or proposed increase in such rates with the City Clerk. For purposes of
this chapter, the filing of the cable operator shall be deemed to have been
made when at least ten copies have been received by the City Clerk. Council
may, by resolution or otherwise, adopt rules and regulations prescribing the
information, data and calculations which must be included as part of the cable
operator's filing of the schedule of rates or proposed increase in such rates.
   (b)   In addition to information and data required by rules and regulations
of the City adopted pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, a cable operator shall
provide all information requested by the City Manager in connection with the
City's review and regulation of existing rates for the basic service tier and
associated equipment or a proposed increase in such rates. The City Manager may

proprietary information is submitted, a cable operator may request that
specific, identified portions of its response be treated as confidential and
withheld from public disclosure. The request must state the reason why the
information should be treated as proprietary and the facts that support such
reason. The request for confidentiality will be granted if the City determines
that the preponderance of the evidence shows that nondisclosure is consistent
with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 USC 552. The City
shall place in a public file for inspection any decision that results in
information being withheld. If the cable operator requests confidentiality and
the request is denied:
      (1)   Where the cable operator is proposing a rate increase, it may
withdraw the proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary information will
be returned to it; or
      (2)   The cable operator may seek review within five working days of the
denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the information will be stayed
pending review.
   (b)   Any interested party may file a request to inspect material withheld
as proprietary with the City. The City shall weigh the policy considerations
favoring nondisclosure against the reasons cited for permitting inspection in
light of the facts of the particular case. It will then promptly notify the
requesting entity and the cable operator that submitted the information as to
the disposition of the request. It may grant, deny or condition a request. The
requesting party or the cable operator may seek review of the decision by
filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Disclosure will be stayed pending
resolution of any appeal.
   (c)   The procedures set forth in this section shall be construed as
analogous to, and consistent with, the rules of the FCC regarding requests for
confidentiality, including, without limitation, 47 CFR 0.459.

870.01 TRANSIENT MERCHANT DEFINED; EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   As used in this chapter, "transient merchant" means a person who
engages temporarily in the retail sale of goods, wares or merchandise in the
City and who, for the purpose of conducting such business, occupies a lot,
building, room or structure of any kind.
   (b)   "Transient merchant" shall not be construed to mean, and the
provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to apply to, a person selling
goods, wares or merchandise of any description raised, produced or manufactured
by the individual offering the same for sale, or to persons handling
vegetables, fruits or perishable farm products at an established City market,
nor shall the provisions of this chapter apply to governmental, charitable,
religious, benevolent, eleemosynary or other nonprofit groups, organizations or
other entities, or bona fide representatives of the same, so long as the
proceeds from such sales inure to the benefit of such group, organization or
other entity, nor shall they apply to a person whose principal place of
business, being a bona fide and lawful business, is, and has been for a period
of at least six months previously, in the City, and who conducts or in any way
participates in a sidewalk or similar sale.
870.02 LICENSE REQUIRED.
   No person, either as principal or agent, shall engage in business as a
transient merchant in the City without first obtaining a license from Council.
870.03 APPLICATION FOR LICENSE.
   An application for the license required by Section
870.02 shall be made in writing to Council and filed with the City Clerk. Such
application shall give the full name of the applicant, his or her residence,
the place where he or she intends to do business, the kind of business and the

   (a)   Upon receipt of the application provided for in Section
870.03, Council, before acting upon it, may refer the same for investigation to
an officer of the City, who shall report to Council within a reasonable time.
If, upon receiving such application, upon receipt of such report after referral
of the application, Council is satisfied that the business to be conducted by
the applicant is not intended to cheat or defraud the public, it shall grant
such license to the applicant.
   (b)   Before the license is issued, the applicant shall deposit five hundred
dollars ($500.00) with the City Treasurer and shall pay to the City Clerk a fee
equal to one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month for the length of time for
which such license is to be issued. If the license is to be used for less than
one month, the fee therefor shall be at the rate of ten dollars ($10.00) per
day for the period of such license. A surety company bond in a like amount may
be deposited with the Treasurer in lieu of a cash deposit, provided, however,
that a special license may be issued by the Clerk in a case where the applicant
is a transient merchant conducting business, including the sale of food, in
connection with a licensed circus, carnival or outdoor show and, in that event,
upon receiving a fee of five dollars ($5.00) for each day scheduled by such
licensed circus, carnival or outdoor show, and upon the registration of such
applicant's fingerprints with the Police Department, the Clerk may issue such a

carnival or outdoor show.

   Deposits made with the City Treasurer as required by Section
870.04(b) are subject to claims of creditors in a case where a judgment has
been obtained against the transient merchant in any court in the State and the
time of appealing such judgment has expired. In such a case garnishment
proceedings may be commenced in such court against the Treasurer. It shall
thereupon be the duty of the Treasurer to remit to any such court any balance
of such cash deposit remaining in his or her hands not exceeding the amount of
such judgment for the purpose of satisfying the same. Any balance of the
deposit remaining in the hands of the Treasurer four months after the
expiration of the license shall be remitted to the transient merchant, provided
that if at such date, the Treasurer has received notice of any suit then
pending against such transient merchant, the deposit shall not be returned
until sixty days after the termination of such suit.
870.06 LICENSE VOIDED BY EXHAUSTION OF DEPOSIT.
   A license issued under this chapter shall be void as soon as the deposit
made with the City Treasurer, as provided for in Section
870.04(b), has been exhausted because of garnishment suits as mentioned in
Section
870.05.
870.07 REVOCATION OF LICENSE.
   A license issued under this chapter may be revoked by Council at any time
for a violation of a law of the State or a rule, regulation or ordinance of the

notice and opportunity to be heard.

to complete the colocation within the applicable time, the permit is void, and
the wireless provider may reapply for a permit. This time period may be
extended by the mutual agreement of the City and the applicant.
   (c)   The City may propose an alternate location within the right-of-way or
on property or structures owned or controlled by the City within seventy-five
feet of the proposed location to either place the new utility pole or colocate
on an existing structure.
The applicant shall use the alternate location if, as determined by the
applicant, the applicant has the right to do so on reasonable terms and
conditions and the alternate location does not impose unreasonable technical
limits or significant additional costs. The City may request written
confirmation of any decision rendered by the applicant under this subsection
and the specific basis for the same.
   (d)   The City may require a separate right-of-way access permit for work
that will unreasonably affect traffic patterns or obstruct vehicular or
pedestrian traffic in the right-of-way.
   (e)   (1)   As a condition of the issuance of a permit, the applicant shall
obtain and maintain a bond, in the amount of not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) per small cell wireless facility, in a form reasonably satisfactory

utility poles, or wireless support structures in the ROW and to return the ROW
to its functional equivalent before the damage.
         C.   To recoup rates or fees that have not been paid by a wireless
provider in more than twelve months, if the wireless provider has received
sixty-day advance notice from the City of the noncompliance.
      (2)   The City shall not require a cash bond, unless the wireless
provider has failed to obtain or maintain a bond required under this section or
its surety has defaulted or failed to perform on a bond given to the City on
behalf of a wireless provider.
   (f)   A small cell wireless facility for which a permit is issued shall be
labeled with the name of the wireless provider, emergency contact telephone

wireless provider's technology. Any such design or concealment measures are not
included in size restrictions in the definition of small wireless facility.
   (c)   Aesthetics Requirements. Wireless providers shall install, modify,
collocate or otherwise provide all wireless facilities, equipment, poles,
support structures and all other related wireless objects in a manner, size and
appearance that is consistent and in conformity with the existing requirements
and existing practices in fact, pertaining to such districts as defined by the
applicable ordinances, rules and codes of this community and the applicable
rules and laws of this State, in such fashion as to create the least negative
impact on the district as possible. Such accommodations may include use of
similar height, materials, color, design, number and appearance of other
similar structures utilized by other occupiers of the rights-of-way and public
spaces.
      (1)   Collocation including replacement of existing poles or support
structures is strongly encouraged over the installation of additional new poles
or support structures in the right-of-way.

            Underground (commercial and then residential)
            Environmentally sensitive areas including nature and wetland
preservation sites
   (d)   Disagreements as between the provider and community on specific
aesthetics issues shall be addressed by the Council upon timely written request
of the provider. The City may consider incentives favoring installations in
preferred districts.
   (e)   Damage to right-of-way. All wireless providers shall repair all damage
to the right-of-way caused by the activities of the wireless provider while
occupying, constructing, installing, mounting, maintaining, modifying,
operating, or replacing small cell wireless facilities, utility poles, or
wireless support structures in the right-of-way and return the right-of-way to
its original condition. Following sixty days' written notice, the City may make
those repairs and charge the wireless provider the cost of the repairs.
(Ord. 2020-02. Passed 3-9-20.)
873.09 RATES.
   (a)   Application fees for permits and annual rates shall be in an amount
set by a resolution of the City from time to time, but a wireless provider
shall not be charged more than the amount permitted by law. The rates, fees,
and terms shall be nondiscriminatory, competitively neutral, and commercially
reasonable.
   (b)   For installations of utility poles designed to support small cell
wireless facilities or collocations of small cell wireless facilities installed
and operation in the right-of-way prior to March 12, 2019, the fees, rates, and

to continue to install or maintain poles in any location. The City may make a
nondiscriminatory decision to eliminate aboveground poles of a particular type
generally, such as electric utility poles, in a designated area of its
geographic jurisdiction. In such instances, for poles with colocated small cell
wireless facilities in place at the time of the decision, the City shall do one
of the following:
      (1)   Continue to maintain the City pole.
      (2)   Install and maintain a reasonable alternative pole or wireless
support structure for the collocation of the small cell wireless facility.
      (3)   Offer to sell the pole to the wireless provider at a reasonable
cost.
      (4)   Allow the wireless provider to install its own utility pole so it
can maintain service from that location.

the sole negligence of the City or its officers, agents, or employees.
   (b)   Obtain insurance naming the City and those acting on its behalf
including but not limited to its officers, agents, and employees as additional
insureds against any claims, demands, damages, lawsuits, judgments, costs,
liens, losses, expenses, and attorney fees. A wireless provider may meet all or
a portion of the City's insurance coverage and limit requirements by self-
insurance, conditioned upon providing to the City, evidence demonstrating, to
the City's satisfaction, the wireless provider's financial ability to meet the
City's insurance coverage and limit requirements throughout the life of the
provider's use of the right-of-way. To the extent it self-insures, a wireless

880.02 HOUSING DEVELOPMENT TAX EXEMPTION AND SERVICE CHARGE.
   (a)   Preamble.
      (1)   It is acknowledged that it is a propre public purpose of the State

under this Act at any amount it chooses not to exceed the taxes that would be
paid but for the Act. It is further acknowledged that housing for persons of
low and moderate income is a public necessity and, as the City will be
benefited and improved by such housing, the encouragement of the same by
providing certain real estate tax exemption for such housing is a valid public

   (a)   Preamble.
      (1)   It is acknowledged that it is a proper public purpose of the State
and its political subdivisions to provide housing for its citizens of low

service charge in lieu of property taxes in accordance with the State Housing
Development Authority Act of 1966 (1966 PA 346, as amended, MCL Section

the service charge to be paid in lieu of taxes by any or all classes of housing
exempt from taxation under this Act at any amount it chooses not to exceed the
taxes that would be paid but for this Act. It is further acknowledged that such
housing for persons of low income is a public necessity, and as the City will
be benefitted and improved by such housing, the encouragement of the same by
providing certain real estate tax exemption for such housing is a valid public
purpose; further, that the continuance of the provisions of this section for
tax exemption and the service charge in lieu of taxes during the period
contemplated in this section are essential to the determination of economic
feasibility of housing developments which are constructed and financed in
reliance on such tax exemption.

development identified as Braidwood Manor (the "Project") on certain property
in the City described in Exhibit A, attached to Ordinance 2006-08, passed

diameter and smaller shall be constructed of type K, soft temper copper tubing.
Water service extension larger than two (2") inches in diameter and shall be
constructed of Class 52 Ductile Iron, Class 22 Cast Iron or C909 PVC Pipe with
a working pressure of 150 PSI. The type of water pipe selected shall be used
for the entire length of the water service extension (from the end of the City
installed water service connection to the water meter). No soldered joints are
allowed before the meter.
   (d)   Placement of Pipe. 
      (1)   All water service shall be constructed no less than five (5') feet
below finished grade at any point. The water service extension may be placed in
the same trench with the sewer service extension, providing the bottom of the
water pipe is above the top of the sewer pipe at all points by at least twelve
(12") inches. A solid shelf must be constructed on one side of the trench which
shall be of sufficient width to properly support the water pipe without
bracing. When a water service extension pipe cannot be placed twelve (12")
inches above the sewer sendee extension pipe, or when the water service
extension pipe exceeds two (2") inches in diameter, the water service extension
and sewer service extension shall be laid in separate trenches and separated by
five (5') feet of undisturbed or compacted earth. Under buildings without
basements, the minimum depth of five (5') feet shall be maintained for eighteen
(18") inches inside the foundation wall. Preexisting conditions will be
considered when applying these rules. In all instances the water line shall be
above the sewer.

extensions shall be provided with two full flow gate valves. The valves are to
be installed on the inlet and outlet sides of the meter located no more than
twelve (12") inches upstream or downstream and must be accessible. All meters
two (2") inches and larger shall have an expansion joint and bypass with a full
flow gate valve installed. The bypass can be full pipe size below the water
service extension size. [For example: A two (2") inch water sendee shall have
as minimum a one-and-a-half (1 /2")-inch bypass.] All meters shall be located
within one (1) foot of the building wall where the pipe enters the building.
   (g)   Inspections.
      (1)   All water service extensions before being covered shall be tested
under full pressure, inspected and approved by an authorized inspector assigned
by the City of Davison DPW. Water service extensions larger than two (2")
inches shall be subject to hydrostatic testing, chlorination, and
bacteriological analysis prior to being placed into service. Water service
extensions larger than two (2") inches will be initially installed with an air
gap between the connection and the extensions under construction. The
contractor shall provide piping materials to make a temporary connection with
cross connection protection to existing water connection and/or fire hydrant.
      (2)   This temporary connection is for the purpose of filling the water
extension for required pressure testing, chlorination and bacteriological
analysis prior to final connection and being placed in service. An alternative
to this shall be a double, back-to-back valve installed with an air relief
between two valves. Inspections will be made Monday through Friday, 7:00 a.m.
to 2:30 p.m. Overtime charges will be assessed for inspections done weekdays
after 2:30 p.m. or during weekend hours.

of Davison DPW shall run water on or off at the curb stop. A request for such
water turn on or off shall be made to the water billing clerk. No turn on will
be made unless all provisions of this rule have been complied with.
   (j)   Extension Leaks. 
      (1)   An authorized inspector of the City of Davison DPW shall
investigate any leak occurring on a private water service extension. If it is
determined the leak is on the supply side of the curb stop or in the curb stop
itself, it shall be repaired by the City at no expense to the property owner.
      (2)   If it is determined that the leak is on the extension side of the
curb stop, it shall be repaired by the property owner at their expense. In the
latter case, the City of Davison shall:
         A.   Give written notice to the property owner on record by regular
mail of the United States Postal Service, advising the owner of the leak and
requiring that repair be made within five (5) days.
         B.   If the repair has not been made at the expiration of the five (5)
days, a second written notice shall be given by certified mail of the United
States Postal Service. This shall establish a second five (5) day period for
the repair to be completed and give notice that any non-compliance will result
in the discontinuance of water service.
         C.   If at the end of the second five (5) day period the repair has
not been made, the sendee shall be discontinued until the proper repair has
occurred.
         D.   If in the judgment of the City of Davison DPW, any leak is of
such magnitude or location as to constitute or create a hazard to public
safety, or a threat of damage to public or private property, they shall order
the water service discontinued immediately until the property repairs have been
completed.
   (k)   Pipe Repairs and Replacements. Pipe repairs or replacement shall be
made with like materials. Any repair over half the length of the extension will
require replacement of the extension. (Refer back to paragraph (j)). Lead
service connection and extensions, regardless of length, must be entirely
replaced with materials required for new systems. If replacement is necessary
on the supply side of the curb stop, the City at no expense to the property
owner will make such replacement to the property. If replacement is necessary
on the extension side of the curb stop, it shall be replaced by the property
owner at their expense.

1044.001 PURPOSE; SCOPE.
   (a)   The purposes of this chapter are:
      (1)   To establish uniform requirements for discharges from the City of
Davison (the “Local Unit”) (including discharges by all users located within
the Local Unit) to the Genesee County Publicly Owned Treatment Works (“POTW”),
and to enable the Local Unit and the County Agency (also referred to as the
“GCWWSD”) to comply with applicable State and Federal laws as required by the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the “Clean Water Act”), as
amended, 33 USC 1251, et seq.; the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR
part 403); Part 31 of Act 451 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1994, MCL §§
324.3101 et seq., as amended (“Water Resources Protection”); and the rules,
Michigan Administrative Code, R 323.2301 et seq., as amended, promulgated
pursuant to Sections 3103, 3106 and 3109 of Part 31 of Act 451 of the Public
Acts of Michigan of 1994, as amended.
      (2)   To prevent the discharge of pollutants into the POTW that do not
meet applicable pretreatment standards and requirements; that would interfere
with the operation of the POTW; that would pass through the POTW into the
receiving waters or the atmosphere, the environment, or otherwise be
incompatible with the POTW; that would inhibit or disrupt the POTW’s
processing, use, or disposal of sludge; that would cause health or safety
problems for POTW workers; or that would result in a violation of the POTW’s
NPDES permit or of other applicable laws and regulations.
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and
sludges from the POTW.
      (4)   To regulate the discharge of wastewater and/or pollutants to the
POTW and to enforce the requirements of this chapter through the issuance of
permits and through other means as provided by this chapter.
      (5)   To authorize and require all inspection, monitoring, reporting and
enforcement activities as necessary to insure compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements and other applicable laws and
regulations.
      (6)   To provide for the equitable distribution and recovery of costs
from users of the POTW sufficient to administer regulatory activities and to
meet the costs of the operation, maintenance, improvement and replacement of
the POTW.
   (b)   This chapter applies to any person that discharges to the POTW from
within the Local Unit. This chapter also applies to any person owning, using,
constructing or maintaining any private system or facility intended or used for
the disposal of sewage or wastewater within the Local Unit.
   (c)   The County Agency has established and organized the Genesee County
Water and Waste Services Division (“GCWWSD”) to administer, implement and
enforce the provisions of Act 342 and this chapter.
   (d)   As required by Act 342, a contract or agreement between the County
Agency and the Local Unit must be entered into before the Local Unit may
discharge into the POTW. As a condition or requirement of the contract or
agreement, the Local Unit is required to adopt, and to keep continually in
force and up to date, an ordinance that, except as specifically approved in
advance by the GCWWSD, must be identical to the sewer use ordinance adopted by
Genesee County (as that ordinance is amended from time to time by the County
upon the recommendation of the County Agency) (the “Genesee County Sewer Use
Ordinance”). This chapter is being adopted by the Local Unit pursuant to the
contract or agreement between the County Agency and the Local Unit and as
required by the Genesee County Sewer Use Ordinance and other applicable State
and Federal laws and regulations.
   (e)   The Local Unit hereby designates, empowers and authorizes the County
Agency, acting through the GCWWSD, to act as the agent and representative of
the Local Unit for purposes of administering and enforcing this chapter within
the Local Unit. This includes, but is not limited to, the power and authority
of the GCWWSD, as deemed necessary by the GCWWSD, to immediately and
independently investigate, enforce, and prosecute (administratively or
judicially, and civilly or criminally) any violation of this chapter or of any
notice, order, permit, decision or determination promulgated, issued or made by
the GCWWSD under this chapter or the Genesee County Sewer Use Ordinance, and to
otherwise implement the requirements of this chapter and the Genesee County
Sewer Use Ordinance.
   (f)   It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge any wastewater or
pollutant to the POTW or to any storm sewer or natural outlet within the Local
Unit or in any area under the jurisdiction of the Local Unit, except in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter and other applicable laws and
regulations. If any user discharges or proposes to discharge wastewaters or
pollutants that are prohibited or limited by this chapter, the County Agency
may take any action as provided by this chapter or other applicable laws or
regulations to assure and require compliance with the provisions of this
chapter.

or proprietor, respectively.
      (3)   If the user is a Federal, State or local governmental entity, the
principal executive officer, ranking elected official, or director having
responsibility for the overall operation of the discharging facility.
      (4)   A duly authorized representative of an individual designated in
paragraph (1), (2) or (3) above, if the representative is responsible for the
overall operation of the facilities from which the discharge to the POTW
originates.
         A.   To be considered “duly authorized,” the authorization must be
made in writing by an individual designated in paragraph (1), (2) or (3) above.
The authorization must specify either an individual or a position having
responsibility for the overall operation of the facility (such as the position
of plant manager, operator of a well or well field, or a position of equivalent
responsibility, or having overall responsibility for the environmental matters
for the company or entity), The written authorization must be submitted to the
POTW Manager prior to or together with any reports to be signed by the
authorized representative.
         B.   If an authorization under paragraph (4)A. above is no longer
accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the
overall operation of the facility, or overall responsibility for environmental
matters for the company or entity, a new written authorization must be
submitted to the POTW Manager prior to or together with any reports to be
signed by the newly authorized representative.
   (d)   “Best management practice” or “BMP” means any practice, program,
procedure, control, technique or measure (used singularly or in combination),
that a user is required to adopt or implement to control, contain, treat,
prevent, or reduce the discharge of wastewater, pollutants or other substances
to the POTW, as determined necessary by the POTW Manager. BMPs include, but are
not limited to: schedules of activities; pollution treatment practices or
devices; prohibitions of practices; good housekeeping practices; pollution
prevention, minimization and reduction measures; educational practices and
programs; maintenance procedures; other management programs, practices or
devices; treatment requirements; notice, reporting, and record-keeping
requirements; and operating procedures and practices to control or contain site
runoff, spillage or leaks, batch discharges, sludge or water disposal, or
drainage from product and raw materials storage. BMPs may be structural, non-
structural, or both. In determining what BMPs will be required of a user in a
particular case, the POTW Manager may consider all relevant technological,
economic, practical, and institutional considerations as determined relevant
and appropriate by the Manager, consistent with achieving and maintaining
compliance with the requirements of this chapter and other applicable laws and
regulations.
   (e)   “BOD” (denoting biochemical oxygen demand) means the quantity of
dissolved oxygen used in the biochemical oxidation of organic matter under
standard laboratory procedure in five (5) days at twenty (20) degrees Celsius,
expressed in milligrams per liter.
   (f)   “Building drain” means that part of the lowest horizontal piping of a
drainage system of a building which receives the discharge from wastewater and
other drainage pipes inside the walls of the building and conveys it to the
building sewer. The building drain shall be deemed to begin five (5) feet
outside the inner face of the building wall.
   (g)   “Building sewer” means the extension from the building drain to the
public sewer or other place of disposal (such as a grinder pump). The building
sewer shall be deemed to begin five (5) feet outside the inner face of the
building wall.
   (h)   “Bypass” means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any
portion of a user’s treatment process or facility needed for compliance with
pretreatment standards or requirements.
   (i)   “Categorical user” means a user subject to a categorical pretreatment
standard.
   (j)   “Categorical pretreatment standard” or “categorical standard” means
any regulation containing pollutant discharge limits promulgated by the U.S.
EPA in accordance with Sections 307(b) and (c) of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC
1317, which apply to a specific category of users and which appear in 40 CFR
Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471.
   (k)   “Cesspool” means an underground pit into which domestic waste is
discharged and from which the liquid seeps into the surrounding soil or is
otherwise removed.
   (l)   “CFR” means Code of Federal Regulations.
   (m)   “Chlorine demand” means the difference between the amount of chlorine
available at the end of the contact time, expressed in mg/l.
   (n)   “COD” means a measure of oxygen-consuming capacity of inorganic and
organic matter present in water or wastewater. It is expressed as the amount of
oxygen consumed from a chemical oxidant in a specified test. It does not
differentiate between stable and unstable organic matter and thus does not
necessarily correlate with biochemical oxygen demand. Also known as oxygen
consumed (OCR) and dichromate oxygen consumed (DO), respectively.
   (o)   “Combined sewer” means a public owned and maintained sewer designed
and intended to receive both wastewater and stormwater for discharge to the
POTW.
   (p)   “Compatible pollutant” means a pollutant which, as determined by the
POTW Manager, is susceptible to effective treatment by the POTW as designed,
and which will not interfere with, or pass through, the POTW, and which is
otherwise not incompatible with the treatment processes or in excess of the
capacity at the POTW. The term “compatible” is a relative concept that must be
determined on a case-by-case basis, in determining whether or not a pollutant
is compatible with the POTW, the Manager may consider, without limitation, the
nature and qualities of the pollutant, and the concentration, mass, and flow
rate at which the pollutant is (or is proposed to be) discharged. Thus, for
example, even pollutants such as BOD, fats, oils or grease, phosphorous,
suspended solids, and fecal coliform bacteria, which are typically considered
“compatible” may be determined incompatible, if discharged in concentrations or
flows that would cause interference or pass through or exceed the POTW’s
capacity. Specifically excluded from the definition of compatible pollutant are
“heavy” metals, PCBs, and any pollutants that will likely contribute or cause
operational or sludge disposal problems or unacceptable discharges to the
receiving waters.
   (q)   “Composite sample” means a series of individual samples taken at
regular intervals over a specific time period and combined into a single sample
(formed either by continuous sampling or by mixing discrete samples)
representative of the average stream during the sampling period. For
categorical sampling, a composite sample shall consist of at least four (4)
individual samples taken within a twenty-four (24) hour period.
   (r)   “Cooling water” means water used for cooling purposes only, including
both contact and non-contact cooling water.
   (s)   “Cooling water (contact)” means water used for cooling purposes only
that may become contaminated or polluted either through the use of water
treatment chemicals (such as corrosion inhibitors or biocides) or by direct
contact with process materials and/or wastewater.
   (t)   “Cooling water (non-contact)” means water used for cooling purposes
only that has no direct contact with any raw material, intermediate product,
final product, or waste, and that does not contain a detectable level of
contaminants higher than that of the intake water (for example, the water
discharged from uses such as air conditioning, cooling, or refrigeration, or to
which the only pollutant added is heat).
   (u)   “County” means Genesee County, Michigan.
   (v)   “County Agency” means the public body or official as designated by the
Genesee County Board of Commissioners pursuant to the provisions of Public Act
342 of the 1939 Public Acts of Michigan, being MCL 46.171 et seq., as amended
(the “County Public Improvement Act”). The County Agency has established and
organized the Genesee County Water and Waste Services Division (“GCWWSD”) to
administer, implement and enforce the provisions of Act 342 and this chapter.
Accordingly, for purposes of this chapter, “GCWWSD” may also be used to refer
to the “County Agency.”
   (w)   “County capital improvement fee” or “CCIF” refers to the charge
authorized to be assessed to all new applicants for a connection permit to the

Notes applicable to subsection (b)(1)A., B. and C. are as follows:
IMC = Instantaneous Maximum Concentration.
T = Total
1   Discharges which contain more than one pollutant which may contribute to fume
toxicity shall be subject to more restrictive limitations, as determined necessary
by the POTW. The more restrictive discharge limits will be calculated based on the
additive fume toxicity of all compounds identified or reasonably expected to be
present in the discharge, including, without limitation, the specific compounds,
if any, listed in subsection (b)(1)B. above.
2   NQ = Non-quantifiable concentration, defined as at or above the quantification
level of 0.2 ug/l using U.S. EPA Method 245.1 (or at or above other quantification
levels applicable under alternative test methods required by the POTW or by other
applicable laws or regulations). Mercury sampling procedures, preservation and
handling, and analytical protocol for compliance monitoring of a user’s discharge
shall be in accordance with U.S. EPA method 245.1, unless the POTW Manager
requires U.S. EPA Method 1631 (or other appropriate method). The quantification
level shall be 0.2 ug/l for Method 245.1 or 0.5 ug/l for Method 1631, unless
higher levels are approved by the POTW Manager because of sample matrix
interference.
3   Any discharge of ammonia nitrogen in excess of 20 mg/l shall be subject to
surcharge as provided by this chapter.
4   Any discharge of BOD in excess of 250 mg/l shall be subject to surcharge as
provided by this chapter.
5   Any discharge of phosphorous (T) in excess of 20 mg/l shall be subject to
surcharge as provided by this chapter.
6   Any discharge of TSS in excess of300 mg/l shall be subject to surcharge as
provided by this chapter.
7   Any discharge of FOG in excess of 100 mg/l shall he subject to surcharge as
provided by this chapter.
The IMC, daily maximum, and monthly average limits listed above in this subsection
(b)(1) (or as listed elsewhere in this chapter or in any user permit or order) for
each pollutant parameter are the concentrations which may not be exceeded and at
which enforcement begins. The surcharge threshold concentrations as specified in
notes 3 through 7 (above) are the concentrations above which surcharges may be
imposed. Discharges exceeding the surcharge thresholds, but which are less than
the IMC, daily maximum, and monthly average limits (and which do not violate any
other applicable prohibitions, limitations, standards, or requirements), are not
violations of this chapter, but are subject to surcharges as provided by this
chapter. All violations of applicable discharge prohibitions and limitations and
all instances of noncompliance with applicable discharge requirements constitute a
violation of this chapter, subject to applicable fines, penalties and other
enforcement actions. In no event shall the imposition of a surcharge for a
discharge which does not meet the applicable prohibitions, limitations or
requirements be construed as authorizing the illegal discharge or otherwise excuse
a violation of this chapter.
 
      (2)   For any discharge that would otherwise be prohibited by subsection
(b)(1), above, the POTW may impose a specific alternative limit (SAL) for all
or any portion of the discharge (or for all or any pollutant parameter thereof)
pursuant to a user permit or by POTW order. Each SAL must be approved in
advance by the POTW Manager. The following conditions and requirements shall
apply to all SALs:
         A.   The POTW shall not be required to approve or require a SAL, but
may do so at its sole discretion. The POTW may terminate or modify the SAL,
and/or require compliance with different or additional discharge standards or
requirements as determined necessary or appropriate at any time.
         B.   A SAL shall not create any property rights or privilege of any
kind whatsoever, nor shall it be construed to authorize any injury to private
or public property or any invasion of personal rights, nor any violation of
local, state or federal laws or regulations.
         C.   A SAL may include any terms, conditions or requirements
determined necessary and appropriate by the POTW Manager, including, but not
limited to, terms, conditions and requirements regarding sampling, analysis,
fees, reimbursement, surety, indemnification, and insurance.
         D.   The POTW shall establish each SAL based on an allocation of the
amount of remaining available loading from the POTW’s maximum allowable
industrial loading (MAIL) for a given pollutant at the time when the SAL is
approved and assigned. Each SAL may also be subject to a maximum (not-to-
exceed) concentration as determined necessary by the POTW to protect the
receiving sewer, the POTW, public health and safety, the environment, or to
otherwise achieve the purposes, objectives and requirements of this chapter.
The MAILs and not-to-exceed concentrations for pollutants of concern are set
forth in subsection (b)(2)F. and G. below. All SAL allocations shall be in the
amounts, and subject to the terms, conditions and requirements, as deemed
necessary and appropriate by the POTW.
         E.   Violation of any SAL (or of any of the terms, conditions or
requirements of a SAL) shall be a violation of this chapter and subject to
applicable fines, penalties, and other enforcement actions.
         F.   The total mass of a pollutant of concern allocated to septage
wastes, trucked wastes, and all other nondomestic users (and taking into
account all SALs that have been assigned by the POTW at the time), shall not
exceed the following MAILs in the aggregate:

Notes:
T = Total
IMC = Instantaneous Maximum Concentration.
1. Discharges which contain two or mere pollutants that contribute to fire/
explosion potential or fume toxicity may be subject to more restrictive IMCs,
as determined to be necessary by the POTW Manager. The corresponding
concentrations will be calculated based on the additive effects of all
compounds identified or reasonably expected to be present in the discharge.
2. Subject to application of applicable surcharge thresholds and payment of
surcharges as provided by subsection (b)(1).
 
      (3)   Pollutants in concentrations that exceed the instantaneous maximum,
daily maximum or monthly average concentrations listed below in this
subsection:
         Parameter:
PCBs: The instantaneous maximum concentration, daily maximum and monthly
average discharge limit for PCBs is non-detect. Except as otherwise required by
the POTW Manager, compliance with this limit shall be determined as follows:
A compliance limit of “non-detect” shall be used for instantaneous maximum
concentration, daily maximum and monthly average. Any discharge of PCBs at or
above the quantification level is a specific violation of this chapter.
PCB sampling procedures, preservation and handling, and analytical protocol for
compliance monitoring of a user’s discharge shall be in accordance with U.S.
EPA method 608. The quantification level shall be 0.1 ug/l, unless higher
levels are determined appropriate by the POTW Manager because of sample matrix
interference. Total PCBs shall be defined as the sum of the Aroclors 1016,
1221, 1232, 1242, 1248, 1254 and 1260. In addition, any detected Aroclor-
specific measurements shall be reported.
      (4)   Any liquid, solid, gas or other pollutant (including, but not
limited to, gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel or fuel oil) which by reason of
its nature or quantity is sufficient either alone or by interaction with other
substances to create a fire or explosion hazard or be injurious in any other
way to persons, the POTW, or to the operation of the sewerage system,
including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed cup flashpoint of
less than 140° F or 60° C using test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21.
      (5)   Pollutants that may cause corrosive structural damage to the POTW,
or that due to their corrosive properties are capable of causing injury to
persons or POTW personnel or harm to fish, animals or the environment.
Discharges that have a pH lower than 6.5 or greater than 9.5 shall not be
discharged.
      (6)   Any solid, insoluble or viscous substance in concentrations or
quantities which may cause obstruction to the flow in the POTW, may create an
encumbrance to the POTW operations, or which otherwise may result in
interference, including, but not limited to, grease, animal entrails or
tissues, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, whole blood, feathers, ashes,
cinders, sand, cement, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw,
shavings, grass clippings, rags, strings, fibers, spent grains, spent hops,
wastepaper, wood, plastics, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining or
processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud or glass grinding or polishing
wastes or tumbling and deburring stones.
      (7)   Any pollutant, including, but not limited to, oxygen demanding
pollutants (BOD, etc.), released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration
that may cause pass through or interference with the POTW or constitute a slug
load, or is otherwise discharged to the POTW in excessive amounts.
      (8)   Wastewater (or vapor) having a temperature that will inhibit
biological activity in the POTW resulting in interference, or heat in such
quantities that the temperature at the POTW treatment plant exceeds 104°
Fahrenheit (40° C). No discharge to the POTW shall have a temperature less than
32" Fahrenheit (0° C) or greater than 150° Fahrenheit (65.7° C), unless
approved in advance by the POTW Manager.
      (9)   Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of
mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through,
      (10)   Pollutants that result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors or
fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and
safety problems. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, wastewaters
which contain liquids, solids or gases that cause gases, vapors or fumes from
the discharge to exceed 10% of the immediately dangerous to life and health
(IDLH) concentration. Discharges which contain more than one pollutant which
may contribute to fume toxicity shall be subject to more restrictive
limitations, as determined necessary by the POTW. The more restrictive
discharge limits shall be calculated based on the additive fume toxicity of all
compounds identified or reasonably expected to be present in the discharge.
      (11)   Trucked or hauled pollutants, except those introduced into the
system at discharge points designated by the POTW, subject to the prior
approval of the POTW Manager and prior issuance of a user permit.
         A.   The POTW Manager shall determine whether to allow the discharge
of trucked or hauled pollutants based on the particular nature, character or
quantity of the proposed discharge in accordance with the discharge
prohibitions, limitations and requirements provided by sections 1044.32 through
1044.37.
         B.   The POTW Manager may impose any conditions on the discharge
determined necessary to ensure compliance with sections
1044.032 through 1044.37, including, without limitation, conditions regarding
the time, place, and manner of discharge, restrictions on the quantity and
quality of the discharge, and sampling requirements.
         C.   The discharge shall not commence without prior notice to, and
authorization from, the POTW Manager, and a representative of the POTW shall be
present at all times during the discharge.
         D.   All trucked or hauled wastes to be discharged to the POTW must be
accompanied by a completed waste manifest form signed by the permittee and the
hauler as provided by the minimum requirements of this section. The permittee
shall certify in writing on the manifest as to the source of all wastes in the
load proposed to be discharged and that the wastes have been pretreated as
required by applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The hauler
shall certify in writing on the manifest that no wastes other than those listed
on the manifest have been accepted by the hauler. The manifest must be reviewed
by the POTW Manager prior to commencing discharge of the load. Failure to
accurately record every load, falsification of data, or failure to transmit the
form to the POTW Manager for review prior to discharge shall constitute a
violation of the permit and may result in revocation of the permit and/or the
imposition of fines and penalties as provided by sections 1044.32 through
1044.37.
         E.   The permittee’s discharge of hauled wastes shall be subject to
sampling by the POTW at any time, including, without limitation, prior to and
during discharge. The POTW Manager may require the permittee to refrain from,
or suspend, discharging until the sample analysis is complete.
         F.   Trucked or hauled pollutants will be accepted only if transported
to the POTW in compliance with state and federal hazardous waste and liquid
industrial waste laws.
         G.   Each discharge of trucked or hauled pollutants will be accepted
only after payment to the POTW of a trucked or hauled pollutant discharge fee
to cover the POTW’s administrative expenses and any additional treatment,
handling or inspection expenses incurred by the POTW in connection with the
discharge. The fee shall be established, paid, and collected as provided for
IPP fees by sections
1044.123 through
1044.127. This discharge fee shall be in addition to any sewer rates, fees,
charges, or surcharges otherwise required by this chapter.
         H.   Prior to accepting a proposed discharge of trucked or hauled
pollutants, the POTW may be required to evaluate the capacity of the POTW to
accept such wastes by means, including, but not limited to, a headworks
analysis or treatability study, as determined necessary by the POTW. All such
evaluation and analysis shall be at the sole cost of the user proposing the
discharge and shall be paid in full by the user whether or not the discharge of
the trucked or hauled pollutants is ultimately approved by the POTW. The POTW
may require the user to post a deposit or other form of surety, as determined
sufficient and appropriate by the POTW, to ensure payment by the user of all
such costs.
      (12)   Wastewater with objectionable color or light absorbency
characteristics that may interfere with treatment processes or analytical
determinations, including, without limitation, dye wastes and vegetable tanning
solutions.
      (13)   Any garbage or other solid material that has not been properly
shredded.
      (14)   Solvent extractables, including, without limitation, oil, grease,
wax, or fat, whether emulsified or not, in excess of applicable local limits;
or other substances that may solidify or become viscous (with a viscosity of
110% of water) at temperatures between 32° Fahrenheit and 150° Fahrenheit in
amounts that may cause obstruction to the flow in sewers or other interference
with the operation of the POTW.
      (15)   Soluble substances in a concentration that may increase the
viscosity to greater than 10% over the viscosity of the water or in amounts
that will cause obstruction to the flow in the POTW resulting in interference.
      (16)   Any substance which exerts or causes a high or unusual
concentration of inert suspended solids, including, but not limited to, lime
slurries, diatomaceous earth and lime residues.
      (17)   Any wastewater which contains suspended solids of such character,
quantity or concentration that special attention is required, or additional
expense incurred, to process such materials at the POTW.
      (18)   Any substance which exerts or causes a high or unusual
concentration of dissolved solids, including, but not limited to, sodium
chloride or sodium sulfate.
      (19)   Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids that either singly
or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public nuisance
or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for
maintenance and repair.
      (20)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of a half-life or concentration
that may exceed limits established by applicable state or federal laws, rules
or regulations.
      (21)   Any pollutant that results in excess foaming during the treatment
process. Excess foaming is any foam that, in the opinion of the POTW Manager,
may interfere with the treatment process.
      (22)   Wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity,
either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere
with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or
animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or to
exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard.
      (23)   Any hazardous waste as defined by this chapter.
      (24)   Any medical or infectious wastes, as defined by the Michigan
Department of Environmental Quality.
      (25)   Any substance that may cause the POTW’s effluent or any other
product of the POTW such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for
reclamation, reuse or disposal, or otherwise interfere with the reclamation,
reuse, or disposal process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW
cause the POTW to be in non-compliance with sludge use or disposal criteria,
guidelines or regulations developed under Section 405 of the Act; under the
Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA) (including Title II, more commonly referred to
as RCRA, and including state regulations contained in any state sludge
management plan prepared pursuant to Subtitle D of the SWDA); the Clean Air
Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Marine Protection, Research, and
Sanctuaries Act; or any more stringent state or local regulations, as
applicable.
      (26)   Any unpolluted water, non-contact cooling water, storm water,
surface water, groundwater, roof runoff or subsurface drainage (except to a
storm sewer or a combined sewer as authorized by this chapter and other
applicable laws and regulations and subject to the prior approval of the POTW
Manager).
      (27)   Any contaminated groundwater or landfill leachate determined by
the POTW to have a reasonable potential to adversely affect the operation of
the POTW, to result in pass through or interference, or to violate any
pretreatment standard or requirement.
      (28)   Any substance that will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES
permit, the receiving water quality standards, or associated local, state or
federal laws, rules or regulations.
      (29)   Any substance which causes a high chlorine demand, including, but
not limited to, nitrite, cyanide, thiocyanate, sulfite and thiosulfate.
      (30)   Any wastewater which exceeds applicable categorical pretreatment
standards, requirements or limits prescribed by local, state or federal laws,
rules or regulations.
      (31)   Any compatible or incompatible pollutant in excess of the allowed
limits as determined by applicable local, state or federal laws, rules or
regulations.

obstruction to the flow in the POTW resulting in interference.
      (34)   Water or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment to only such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters,
      (35)   Any pollutant, substance, or wastewater that, either directly or
indirectly, and either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, has a
reasonable potential to:
         A.   Create a chemical reaction with any materials of construction to
impair the strength or durability of sewer structures;
         B.   Cause a mechanical action that will damage or destroy sewer
structures;
         C.   Impede or restrict the hydraulic capacity of the POTW;
         D.   Interfere with normal inspection or maintenance of sewer
structures;
         E.   Place unusual demands upon the wastewater treatment equipment or
processes by biological, chemical or physical means; or
         F.   Cause a hazard to human life or create a public nuisance.
   (c)   Pollutant Reduction Plans. If determined necessary by the POTW Manager
to prevent interference or pass through, to protect the POTW, to comply with
applicable federal or state laws or regulations, to comply with the POTW’s
NPDES permit, or to otherwise meet the purposes and objectives of this chapter,
any user determined by the POTW Manager to have a reasonable potential to
discharge any regulated pollutant (including, but not limited to, mercury or
PCBs) to the POTW may be required to develop, submit for approval, and
implement a Reduction Plan (“RP”) for the pollutant, as provided by this
section. The RP may be imposed as a condition to a user permit, or may be
required independently and even if a user permit has not been issued to the
user.
      (1)   At a minimum, the RP shall contain such requirements and
conditions, as determined necessary by the POTW Manager to ensure that the
pollutant reduction efforts will be effective in achieving the goals of this
chapter (including, but not limited to, requirements and conditions regarding
user source identification; best management practices; schedules of compliance;
monitoring, sampling and analysis; reporting; treatment system for removal of
the pollutant from the discharged wastewater; written procedures for disposal
of contaminated wastes and wastewater; employee training, and on-going employee
training requirements regarding pollutant related issues; elimination, if
feasible, of any purchased materials containing the pollutant; and any other
elements determined necessary and appropriate under the circumstances by the
POTW Manager).
      (2)   The goal of an RP shall be to maintain the amount of one or more
pollutants or substances at or below the applicable discharge limits or levels,
or such other goals as required by the POTW. The POTW Manager may, in the POTW
Manager’s discretion, consider cost-effectiveness during the development and
implementation of an RP.
      (3)   The POTW Manager may require any user to submit an RP that
describes the control strategy designed to proceed toward achievement of the
specified goal and shall at a minimum include, but shall not be limited to, all
of the following as determined necessary by the POTW Manager on a case-by-case
basis:
         A.   Periodic monitoring for the pollutant in the user’s discharge.
         B.   Periodic monitoring of the potential sources of the pollutant in
the user’s discharge.
         C.   A commitment by the user that reasonable control measures and/or
best management practices will be implemented when sources of the pollutant are
discovered. Factors to be considered by the POTW may include the following:
            1.   Significance of sources.
            2.   Economic considerations.
            3.   Technical and treatability considerations.
            4.   Such other factors as determined appropriate by the POTW
Manager.
         D.   An annual status report. The report shall be sent by the user to
the POTW and shall include, at a minimum, all of the following:
            1.   All RP monitoring results for the previous year.
            2.   A list of potential sources of the pollutant in the user’s
discharge.
            3.   A summary of all actions taken by the user to reduce or
eliminate the identified sources of the pollutant or substance.
      (4)   As determined necessary by the POTW Manager, the Manager may
require a user to develop, submit and implement an RP for any pollutant or
substance regulated by this chapter. The POTW Manager may also modify an
approved RP at any time as determined necessary by the POTW Manager to meet the
goals and objectives of this chapter.
      (5)   Failure to submit an approvable RP within the specified deadlines
or to fully and timely comply with any condition or requirement of an approved
RP shall constitute a violation of this chapter, subject to the fine, penalty,
and other enforcement provisions of this chapter.
      (6)   Holding enforcement action in abeyance. If the effluent sample
analysis results of a user’s discharge exceeds the applicable discharge limit,
detection level, or quantification level for a pollutant, the POTW Manager may,
in the POTW Manager’s sole discretion, nevertheless allow that discharge to
continue and may hold any enforcement action regarding the prohibited discharge
in abeyance, subject to the terms, conditions, and requirements of this
subsection (c)(6), as follows:
         A.   If an approved RP is already in place: If effluent sample
analysis results exceeds the applicable discharge limit, detection level, or
quantification level for a pollutant for which an approved RP is already in
place, then the POTW Manager may, in the POTW Manager’s sole discretion,
nevertheless allow that discharge to continue and may hold any enforcement
action regarding the prohibited discharge in abeyance for the period that the
sample represents if the RP (and all terms, conditions and requirements
thereof) is being fully and continually performed in good faith by the user, as
determined by the POTW Manager, and subject to all of the requirements and
conditions of subsection (c)(6)C.
         B.   If an approved RP is not already in place: If effluent sample
analysis results exceeds the applicable discharge limit, detection level, or
quantification level for a pollutant for which an approved RP is not already in
place, then the POTW Manager may, in the POTW Manager’s sole discretion,
nevertheless allow that discharge to continue and may hold any enforcement
regarding the prohibited discharge in abeyance, subject to all of the
requirements and conditions of subsection (c)(6)C., and provided further as
follows: The user with the non-compliant discharge shall develop and implement
an RP approved by the POTW Manager to minimize the user’s discharges of the
pollutant in question to the POTW. The RP shall meet all of the requirements of
this subsection (c).
         C.   The following requirements and conditions shall apply to any
situation under this subsection (c)(6) in which an enforcement action is held
in abeyance as provided by this subsection (regardless of whether or not an RP
was in place at the time of the non-compliance):
            1.   The user with the non-compliant discharge shall have a POTW-
accessible point for monitoring all discharges from the user to the POTW, as
approved by the POTW. All costs and expenses for and related to the
installation and maintenance of this monitoring point and any required sampling
devices shall be paid for solely by the user.
            2.   The user with the non-compliant discharge shall routinely
self-monitor its discharges to the POTW for the pollutant in question using the
sampling methods, procedures, preservation and handling, and analytical
protocol required by the POTW Manager and at the frequency specified by the
POTW Manager. All costs and expenses of this sampling and analysis shall be
paid for solely by the user.
            3.   The POTW may collect any additional samples of the user’s
discharge as determined necessary by the POTW Manager, all costs and expenses
to be paid for by the user.
            4.   If the user complies with all of the requirements and
conditions for the RP as specified by the POTW Manager, and if the POTW Manager
determines that all reasonable and cost-effective actions based on the
economic, technical, and treatability considerations, including, but not
limited to, all elements of the user’s RP, have been, and continue to be, fully
and satisfactorily implemented by the user, then the POTW may, in its
discretion, hold enforcement action in abeyance and allow the user to continue
the non-compliant discharge.
            5.   Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection (c)(6) to the
contrary, and regardless of whether a user fully complies with all requirements
and conditions of this section and/or of an approved RP, the POTW Manager shall
have the unconditional right to prohibit and terminate any non-compliant
discharge at any time and without prior notice, and to take any enforcement
action in response thereto, including any enforcement action that had
previously been held in abeyance under this subsection(c)(6).
            6.   Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection (c)(6) to the
contrary, the POTW Manager shall not hold an enforcement action in abeyance as
provided by this subsection unless the POTW Manager has first obtained approval
from the MDEQ to do so for the specific pollutant parameter in question;
provided that such prior approval shall not be required for discharges of
mercury or PCBs.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.033 PRETREATMENT STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Compliance with Applicable Standards and Requirements. The national
categorical pretreatment standards as established for specific industries under
40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N are hereby made a part of the requirements of
this chapter in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations, and are
incorporated by reference as if fully set forth in this chapter. A user shall
comply with all categorical pretreatment standards and any other pretreatment
requirements established under the Act that are applicable to that user. A user
shall also comply with all other applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements established under this chapter or under state and federal laws and
regulations.
   (b)   Deadlines for Compliance. Compliance by existing sources with
categorical pretreatment standards shall be within 3 years of the date the
standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified by 40 CFR
chapter I, subchapter N. Existing sources that become industrial users
subsequent to promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard
shall be considered existing industrial users except where such sources meet
the definition of “new source.” New sources shall install and have in operating
condition, and shall start-up all pollution control equipment required to meet
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements before beginning to
discharge. Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed 90 days), new
sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (c)   Alternative Categorical Limits. Categorical pretreatment standards
shall apply to a user subject to categorical standards, unless an enforceable
alternative limit to the corresponding national categorical standards is
derived using any of the methods specified in MAC R 323.2313 (regarding removal
credits, fundamentally different factor variances, net/gross calculations,
equivalent mass per day limitations, and combined wastestream formula
alternative limitations). The use of any alternative categorical limit shall be
subject to the prior approval of the POTW Manager. If local limits are more
stringent than derived alternative categorical limits, the local limits shall
control.
   (d)   Compliance with Other Applicable Laws and Regulations. Users of the
POTW shall comply with all local, state and federal laws and regulations that
may apply to their discharges to the POTW, including, but not limited to,
Article II, Air Pollution Control, Part 55 of Act 451 of the Public Acts of
Michigan of 1994 (the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act).
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.034 RIGHT OF REVISION.
   The POTW reserves the right to establish more restrictive prohibitions,
limitations and requirements for discharges to the POTW to prevent interference
or pass through, to protect the POTW, to comply with applicable federal or
state laws or regulations, to comply with the POTW’s NPDES permit, or as
otherwise determined necessary by the POTW Manager.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.035 POTW’S RIGHT TO REFUSE OR CONDITION DISCHARGE.
   The POTW may refuse to accept, or may condition its acceptance of, all or
any portion of any proposed or existing discharge to the POTW from any person,
regardless of whether or not a user permit has been issued for the discharge,
if the POTW Manager determines that the discharge has a reasonable potential
to: adversely affect the operation of the POTW; result in pass through or
interference; violate any pretreatment standard or requirement; cause the POTW
to violate its NPDES permit; or if the impacts of the discharge on the POTW or
the POTW’s discharge are uncertain or unknown (because, for example, no local
limits or headworks analysis has been conducted for particular pollutants in
the discharge). If the POTW Manager denies any person permission to commence or
continue all or any portion of a discharge to the POTW, the person shall
refrain from commencing to discharge or shall immediately terminate the
discharge to the POTW and shall not thereafter recommence discharge without
written authorization from the POTW Manager. Similarly, if the POTW Manager
denies any person permission to commence or continue all or any portion of a
discharge to the POTW except subject to conditions determined necessary and
appropriate by the POTW Manager, the person shall refrain from commencing or
continuing the discharge except in full compliance with those conditions. This
includes, but is not limited to, the POTW’s right to revise or revoke user
permits; and to require a Local Unit to revise the Local Unit’s ordinance
consistent with any revisions made by the county to this chapter, as a
condition to discharge.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.036 MOST RESTRICTIVE STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS APPLY.
   Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the most
stringent or restrictive standard or requirement applicable to a user’s
discharge shall control, whether established by this chapter, by any notice,
order, permit, decision or determination promulgated, issued or made by the
POTW under this chapter, by state laws or regulations, including the POTW’s
NPDES permit, or by federal laws or regulations. Further, if state or federal
laws or regulations provide for standards and requirements not covered by this
chapter that are otherwise applicable to a user’s discharge, those standards
and requirements shall apply to the user in addition to those required by this
chapter, and the most restrictive of those additional standards or requirements
shall control and shall be complied with by the user within the time period
required by the law or regulation.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.037 DILUTION PROHIBITED AS SUBSTITUTE FOR TREATMENT.
   Unless expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard
or requirement and subject to the prior approval of the POTW Manager, no user
shall ever increase the use of process water, mix separate wastestreams, or in
any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute
for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a federal, state or local
standard, requirement or limitation. The POTW may impose mass limitations on
nondomestic users that are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements and in other cases where the imposition of mass
limitations is appropriate. Combining a user’s wastestream or modulating the
release of pollutants upstream of the sampling point prior to the point of
discharge into the public sewer shall not be construed as dilution, except as
otherwise restricted by National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or
requirements. No user intending to use dilution as a substitute for treatment
shall do so without the prior approval of the POTW Manager consistent with the
requirements of this section.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.038 USER PERMIT REQUIRED.
   (a)   Industrial User Permits. It is unlawful for any significant industrial
user (SIU), or any other user as determined necessary by the POTW Manager to
carry out the purposes of this chapter, to discharge to the POTW without an
industrial user permit as provided by sections
1044.038 through
1044.053.
   (b)   General User Permits. The POTW Manager may require any user other than
a SIU to obtain a general user permit to discharge to the POTW, subject to such
terms and conditions as are determined necessary and appropriate by the POTW to
achieve the purposes, policies and objectives of this chapter.
      (1)   A general user permit may contain, but shall not be required to
contain, any of the terms and conditions that would apply to an industrial user
permit issued to a SIU as provided by sections
1044.038 through
1044.053 to comply with the general and specific discharge prohibitions of this
chapter, including, but not limited to, discharge limitations, and requirements
regarding sampling and monitoring; pretreatment; pollution prevention,
minimization or reductions plans; accidental discharge, spill prevention, and
containment requirements; flow equalization; and implementation of best
management practices or a best management practices plan.
      (2)   To the extent determined appropriate by the POTW Manager on a case-
by-case basis, a general user permit issued under this subsection shall be
subject to provisions otherwise applicable to permits for SlUs. However, all
general user permits shall be non-transferable, and are subject to the permit
fee and permit appeals provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   It is unlawful for any user required by the POTW Manager to obtain
a general user permit to discharge to the POTW without a general user permit as
provided by sections
1044.038 through
1044.053.
      (4)   Failure to comply with a general user permit issued under this
subsection constitutes a violation of this chapter.
      (5)   In no case shall a general user permit be construed to authorize
the illegal discharge or otherwise excuse a violation of this chapter.
   (c)   Any violation of the terms or conditions of a user permit is a
violation of this chapter, subject to the fine, penalty, and other enforcement
provisions of this chapter. Obtaining a user permit shall not relieve a user of
its obligation to obtain other permits or approvals that may be required by
other local, state or federal laws or regulations.
   (d)   The issuance of a user permit shall not convey to a user any property
rights or privilege of any kind whatsoever, nor shall it be construed to
authorize any injury to private or public property or any invasion of personal
rights, nor any violation of local, state or federal laws or regulations.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.039 DETERMINATION OF USER STATUS.
   (a)   The POTW may require any user to submit information to the POTW for
its use in determining whether the user’s status, including, but not limited
to, whether the user is a SIU, as well as to determine changes or the absence
or inadequacy of changes in a user’s facilities.
   (b)   The POTW shall notify a nondomestic user of the POTW’s belief that the
user is, or may be, a SIU. Upon such notification, the user must complete and
submit an application for an industrial user permit on a form furnished by the
POTW. The failure of the POTW to so notify a nondomestic user shall not relieve
any SIU of the duty to obtain a permit as required by this chapter.
   (c)   Upon determination that a user permit is required, no connection to
the POTW shall be made and no discharge thereto shall occur until a permit is
duly issued; provided, however, that the POTW may at its discretion issue a
written authorization in place of a permit, which authorization shall be valid
for a period not to exceed 60 days.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.040 PERMIT APPLICATION DEADLINES.
   Each user must file an application for a user permit on the form provided by
the POTW within the following deadlines:
   (a)   Existing SIUs. Any SIU discharging into the POTW as of the effective
date of this chapter shall submit a completed permit application form to the
POTW as provided by sections
1044.038 through
1044.053 within 60 days of being so directed and provided a form by the POTW.
   (b)   Proposed New SIUs. Any SIU proposing to commence (or recommence)
discharging into the POTW after the effective date of this chapter shall, at
least 90 days prior to the anticipated date on which discharging will commence,
request a permit application form and submit the completed application to the
POTW.
   (c)   Categorical Users Subject to New Standard. A user which becomes
subject to a new or revised national categorical pretreatment standard, and
which has not previously submitted an application for a permit as required
herein, shall apply to the POTW for an industrial user permit within 90 days
after the promulgation of the applicable national categorical pretreatment
standard. The POTW may also initiate this action; however, the failure of the
POTW so to do shall not relieve a user of its obligation to obtain a permit.
   (d)   Other Users. Any other user directed by the POTW to complete and
submit a user permit application shall do so within 60 days of being so
directed by the POTW and provided a form by the POTW.

   (b)   If a user monitors any pollutant (or measures flow) more frequently
than required by this chapter or a user permit, using the monitoring, sampling
and analytical procedures as required by Section
1044.064, the results of all such additional monitoring shall be included in
any report or notification submitted pursuant to this chapter.
   (c)   The POTW Manager may require that reports, notifications, and other
required documents and data be submitted in a standardized format, as specified
by the POTW Manager.
   (d)   If the POTW instead of a user collects all of the information,
including flow data, required for a report required by Sections
1044.054 or
1044.055, the POTW Manager may in his or her discretion waive the requirement
that the report be submitted by the user.
   (e)   The reports, notifications, and other documents and data required to
be submitted or maintained by this chapter shall be subject to all of the
provisions as specified by MAC R 323.2310(13).
   (f)   Written reports and notifications will be deemed to have been
submitted to the POTW, unless otherwise specified by the POTW Manager, as
follows:
      (1)   If mailed, on the date postmarked.

notifications which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility
serviced by the United States Postal Service, including, but not limited to,
reports or notifications that are hand-delivered, faxed, or emailed.
      (3)   Written reports and notifications may be submitted to the POTW by
fax or email (or by any means other than mail or hand-delivery) only with the
prior approval of the POTW on a case-by-case basis. The report or notification
shall be sent to the fax number or email address specified by the POTW.
   (g)   All written reports and notifications submitted by mail or hand-
delivery shall be sent or delivered to the following address:
         POTW Manager
         Anthony Ragnone WWTP
         9290 Farrand Road
         Montrose, MI 48457
   (h)   Failure to provide the reports and notifications required by this
chapter constitutes an independent violation of this chapter. However,
compliance with applicable reporting and notification requirements shall not
relieve a user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability that may be
incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to
person or property; nor shall such report or notification relieve a user of any
fines, penalties, or other liability that may be imposed by applicable laws or
regulations. Further, the reporting and notification requirements required by
this chapter shall not be construed to authorize a discharge that exceeds a
discharge prohibition or limitation under this chapter or other applicable laws
or regulations.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.063 SIGNATURE AND CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.
   All written reports and notifications required by this chapter shall be
signed and certified as follows:
   (a)   Required Signatures. The reports and notifications shall be signed by
an “authorized representative” of the user as defined in Section
1044.002.
   (b)   Required Certification. The reports and notifications shall include
the following certification statement:
“I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.”
   (c)   Exception. If the POTW elects to perform instead of the user all or
any portion of the sampling or analysis otherwise required for a report or
notification, the user will not be required to comply with the certification
requirements for the sampling and analysis (or portion thereof) performed by
the POTW.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.064 SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Sections
1044.064 through
1044.073 provide the sampling, analysis and monitoring requirements applicable
to users of the POTW. Those sections do not apply to domestic users except as
may be determined appropriate in a specific case by the POTW. All users
required by this chapter (or by any permit, order, decision or determination
issued or made under this chapter) to sample, monitor and analyze their
discharges to the POTW shall do so according to the minimum requirements
provided by Sections
1044.064 through
1044.073. Additional or more restrictive sampling, analytical or monitoring
requirements may be required for a particular User by a permit, order, decision
or determination issued or made under this chapter.
   (b)   All sampling, measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics
of discharges to the POTW shall be performed in accordance with the procedures
approved by the U.S. EPA contained in 40 CFR part 136. If, as determined by the
POTW Manager, the sampling and analytical techniques contained in 40 CFR part
136 are not available, do not apply to the discharge or pollutants in question,
are not appropriate under the circumstances for application to the discharge or
pollutants in question, or where one or more alternate techniques are available
under 40 CFR part 136, sampling and analysis shall be performed using validated
sampling and analytical methods and procedures approved or required by the POTW
Manager.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.065 SAMPLING FREQUENCY.
   Users shall sample their discharges to the POTW at a frequency necessary to
assess and assure compliance with the requirements of this chapter, any permit
or order issued pursuant to this chapter, all applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements, other applicable state and federal laws and regulations, or
as otherwise determined necessary by the POTW Manager consistent with the
purposes and intent of this chapter. At a minimum, all significant industrial
users shall sample their effluent two times per year (once every six months) or
as often as provided by their permits, whichever is more frequent, and report
the results to the POTW. Each discharge point to the POTW shall be sampled and
reported individually.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.066 SAMPLE TYPES.
   Where representative samples are required to be taken, a user shall take a
minimum of four grab samples for pH, temperature, cyanide, phenols (T),
residual chlorine, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics (and any
other parameters designated by the POTW Manager), unless a lesser or greater
number of grab samples is approved or required in advance by the POTW Manager.
Grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous maximum
discharge limits. For all other pollutants and sampling, 24-hour composite
samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques. The POTW Manager may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for
any user that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the POTW Manager that flow-
proportional sampling is infeasible. If flow-proportional sampling is waived,
samples may instead be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling
techniques, or through a minimum of four grab samples, if the user demonstrates
to the satisfaction of the Manager that this will provide a representative
sample of the effluent being discharged.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.067 SAMPLING METHODS, EQUIPMENT AND LOCATION.
   A user shall use the sampling methods, sampling equipment, and sampling
location specified by the user’s user permit, or, in the absence of a permit,
as required by the POTW Manager.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.068 COSTS OF MONITORING, SAMPLING AND ANALYSES.
   All required monitoring, taking of samples, and sample analyses, whether
performed by the POTW or by a user, including, but not limited to, the costs or
fees associated with inspection or surveillance, shall be at the sole cost of
the user.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.069 SELF-MONITORING.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, self-monitoring shall be
conducted by each nondomestic user to ensure compliance with all applicable
requirements of this chapter and other applicable laws and regulations.
   (b)   A user performing its own sampling shall submit the samples for
analysis to a laboratory (which may include the user’s own laboratory) approved
by the POTW.
   (c)   A user performing its own sampling or monitoring shall record and
maintain for all samples and monitoring the date, exact location (which shall
match sampling locations identified in the user’s user permit, as applicable),
time (including start time and stop time) and method of sampling or
measurement, and the name(s) of person(s) taking the samples or measurements;
sampler programming information; the sample preservation techniques or
procedures used; the mil chain-of-custody for each sample; the dates the
analyses were performed and completed; who performed the analyses; the
analytical techniques and methods used; the detection limits and/or
quantification level used per parameter; quality assurance/quality control (QA/
QC) procedures used and QA/QC data; and the results of the analyses.
   (d)   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall
notify the POTW Manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The
user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the POTW within 30 days after becoming aware of the
violation, except that the user shall not be required to resample if (a) the
POTW performs sampling at the user at a frequency of at least once per month,
or (b) the POTW performs sampling at the user between the time when the user
performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results
of the sampling that indicates the violation.
   (e)   If a user uses its own laboratory for sample analysis, the POTW
Manager may require the user to send split samples to an independent laboratory
at a frequency specified by the Manager as a quality control check.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.070 SAMPLING AND ANALYSES PERFORMED BV POTW.
   (a)   The sampling and analysis required by this chapter may be performed by
the POTW instead of the user, as determined necessary by the POTW Manager for
purposes of this chapter. The POTW shall provide the user with copies of
analytical results prepared by the POTW. If the results of any sampling and
analysis performed by the POTW instead of the user show that a pretreatment
standard has been violated, the POTW shall provide the user with copies of the
analytical results within 10 days after the results are available.
   (b)   If the POTW performs the required sampling and analysis for a user,
the user shall pay a sampling fee to the POTW to fully reimburse the POTW for
the sampling, including administrative and overhead costs. The POTW may
contract with an independent firm to perform the sampling and analysis and the
user shall fully reimburse the POTW for amounts paid by the POTW to the
independent firm.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.071 SPLIT SAMPLES AND SAMPLE RESULTS.
   (a)   If requested by the POTW, the POTW shall be provided with splits of
any sample taken by a user. Splits shall be provided by the user to the POTW at
no cost to the POTW.
   (b)   If requested by a user prior to the collection of a sample of the
user’s discharge, the POTW shall leave a portion of the sample of the discharge
taken from any sampling point on or adjacent to the premises for the user’s
independent analysis.
   (c)   In cases of disputes arising over split samples, the portion taken and
analyzed by the POTW shall be controlling unless proven invalid. The burden of
proving the POTW’s results invalid shall be on the user and at the user’s sole
cost.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.072 MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND CALIBRATION OF EQUIPMENT.
   (a)   A user who performs self-monitoring shall contract with an independent
company (unless the requirement to use an independent company is waived in
advance by the POTW Manager as determined appropriate by the Manager) to
maintain, repair, and calibrate the sampling and flow measurement equipment and
instruments used to monitor the user.
   (b)   The maintenance, repair, and calibration shall be performed as often
as necessary to ensure that monitoring data is accurate and representative, and
consistent with the accepted capability of the type of equipment used, and
shall be at the sole cost of the user.
   (c)   A user shall keep a complete and accurate written record of all
calibrations, inspections and maintenance done (including, without limitation,
the date and time of the activity, a description of what was done and the
methods used, the names of persons conducting the activity, and any required or
recommended follow-up). The record shall also include a description of all
problems discovered regarding the equipment whether in response to a regularly
scheduled inspection or otherwise.
   (d)   The POTW, in any event, may inspect and test a user’s sampling and
flow measurement equipment and instruments at all reasonable times.
   (e)   In no case shall a user’s failure to keep its equipment, instruments
and facilities in good working order constitute grounds for the user to claim
that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.073 REQUIRED SAMPLING STRUCTURES AND DEVICES.
   (a)   The POTW may require any user to install at each discharge point a
suitable control structure (such as a manhole or sampling vault) and necessary
measuring and sampling devices (including automatic devices) to facilitate the
observation, sampling, and measurement of the quantity, composition, and
concentrations of discharges to the POTW. The structure and devices shall be
maintained at all times in a safe, clean and proper operating condition at the
sole expense of the user.
   (b)   There shall be ample room in or near the control structure to allow
accurate monitoring, measuring, sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis, as determined necessary by the POTW Manager. At a minimum, all sewers
shall have an inspection and sampling manhole or structure with an opening of
no less than 24 inches in diameter and an internal diameter of no less than 36
inches containing flow measuring, recording and sampling equipment as required
by the POTW Manager to assure compliance with this chapter.
   (c)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction for safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the verbal or written request of the POTW. The costs of clearing such access
shall be born by the user.
   (d)   The location and complexity of the required control structure or
devices may vary with sampling requirements determined necessary by the POTW
Manager to protect the POTW and to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
   (e)   The required sampling structures and devices shall be constructed and
installed at the user’s sole expense in accordance with plans submitted to the
POTW, and in compliance with all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the POTW, or within such other shorter or longer time
period specified by the POTW Manager as required by the particular
circumstances to meet the requirements of this chapter. The structures and
devices shall be operated and maintained by the user at the user’s sole expense
so as to be safe and accessible to POTW personnel during all reasonable times
and so as to provide accurate and representative monitoring data. If a user
fails to install or maintain a required structure or device, the POTW may do so
and charge the costs to the user.
   (f)   The sampling structures and devices must be provided on the user’s
premises as approved by the POTW, but the POTW may, if it determines that such
a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship to the user, allow the
facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so
that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
   (g)   Samples shall be taken at a control structure approved by the POTW.
However, in the absence of a suitable control structure as required by this
section, samples shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if pretreatment facilities exist, or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment facilities exist. If other wastewaters are
mixed with a regulated process wastestream prior to pretreatment, the user must
measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined
wastestream formula under MAC R 323.2311(7) or other methods required by the
POTW to evaluate compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements.
   (h)   No user shall change monitoring points without first notifying and
receiving the approval of the POTW Manager. The POTW Manager shall not approve
any change in a user’s monitoring point or points that would allow the user to
substitute dilution for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with
applicable standards.

user seeking to establish the affirmative defenses provided by MAC R 323.2303
(3) shall have the burden of proof.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.085 BYPASS NOT VIOLATING APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT STANDARDS OR
REQUIREMENTS.
   A nondomestic user may allow any bypass to occur that does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if the bypass
is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. A bypass that meets
the requirements of the preceding sentence of this section is not subject to
the provisions in Sections
1044.086 through
1044.088. However, nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize a
discharge that exceeds a discharge prohibition or limitation under this chapter
or other applicable laws or regulations; nor to relieve a user for any expense,
loss, damage, or liability that may be incurred as a result of the bypass, such
as damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property;
nor to relieve the user of any fines, penalties or other liability that may be
imposed by applicable laws or regulations as a result of the bypass.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.086 BYPASS PROHIBITED.
   Except as provided by Section
1044.085, the bypass of industrial wastes from any portion of a user’s facility
is prohibited, and shall be subject to enforcement action, unless all of the
following apply:
   (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or
severe property damage.
   (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of
auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated waste, or maintenance
during normal periods of equipment downtime. (This condition is not satisfied
if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass that occurred during normal
periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance.)
   (c)   The user submitted the notices as required under Section
1044.087.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.087 REQUIRED NOTICES.
   (a)   Anticipated Bypass. If a user knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it must submit prior notice of the bypass to the POTW. Such notice
shall be submitted to the POTW as soon as the user becomes aware of the need
for the bypass, and if possible, at least ten days before the date of the
bypass.
   (b)   Unanticipated Bypass. A user shall submit oral notice of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW
within 24 hours from the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes
aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and
times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW Manager may waive the written
report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24
hours.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.088 POTW APPROVED BYPASS.
   The POTW Manager may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its
adverse effects, if the Manager determines that it meets the conditions set
forth in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of Section
1044.086. It shall be a violation of this chapter for a user to allow an
anticipated bypass to occur without the prior approval of the Manager.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.089 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

with an order is unintentional and temporary and due to factors beyond the
reasonable control of a user, and the user can demonstrate the conditions
necessary for demonstration of an upset as provided by Section
1044.083(a), the POTW Manager may modify the order or take other actions as
determined appropriate. However, a user shall not be relieved of liability for
noncompliance with an order to the extent caused by operational error,
improperly designed or inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative
maintenance, or careless or improper operation.

1044.109 NUMBER OF VIOLATIONS.
   The number of violations resulting from a user’s noncompliance with
applicable discharge prohibitions or effluent limitations shall be determined
as follows:
   (a)   Applicable concentration limitations and mass (or loading) limitations
shall be treated as separate limitations, and a user may be liable and
penalized separately for exceeding any of those limitations for a single
pollutant or sampling parameter.
   (b)   Each violation of a daily maximum limit for a single pollutant or
sampling parameter shall constitute a separate violation for each day on which
the violation occurs or continues.
   (c)   Each violation of an instantaneous maximum limit for a single
pollutant or sampling parameter shall constitute a separate violation for each
such occurrence, and there may be multiple violations for each day on which
such a violation occurs or continues.
   (d)   Each violation of a monthly average limit (or of some other average
limit period) for a single pollutant or sampling parameter shall constitute a
separate violation for each day of the month (or other stated period) during
which the violation occurred, regardless of the number of days on which samples
were actually taken. (For example, in a month with 31 days, a violation of the
monthly average limit for that month constitutes 31 violations for each
pollutant parameter for which the monthly average limit was exceeded during the
month.)
   (e)   If a user permit regulates more than one outfall, each outfall shall
be considered separately in computing the number of violations as provided by
this section.

   (g)   Other charges or fees for services or procedures performed by the POTW
as are required by law.
   (h)   Such other charges or fees as the POTW may deem necessary to perform
fully the provisions of applicable federal and state laws, this chapter, rules
and regulations issued or adopted pursuant to law or ordinance, and terms and
conditions of service.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.125 IPP FEE AMOUNTS.
   IPP fees shall be paid by users to the POTW in amounts determined necessary
by the POTW from time to time to reimburse the POTW for all expenses incurred
by the POTW in administering the IPP. To the extent practical, the fees shall
be set in an amount to include at least the POTW’s average total costs for that
purpose. With regard to IPP activities undertaken by the POTW with regard to
particular users, the fees shall be charged to the users on a time and
materials basis, plus general administrative expenses, based on the nature and
requirements of the IPP activities undertaken.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.126 SURCHARGES.
   (a)   Surcharges are intended to reimburse the POTW for all costs incurred
by the POTW in handling or treating a discharge which contains pollutants in
excess of specified surcharge concentrations, loadings or other applicable
limits.
   (b)   Any user exceeding applicable surcharge limitations or other
applicable limits shall be subject to the imposition of one or more surcharges
as provided by this section to reimburse the POTW for any costs or expenses,
direct or indirect, the POTW may incur in handling or treating the discharge,
or which may be imposed upon the POTW, where the exceedence of applicable
limits causes or contributes to those costs or expense.
   (c)   The amount of a surcharge assessed shall be as specified in the
surcharge rate schedule and associated surcharge provisions prepared by the
POTW and approved from time-to-time by the POTW.
   (d)   All violations of applicable discharge prohibitions and limitations
and all instances of noncompliance with applicable discharge requirements shall
constitute a violation of this chapter, subject to applicable fines, penalties
and other enforcement actions provided by this chapter. In no event shall the
imposition of a surcharge for a discharge which does not meet the applicable
prohibitions, limitations or requirements be construed as authorizing the
illegal discharge or otherwise excuse a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.127 BILLING AND COLLECTION OF IPP FEES.
   User permit application fees shall be due upon submission of permit
applications. All other IPP fees shall be due within 30 days of the date of the
activity or service for which the fee is required. For fees not paid at the
time of service, the amount of the fee shall be added to the user’s waste
service charge or billed separately. IPP fees provided for by Sections
1044.123 through
1044.127 shall be billed, collected and enforced pursuant to the procedures as
provided by POTW for sewerage system rates and charges as provided by Sections
1044.128 through
1044.139 and/or as otherwise established by the POTW.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.128 SEWER RATES AND COUNTY CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FEE (CCIF).
   The County Agency shall prescribe the base rates of the county for sewer
service and other county sewer charges for all Local Units that discharge to
the POTW (with the Local Units prescribing the rates and charges to be paid by
the individual users located within each Local Unit). The County Agency may
impose a one-time County Capital Improvement Fee (CCIF) for each new direct or
indirect connection to the POTW as a method for financing the costs of
construction and related expenses of any expansion to the POTW on and after
that date. The sewer rates, charges, and CCIF shall be subject to revision from
time to time.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.129 SEWER USAGE CHARGES AND CCIF; METERING; ESTIMATES.
   (a)   The usage charges of the county for sewer service to a user’s premises
connected to the POTW shall be determined by applying the base sewer rate
established by the County Agency to the quantity of wastewater discharged from
the premises during each billing cycle. If the source of fresh water to a
user’s premises is by connection to a public water supply system, the quantity
of wastewater discharged from the premises shall be deemed the equivalent of
the quantity of fresh water supplied to the premises as measured by the water
meter connected to the premises’ water supply line.
   (b)   The usage charges of the county for domestic sewer service to a
single-family detached residential dwelling without metered water is a flat
rate charge assessed each billing cycle. The flat rate is based on an estimate
of the quantity of fresh water supplied to a single-family detached residential
dwelling for domestic use during a billing cycle multiplied by the base sewer
rate.
   (c)   The usage charges of the county for nondomestic sewer service to a
premises without metered water shall be determined by applying the number of
residential equivalent units (REUs) assigned to the type or classification of
use or uses on the premises by the County Agency to the established flat rate.
REUs are factors or multipliers assigned to nondomestic users by type or
classification of user, which factors or multipliers are generally accepted and
used by water and/or sewer service providers when metering has not been used.
The Table of Residential Equivalent Units is published and kept on file by, and
available upon request to, the County Agency.
   (d)   If the source of fresh water to a nondomestic user’s premises is by
connection to a private well, beginning with new connections to the POTW on and
after January 1, 2007, the user must, as a condition of connection to the POTW,
install, at the user’s sole expense, a water meter on the water supply line to
the premises. The quantity of wastewater discharged from the premises shall be
deemed the equivalent of the fresh water supplied to the premises as measured
by the water meter connected to the premises’ water supply line.
   (e)   A domestic user or nondomestic user with a premises that was connected
to the POTW before January 1, 2007, which premises has its fresh water supplied
from a private well without metering its water use may, at any time thereafter,
and at the user’s sole expense, install a water meter. The quantity of water
measured by the meter shall, from that time forward, be used in determining the
quantity of wastewater discharged from the premises.
   (f)   A water meter that has been installed shall not be removed or replaced
without the prior approval of the county; nor shall the meter be bypassed,
tampered with, or otherwise rendered inoperable or inaccurate in any way by any
person. Further, each water meter shall be installed, maintained in good
working order, and kept calibrated at all times by the user at the user’s sole
expense.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.130 SEWER CAPACITY PURCHASE (CCIF).
   (a)   The County Capital Improvement Fee (CCIF) is a one-time fee assessed,
if at all, at the time of application for connection to the POTW by applying
the established CCIF rate to the unit or number of REUs assigned by the County
Agency to a classification of user. One unit is based upon a peak hour use. A
peak hour use of 52.5 gallons per hour (1,260 gallons per day) is one unit. A
single-family detached residential dwelling is considered one unit. The number
of units assigned per connection to a nondomestic building is determined by one
of two ways:
      (1)   Using existing water usage records from metering, identifying the
peak hourly usage and dividing by 52.5 and dividing again by the percentage of
occupancy at time of usage yields the number of units.
      (2)   If metering data is not available, the County Agency shall assign
the number of units based upon the approved site plan and the Table of
Residential Equivalent Units.
   (b)   All connections (whether domestic or nondomestic) shall be assigned at
least one unit. Any partial units will be rounded up to the next whole number.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.131 DOMESTIC USE OF A PREMISES; NONDOMESTIC USE OF A PREMISES.
   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided by other provisions of
this chapter, and solely for the purpose of calculating rates, charges, and
fees as provided by Sections
1044.128 through
1044.139, the only use of a premises that shall be considered a domestic use
shall be use for a single-family detached dwelling; all other uses of a
premises, including but not limited to, all other residential uses such as
multiple-family residential dwellings, shall be considered nondomestic uses for
the purpose of calculating rates, charges, and fees as provided by Sections
1044.128 through
1044.139.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.132 REVIEW OF NON-METERED USAGE CHARGES AND CCIF; MANDATORY METERING.
   (a)   If a nondomestic user requests review by the Genesee County Board of
Review of usage charges for sewer service and/or the CCIF, which charges or
CCIF are based on the application of REUs due to the absence of metering, the
user shall, at its sole expense, be required to install a meter capable of
reading and recording instantaneous (peak hour) flow of water on the water
supply line to the building before consideration by the Board of Review. Upon
installation of the water meter, the usage charges of the county for sewer
service shall thereafter be determined as set forth in Section
1044.129.
   (b)   If a single-family detached dwelling user requests review by the
Genesee County Board of Review of usage charges for sewer service based on use
of the flat rate, the user shall, at the user’s sole expense, be required to
install a water meter on the water supply line of the dwelling before
consideration by the Board of Review of the user’s request for review. Upon
installation of the water meter, the usage charges of the county for sewer
service shall thereafter be determined as set forth in Section
1044.129.
   (c)   If, during the two-year period before metering, the county’s sewer use
charges paid by a domestic or nondomestic user exceeded the county’s sewer use
charges paid by that user following two years of metering, and the use of the
premises at the time of metering was substantially the same as its use by that
user before metering, the County Agency shall refund to that user the amount of
the difference between what was paid by that user for the county’s charges for
the two-year period before metering and what was paid by that user for the
county’s charges after two years of metering provided, however, that the Board
of Review has not previously finally adjusted the user’s sewer service charges.
   (d)   Conversely, if it is determined that the county’s sewer use charges
paid by that user for the two-year period prior to metering were less than what
was charged following two years of metering, the County Agency may
retroactively adjust the usage charges of the county by adding the amount of
the difference to the charges assessed the Local Unit for county sewer service.
The Local Unit shall apportion the adjusted amount as equally as possible on
future bills for sewer service to that user over a two-year period.
   (e)   Similarly, a nondomestic user requesting the Board of Review to grant
a refund of a portion of the CCIF paid by the user, which CCIF was based on the
application of REUs in accordance with Section
1044.130(a)(2), shall be entitled to a refund of a portion of the CCIF paid if,
following two years of metering, the application of the formula stated above in
Section
1044.130(a)(1) to the meter data collected shows that the user overpaid the
CCIF. In that event, the User shall be refunded the difference between the CCIF
paid by application of the REUs and the amount determined by the metering data
collected. If the meter data discloses that the CCIF charged to that user was
less than what would have been charged had the data been available, the County
Agency may require that user to pay the amount of the underpayment.
   (f)   A challenge to the CCIF must be filed before the next regularly
scheduled meeting of the Board of Review or the challenge shall be barred as
untimely.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.133 COLLECTION ACTION.
   The POTW and/or the Local Unit may in any court having jurisdiction in the
premises initiate an action for the collection of unpaid sewer service rates or
charges, and to recover court costs and reasonable attorney fees. With respect
to the collection of sewerage system rates and charges, the POTW and the Local
Unit shall have all powers granted to them by applicable state and federal
laws, rules and regulations.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.134 SEPARATE BOOKS, RECORDS AND ACCOUNTS; AUDIT.
   The POTW shall maintain and keep books of records and accounts, separate
from all other records and accounts, in which shall be made full and correct
entries of all matters relating to the sewerage system and to the wastewater
treatment plant. An annual audit of such books of record and accounts for the
preceding operating year shall be by an independent certified public
accountant. The operating year of the POTW shall commence on January 1 and
shall end on December 31.

1044.135 ANNUAL REVIEW OF RATES, FEES, CHARGES AND SURCHARGES.
   In conjunction with the annual sewerage works audit of the POTW, the POTW
shall review sewer rates, fees, charges, and surcharges for the purpose of
meeting anticipated expenditures for the following operating year.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.136 ANNUAL REVIEW OF NONDOMESTIC USERS.
   A review shall be performed by the POTW at the end of each operating year of
the classifications of all nondomestic users.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.137 INSURANCE.
   The POTW shall obtain and maintain in full force and effect insurance on the
physical properties of the sewerage works. The insurance shall be of the kinds
and in the amounts as are customarily carried by public entities engaged in the
operation of public sewage disposal systems. All monies received for losses
under any such insurance coverages shall be used solely for the repair,
restoration or replacement of the sewerage system or of the wastewater
treatment plant.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.138 SERVICE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
   The terms and conditions of sewerage system use and/or service shall be as
prescribed by the POTW; provided, however, that such terms and conditions shall
not be less stringent than federal or state laws or regulations issued pursuant
thereto by governmental agencies having jurisdiction in the premises. The terms
and conditions of sewerage system services shall include a provision for the
discontinuance of service in the event of non-payment or delinquency in payment
of sewer service rates or charges.
1044.139 LIEN.
   The Local Unit and POTW shall have as security for the collection of
sewerage system rates or charges a lien upon the real property to which service
is provided. Such lien shall become effective immediately upon the supplying of
the sewerage system service, and shall be enforceable as provided by law.
(Ord. 2009-02. Passed 5-11-09.)
1044.140 USER INVENTORY AND OTHER INFORMATION.
   The Local Unit shall provide information (or access thereto) as requested by
the County Agency regarding discharges from users located within the Local

illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
      (2)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (3)   A person is considered to be in violation of this subchapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue.
(Ord. 2014-06. Passed 7-14-14; Ord. 2018-08. Passed 6-25-18.)
1046.57 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (a)   Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The City
of Davison may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person
when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or Waters of
the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps
as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of the
United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
   (b)   Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this subchapter may have their MS4
access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit
discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the
proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the
authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
      A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the
authorized enforcement agency.
(Ord. 2014-06. Passed 7-14-14.)
1046.58 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person or party subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
storm water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to
the City of Davison prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. Also, see
the City’s adopted ordinance 2014-03, Chapter 1047.
(Ord. 2014-06. Passed 7-14-14.)
1046.59 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (a)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
   (b)   Access to Facilities.
      (1)   The City of Davison shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this subchapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this subchapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement
agency.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the City of Davison ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES
permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties
as defined by State and Federal law.
      (3)   The City of Davison shall have the right to set up on any permitted
facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized
enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility’s
storm water discharge.
      (4)   The City of Davison has the right to require the discharger to
install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to
measure storm-water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the City of Davison and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the City of Davison access to a
permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this
subchapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to
discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if
the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the
permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this subchapter.
      (7)   If the City of Davison has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which storm-water is discharged, and the City is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
subchapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
subchapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement
agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction.
(Ord. 2014-06. Passed 7-14-14.)
1046.60 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The City of Davison will adopt requirements identifying Best Management
Practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or
contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain
system, or Waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or
industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural
and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated
with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed in
compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a
storm-water pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with
requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 2014-06. Passed 7-14-14.)
1046.61 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person’s lessee, shall reasonably keep and maintain that part of the
watercourse within the property free of their trash and debris, that would
pollute or contaminate the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall
maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a
watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 2014-06. Passed 7-14-14.)
1046.62 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or Waters of the U.S.
said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized
enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the City of Davison within three business days
of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for
at least three years.
(Ord. 2014-06. Passed 7-14-14.)
1046.63 ENFORCEMENT.
   Notice of Violation.
   Whenever the City of Davison finds that a person has violated a prohibition
or failed to meet a requirement of this subchapter, the authorized enforcement
agency may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible
person or party. Such notice may require without limitation:
   (a)   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
   (b)   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;

desist;
   (d)   The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or contamination
hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
   (e)   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and
   (f)   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation
or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should
the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the
work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the
expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.
(Ord. 2014-06. Passed 7-14-14.)
1046.64 APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation may appeal the determination of
the authorized enforcement agency. The notice of appeal must be received within
15 days from the date of the Notice of Violation. Hearing on the appeal before
the appropriate authority or his/her designee shall take place within 15 days
from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the municipal
authority or their designee shall be final.
(Ord. 2014-06. Passed 7-14-14.)
1046.65 ENFORCEMENT MEASURES AFTER APPEAL.

STORM WATER
1047.001 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the “City of Davison Storm Water Management
Ordinance” and may be so cited.
(Ord. 2015-01. Passed 1-26-15.)
1047.002 FINDINGS.
   The City of Davison finds that:
   (a)   Water bodies, roadways, structures, and other property within, and
downstream of the City of Davison are at times subjected to flooding;
   (b)   Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is
also a danger to the natural resources of the City of Davison and the region;
   (c)   Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds,
resulting in increased storm water runoff rates and volumes, increased
flooding, increased stream channel erosion, and increased sediment transport
and deposition;
   (d)   Storm water runoff produced by land development contributes to
increased quantities of water-borne pollutants;
   (e)   Increases of storm water runoff, soil erosion, and non-point source
pollution have occurred as a result of land development, and cause
deterioration of the water resources of the City of Davison and downstream
municipalities;
   (f)   Storm water runoff, soil erosion, and non-point source pollution, due
to land development within the City of Davison have resulted in a deterioration
of the water resources of the City of Davison and downstream municipalities;
   (g)   Increased storm water runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments and
pollutants associated with storm water runoff from future development projects
within the City of Davison will, absent reasonable regulation and control,
adversely affect the City of Davison’s water bodies and water resources, and
those of downstream municipalities;
   (h)   Storm water runoff, soil erosion, and non-point source pollution can
be controlled and minimized by the regulation of storm water runoff from
development;
   (i)   Adopting the standards, criteria and procedures contained in this
chapter and implementing the same will address many of the deleterious effects
of storm water runoff;
   (j)   Adopting these standards is necessary for the preservation of the
public health, safety and welfare.
(Ord. 2015-01. Passed 1-26-15.)
1047.003 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to establish minimum storm water
management requirements and controls to accomplish, among others, the following
objectives:
   (a)   To reduce artificially induced flood damage;
   (b)   To minimize increased storm water runoff rates and volumes from
identified new land development;
   (c)   To minimize the deterioration of existing watercourses, culverts and
bridges, and other structures;
   (d)   To encourage water recharge into the ground where geologically
favorable conditions exist;
   (e)   To prevent an increase in non- point source pollution;
   (f)   To maintain the integrity of stream channels for their biological
functions, as well as for drainage and other purposes;
   (g)   To minimize the impact of development upon stream bank and streambed
stability;
   (h)   To reduce erosion from development or construction projects;
   (i)   To preserve and protect water supply facilities and water resources by
means of controlling increased flood discharges, stream erosion, and runoff
pollution; and
   (j)   To reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, and non-
point source pollution, wherever practicable, from lands that were developed
without storm water management controls meeting the purposes and standards of
this chapter.
   (k)   To reduce the adverse impact of changing land use on water bodies and,
to that end, this chapter establishes minimum standards to protect water bodies
from degradation resulting from changing land use where there are insufficient
storm water management controls.
(Ord. 2015-01. Passed 1-26-15.)
1047.004 APPLICABILITY, EXEMPTIONS AND GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   To prevent an increase in non-point source pollution, this chapter shall
apply to any earth-disturbing activities greater than or equal to one acre for
new development or redevelopment projects or earth disturbing activities less
than one acre on parcels with greater than or equal to 50% impervious surface
which will alter storm water drainage characteristics of the development site.
Typically these developments require approval of a plat, a site development
plan, building permit, and other permits to be obtained. However, this chapter
shall not apply to the following:
   (a)   Development on one single-family lot, parcel, or condominium unit
where the City of Davison determines that due to the size of the development
site or other circumstances, the quantity, quality, and or rate of storm water
flow does not materially alter storm water flow from the property in terms of
rate and/or volume.
   (b)   The installation or removal of individual mobile homes within a mobile
home park. This exemption shall not be construed to apply to the construction,
expansion, or modification of a mobile home park.
   (c)   Ongoing farm operations such as tilling or plowing. Earth disturbances
that are not directly related to farming are not exempt from this chapter.
   (d)   Plats with preliminary plat approval and other developments with final
land use approval prior to the effective date of this chapter, where such
approvals remain in effect.

Ch. 1220
1222.01 MASTER PLAN FOR PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT OF CITY.
   It shall be the function and duty of the Planning Commission to make and
adopt a Master Plan for the physical development of the Municipality, including
any area outside of its boundaries which, in the Commission's judgment, bears
relation to the planning of such Municipality. Such Plan, with accompanying
maps, plats, charts and descriptive matter, shall show the Commission's
recommendation for the development of such territory, including, among other
things, the general location, character and the extent of streets, viaducts,
bridges, waterways, boulevards, parkways, playgrounds and open spaces, the
general location of public buildings and other public property, and the general
location and extent of public utilities and terminals, whether publicly or
privately owned or operated, for water, light, sanitation, transportation,
communication, power and other purposes; also the removal, relocation,
widening, narrowing, vacating, abandonment, change of use or extension of any
of the foregoing ways, grounds, open spaces, buildings, property, utilities or
terminals; the general location, character, layout and extent of community
centers and neighborhood units; and the general character, extent and layout of
the replanning and redevelopment of blighted districts and slum areas; as well
as the zoning plan for the control of height, area, location and use of
buildings and premises. As the work of making the whole Master Plan progresses,
the Commission may from time to time adopt and publish a part or parts thereof,
any such part to cover one or more major section or division of the
Municipality or for one or more of the aforesaid or other functional matters to
be included in the Plan. The Commission may from time to time amend, extend or
add to the Plan.
1222.02 SURVEYS AND STUDIES.
   In the preparation of the Master Plan, the Planning Commission shall make
careful and comprehensive surveys and studies of present conditions and future
growth of the Municipality with due regard to its relation to the neighboring
territory. The Plan shall be made with the general purpose of guiding and
accomplishing a coordinated, adjusted and harmonious development of the
Municipality and its environs which will, in accordance with present and future
needs, best promote health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity and
general welfare, as well as efficiency and economy in the process of
development, including, among other things, adequate provision for traffic, the
promotion of safety from fire and other dangers, adequate provision for light
and air, the promotion of the healthful and convenient distribution of
population, the promotion of good civic design and arrangement, wise and
efficient expenditure of public funds, and the adequate provision of public
utilities and other public requirements.
1222.03 PROCEDURE FOR ADOPTION AND AMENDMENT.
   The Planning Commission may adopt the Master Plan as a whole by a single
resolution or may, by successive resolutions, adopt successive parts of the
Plan, such parts corresponding with major geographical sections or divisions of
the Municipality or with functional subdivisions of the subject matter of the
Plan. In addition, the Commission may adopt any amendment or extension of the
Plan or an addition thereto. Before the adoption of the Plan or any such part,
amendment, extension or addition, the Commission shall hold at least one public
hearing thereon, notice of the time and place of which shall be given, not less
than fifteen days prior to such hearing, by one publication in a newspaper of
general circulation in the Municipality and by registered United States mail to
each public utility company and to each railroad company owning or operating
any public utility or railroad within the geographical sections or divisions of
the Municipality affected. The adoption of the Plan or of any such part of
amendment or extension or addition shall be by resolution of the Commission
carried by the affirmative votes of not less than six members of the
Commission. The resolution shall refer expressly to the maps and descriptive
and other matter intended by the Commission to form the whole or part of the
Plan, and the action taken shall be recorded on the map and Plan and
descriptive matter by the identifying signature of the Chairman and/or
Secretary of the Commission. An attested copy of the Plan or part thereof shall
be certified to Council and to the County Register of Deeds. An attested copy
of the Plan or parts thereof shall be certified to Council.
1222.04 PUBLIC WORKS; APPROVAL BY COMMISSION; DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.
   Whenever the Planning Commission has adopted the Master Plan of the
Municipality or of one or more major sections or districts thereof, no public
way, square, park, ground, open space, building or structure shall be
constructed or authorized in the Municipality or in such planned section and
district until the location, character and extent thereof has been submitted to
and approved by the Commission. In case of disapproval, the Commission shall
communicate its reasons to Council, which shall have the power to overrule such
disapproval by a recorded vote of not less than two-thirds of its entire
membership. If the public way, ground, space, building, structure or utility is
one the authorization or financing of which does not, under the law or Charter
provisions governing the same, fall within the province of Council, then the
submission to the Planning Commission shall be by the board, commission or body
having such jurisdiction, and the Planning Commission's disapproval may be
overruled by such board, commission or body by a vote of not less than two-
thirds of its membership. The failure of the Commission to act within sixty
days from and after the date of official submission to the Commission shall be
deemed approval. For the purpose of furthering the desirable future development
of the Municipality under the Master Plan, the Planning Commission, after
adopting a Master Plan, shall prepare coordinated and comprehensive programs of
public structures and improvements. The Commission shall annually prepare such
a program for the ensuing six years, which program shall show those public
structures and improvements, in the general order of their priority, which, in
the Commission's judgment, will be needed or desirable and can be undertaken
within the six-year period. The above comprehensive coordinated programs shall
be based upon the requirements of the community for all types of public
improvements and, to that end, each agency or department of the Municipality
concerned with such improvements shall, upon request, furnish the Commission
with lists, plans and estimates of time and cost of public structures and
improvements within the purview of such agency or department.
1222.05 RESCISSION OF ACTION BY COUNCIL.
   Whenever Council has ordered the opening, widening or extension of any
street, avenue or boulevard, or whenever Council has ordered that proceedings
be instituted for the acquisition or enlargement of any park, playground,
playfield or other public open space, such action of Council shall not be
rescinded until after the matter has been referred back to the Planning
Commission for a report and until after a public hearing has been held. Council
shall have the power to overrule the recommendations of the Planning Commission
by a vote of not less than two-thirds of its entire membership.
1222.06 PUBLICITY AND EDUCATION; GIFTS; COOPERATION FROM OFFICIALS.
   The Planning Commission shall have the power to promote public interest in
and understanding of the Master Plan and to that end may publish and distribute
copies of the Plan or of any report and may employ such other means of
publicity and education as it may determine. Members of the Commission, when
duly authorized by the Commission, may attend city planning conferences or
meetings of city planning institutes or hearings upon pending city planning
legislation, and the Commission may, by resolution spread upon its minutes, pay
the reasonable traveling expenses incident to such attendance. The Commission
shall, from time to time, recommend to the appropriate public officials
programs for public structures and improvements and for the financing thereof.
It shall be part of its duties to consult and advise with public officials and
agencies, public utility companies, civic, educational, professional and other
organizations, and citizens, relative to protecting or carrying out the Plan.
The Commission shall have the right to accept and use gifts for the exercise of
its functions. All public officials shall, upon request, furnish to the
Commission, within a reasonable time, such available information as it may
require for its work. The Commission and its members, officers and employees,
in the performance of their functions, may enter upon any land, make
examinations and surveys and place and maintain necessary monuments and marks
thereon. In general, the Commission shall have such powers as may be necessary
to enable it to fulfill its functions, promote Municipal planning and carry out
the purposes of this chapter.
1222.07 APPROVAL OF SUBDIVISION PLATS.
   Whenever the Planning Commission has adopted a Master Plan relating to the
major street system of the territory within its subdivision, jurisdiction or
part thereof, and has filed a certified copy of such Plan in the office of the
County Register of Deeds of the county in which such territory or part is
located, then no plat of a subdivision of land within such territory or part
shall be filed or recorded until it has been approved by the Planning
Commission and such approval entered in writing on the plat by the Chairman or
Secretary of the Commission.

safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare of the residents of the City;
to provide for the orderly growth and harmonious development of the City
consistent with the Master Plan or such portions thereof as have been
promulgated; to secure adequate traffic circulation through coordinated street
systems so as to lessen congestion on the streets and highways; to ensure
adequate provisions for water, drainage and sanitary sewer facilities and other

individual lots; to facilitate the further subdivision of large tracts into
smaller tracts; and to provide logical procedures for the achievement of these
purposes.

abrogate, annul or in any way impair or interfere with provisions of other laws
or ordinances, or with private restrictions placed upon property by deed,
covenant or other private agreement, or with restrictive covenants running with
the land to which the City is a party. Where these Subdivision Regulations
impose a greater restriction upon land than is imposed or required by existing

   No plat of any subdivision shall be entitled to be recorded in the office of
the County Register of Deeds or have any validity until it has been approved in
the manner prescribed in these Subdivision Regulations. If any such unapproved

accepted by Council. Acceptance of improvements and areas by Council shall be
by resolution upon evidence of completion of all required improvements in
strict compliance with these Subdivision Regulations.
1242.05 REVISION OF PLAT AFTER APPROVAL.

Control Act.
1242.06 FILING FEE.
   The subdivider shall pay a filing fee of sixty dollars ($60.00) for every
proposed plat submitted to Council for approval.
1242.07 VARIANCES.
   (a)   Hardship. The Planning Commission, with concurrence by Council, may
authorize a variance from these Subdivision Regulations when, in its opinion,
undue hardship may result from strict compliance. In granting any variance, the
Commission shall prescribe only conditions that it deems necessary to, or
desirable for, the public interest. In making its findings, as required herein,
the Commission shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of land
and the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside
or work in the proposed subdivision and the probable effect of the proposed
subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. No variance shall be
granted unless the Commission finds that:
      (1)   There are special circumstances or conditions affecting the
property such that the strict application of the provisions of these
Regulations would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his or her
land.
      (2)   The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right of the petitioner.
      (3)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property in the territory in which the property
is situated.
   (b)   Large Scale Development or Complete Neighborhood. The Planning
Commission, with concurrence by Council, may authorize a variance from these
Regulations in the case of a plan for a complete community or neighborhood
which, in the judgment of the Commission, provides adequate public spaces and
includes provisions for efficient circulation, light, air and other needs. In
making its findings, as required herein, the Commission shall take into account
the nature of the proposed use of land and the existing use of land in the
vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision
and the probable effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in
the vicinity. The Commission shall find that:
      (1)   The proposed project will constitute a desirable and stable
community development.
      (2)   The proposed project will be in harmony with adjacent areas and
suitable provisions will be made for access thereto so that the proposed
project will not hinder their future development.
   (c)   Applications Required.
      (1)   Hardship variances. Application for any such variance shall be
submitted in writing by the subdivider at the time the proposed plat is filed
for the consideration of Council. The petition shall state fully the grounds
for the application and all facts relied upon by the petitioner.
      (2)   Large scale development or complete neighborhood variances.
Application for any such variance shall be made in writing by the subdivider at
the time the proposed plat is filed for the consideration of Council, stating
fully and clearly all facts relied upon by the petitioner. Such application
shall be supplemented with maps, plans or other additional data which may aid
the Commission in the analysis of the proposed project. The plans for such
development shall include such covenants, restrictions or other legal
provisions as are necessary to guarantee the full achievement of the plan.

provides for adequate and convenient open spaces for traffic, both vehicular
and pedestrian, utilities, access of fire-fighting apparatus, recreation, light
and air and for the avoidance of congestion of population, including the
minimum width and area of lots. The Commission shall recommend the location of,
and whether there should be, pedestrian crosswalks across blocks over 600 feet

1246.01 CONTENTS.
   The final plat shall have incorporated therein all modifications or
amendments required by the Planning Commission and confirmed by Council;
otherwise, it shall conform to the proposed plat as approved and all
requirements of the Subdivision Control Act. However, only that portion of land
included in the proposed plat which the subdivider proposes to record and
develop at that time may be included in the final plat at the option of the
subdivider, provided that such portion makes possible progressive approval of
contiguous additional portions satisfactory to the Planning Commission and
Council and conforms to all of the requirements of these Subdivision
Regulations. In the latter case, the subdivider shall file a written
application for an extension of time on that portion of the subdivision not
included in the final plat as indicated in Section
1244.12. The final plat shall contain and include at least the following:
   (a)   Form of Map. The form of the final plat map shall be as specified in
the Subdivision Control Act.
   (b)   Information. The map shall contain at least the information required
by the Subdivision Control Act.
1246.02 RESTRICTIONS.
   The plat restrictions as approved by the City Planning Commission and
Council shall be the plat restrictions recorded at the time of recording of the
final plat. The developer shall furnish the City with certified copies of the
recorded plat restrictions.
1246.03 AGREEMENTS AS TO IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   The final plat to be placed on record shall be accompanied by a
statement signed by the owner and subdivider, setting forth the following:
      (1)   Plans and specifications for such improvements previously approved
by the City Manager and the City Engineer clearly describing the same; and
      (2)   Agreements executed by the owner and subdivider wherein they agree
to make and install the improvements provided for in
Chapter 1250, in accordance with the plans and specifications accompanying the
final plat, and to permit such improvements to be inspected during the course
of construction by an inspector appointed by Council, salaries and other costs
in connection with such inspections to be paid by the owner and subdivider,
such costs to be based on the reasonable, customary charges for such service.
   (b)   If Council, by motion, approves the action of the Planning Commission
in approving the final plat, it shall in any case withhold its approval of the
plat until an agreement signed by the subdivider, as provided in paragraph(a)
(2) hereof, is given, supported by:
      (1)   A bond executed by an acceptable surety company in an amount equal
to the full estimated cost of construction of the required improvements, which
estimated cost shall be determined by the City Manager. The surety shall be
subject to the condition that the improvements will be completed within a
specified period agreed to by Council after approval of the final plat.
      (2)   A petition duly filed with the City Clerk for the installation of
all improvements by the City at a 100 percent special assessment to the
subdivider; and
      (3)   A deposit in the form of cash, or an irrevocable letter of credit
or a certified check, in an amount equal to the full estimated cost of
construction of the required improvements (which estimated cost shall be
determined by the City Manager), to ensure that the installation of the
required improvements is completed within the time specified in the agreement
provided for in paragraph (a)(2) hereof, after approval of the plat. However,
the City shall rebate to the subdivider, as the work progresses, amounts of
such cash deposits equal to the ratio of the work completed to the entire
project. The amount so deposited shall be retained in a separate bank account
for each plat.
   (c)   As an alternate, the subdivider may, following approval of the final
plat by Council conditional only upon completion of all improvements agreed to
under paragraph (a)(2) hereof, proceed to install all improvements agreed to
under the supervision of the City Manager with inspection as hereinbefore
provided. Approval of the final plat shall, in this case, be conditional upon
satisfactory completion of all improvements and the furnishing to the City of a
valid performance bond which guarantees all improvements and provides for
repair of any damage to these improvements for a period of three years
following approval of the final plat.
1246.04 AGREEMENT BETWEEN SUBDIVIDER AND OWNER AND CITY.
   An agreement shall be executed by the subdivider and owner with the City in
a form ready for acceptance by Council containing a restriction upon the plat
whereby the City's Building Official will not be permitted to issue a building
permit for any structure upon any lot within such subdivision until the
improvements specified in these Subdivision Regulations have been completed or
until satisfactory arrangements have been made with the City for their
completion as provided for in Section
1246.03. These restrictions shall be made part of the plat restrictions of
Section
1246.02.
1246.05 ZONING CHANGE; PROCEDURE.
   In instances where a zoning change is involved, the required public hearing
shall be held by the Planning Commission with a recommendation to Council for
ordinance enactment by Council, unless the same has already been enacted by
Council. In the case of land to be annexed to the present corporation limits of
the City at the time of approval of the final plat, a request for amendment of
the Zoning Code to include the annexed land in accordance with the final plat
map shall be submitted and the procedures of Section
1240.06 shall apply.
1246.06 CERTIFICATE FROM CITY MANAGER.
   A statement from the City Manager is required certifying that he or she is
in receipt of the following:
   (a)   A plan of each street and alley in the subdivision prepared in
accordance with
Chapter 1024;
   (b)   A plan for each sanitary sewer in the subdivision prepared in
accordance with
Chapter 1046;

with
Chapter 1046;
   (d)   A plan for each water main, together with its appurtenances, in the
subdivision prepared in accordance with
Chapter 1042;
   (e)   A plan for all sidewalks, pedestrian crosswalks and driveway aprons
prepared in accordance with
Chapter 1026; and
   (f)   A reproducible copy of the final plat map.
   The City Manager shall also certify that the above plans have been checked
and found to be complete, correct and in accordance with all applicable
provisions of these Codified Ordinances and specifications of the City.
1246.07 CERTIFICATES FROM POSTMASTER AND FIRE CHIEF.
   A statement signed by the Davison Postmaster or Assistant Postmaster and by
the Fire Chief is required, listing all streets in the subdivision that are not
continuations of existing streets of the same name and indicating that the
listed streets do not duplicate and are not likely to be confused with the name
of any existing street served by the Davison Post Office or by the Fire
Authority.
1246.08 PREPARATION.
   The final plat shall be prepared by a professional engineer registered as a
civil engineer in the State, or by a registered land surveyor, who shall affix
his or her seal to all maps and other documents prepared by him or her as
required by these Subdivision Regulations.
1246.09 FILING.
   The final plat shall be filed within one year after the date of approval of
the proposed plat by Council, unless an extension of this period is granted by
Council for good cause prior to the expiration of the one-year period;
otherwise, any final plat shall be considered void and the procedure for the
filing of a preliminary plat shall be followed. The subdivider, during either
the one-year period or a valid extension thereof and at least one week prior to
the Planning Commission meeting at which it is to be considered, shall file
with the City Clerk an application for final approval, together with the five
copies of the proposed final plat map on approved material, as required by the
Subdivision Control Act, and ten paper copies of this map and of all other
pertinent documents, together with such fees as are provided for in the City's
user fee schedule, as amended from time to time by resolution of Council, and
as provided in the Subdivision Control Act. The filing fee for the preliminary
plat shall be allowed as the per-lot fee for the first final plat on any
subdivision contained within the limits of the preliminary plat. The final plat
with all accompanying documents shall be examined by both the City Attorney and
the City Manager within one week after filing in order to determine that the
final plat is in full compliance with the formal and technical provisions,
respectively, of these Subdivision Regulations and the Subdivision Control Act,
with all agreements in order and enforceable upon their formal acceptance by
Council. Further, the City Manager shall find that all amendments upon which
contingent approval of the preliminary plat was granted by the Planning
Commission and confirmed by Council have been incorporated in the final plat.
The City Attorney and City Manager shall endorse the application for final
approval with their individual findings and return it to the City Clerk for
appropriate action. If the final plat is not approved by either the City
Attorney or the City Manager, or both, the subdivider shall be immediately so
notified by the City Clerk so that he or she may take necessary corrective
action. The refiling of such a corrected final plat shall be done in the same
manner as the original filing as provided herein, except that no fee shall be
required.
(Adopting Ordinance; Ord. 95-5. Passed 7-10-95.)
1246.10 REFERRAL.
   After the final plat has been approved by both the City Attorney and the
City Manager, as required in Section
1246.09, the City Clerk shall, within one working day, refer three copies of
the plat, including the paper maps, to the City Planning Commission and shall,
in addition, refer one copy, including a paper map, to each of the following
for their study and recommendation:
   (a)   Each member of Council;
   (b)   The City Attorney; and
   (c)   The City Manager.
1246.11 APPROVAL BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   The Planning Commission shall rule on the final plat within ten days after
its filing with the City Clerk. The Commission shall determine whether or not
the final plat conforms to the Master Plan or such portions thereof as have
been promulgated and whether or not the final plat is in substantial agreement
with the proposed plat, with all amendments upon which conditional approval of
the proposed plat was granted by the Commission and confirmed by Council
incorporated therein. If the Commission approves the final plat, it shall, by
resolution, direct its Chairman to sign the paper copies of the final plat map
in the space provided therefor and notify Council of this action in its
official minutes. Should the Commission find that the final plat does not
conform substantially to the previously approved preliminary plat and that it
is not acceptable, it shall record the reason in its official minutes, forward
the same to Council and recommend that Council disapprove the final plat until
the objections causing disapproval have been changed to meet with the approval
of the Commission. The three paper copies of the final plat map shall, upon
approval, be distributed as follows:
   (a)   One copy shall be retained by the Planning Commission;
   (b)   One copy shall be sent to the City Clerk for filing; and
   (c)   One copy shall be forwarded to Council for its use in acting on the
final plat.
1246.12 TIME REQUIREMENT FOR ACTION BY COUNCIL.
   Council shall act on the final plat within twenty days after it has been
officially filed, unless such time is extended by agreement with the subdivider
or his or her agent. A special meeting shall be called if necessary. During
this period, Council shall receive a written report with recommendations from
the Planning Commission and each City official except Council members.
(Ord. 2003-19. Passed 3-24-03.)
1246.13 NOTICE OF ACTION TAKEN.
   (a)   Council shall determine whether the final plat shall be approved or
disapproved and shall give notice to the subdivider as provided herein. If the
final plat is approved, Council shall authorize the Mayor and Clerk to sign the
agreement provided for in Section
1246.04, the final plat map and any other necessary related documents. In any
case, a notation of the action taken and requisite reasons therefor shall be
entered in the records of Council.
   (b)   If approved, the City Clerk shall affix his or her signature to the
copies ofthe final plat map, together with a notation that such plat has
received final approval, and deliver them to the Clerk of the County Plat
Board, together with the necessary fee for compliance with recording
requirements as provided in the Subdivision Control Act.
   (c)   If disapproved, the City Clerk shall attach to the plat a statement of
the reasons for such action and return it to the subdivider.
1246.14 RECORDING.
   Following final approval by Council, the final plat map, as approved, may be
legally recorded by forwarding the same with the required fee to the Clerk of
the County Plat Board for additional approvals and recording in compliance with
the Subdivision Control Act. Approval of the final plat by Council shall be

shall conform to the Master Plan, or such portions thereof as have been
promulgated, and to
Chapter 1022 et seq. of the Streets, Utilities and Public Services Code and
shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to
topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and to the proposed
uses of the land to be served by such streets. Where not shown on the Official
Map, the Master Plan or such portions thereof as have been promulgated, the
arrangement and other design standards of streets shall conform to the
provisions of this chapter.
1248.02 RELATION TO ADJOINING STREET SYSTEM.
   The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the
continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets in surrounding areas
or conform to a plan for a neighborhood approved by the Planning Commission and
confirmed by Council to meet a particular situation where topographical or
other conditions make continuance or conformity to existing streets
impractical. The street arrangements shall not be such as to cause hardship to
owners of adjoining property in platting their own land and providing
convenient access to it.
1248.03 PROJECTION OF STREETS.
   Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of streets in new
subdivisions shall make provision for the proper projection of streets into
such unsubdivided areas.
1248.04 STREETS TO BE CARRIED TO BOUNDARIES OF TRACT.
   When a new subdivision adjoins unsubdivided land susceptible of being
subdivided, then the new streets shall be carried to the boundaries of the
tract proposed to be subdivided.
1248.05 STREET JOGS.
   Street jogs with centerline offsets shall be such that the centerline offset
is not less than the minimum dimension specified in

portion of the street shall be at least sixty feet. The property line at the
intersection of the turn-around and the straight portion of the street shall be
rounded at a radius of not less than twenty feet. The location in the center of
the turn-around of a planting circle, twenty feet in diameter, curbed all
around, having a three-foot wide sidewalk adjacent to the curb all around and
planted by the subdivider with trees and/or shrubs of species approved by the

service alleys or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate
protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and
local traffic.
1248.09 MINOR STREETS.
   Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be
discouraged.
1248.10 SUBDIVISIONS BORDERING OR CONTAINING RAILROADS OR LIMITED ACCESS
HIGHWAYS.
   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad or limited access
highway right of way, the Planning Commission, with the approval of Council,

of way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land,
as for park purposes in Residential Districts, or for parking, commercial or
industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such instances shall also be
determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and possible
future grade separations.
1248.11 REVERSE CURVES.
   A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse curves
on arterial and collector streets. On minor streets utilizing reverse curves
without the 100-foot tangent, such curves shall be so designed that a traffic
hazard does not result.
1248.12 CLEAR VISIBILITY REQUIRED.
   Clear visibility measured along the centerline of the street shall be
provided for at least 300 feet on arterial streets, at least 200 feet on

reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these Subdivision Regulations and where the Planning Commission
finds and Council concurs that it will be practical to require the dedication
of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a tract
to be sudivided is adjacent to an existing half-street, the other half-street
shall be platted within the proposed subdivision.

   Reserve strips controlling access to streets are prohibited except where
their control is placed with the City under conditions approved by the Planning
Commission and confirmed by Council.

part of a street dedicated for public use if such vacation interferes with the
uniformity of the existing street pattern or any future street plans prepared
for the area.
1248.21 STREET WIDTHS.
   Street right-of-way widths shall be as shown on the maps of the Master Plan
or such portions thereof as may have been promulgated, or, if not shown, shall
be not less than as shown in the schedule in Section

minimum right-of-way width required for any existing street by previous
ordinance or action of Council.
1248.22 REQUIRED STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
   Street improvements shall be provided by the subdivider at his or her own
expense as required in Section

1262.01 ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL; PERMITS; ZONING COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATES.
   (a)   Administrative Official. The Building Official shall administer and
enforce this Zoning Code. He or she may be provided with the assistance of such
other persons as Council may direct.
   If the Building Official finds that any of the provisions of this Zoning
Code is being violated, he or she shall notify, in writing, the person
responsible for such violation, or the owner of record of the lot upon which
such violation is taking place, indicating the nature of the violation and
ordering the action necessary to correct it. He or she shall order
discontinuance of the illegal use of any lot or structure, removal of illegal
structures or of illegal additions, alterations or structural changes,
discontinuance of any illegal work being done or any other action authorized by
this Zoning Code to ensure compliance with or to prevent violation of its
provisions.
   (b)   Permits Required. No structure shall be erected, moved, added to, or
structurally altered without a permit therefor, issued by the Building
Official, except in conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Code in the
case of a written approval for a conditional use permit from the Planning
Commission, or a reversal on appeal, or a variance from the Board of Zoning
Appeals, in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (c)   Certificates of Zoning Compliance for New, Altered or Nonconforming
Uses. No person shall use, occupy, or permit the use or occupancy of any
structure or premises, or part thereof, hereafter created, erected, changed,
converted, or wholly or partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure,
until a certificate of zoning compliance has been issued therefor by the
Building Official stating that the proposed use of the structure or lot
conforms to the requirements of this Zoning Code.
      (1)   No nonconforming structure or use shall be maintained, renewed,
changed, or extended until a certificate of zoning compliance has been issued
by the Building Official. The certificate of zoning compliance shall state
specifically wherein the nonconforming use differs from the provisions of this
Zoning Code, provided that upon enactment or amendment of this Zoning Code,
owners or occupants of nonconforming uses or structures shall have three (3)
months to apply for certificates of zoning compliance. Failure to make such
application within three (3) months shall be presumptive evidence that the
property was a conforming use at the time of enactment or amendment of this
Zoning Code.

provided that such temporary certificates may include such conditions and
safeguards as will protect the safety of the occupants and the public.
      (4)   The Building Official shall maintain a record of all certificates
of zoning compliance, and a copy shall be furnished upon request to any person.
      (5)   Failure to obtain a certificate of zoning compliance shall be a

   (d)   Authorized Construction and Use. Permits or certificates of zoning
compliance shall be issued by the Building Official on the basis of plans and
applications approved, where necessary, by the Planning Commission or the Board
of Zoning Appeals and shall authorize only the use, arrangement and
construction set forth in such approved plans or construction. A use,

1262.02 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS; INTENT.
   Conditional use permit procedures set forth in this chapter are instituted
to provide an opportunity to use a lot or parcel for an activity which, under
usual circumstances, would be detrimental to other permitted land uses and
cannot be permitted within the same district, but which can be permitted under
circumstances unique to the proposed location, subject to conditions acceptable
to the community and providing protection to adjacent land uses. These
procedures are adopted to provide guidelines for the Planning Commission to
follow in arriving at any decision over which the City has jurisdiction and to
provide for the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare, as well as
to provide for the interest of the property owner and the City.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1262.03 APPLICATION FOR CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.

an owner of an interest in the land on which the conditional use is to be
located, to the City Manager's office so that the conditional use application
can be reviewed interdepartmentally and/or any revisions, corrections, or
information necessary can be corrected or made available by the petitioner.
This does not necessarily mean that upon review by the Planning Commission any
further pertinent information will not be requested.

requirement may be waived at the discretion of the City Manager or his or her
designee only after the City Manager or his or her designee determines that the
scope of the project does not warrant such services. Drawings shall be to the
scale of not less than one (1) inch equals twenty (20) feet if the subject
property is less than three (3) acres, or not less than one (1) inch equals
sixty (60) feet if three (3) acres or more. The information shall accompany all
plans submitted for review and must comply with the procedures set forth in
these Codified Ordinances and/or any other State laws or statutes and shall

      (9)   The location, size, and capacity of all existing and proposed
private or public water facilities, storm, and sanitary sewer service
facilities and solid waste disposal facilities servicing the site;
      (10)   The location, dimensions, and lighting of all signs;
      (11)   The location, intensity, and orientation of all lighting;
      (12)   A location map at a larger scale, indicating the relationship of
the site to the surrounding land area;

consideration of the application, provided that all applicable provisions for a
zone change application have been complied with.
   (d)   The application and zone change application, if any, shall be reviewed
interdepartmentally and, upon finding the application complete, the City shall
instruct the applicant to submit proper copies to the City Clerk thirty (30)
days prior the next regular or special Planning Commission meeting intended for
that purpose. The Commission shall review and communicate its recommendation on
the zone change application to Council within two (2) weeks after the regular
or special Planning Commission meeting at which such application was
considered.
   (e)   The Commission shall hear any person wishing to express an opinion on
the application and review the conditional use permit application at its next
regular or special meeting, intended for that purpose, provided that such
meeting provides adequate time to notify adjacent property owners and post a
notice of public hearing, as required. Notice procedures under Section
1262.19 shall be followed.
   (f)   (1)   The Commission shall, within two (2) weeks after the public
hearing at which the application was considered, advise the applicant, the City
Manager, the Building Official, the City Clerk, and Council of its findings
regarding vehicular traffic circulation, geological considerations, air, water
and land pollution, waste disposal and other problems which can be anticipated
from the proposed activity, and of its approval, with any condition the
Commission may find necessary, or of its disapproval, with its reasons in
writing. The Commission may direct the applicant to comply with any condition
which it deems necessary to provide for the public health, safety, and welfare
of present or prospective occupants of the conditional use and of any lands
contiguous to the proposed use, or deemed necessary for the prevention of any
nuisance condition.
      (2)   Standards for approval shall be as follows:
         A.   The Planning Commission shall review the particular circumstances
and facts applicable to each proposed conditional use in terms of the following
standards and requirements and shall make a determination as to whether the use
proposed to be developed on the subject parcel meets the following standards
and requirements:
            1.   It will be harmonious with, and in accordance with, the
general objectives of the Future Land Use Plan.
            2.   It will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in
harmony with the existing and intended character of the general vicinity and so
that such use will not change the essential character of that area.
            3.   It will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future
neighboring uses.
            4.   It will represent a substantial improvement to property in the
immediate vicinity and to the community as a whole.
            5.   It will be served adequately by essential public services and
facilities, such as highways, streets, drainage structures, police and fire
protection and refuse disposal, or persons or agencies responsible for the
establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide adequately for such
services.
            6.   It will not create excessive additional requirements at public
cost for public facilities and services, or be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community.
            7.   It will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials,
equipment, and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any person
or property or the general welfare by reason of excessive smoke, fumes, glare,
noise, vibration, or odors.
            8.   It will be consistent with the intent and purposes of this
Zoning Code.
         B.   If the facts regarding the conditional use being reviewed do not
establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the standards and
requirements set forth in this Zoning Code will be met by the proposed use, the
Planning Commission shall not approve a conditional use.
         In approving a conditional use permit, the Planning Commission may
impose of such reasonable conditions of use as it deems necessary to protect
the best interests of the City and the general vicinity, to achieve the
objectives of this Zoning Code and to assure that the health, safety, and
welfare of the general public will not be infringed upon.
         The Planning Commission may deny, approve, or approve with conditions,
a request for conditional use approval. The decision on a conditional use shall
incorporate a statement containing the findings and conclusions relative to the
conditional use under consideration which specifies the basis for the decision
and any conditions recommended.
         C.   Upon holding a public hearing and review of the conditional use
request, the Planning Commission shall, within thirty (30) days, forward to the
Building Official its finding and decision. The finding shall include a record
of those conditions which are to be imposed. Any decision on such a request
shall state the findings of fact and specify the conclusions drawn therefrom
and any conditions imposed thereon. Any conditions imposed shall remain
unchanged except upon the mutual consent of a majority of the Planning
Commission and the land owner, and the Planning Commission shall maintain a
record of all conditions that are changed. All records of proceedings hereunder
shall be kept and made available to the public.
         A conditional use permit shall be issued by the Planning Commission
upon approval. The Planning Commission shall forward a copy of the permit to
the owner/applicant, the City Clerk, and the Building Official. The Building
Official shall not issue a building permit until he or she has received a copy
of the conditional use permit approved by the Planning Commission.
         D.   Any conditional use permit granted under this Zoning Code shall
become null and void and all fees forfeited unless construction and/or use is
commenced within twelve (12) months of the date of issuance of said conditional
use permit, except that the Planning Commission may, at its discretion, upon
application by the owner and for cause shown, provide for up to two (2)
successive twelve (12) month extensions.
         A violation of any requirement, condition, or safeguard imposed
hereunder shall be considered a violation of this Zoning Code and shall
constitute grounds for termination of a previously granted conditional use
permit.
         E.   The conditional use review and site plan review may occur
concurrently with the mutual consent of the land owner and the Planning
Commission; however, neither shall occur concurrently with a proposed amendment
to the zoning map or text.
         F.   Any such disapproval may be appealed to the Board of Zoning
Appeals under the provisions of this chapter. The Board shall consider such
appeal as a petition for variance and subject to the same standards and relief.
   (g)   The Building Official shall, upon receipt of notice of approval and
upon application by the applicant, accompanied by a receipt duly executed by
the City Treasurer attesting to the payment of all required fees, issue a
building permit for the approved conditional use, provided that he or she has
found satisfactory compliance with all conditions precedent imposed by such
approval.

Zoning Administrator may recommend marginal access drives. For a narrow
frontage, which will require a single outlet, the Planning Commission may
recommend that money be placed in escrow, pursuant to Section
1262.14, with the City so as to provide for a marginal service drive equal in
length to the frontage of the property involved. Occupancy permits shall not be
issued until the improvement is physically provided or monies have been
deposited with the City Treasurer.
   (d)   The Planning Commission and/or Zoning Administrator shall consider the
installation, erection and construction of transmission systems for essential
services.
   (e)   The Planning Commission and/or Zoning Administrator shall require
marginal access drives for all residential developments having residential lots
or sites facing onto major thoroughfares. Where practical, the Planning
Commission and/or Zoning Administrator shall require a rear lot relationship to
major thoroughfares.
   (f)   Where the City has adopted specific area or neighborhood improvement
or redevelopment plans and recommendations involving, but not limited to,
public rights-of-way, utilities and storm drainage, parking facilities,
building placement, access drives, floor space density allocations, building
facade and architectural treatment, no site plan and/or building permit shall
be approved unless there is general compliance with such City plan.

   To ensure compliance with this Zoning Code with the conditions imposed
hereunder, by all residential and commercial builders and any individual owner
who shall submit a plan for the construction of a building or buildings valued

require a surety bond or a cash deposit of the full amount of the estimated

the event of a surety bond, such bond shall name the City of Davison as the
oblige. In the event of a cash deposit, such cash deposit is to be deposited
with the City Treasurer to ensure faithful completion of the improvements and

   (a)   The performance guarantee shall be deposited at the time of the
application for a certificate of occupancy is requested. The City shall return
the performance guarantee on deposit upon verification by the Building Official
that all work and improvements have been satisfactorily completed. The return
of the performance guarantee does not relieve the applicant from satisfying all
applicable maintenance warranties and/or guarantees necessary to ensure the
proper functioning of said projects.
   (b)   As used in this section, "improvements" means those features and
actions associated with a project which are considered necessary by the body or

safety, and welfare of the residents of the City and future users or
inhabitants of the proposed project or project area, including roadways,
lighting, utilities, sidewalks, screening, landscaping, and surface drainage.

1263.01   PURPOSE.
   The exterior appearance of any building located within RA, A, B, C, or I
Zoning Districts of the City has an effect upon the desirability of the
immediate area and of neighboring areas for business and other purposes.
Maintenance of an attractive, compatible and pleasing exterior appearance of
such buildings will prevent impairment of the stability of the value of other
real property in the area, permit the most appropriate development of such
area, and prevent attendant deterioration of conditions affecting the general
welfare of the citizens of the City.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1263.02 SCOPE.
   Except for those items listed below, all plans submitted under Sections
1262.04 et seq. relative to site plan review shall be subject to design review
requirements of this Section. Those items exempt from these provisions are:
   (a)   Single-family detached dwellings. However, all single-family detached
dwellings adding a temporary accessory apartment shall be subject to design
review. Furthermore, all one-family dwellings shall be subject to the
requirements of Section
1288.03.
   (b)   Items such as gutters, downspouts, door and window replacements,
antennas, roof vents, small mechanical equipment, painting to a similar color,
and items of ordinary repair and maintenance.
   (c)   Mobile home parks.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1263.03 APPROVAL PROCEDURE.
   The Planning Commission shall review submitted materials concurrently with
site plan review when such is required. All approvals for site plans shall be
conditioned upon an affirmative review of the building design.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1263.04 INFORMATION REQUIRED.
   The Planning Commission shall receive and promptly review all drawings,
data, plans and specifications required under this subsection. This information
shall include:
   (a)   An application form, indicating:
      (1)   The name, address, and telephone number of the petitioner, property

      (2)   The general location of the subject parcel.
      (3)   A project description.
   (b)   A site plan, providing data as required by Section
1262.07.
   (c)   Elevation drawings of all sides of buildings visible to the public,
showing general design treatment.
   (d)   Any other material, drawings, and documents which may be helpful to,
or requested by, the Planning Commission.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1263.05 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   In the process of reviewing the submitted materials, the Planning Commission
shall consider:
   (a)   The relationship of buildings to the site, as follows:
      (1)   The site shall be planned to accomplish a desirable transition,
between the building(s), with the streetscape to provide for adequate planting,
safe pedestrian movement, and parking areas.
      (2)   Site planning in which setbacks and yards are in excess of zoning
restrictions is encouraged, where feasible, to provide an interesting
relationship between buildings.
      (3)   Parking areas shall be treated with decorative elements, building
wall extensions, plantings, berms, or other innovative means so as to screen
parking areas from view from public ways.
      (4)   Without restricting the permissible limits of the applicable zoning
district, the height and scale of each building shall be compatible with its
site and existing (or anticipated) adjoining buildings.
      (5)   Newly installed utility services, and service revisions
necessitated by exterior alterations, shall be underground, where feasible.
   (b)   The relationship of buildings and the site to the adjoining area
through attractive landscape transition.
   (c)   Building design.
      (1)   Architectural style is not restricted but shall incorporate
elements representative of, or compatible with, the community. Evaluation of
the appearance of a project shall be based on the quality of its design and
relationship to surroundings.
      (2)   Buildings shall have a scale which is harmonious with permanent
neighboring development.
      (3)   Building components, such as windows, doors, eaves, and parapets,
shall have good proportions and relationships to one another.
      (4)   Mechanical equipment or other utility hardware on roof, ground, or
buildings shall be screened from public view, or they shall be so located as
not to be visible from any public ways.
      (5)   Exterior lighting shall be part of the architectural concept.
Fixtures, standards, and all exposed accessories shall be harmonious with
building design.
      (6)   The design should be compatible with future construction both on
and off the site.
   (d)   Maintenance factors.
      (1)   Continued good appearance depends upon the extent and quality of
maintenance. The choice of materials and their use, together with the types of
finishes and other protective measures, must be conducive to easy maintenance
and upkeep.
      (2)   Materials and finishes shall be selected for their durability and
wear as well as for their beauty. Proper measures and devices shall be
incorporated for protection against the elements, neglect, damage, and abuse.
      (3)   Configurations that tend to catch and accumulate debris, leaves,
trash, dirt, and rubbish shall be avoided.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1263.06 APPROVAL STANDARDS.
   The Planning Commission shall review the particular circumstances and facts
applicable to each submittal in terms of the preceding design criteria and
shall make a finding as to whether the proposal meets the following standards:
   (a)   The appearance of the building exterior will not detract from the
general harmony of and is compatible with other buildings already existing in
the immediate vicinity.
   (b)   The appearance of the building exterior will not be garish or
otherwise offensive to the sense of sight.
   (c)   The appearance of the building exterior will tend to minimize or
prevent discordant and unsightly surroundings in the immediate neighborhood.

1264.02 ADOPTION BY REFERENCE OF STATE STATUTE.
   Act No. 110 of the Public Acts of 2006, as amended, is hereby adopted and

which are not in direct conflict therewith.
(Res. 2007-02. Passed 7-11-07; Ord. 2009-04. Passed 6-22-09.)
1264.03 MEMBERSHIP.
   (a)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall perform its duties and exercise its
powers as provided in Act No. 110 of the Public Acts of 2006, as amended, and
in such a way that the objectives of this Zoning Code shall be observed, public

Public Acts of 2006, as amended, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consist of
five (5) members appointed by the CEO with Council concurrence, one (1) of whom

Planning Commission term, and one (1) of whom that, if desired, may be a member
of the City Council with appointment coinciding with City Council term.
   (b)   Appointments for each member shall be for a three (3) year term. When
members are first appointed, the appointments may be for less than three (3)
years to provide for staggered terms. A successor shall be appointed not more
than one (1) month after the term of the preceding member has expired.
Vacancies for unexpired terms shall be filled for the remainder of the term. An

appointed to a full three-year term. These alternate members may be called to
sit as regular members of the Zoning Board of Appeals by the Chair of the
Zoning Board of Appeals or a designated representative in the following
instances:
      (1)   If a regular member is absent or unable to attend one (1) or more

disqualify himself or herself from a vote in which the member has a conflict of
interest constitutes malfeasance in office.

affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) or four (4) members of the Zoning Board of
Appeals.

Planning Commission, or the City Council, shall not participate in a public

other similar requirements as specified in this Zoning Code, where by reason of
unique physical characteristics a specific piece of property at the time of
enactment of this Zoning Code or other extraordinary or exceptional conditions
of such property, the strict application of such regulations if enacted would
result in practical difficulties upon the owner of such property provided such
relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and
without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of this Zoning Code. In
granting a variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach conditions
regarding the location, character, and other features of the proposed uses as
it may deem reasonable in furtherance of the purpose of this Zoning Code. In
granting a variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall state the grounds upon
which it justified the granting of a variance. To obtain a nonuse variance, the
applicant must submit an affidavit demonstrating a practical difficulty exists,
by explaining all of the following:
         A.   How the property, if developed in strict compliance with the
requirements in the Zoning Code, would be prevented from being used for a
permitted purpose, or how compliance with the Zoning Code requirements would be
unnecessarily burdensome.
         B.   Why the requested variance will not confer special privileges
that are denied other properties similarly situated and in the same zoning
district.
         C.   The conditions and circumstances unique to the property which are
not similarly applicable to other properties in the same zoning district.
         D.   The conditions and circumstances unique to the property which
were not created by the owner, or his or her predecessor in title, within the
time following the effective date of the provisions alleged to adversely affect
such property.
      For each nonuse variance, the variance requested is the minimum necessary
to permit reasonable use of the land.
      (2)   Use variances: The Zoning Board of Appeals may grant a use variance
only upon a finding that an unnecessary hardship exists. A use variance is a
variance that permits a use that is otherwise not provided for in a zoning
district. Approval of a use variance shall require an affirmative vote of two-
thirds (2/3) or four (4) members of the Zoning Board of Appeals. A finding of
an unnecessary hardship shall require demonstration by the applicant of all of
the following:
         A.   Unreasonable current zoning designation: The applicant has
demonstrated that the site can not reasonably be used for any of the uses
allowed within the current zoning district designation. The Zoning Board of
Appeals may require submission of documentation from real estate or market
experts, or a certified appraiser, to substantiate this finding.
         B.   Unique circumstances: The need for the variance is due to unique
circumstances peculiar to the property and not generally applicable in the area
or to other properties in the same zoning district. The applicant must prove
that there are certain features or conditions of the land that are not
generally applicable throughout the zone and that these features make it
impossible to earn a reasonable return without some adjustment. In those
situations where the difficulty is shared by others, the Zoning Board of
Appeals may find that relief should be accomplished by an amendment to the
Zoning Code, not a variance.
         C.   Character of neighborhood: The use variance will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood nor be of detriment to adjacent
properties.
         D.   Not self-created: The problem and resulting need for the variance
has not been self-created by the applicant and/or the applicant's immediate
predecessor.
      For each use variance, the variance requested is the minimum necessary to
permit reasonable use of the land.
      (3)   An application for the approval of a variance shall be made by an
owner of an interest in the lot, to the City Clerk, accompanied by the
necessary fees and documents as provided in this Zoning Code.
      (4)   The application shall be accompanied by a site plan, drawn to a
scale of one (1) inch equals twenty (20) feet on three (3) acres or less and
one (1) inch equals fifty (50) feet on a site over three (3) acres, placed on a
standard sheet and containing the following information:
         A.   Dimensional elements for which a variance is requested.
         B.   Dimensional relationships of the subject lot to the structures on
all adjacent lots.
   (d)   Approval of Temporary Uses.
      (1)   The application for a temporary use permit shall be accompanied by
plans and specifications including a plot plan, in triplicate, drawn to scale
showing the following:
         A.   The shape, location, and dimensions of the lot, including the
shape, size, and location of all buildings or other structures already on the
lot, the off-street parking layout, and the location of any designated fire
lanes.
         B.   The materials to be utilized in and the shape, size, and location
of all buildings and structures to be erected or moved onto the lot.
         C.   The anticipated vehicular traffic flow to and from the lot and
any adjacent thoroughfares, loss of off-street parking spaces, if any, as well
as the anticipated flow of pedestrian traffic upon lot sidewalks.
      (2)   A temporary use permit shall only be granted if the Zoning Board of
Appeals determines that the proposed use, including the erection of any
temporary building or structure, will:
         A.   Provide adequate light and ventilation between buildings and
structures.
         B.   Provide adequate vehicular and pedestrian traffic flow and
adequate off-street parking.
         C.   Provide adequate lot access for fire protection purposes.
         D.   Not adversely affect the stability and integrity of the zoning
plan prescribed by this Zoning Code or otherwise interfere with the protection
of public health, safety, and general welfare.
         E.   Not be incompatible with or otherwise adversely affect the
physical character of the community and, in particular, the surrounding area
within a distance of one thousand (1,000) feet.
         When the proposed temporary use is to be conducted on an otherwise
vacant or unused lot, the use shall comply with all applicable zoning
regulations for the district in which the temporary special use is to be
located, including all requirements pertaining to lot size, height, setback,
open space ratio, maximum percentage of covered lot area, and off-street
parking. In no instance shall signs, parking, buildings, produce, or other site
features occupy a public right-of-way.
      (3)   The Zoning Board of Appeals may permit in any Residential District
the temporary location of a pre-manufactured building in new subdivisions for
the period that active construction is in progress, provided that:
         A.   The use shall be only for offices for the specific purpose of
selling lots or new homes to be erected in the subdivision.
         B.   All applicable building height, bulk, and area requirements of
the district are met.
         C.   The structure shall be removed from the subdivision upon
completion of the first permanently built model home intended for display, but
in no case shall the pre-manufactured building remain beyond the time
limitation specified above.
         In classifying uses as not requiring capital improvement, the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall determine that they are either demountable structures
related to the permitted use of land; recreation developments, such as, but not
limited to, golf driving ranges and outdoor archery courts; or structures which
do not require foundations, heating systems, or sanitary connections.
      (4)   The Zoning Board of Appeals, in granting permits for temporary uses
described in paragraphs (d)(1) to (3) hereof, shall do so under the following
conditions:
         A.   The granting of the temporary use shall in no way constitute a
change in the basic uses permitted in the district, nor on the property wherein
the temporary use is permitted.
         B.   The granting of the temporary use shall be granted in writing,
stipulating all conditions as to time, the nature of development permitted and
arrangements for removing the use at the termination of said temporary permit.
         C.   All setbacks, land coverage, off-street parking, lighting and
other requirements to be considered in protecting the public health, safety,
peace, morals, comfort, convenience, and general welfare of the inhabitants of
the City shall be made at the discretion of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
         D.   The use shall be in harmony with the general character of the
area.
      (5)   No temporary use permit shall be granted without first giving
notice to owners of adjacent property of the time and place of a public hearing
to be held as provided for in Section
1262.19. Further, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall seek the review and
recommendation of the Planning Commission prior to the taking of any action.
   (e)   Nonconforming Uses and Structures. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall
have authority to permit, upon proper application and adequate showing by
applicant, an expansion, extension, or enlargement of a nonconforming use or
structure, subject to the following conditions and limitations:
      (1)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased, extended,
or moved except as permitted by the Zoning Board of Appeals pursuant to
authority granted to the Zoning Board of Appeals as set forth in Section
1288.07 of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   Exterior alterations, expansions, or structural modification
involving exterior load-bearing walls shall be subject to review by the Zoning
Board of Appeals, in accordance with Section
1288.07. This shall not include normal repair or routine maintenance of
exterior surfaces.
   (f)   Conditional Uses and Planned Unit Developments. The Zoning Board of
Appeals shall have the power to review and consider appeals pertaining to
decisions on Conditional Uses, including Planned Unit Developments, made by the
Planning Commission.

decision. The conditions may include conditions necessary to ensure that public

indicated in subsections (a) through (e) above shall be so construed. Distances
not specifically indicated on the official Zoning Map shall be determined by
the scale of the Map.

shall approve the same by resolution.
   (b)   Land not zoned prior to annexation shall be automatically classified

   The B-1 Residential Multifamily Residential District is composed of those

dwellings at a higher density than permitted in other residential zoning
districts. These areas would be designed for good accessibility and to be
compatible with adjacent single-family areas. Various types and sizes of
residential units, for ownership or rental, would thereby be provided to meet
the needs of the different age and family groups in Davison without creating an
unreasonable burden to existing community facilities, utilities, or services.
In addition to the dwellings permitted in this zone, there are certain non-
residential uses which may be compatible with, and supportive of, a residential
environment and may be permitted only with conditional use approval.

   (a)   Maximum building coverage shall not exceed thirty (30) percent of the
lot area.
   (b)   The distance between any two (2) buildings within a garden apartment
or townhouse development shall be not less than twenty (20) feet.
   (c)   There shall be a greenbelt planting strip proposed along all side,
rear and front property lines of any garden apartment or townhouse complex. The
width of the landscaped planting area shall be at least twenty (20) feet. The
Planning Commission may modify this requirement and instead allow a reduction
in width, based on evidence presented by the property owners and/or their
agents, showing that the reasonable ability to comply with the requirement does
not exist by reason of limited site area or natural feature characteristics.
The Planning Commission may require evergreen screening or a screenwall in its
place.
   (d)   All garden apartment and townhouse developments shall be served with
public sewer and water facilities.
   (e)   Subject to Planning Commission review and recommendations, a minimum
of ten (10) percent of the total lot area shall be developed for recreation and
park purposes.
   (f)   Provision shall be made for safe and efficient egress and ingress to
public streets and highways serving any garden apartment or townhouse
development, which shall be designed to minimize congestion and interference
with traffic flow.
   (g)   The site shall be developed and facilities shall be provided in such a
manner as to ensure adequate drainage.
   (h)   Lighting facilities shall be required where deemed necessary for the
safety and convenience of residents and visitors. These facilities shall be
arranged in such a manner as to protect abutting streets and adjacent
properties from unreasonable glare or hazardous interference of any kind.
   (i)   Provision shall be made for serving garden apartments and townhouses
by refuse collection vehicles. No incinerators are permitted. All refuse and
garbage shall be screened and stored in waste disposal containers and shall
meet the provisions stated in Section
1288.30.
   (j)   Design guidelines.
      (1)   Building facades are considered the public faces of buildings. All
four (4) sides of the building must be addressed with consistent architecture.
      (2)   Natural materials, such as natural brick, stone, and wood are
encouraged.
      (3)   Complementary design.
         A.   All developments and/or redevelopments should rely on neighboring
architecture and not necessarily on corporate architecture to distinguish
themselves while complimenting existing quality development.
         B.   Roof pitch, bulk and materials types shall be considered during
design and/or renovation.
      (4)   All mechanical equipment, including roof top equipment, shall be
screened from view.
         A.   Mechanical equipment, including but not limited to HVAC,
generators, trash compactors and other such items shall be so screened and
shielded in order to conform to the noise standards adopted in Section 1228.27.
         B.   All screening both in terms of visual and sound, shall be
consistent with the architecture of the building.
      (5)   Accessory structures must be consistent in architecture and size
and proportion with the principal building and subject to setback and lot
coverage requirements.
      (6)   Off-street parking is required as specified in
Chapter 1290, except that off-street private parking shall not be the dominant
feature of the site. Parking is not permitted in the front yard. In addition,
off-street parking may be public, private, or a combination of both and shall
be located within three hundred (300) feet of the proposed use.
      (7)   Sidewalks or a multi-use path, as shown on the City's adopted plan,
are required with each development.
         A.   Sidewalks along the public road shall be a minimum of five (5)
feet in width and shall require the installation of a brick soldier course on
both sides of walk. If the area between the soldier course and curb is less
than three (3) feet, the soldier course shall be extended to the curb.

         B.   A pathway, if required, shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet in
width, subject to the engineering and design standards of the City.
         C.   A paved walk connection shall be provided from the path or walk
at the street to the front entry of the building. It shall be a minimum of five
(5) feet wide.
         D.   If appropriate, additional sidewalk or pathway connections may be
required to connect pedestrians to and from parking areas. This walk shall be
five (5) feet in width.
         E.   At any point where a pedestrian pathway or walk crosses an entry/
exit driveway, a stamped concrete or stamped bituminous crosswalk is required.
The crosswalk shall also include reflective white lines outlining the stamped
area. The crosswalk shall be a pattern and color approved by the City.
         F.   At any point where a pedestrian connection crosses a driveway,
the pedestrian crosswalk shall be marked by white crosswalk striping.

of a site in relation to drainage, pedestrian and vehicular circulation, off-
street parking, structural relationships, public utilities, landscaping,
accessibility and other site design elements which may have an adverse effect
upon the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare, as well as to
provide for the interest of the property owner.
   (b)   Waiver of Review. The Building Official shall have authority to waive
the Planning Commission's review of a site plan when the proposed use is of a
nature which will require no alterations or only minor modifications to the
site and/or structures in question. These shall not include the following:
      (1)   Expansion or relocation of an existing building or construction of
a new building;
      (2)   A change in use and/or interior modifications which will result in
a need for increased parking;
      (3)   Reduction of parking spaces from what originally existed for the
former use;
      (4)   Major changes to the internal traffic or pedestrian circulation
system of the site;
      (5)   Relocation or modification of the ingress and egress drives to
public thoroughfares of the site;
      (6)   Major changes to landscaping, fences or walls; or
      (7)   Any use or modification to the site and/or structure which, in the
opinion of the Building Official, may significantly affect public health,
safety, or general welfare.
         The site plan shall always be required when a conditional use permit
is being considered.

zoning and the site development requirements.
         B.   After administrative review of a site plan by the Site Plan
Committee, the Building Official shall place the site plan on the Planning
Commission agenda for review and action at the earliest available meeting. A
site plan shall be approved, approved with conditions or disapproved by the
City of Davison Planning Commission in accordance with the requirements of this
Zoning Code.
      (2)   When the proposed new construction or remodeling constitutes an
addition to an existing building or use, site plan review procedures may be
modified, at the discretion of the City Manager, to provide for an
administrative review by City staff in lieu of a more formal review by the
Planning Commission. City staff may conduct an administrative review provided
both of the following are true:
         A.   No variances to the Zoning Code are required.
         B.   The proposed new construction would not increase the total square
footage of the building greater than twenty-five (25) percent or one thousand
(1,000) square feet, whichever is less.
      (3)   For those cases requiring site plan review solely as a result of
building reoccupancy, site plan review procedures may be modified, at the
discretion of the Building Official, to provide for an administrative review by
City staff in lieu of a more formal review by the City Planning Commission.
City staff may conduct an administrative review provided all of the following
are true:
         A.   No variances to the Zoning Code are required.
         B.   Such use is conducted within a completely enclosed building.
         C.   Reoccupancy does not create additional parking demands, beyond

site.
      (4)   The Building Official shall notify the Planning Commission of all
site plans scheduled for administrative review.

If necessary, the City will maintain the landscaping and bill back the costs of
the maintenance to the property owner. Landscaping shall be as required:
      (1)   If applicable, street trees shall be planted every thirty (30) feet
on center for each street or entrance drive longer than thirty (30) feet. All
street trees are subject to the site vision clearance of Section
1288.22(c)(7).
      (2)   Street trees shall be similar to those older growth trees in the
district in terms of expected height, etc., but not necessarily species and or
type.
   (d)   Screening. All shredding bins, generators, air handling units and
other such similar items shall be screened through a combination of a wall,
fence and landscaping. The wall shall be consistent with the materials used in
the building. If a fence is used the fence shall be opaque in nature and solid
wood or vinyl, masonry painted to blend with the building. The height of the
wall or fence shall be equal to the height of the object being screened, except
that it shall not be greater than seven (7) feet. Each shall require the
installation of landscaping around the perimeter of the screening. Due to the
expected level of noise that certain types of equipment may generate, the
screening may require the installation of such mitigating measures as a sound
wall, as determined by the Zoning Administrator or the Planning Commission.

1281.07 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   In order to permit a wide range of uses and provide for creativity and
flexibility for developers and the City, while still preserving the character
and identity of Davison, the following performance standards apply to all uses
within the C-2 Traditional Neighborhood Commercial.
   (a)   No use shall operate before 7:00 a.m. nor after 10:00 p.m., unless

7:00 a.m. nor after 10:00 p.m. excepting that snow plowing is permitted all
hours.
   (d)   The Planning Commission may require the installation of sound
dampening or noise walls when a proposed use has loading and/or unloading that
may disturb adjacent residential uses, or requires the need for a generator or
other such items that emit noise not typically associated with residential
neighborhoods or light commercial development.
   (e)   No use is permitted which emits smoke, soot or noxious fumes or odors.
   (f)   Road construction, road cleaning, snow plowing and other such similar
work conducted by the City and/or its agents operated within the road or road

1283.13 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The intent and purpose of the following performance standards is to allow
for industrial operations with high standards for site development and use
performance. These performance standards shall apply to all uses allowed within
the Industrial District. Applicants may be required by the Planning Commission
to submit studies, reports and additional information relative to how a
proposed use will meet the performance standards described in this section.
This includes, but is not limited to: noise studies, odor maps, engineering
analysis of proposed vibrations, emission maps, schematics and renderings of
the proposed buffers and buildings when viewed from the adjoining property.
   (a)   Control of Smoke, Dust, Fly Ash, and Gases. The emission of smoke,
dust, fly ash and gases shall in no manner be unclean, destructive,
unhealthful, hazardous or deleterious to the general welfare. Such emission
shall be in strict conformance with all new source standards of performance
promulgated under the Federal Clean Air Act for sulfur dioxide, hydrogen
chloride, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, lead, cadmium, mercury, dioxin,
dibenzofurans, particulate matter, opacity and other post-combustion
concentrations of surrogate substances, as well as all applicable State and
County health laws as pertaining to air pollution and smoke abatement.
   (b)   Control of Odors. There shall be no emission of odorous matter in such
quantities as to be offensive at lot boundary lines.
      (1)   Any process which may involve the creation or emission of any odor
shall be provided with a secondary safeguard system, so that control will be
maintained if the primary safeguard system fails.
      (2)   There is hereby established, as a guide in determining such
quantities of offensive odors, Table III (Odor Thresholds) in Chapter 5, “Air
Pollution Abatement Manual,” copyright 1951 by Manufacturing Chemists’
Association, Inc., Washington, D.C.
   (c)   Control of Glare or Heat. Any operation producing intense glare or
heat shall be performed within an enclosed building or behind a solid fence in
such a manner as to be completely imperceptible from any point beyond the lot
lines of the lot upon which the source of such glare or heat is located.
   (d)   Control of Vibrations. No vibration which is discernible to the human
sense of feeling shall be perceptible at any point beyond the lot line of the
lot upon which the source of such vibration is located.
   (e)   Control of Excessive Noise. Noise emanating from operations within the
Industrial District shall conform to the noise standards described in Section
1288.27 of this zoning ordinance.

handling of any flammable materials used on site shall comply with all State
rules and regulations, and regulations as established by the Fire Prevention
Act, Act 207, P.A. of 1941, as amended. If located above ground, storage tanks
shall provide secondary containment. If located below ground, storage tanks
shall provide corrosion protection and spill/overfill prevention systems.
Furthermore, all storage tanks for flammable liquid materials above ground
shall be located at least 150 feet from all property lines. No outdoor storage
shall be visible from abutting lots that are zoned for residential purpose or
zoned “Technology.”
      (2)   All outdoor storage facilities for fuel, raw materials and products
shall be enclosed by a fence adequate to conceal the facilities from any
adjacent properties and to prevent spillage onto all adjacent properties and
into storm sewers.
      (3)   No material or waste shall be deposited upon a lot in such a form
or manner that the same may be transferred off the lot by natural forces or
causes.
      (4)   All material or waste which might cause fumes or dust or which
constitutes a fire hazard or which may be edible or otherwise be attractive to
rodents or insects shall be stored outdoors only in closed containers.
   (h)   Control of Water Pollution. Pollution of water shall be subject to
such requirements and regulations as are established by the Michigan State
Department of Health, the Michigan Water Resources Commission, the Genesee
County Health Department, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Such
requirements and regulations shall apply in all cases except when they are less

and visitors.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1284.02 SCOPE.
   The requirements of this chapter shall apply to all lands that are
designated as CO Corridor Overlay Districts and are shown on the City of
Davison Zoning Map. The provisions and restrictions of this chapter shall be
considered to apply in addition to, and, where applicable, instead of, the
provisions of the underlying zoning districts shown on the official Zoning Map,
sufficient to fulfill the purposes of this chapter. Uses and regulations
otherwise applicable in existing zoning districts shall not be allowed unless
also permitted and developed, in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1284.03 NONRESIDENTIAL SITE ACCESS REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Performance Standards. No person shall construct or utilize any direct
access driveway which does not meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Any driveway design utilized must allow an entering vehicle turning
speed of fifteen (15) mph to help reduce interference with through street
traffic.
      (2)   Driveway design and placement must be in harmony with internal
circulation and parking design such that the entrance can absorb the maximum
rate of inbound traffic during a normal weekday peak traffic period as
determined by a competent traffic survey.
      (3)   There must be sufficient on-site storage (sixty (60) feet minimum)
to accommodate at least three (3) lined-up vehicles waiting to park or exit
without utilizing any portion of the street right-of-way or in any other way
interfering with street traffic.
      (4)   Provision for circulation between adjacent parcels should be
provided through coordinated or collective parking marginal access drives, or
other methods.
      (5)   Driveway entrances must be able to accommodate all vehicle types
having occasion to enter the site, including delivery vehicles.
      (6)   Driveway placement must be such that loading and unloading
activities will in no way hinder vehicle ingress and egress.
      (7)   Direct access driveway placement must be such that an exiting
vehicle has an unobstructed sight distance according to the following schedule:
 
Roadway Design Speed (mph) Sight Distance (ft.)
25                         150
30                         200
35                         225
40                         275
45                         325
 
      (8)   Driveway design must be such that an entering vehicle will not
encroach upon the exit lane of a two-way driveway. Also, a right turning
exiting vehicle shall be able to utilize only the first through-traffic lane
available without encroachment into the adjacent through lane.
   (b)   Design Criteria.
      (1)   Driveway profiles.
         A.   The grade of a two-way, one-way or divided commercial driveway
shall not exceed four (4) percent for a minimum distance of twenty-five (25)
feet from the edge of the pavement. Beyond this distance the grade shall not
exceed ten (10) percent.
         B.   If the street is curbed and if the sidewalk is ten (10) feet or
less from the edge of the pavement, the grade of a driveway shall be the grade
required to meet the sidewalk elevation, but if that grade would exceed the
maximums specified in paragraph (b)(1)A. hereof, the sidewalk shall be
inclined, per the regulations in paragraph (b)(1)F. hereof.
         C.   If the street is uncurbed, the grade of the driveway between the
street edge of pavement and the edge of the shoulder shall conform to the slope
of the shoulder to the edge of the driveway approach. From that point the
dimensions specified in paragraph (b)(1)D. hereof will apply.
         D.   For a driveway on an upgrade towards the street, a grade of four
(4) percent for a distance of one hundred (100) feet from the edge of the
pavement is required. Beyond this distance, the grade shall not exceed ten (10)
percent and the difference in grades where there is a change of grade shall not
exceed three (3) percent.
         E.   Vertical curves with a minimum length of fifty (50) feet, as
measured along the arc, shall be provided at a change of grade of four (4)
percent or more.
         F.   If the sidewalk elevation has to be adjusted to meet the
driveway, the sidewalk shall be inclined at a rate not to exceed one (1) foot
vertical for every twenty-four (24) feet horizontal.
      (2)   Driveway spacing and design.
         A.   Each parcel shall be limited to one (1) access drive on a
fronting road, unless a second drive is shared with an adjacent parcel, or
subject to the conditions of paragraph (b)(2)B. hereof.
         B.   For uses that have driveway approach volumes exceeding five
thousand (5,000) vehicles per day, or arterial frontage of three hundred (300)
feet or more, additional driveways may be allowed, in accordance with the
following: one (1) additional driveway entrance along a continuous site with
frontage in excess of three hundred (300) feet, or two (2) additional driveway
entrances along a continuous site with frontage in excess of six hundred (600)
feet.
         C.   Two (2)-way driveways shall be at least twenty-four (24) feet
wide. One (1)-way driveways shall be at least sixteen (16) feet wide.
         D.   For uses which generate exit volumes of more than five thousand
(5,000) vehicles per day, two (2) exit lanes shall be provided, separated by a
median, and shall be clearly marked for left or right turns.
         E.   Commercial access drives shall be spaced no less than two hundred
(200) feet from any street intersection or other access drive, and no less than
seventy-five (75) feet from any residential zoning district. Spacing will be
measured from the midpoint of each driveway. In the event that a particular
parcel or parcels lack sufficient arterial frontage to maintain adequate
spacing, the land owner(s) may pursue either of the following options:
            1.   They may seek a variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals in
accordance with
Chapter 1264.
            2.   The adjacent land owners may agree to establish a common
driveway. In such case the driveway mid-point should be the property line
between the two (2) parcels. The driveway must meet standard specifications,
and the estimated driveway volume will be the sum of the trip generation rates
of both land uses in question.
               When two (2) adjacent property owners agree to combine access
points, the Municipality will grant an incentive bonus. The total lot size and
road frontage normally required will each be reduced by ten (10) percent for
both land owners. In addition, the required number of parking spaces will be
reduced by ten (10) percent for each development.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1284.04 MISCELLANEOUS REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Required Landscaping Adjacent to Public Rights-of-Way. Where paved
ground surface areas are located adjacent to sidewalks, streets, and other
public rights-of-way, landscaping shall be provided between the public right-
of-way and the paved ground surface area. Said landscaping shall include a
landscaped yard at least thirty (30) feet in width containing an opaque screen
of landscaping at least three (3) feet in height. Said screen may be composed
of a berm at least three (3) feet in height, a maintenance-free wall at least
three (3) feet in height or a screen of landscaping at least two and one-half
(2-1/2) feet in height at time of planting. If a screen of living landscaping
material is utilized, it shall attain capacity and a height of three (3) feet
within twelve (12) months of planting under normal growing conditions. One (1)
tree shall be planted for each fifty (50) linear feet, or fraction thereof, of
frontage on a public right-of-way. Landscaping adjacent to public rights-of-way
is not required if the paved ground surface area is completely screened from
the public right-of-way by an intervening building or structure.
   No berm or other landscaping shall interfere with the natural flow of water.
   (b)   Existing Plant Materials.
      (1)   In instances where healthy plant material exists on a site prior to
its development, the forester may adjust the application of the above standards
to allow credit for such plant material if such an adjustment is in keeping
with, and will preserve, the intent of this section.
      (2)   All existing plant materials must first be inspected by the
forester to determine the health and desirability of such materials. In the
event plant materials are to be saved, prior approval must be obtained from the
Building Official before any delimbing, root pruning, or other work is done.
      (3)   If such existing plant material is labeled "to be saved" on site
plans, protective techniques, such as, but not limited to, fencing placed at
the drip-line around the perimeter of the plant material, shall be installed.
No vehicle or other construction equipment shall be parked or stored within the
drip-line of any plant material intended to be saved.
      (4)   In the event that healthy trees labeled "to be saved" on the
approved site plan are destroyed or damaged, as determined by the Building
Official, the owner, developer, or contractor shall replace said trees with
individual trees of comparable type and size or a group of individual trees
which total the same size.
   (c)   Screening of Trash Storage Areas. Any new or altered use which
requires an outdoor trash storage area shall comply with the following
requirements:
      (1)   Any such area shall be limited to normal refuse which is collected
on a regular basis and shall be maintained in a neat, orderly, and sanitary
condition.
      (2)   In no instance shall any such refuse be visible above the required
screening.
      (3)   Required screening shall consist of a masonry wall and plant
material per Sections
1288.22 and
1288.23.
   (d)   Utilities.
      (1)   Electrical telephone and cable television lines shall be
underground.
      (2)   Surface mounted transformers and similar equipment for the
underground wires shall be shown on the final site plan and shall be screened
from view.
   (e)   Walkways. Where the subject site borders a public right-of-way, a
sidewalk five (5) feet in width or greater shall be provided within the public
right-of-way one (1) foot from the subject site's property lines, except that
the Planning Commission may approve an alternate location to provide for a
logical interconnection with adjoining properties.
   (f)   Lighting.
      (1)   Lighting is an integral part of the corridor design concept and a
major element in creating a unique and safe night-time ambience. All exterior
lighting shall be designed as part of the overall architectural concept.
Fixtures, standards, and all exposed accessories shall be harmonious with the
building design, the lighting design and hardware of the public spaces, and the
overall visual environment of the district. Obtrusive appearance of their
setting should be avoided.
      (2)   Night lighting of buildings shall be selective and focused; overall
ambient lighting of buildings is not desirable. Rather, lighting should
highlight entrances, dramatize special architectural features, keynote repeated
features, and use the play of light and shadow to articulate the facade. The
creative use of lighting to accomplish these ends is strongly encouraged. The
lighting of signs themselves will play a significant role in the nighttime
visual environment.
      (3)   For safety, identification, and convenience, entrances of buildings
and parking areas shall be well illuminated.
      (4)   Vestibules created by recessed entries shall be illuminated by
downlights.
      (5)   All show window areas shall be adequately lighted employing
concealed or baffled sources which will not create glare or uncomfortable
visual conditions for pedestrians.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1284.05 SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   (a)   Prior to the establishment of a new use, change of use, addition to an
existing use, or the erection of any building, a site plan shall be submitted
and approved, or approved with conditions in accordance with the requirements
of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Site plan review will be required for all construction except for
single-family detached and two-family dwellings and their accessory uses unless
otherwise required by this Zoning Code.

detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare.
   (d)   Surface parking areas as regulated by
Chapter 1290.
   (e)   Uses permitted by the zoning districts otherwise established for the
parcel subject to the regulations of such districts, provided that:
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least
one foot above the base flood level.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures shall either:
         A.   Have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated at least
one foot above the base flood level; or
         B.   Be constructed such that the structure, below base flood level,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, is watertight, with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and effects of buoyancy. A licensed professional engineer or architect
shall certify that the standards of this paragraph are satisfied, and that the
floodproofing methods employed are adequate to withstand the flood depths,
pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors associated
with a base flood in the location of the structure.
      (3)   In the area below the upper limit of the floodplain area boundary,
dumping, or backfilling with any material in any manner is prohibited, unless,
through compensating excavation and shaping of the floodplain area, its flow
and impoundment capacity will be maintained or improved, subject to State
permitting requirements.
      (4)   Any filling on banks adjacent to a floodplain area boundary shall
have approved erosion control to prevent soil from being washed into the
floodplain. City Council shall adopt erosion control standards, which are
subject to State Part 91 of the Michigan Natural Resources and Environmental
Protection Act, being Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994. These standards shall
be administered by the Genesee County Drain Commissioner Division of Water and
Waste Services.

anti-climbing device to prevent unauthorized access.
      (3)   Maximum Height. The maximum height of wireless communication
support structures shall be: A. 250 feet, B. the minimum height demonstrated to
be necessary by the applicant, or C. such lower heights as required and
approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The applicant shall
demonstrate a justification for the height and provide an evaluation of
alternative designs, which might result in lower heights. Accessory buildings
shall be limited to the maximum height for accessory structures within
respective zoning districts.
      (4)   Setbacks from Nonresidential Districts. Wireless communication
support structures abutting any lot zoned for other than residential purposes
shall have a minimum setback in accordance with the required setbacks for the
principal buildings for the zoning district in which the support structure is
located.
      (5)   Compatibility of Accessory Structures. Wireless communication
facilities proposed on the roof of a building with an equipment enclosure shall
be architecturally compatible with the principal building upon which it is
located. The equipment enclosure may be located within the principal building
or may be an accessory building, provided the accessory building conforms to
all district requirements for accessory buildings and is constructed of the
same or compatible building material as the principal building.
      (6)   Appearance of Support Structures. The color of wireless
communication support structures and all accessory buildings shall minimize
distraction, reduce visibility as little as possible, maximize aesthetics, and
ensure compatibility with its surroundings. The applicant shall be responsible
for the maintenance of the wireless communication facility in a neat and
orderly condition, as well as maintaining the safety of the site and structural
integrity of any structures.
      (7)   Federal and State Requirements. The requirements of the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and
the Michigan Aeronautics Commission shall be noted on the site plan. Structures
shall be subject to any State and Federal regulations concerning non-ionizing
electromagnetic radiation. Furthermore, if more restrictive State or Federal
standards are adopted in the future, the antenna shall be made to conform to
the extent required by such standard or the approval and permit for the
structure shall be subject to revocation by the City. The cost for testing and
verification of compliance shall be borne by the operator of the antenna.
      (8)   Lighting. Lighting on a wireless communication facility shall be
prohibited unless otherwise required by the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA). The applicant shall propose a height reduction to eliminate the need for
lighting, or shall submit detailed technical data demonstrating the need for
the requested height, including an analysis demonstrating that other sites are
unavailable or inadequate for the applicant’s purposes.
      (9)   Collocation. All wireless communication support structures shall
accommodate no more than six attached wireless communication facilities.
Support structures shall allow for future rearrangement of attached wireless
communication facilities to accept other attached facilities mounted at varying
heights.
         A.   When Collocation is not Feasible. Wireless communication support
structures shall not be approved unless the applicant documents that its
attached wireless communication facilities cannot be feasibly collocated or
accommodated on an existing support structure or other existing structure due
to one or more of the following reasons:
            1.   The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of
the existing support structure or other structure, as documented by a licensed
engineer, and the existing support structure or other structure cannot be
reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent
equipment at a reasonable cost.
            2.   The planned equipment would cause interference affecting the
function of other equipment on the existing supporting structure or other
structure as documented by a licensed engineer, and the interference cannot be
prevented at a reasonable cost.
            3.   Support structures and other structures within the search
radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary for the
coverage area and capacity needs to reasonably function as documented by a
qualified and licensed professional engineer.
            4.   Other unforeseen reasons that make it infeasible to locate the
planned communication equipment upon an existing support structure or other
structure.
         B.   Determining Feasibility of Collocation. Collocation shall be
deemed to be feasible when all of the following are met:
            1.   The applicant/ provider will pay market rent or other market
compensation for collocation.
            2.   The site is able to provide structural support, considering
reasonable modification or replacement of a facility.
            3.   The collocation being considered is technically reasonable and
will not result in unreasonable interference, given appropriate physical
adjustments.
            4.   The height of the structure necessary for collocation will not
be increased beyond maximum height limits.
         C.   Refusal to Permit Collocation. If a party who owns or otherwise
controls a wireless communication support structure shall fail or refuse to
alter a structure to accommodate a feasible collocation, such facility shall
thereafter be a nonconforming structure and use, and shall not be altered,
expanded or extended in any respect.
         D.   Refusal of Collocation Constitutes Violation. If a party who owns
or otherwise controls a facility shall fail or refuse to permit a feasible
collocation, and this requires the construction and/or use of a new wireless
communication support structure, the party failing or refusing to permit a
feasible collocation shall be deemed to be in direct violation and
contradiction of the policy, intent and purpose of this section of the zoning
ordinance.
         E.   Violation Resulting in Prohibition of New Structures.
Consequently, such party shall take responsibility for the violation, and shall
be prohibited from receiving approval for a new support structure within the
City of Davison for a period of five years from the date of the failure or
refusal to permit the collocation.
         F.   Appeal of Prohibition; Variance. Such a party may seek and obtain
a variance form the Zoning Board of Appeals if and to the limited extent the
applicant demonstrates entitlement to variance relief which, in this context,
shall mean a demonstration that enforcement of the five-year prohibition would
unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent wireless
communication services, or that such enforcement would have the effect of
prohibiting the provision of personal wireless communication service.
         G.   Offer of Collocation Required. An application for a new wireless
communication support structure shall include a letter from the applicant to
all potential users offering an opportunity for collocation. The list of
potential users shall be provided by the City of Davison based on those
entities who or which have requested approval of a wireless communication
facility, current FCC license holders, and other entities requesting to be on
the list. If, during a period of 30 days after the notice letters are sent to
potential users, a user requests, in writing, to collocate on the new support
structure, the applicant shall accommodate the request(s), unless collocation
is not feasible based on the criteria of this section.
      (10)   Removal. When a wireless communication facility has not been used
for six months or six months after new technology is available which permits
the operation of a facility without the requirement of a wireless communication
support structure, all or parts of the wireless communication facility shall be
removed by the users and owners of the facility and owners of the property.
         The removal of antennas or other equipment from the facility, or the
cessation of operations (transmission and/or reception of radio signals) shall
be considered as the beginning of a period of non-use. The situation(s) in
which removal of a wireless communication facility is required may be applied
and limited to a portion of the facility.
         A.   Upon the occurrence of one or more of the events requiring
removal, the property owner or persons who had used the wireless communication
facility shall immediately apply for and secure the application for any
required demolition or removal permits, and immediately proceed with and
complete the demolition or removal, restoring the condition which existed prior
to the construction of the facility.
         B.   If the partial or total required removal of the wireless
communication facility or a portion thereof has not been lawfully completed
within 60 days of the applicable deadline, and after at least 30 days’ written
notice, the City of Davison may remove or secure the removal of the facility or
required portions thereof, with its actual costs and reasonable administrative
charges to be drawn or collected from the security posted at the time
application was made for establishing the facility or, if necessary, through
appropriate judicial remedies. Such changes, if not paid within six months,
constitute a lien on the property and shall be placed in the next general tax
roll and collected as a part of the general City taxes.
      (11)   Radio Frequency Emission Standards. Wireless communication
facilities shall comply with applicable Federal and State standards relative to
electromagnetic fields and the environmental effects of radio frequency
emissions.
      (12)   Effect of Approval.
         A.   Subject to division (i)(12)B. below, final approval for a
wireless communication support structure shall be effective for a period of six
months.
         B.   If construction of a wireless communication support structure is
commenced within two miles of the land upon which a facility has been approved,
but upon which construction has not been commenced during the six-month period
of effectiveness, the approval for the support structure that has not been
commenced shall be void 30 days following written notice from the City of the
commencement of the other support structure. Such voiding shall apply unless
the applicant granted approval for the support structure which has not been
commenced, demonstrates that it would not be feasible to collocate on the
support structure that has been newly commenced.

shall be maintained an unobstructed landscaped greenbelt planting area between
the nearest point of the off-street parking area and the front lot line. The
width of the landscaped greenbelt planting area shall be at least fifteen (15)
feet. The Planning Commission may modify this requirement and instead allow a
reduction in width, based on evidence presented by the property owners and/or
their agents, showing that the reasonable ability to comply with the

permitted to occupy a portion of the required side yard, provided that there
shall be maintained an unobstructed landscaped greenbelt planting area between
the nearest point of the off-street parking area and the side lot line. The
width of the landscaped greenbelt planting area shall be at least fifteen (15)
feet. The Planning Commission may modify this requirement and instead allow a
reduction in width, based on evidence presented by the property owners and/or
their agents, showing that the reasonable ability to comply with the
requirement does not exist by reason of limited site area or natural feature
characteristics. The Planning Commission may require evergreen screening or a
screen wall in its place.
(Ord. 2008-07. Passed 11-10-08.)

modified by the Planning Commission. Lots abutting residential districts or
uses shall have a minimum rear yard of one hundred (100) feet and be designed
with a greenbelt buffer and berm that complies with the standards described in
Section
1288.22. Pre-platted lots located within the boundary of the Local Development
Finance Authority (LDFA) district that abut a residential district or use are

and identity of Davison, the following performance standards shall apply to all
uses within the T Technology district:
   (a)   All outdoor lighting shall be limited to fifteen (15) feet in height
when located three hundred (300) feet from a residentially zoned district and
further subject to the provisions of Section

   (a)   No structure shall be erected, altered or moved into the City except
in conformity with all of the regulations pertaining to such structure and
pertaining to the district in which such structure is located or to be located.
   (b)   No structure shall be erected, altered or moved into the City without
a permit authorizing such erection, alteration or movement having previously
been issued.
   (c)   No permit shall be issued unless a site plan showing compliance with
all of the requirements of this Zoning Code has been approved by the Building
Official or, in the case of a use requiring approval of the Planning
Commission, by such Commission. In the case of an existing structure, there
must be a finding by the Building Official that the structure is in conformity
with all existing ordinances and regulations, or that the alteration, after
moving, will permit compliance with all such ordinances and regulations.
However, nothing in this section shall prevent the issuance of a permit for a
variance duly granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (d)   No structure shall hereafter be erected or altered to exceed the
height or bulk, to accommodate or house a greater number of families, to occupy
a greater percentage of lot area or to have narrower or smaller rear yards,
front yards, side yards or other open spaces than required by this Zoning Code,
or in any other manner contrary to the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (e)   No part of a yard, or other open space, or off-street parking or
loading space, required for, or in connection with, any land use or structure,
for the purpose of complying with this Zoning Code, shall be included as part
of a yard, open space or off-street parking or loading space similarly required
for any other land use or structure, except as otherwise specifically permitted
under this Zoning Code.
   (f)   No yard or lot existing at the time of the passage of this Zoning Code
shall be reduced in dimensions or area below the minimum requirements set forth
in this Zoning Code. Yards or lots created after the effective date of this
Zoning Code shall meet at least the minimum requirements established by this
Zoning Code.
   (g)   No structure shall be constructed within a flood plain of any natural
watercourse, such as to diminish the capacity of the flood plain to store run-
off or to impede the free flow of such run-off.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95; Ord. 2001-4. Passed 10-8-01.)
1288.02 CONSTRUCTION OR CONTRACTS UNDER EXISTING PERMITS; BUILDING COMPLETION
PERIOD.
   Any structure for which a permit has been issued, and construction of the
whole or a part of which has been started, or for which a contract has been
entered into pursuant to a permit issued prior to the effective date of this
Zoning Code may be completed and used in accordance with the plans and
applications on which such permit was granted, provided that the construction
permitted by such permit has been prosecuted and completed within one (1) year
from the date of issuance of such permit and per the requirements of Section
1288.19.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95; Ord. 2001-4. Passed 10-8-01.)
1288.03 ONE-FAMILY DWELLING STANDARDS.
   (a)   Every one-family dwelling unit hereafter erected shall:
      (1)   With the exception of mobile homes in mobile home parks, have a
minimum square footage based on the requirements of the zoning district where
the dwelling is located.
      (2)   Have a minimum width across any section of twenty-four (24) feet
and shall comply in all respects with the State Construction Code. Where a
dwelling is required, by law, to comply with any Federal or State standards or
regulations for construction, and where such standards or regulations allow
standards of construction which are less stringent than those imposed by the
State Construction Code; then, and in that event, the less stringent Federal or
State standard or regulation shall apply.
      (3)   Be firmly attached to a permanent foundation constructed on the
site in accordance with the State Construction Code and co-extensive with the
perimeter of the building, which attachment shall also meet all applicable
building codes and other State and Federal regulations.
      (4)   Not have exposed wheels, towing mechanism, undercarriage or
chassis.
      (5)   Be connected to a public sewer and water supply or to such private
facilities approved by the County Health Department.
      (6)   Contain a storage area, whether in a basement located under the
dwelling, in an attic area, in closet areas or in a separate structure, being
of standard construction similar to, or of better quality than, the principal
dwelling. Such storage shall be in addition to the space for the storage of
automobiles and shall be equal to not less than fifteen (15) percent of the
minimum square footage requirement of this Zoning Code for the zone in which
the dwelling is located. In no case, however, shall more than two hundred (200)
square feet of storage area be required by this provision.
      (7)   Be aesthetically compatible in design and appearance with other
residences in the vicinity, and with either a roof overhang of not less than
six (6) inches on all sides, or alternatively with window sills and roof
drainage systems concentrating roof drainage along the sides of the dwelling;
with not less than one (1) exterior door being in the front of the dwelling and
containing permanently attached steps connected to said exterior door area
where a difference in elevation requires the same.
   The compatibility of design and appearance shall be determined in the first
instance by the City Building Official upon review of the plans submitted for a
particular dwelling, subject to appeal by an aggrieved applicant to the Board
of Zoning Appeals within a period of fifteen (15) days from the receipt of
notice of said Building Official's decision. Any determination of compatibility
shall be based upon the following standards:
         A.   Architectural style is not restricted. Evaluation of the
appearance of a project shall be based on the quality of its design and
relationship to its surroundings.
         B.   Buildings shall have a good scale and be in harmonious
conformance with permanent neighboring development.
         C.   Materials shall have good architectural character and shall be
selected for harmony of the building with adjoining buildings.
         D.   Materials shall be selected for suitability to the type of
buildings and the design in which they are used. Buildings shall have the same
materials, or those that are architecturally harmonious, used for all building
walls and other exterior building components wholly or partly visible from
public ways.
         E.   Materials shall be of durable quality.
         F.   In any design in which the structural frame is exposed to view,
the structural materials shall be compatible within themselves and harmonious
with their surroundings.
         G.   Building components, such as windows, doors, eaves, and parapets,
shall have good proportions and relationships to one another.
         H.   Mechanical equipment or other utility hardware on roof, ground,
or buildings shall be screened from public view with materials harmonious with
the building, or they shall be so located as not to be visible from any public
ways.
         I.   The roof overhang and pitch shall be comparable to the overhang
and pitch of homes typically found in the surrounding area, provided the pitch
of the roof shall not be less than one (1) foot of rise for each three (3) feet
of horizontal run.
         J.   Any determination of compatibility shall be based upon the
standards set forth in this section, as compared against the character, design,
and appearance of one (1) or more residential dwellings located outside of
mobile home parks within one thousand (1,000) feet of the subject dwelling,
where such area is developed with dwellings to the extent of not less than
twenty (20) percent of the lots situated within said area; or, where said area
is not developed, by the character, design, and appearance of one (1) or more
residential dwellings located outside of mobile home parks throughout the City.
The foregoing shall not be construed to prohibit innovative design concepts
involving such matters as solar energy, view, unique land contour, or relief
from the standard designed home.
      (8)   Comply with all pertinent building and fire codes. In the case of
mobile homes, the standards for mobile home construction as contained in the
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) regulations
entitled "Mobile Home Construction and Safety Standards," as amended, shall
apply. Additionally, all dwellings shall meet or exceed all applicable roof
snow load and strength requirements.
   (b)   The foregoing standards shall not apply to a mobile home located in a
licensed mobile home park except to the extent required by State or Federal
law, or otherwise specifically required in this Zoning Code pertaining to such
parks.
   (c)   All construction required herein shall be commenced only after a
building permit has been obtained in accordance with the applicable State
Construction Code provisions and requirements.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1288.04 ON-SITE SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS.
   Before any permit is issued under the provisions of this Zoning Code, the
applicant shall obtain an endorsement in writing from the County Health
Department or the Building Official approving his or her plans for any on-site
sewage disposal system, which system shall be in accordance with State law,
County regulations or these Codified Ordinances, whichever is the most
restrictive, and in accordance with the applicable regulations of the Genesee
County Sewage Disposal District No. 1.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95; Ord. 2001-4. Passed 10-8-01.)
1288.05 WATER SUPPLY.
   (a)   Every building or structure hereafter erected or moved upon any
premises and used in whole or in part for dwelling, recreational, business,
commercial, or industrial purposes shall be provided with a safe, adequate and
sanitary water supply. All plumbing work relating to the water supply system
shall conform to the material and installation standards set forth in the State
Plumbing Code.
   (b)   Where a public water system is not available, each fixture for which
water for human consumption may be obtained shall be supplied from a system
which meets the minimum requirements of the State, the County Health
Department, the State Department of Health, or these Codified Ordinances,
whichever is greater.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1288.06 EXCAVATIONS AND SANITARY LANDFILLS.
   (a)   The excavation and removal of soil shall be permitted only under
renewable annual permit, subject to the approval of the Planning Commission
based on a finding that the proposed excavation operation and the conditions in
which the excavation site will be left will not be detrimental to the
surrounding land uses or to the public health, safety, morals and general
welfare. However, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to
excavations for the construction of a structure for which a building permit has
been issued.
   (b)   The sanitary landfill or the filling and grading of any lot shall be
permitted only under a permit for a prescribed period of time, to be determined
by the Commission, and upon a finding by the Commission that the proposed
sanitary landfill filling or grading will not encroach upon an existing flood
plain, will not adversely affect surface water drainage and will not be
detrimental to surrounding land uses or to the public health, safety, morals,
and general welfare.
   (c)   The Commission may require all documents necessary to make the
foregoing finding and impose such conditions as it deems necessary to safeguard
the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare.
   (d)   The findings of the Commission shall be made upon the review procedure
outlined in
Chapter 1262.
   (e)   The Commission shall establish the amount of a bond and require a
posting of such bond, in favor of the City, holding the City free of all
liability incidental to such excavation or sanitary landfill and to assure
performance in accordance with the conditions required by the Commission.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1288.07 NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS.
   (a)   Intent.
      (1)   It is the intent of this Zoning Code to permit existing, legal
nonconforming lots, structures, and uses to continue until they are removed,
but not to encourage their survival.
      (2)   It is recognized that there exists, within the districts
established by this Zoning Code and subsequent amendments thereto, lots,
structures, and uses of land and structures which were lawful before this
Zoning Code was passed or amended which would be prohibited, regulated, or
restricted under the terms of this Zoning Code or future amendments.
      (3)   Such uses are declared by this Zoning Code to be incompatible with
permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this
Zoning Code that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, or
extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited
elsewhere in the same district.
      (4)   A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or
a nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged
after passage of this Zoning Code by attachment on a building or premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition
of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district
involved.
      (5)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Zoning Code shall be
deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any
building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code and upon which actual
building construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is
hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in a permanent
position and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or
removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to
rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided that work shall be diligently carried on until
completion of the building involved.
      (6)   Any nonconforming use which has ceased its usual conduct of
business for a period of one (1) year or more shall be considered to have been
terminated and may not thereafter commence operations.
      (7)   The use or occupancy of a nonconforming structure, which was a
lawful structure at the time of the effective date of this Zoning Code, may be
continued, provided that no enlargement, change or alteration shall be
permitted upon such nonconforming structure, except upon a finding by the
Building Official that such enlargement, change or alteration will bring such
structure into conformity with this Zoning Code, and that the use within such
structure is in conformity with the requirements of this Zoning Code; and
provided, further, that no enlargement, change or alteration of a nonconforming
structure housing a nonconforming use shall be permitted, except upon a finding
by the Board of Zoning Appeals that such enlargement, change or alteration will
permit greater compliance with the provisions of this Zoning Code and that
adequate provisions, as required by the Board of Zoning Appeals, are installed
or instituted to minimize the detrimental effects of the nonconforming use upon
adjoining conforming uses.
   (b)   Nonconforming Lots. In any single-family district, notwithstanding
limitations imposed by other provisions of this Zoning Code, a single-family
dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of
record which is under separate and distinct ownership from adjacent lots at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code. This provision
shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or
width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district; provided that
yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or width or both, of
the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is
located. Yard requirement variances may be obtained through approval of the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (c)   Nonconforming Uses of Land. Where, at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this Zoning Code, lawful use of land exists that is made no
longer permissible under the terms of this Zoning Code as enacted or amended,
such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
      (1)   Enlargement or extension. No such nonconforming use shall be
enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was
occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   Relocation. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in
part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code.
      (3)   Cessation of use. If such nonconforming use of land ceases for any
reason for a period of more than thirty (30) days, any subsequent use of such
land shall conform to the regulations specified by this Zoning Code for the
district in which such land is located.
      (4)   Nonconforming structures generally. Where a lawful structure exists
at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code that could
not be built under the terms of this Zoning Code by reason of restrictions on
area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or
its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
         A.   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity. However, existing residences on lots of a width
less than required herein may add a rear porch, provided that other
requirements relative to the yard space and land coverage are met with the
approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
         B.   Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of
more than fifty (50) percent of its replacement cost, exclusive of the
foundation at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in
conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
         C.   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is removed.
      (5)   Nonconforming uses of structures and land. If a lawful use of a
structure, or of a structure and land in combination, exists at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code, that would not be allowed in
the district under the terms of this Zoning Code, the lawful use may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
         A.   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
Zoning Code in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
         B.   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use, and which
existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code, but no such
use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
         C.   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and land in combination, may be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same or more restricted classification provided that
the Board of Zoning Appeals, either by general rule or by making findings in a
specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more
appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting
such change, the Board of Zoning Appeals may require conditions and safeguards
in accordance with the purpose and intent of this Zoning Code. Where a
nonconforming use of a structure, land, or structure and land in combination,
is hereafter changed to a more conforming use, it shall not thereafter be
changed to a less conforming use.
         D.   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on
which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located,
and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
         E.   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or a structure and
premises in combination, is discontinued or ceases to exist for twelve (12)
consecutive months or eighteen (18) months during any three (3)-year period,
the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter
be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it
is located. Structures occupied by seasonal uses (one season out of each year)
shall be excepted from this provision.
         F.   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and
premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall
eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
      (6)   Repairs and maintenance.
         A.   On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming
use, work may be done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months on
ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures,
wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding sixty-five (65) percent of the
assessed value of the building as determined by the most recent City record of
assessment, provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at
the time of passage or amendment of this Zoning Code shall not be increased.
         B.   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring or repair of normal wear and tear to a safe
condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official
charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.
      (7)   Conditional use interpretation. Any conditional use as provided for
in this Zoning Code shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall, without
further action, be deemed a conforming use in such district.
      (8)   Change of tenancy or ownership. There may be a change of tenancy,
ownership, or management of any existing nonconforming uses of land,
structures, and premises, provided that there is no change in the nature or
character of such nonconforming uses.
      (9)   Acquisition. The City Council may acquire, by purchase,
condemnation, or otherwise, private property or an interest in private property
for the removal of nonconforming uses. The cost and expense, or a portion
thereof, of acquiring the private property may be paid from general funds or
assessed to a special district in accordance with the applicable statutory
provisions relating to the creation and operation of special assessment
districts for public improvements in cities. The elimination of the
nonconforming uses and structures in a zoning district is declared to be for a
public purpose and for a public use. The City Council may institute and
prosecute proceedings for condemnation of nonconforming uses and structures
under the power of eminent domain in accordance with Act 149 of the Public Acts
of 1911, as amended, being Sections
213.21 to 213.41 of the Michigan Compiled Laws or other applicable statute.

1288.09 YARD AND LOT AREA REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Lot Measurements. No area shall be counted as accessory to more than
one (1) principal structure or use, and no area necessary for compliance with
the open space requirements for one (1) principal structure or use shall be
included or counted in the calculation of the open space accessory to any other
principal structure or use. In the determination of a land area where a
structure is to be erected, altered or used, no road right-of-way shall be
included in the computation of the required minimum land area.
      (1)   Depth of a lot shall be considered to be the distance between the
midpoints of straight lines connecting the foremost points to the side lot
lines in front and the rear-most points of the side lot lines in the rear.
      (2)   Width of a lot shall be the distance along a straight line
connecting side lot lines and measured across the lot, between side lot lines,
at the required setback line. Side lot lines shall be as nearly perpendicular
or radial to the street lines as practical.
      (3)   The front of a lot shall be the portion nearest the street and, for
the purposes of determining yard requirements on corner lots, all sides of a
lot adjacent to streets shall be considered frontage, and setbacks shall be
provided as required in this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Yards. All front, side, and rear yard setbacks shall be the minimum
distance, measured on a line perpendicular to the respective front, side, or
rear lot line, to the nearest point of the principal structure, excluding all
projections which project less than three (3) feet from the structure wall and
which do not exceed four (4) feet in length.
      (1)   No fence or wall shall be permitted within any required front yard
which materially impedes vision across such yard above the height of two (2)
feet, and no hedge or other vegetation shall be permitted which materially
impedes vision across such yard between heights of three (3) feet and eight (8)
feet, all of which shall be measured from the existing grade at the base of
such vegetation, provided, however, that this provision shall not affect any
yard area where the natural ground elevation is more than four (4) feet above
the centerline elevation.
      (2)   In the case of corner lots which do not have reversed frontage, the
front yard requirements shall apply to all sides of the lot which abut a
street.
      (3)   In any district where a lot runs through a block from street to
street and where a front yard is required, such front yard shall be provided
along each street lot line.
      (4)   In the case of through lots, side yards shall extend from the set-
back lines of required front yards. In the case of corner lots, front yard
requirements shall apply to each side of the lot which abuts a street. The rear
yard shall be considered as that area adjacent to the side of the principal
structure which is opposite to that side of the principal structure in which
the main entrance is located.
      (5)   Width of a required side yard shall be measured in such a manner
that the yard established is a strip of at least the minimum width required by
district regulations.
      (6)   Depth of a required rear yard shall be measured in such a manner
that the yard established is a strip of at least the minimum width required by
district regulations.
         A.   When the rear line of a corner lot abuts the side line of an
adjoining lot in a Residential District, no accessory structure shall be within
eight (8) feet of such abutting lot line or closer to the side street lot line
than the front yard setback of the principal structure on the adjoining lot,
but in no case shall the setback be less than twenty-five (25) feet.
         B.   When the rear line of a corner lot with reverse frontage abuts
the side line of an adjoining lot in a Residential District, no accessory

same block face.
      (4)   Side yards. The required combined width of side yards on lots
existing prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code, and with a width of
less than that specified in the Residential District provisions affecting the
district in which such lot is located, may be reduced six (6) inches for each
foot or major fraction thereof by which the width of such lot is less than the
required district provisions, provided that the minimum side yard shall not be
less than five (5) feet and the combined width of both side yards shall not be
less than fifteen (15) feet.
      (5)   Rear yards. Any platted and recorded lot with less than one hundred
ten (110) feet of depth and located in a Residential District may have three
(3) inches deducted from the required rear yard depth for every foot the lot is
less than one hundred ten (110) feet deep, provided that no rear yard shall be
less than twenty (20) feet.
   (b)   Essential Services. Essential services serving the City of Davison
shall be permitted as authorized and regulated by law and applicable ordinances
of the Municipality. Overhead or underground lines and necessary poles and
towers proposed to be erected to service primarily those areas beyond the
Municipality shall require the review and approval, after a public hearing, of
the City Council acting in the capacity of appeal board. Such review shall
consider abutting property and uses as they relate to easements, rights-of-way,
overhead lines, poles and towers and, further, shall consider injurious effects
on property abutting or adjacent thereto and on the orderly appearance of the
City of Davison.
   (c)   Voting Places. The provisions of this Zoning Code shall not be so
construed as to interfere with the temporary use of any property as a voting
place in connection with a Municipal or other public election.
   (d)   Height Limits. The height limitations of this Zoning Code shall not
apply to farm buildings, chimneys, church spires, flag poles, public monuments,
or television receiving antennae for personal use; provided, however, that the
City Council may specify a height limit for any such structure when such
structure requires authorization as a conditional use.
   (e)   Yard Regulations. When yard regulations cannot reasonably be complied
with, or where their application cannot be determined on lots of peculiar
shape, topography or due to architectural or site arrangement, such regulations
may be modified as determined by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (f)   Porches. An open, unenclosed, porch or paved terrace may project into
a front yard for a distance not exceeding ten (10) feet or one-half (1/2) the
distance to the right-of-way line, whichever is less.

(3) feet.
   (h)   Access Through Yards. For the purpose of this Zoning Code, access
drives may be placed in the required front or side yards so as to provide
access to rear yards or accessory or attached structures. These drives shall
not be considered as structural violations in front and side yards. Further,
any walk, terrace, or other pavement servicing a like function, and not in
excess of nine (9) inches above the grade upon which placed, shall, for the
purpose of this Zoning Code, not be considered to be a structure, and shall be
permitted in any required yard.

1288.20 ADAPTIVE REUSE PROJECTS.
   (a)   Intent. Typically, various land use activities are provided for in one
(1) or more zoning districts. The criteria for such allocations are based upon
similarities in the nature of uses and their relationship to other such uses
and adjoining development. Zoning districts are also established to coordinate
with and provide for the effectuation of the City's long-range development
plan.
   The City does, however, possess various existing specialized structures
which have become functionally obsolete for their original purpose and whose
redevelopment or conversion in conformance with the City of Davison Master Plan
would be unnecessarily burdensome. It is therefore the intent of this section
to set forth the basic qualifying criteria, project classification, development
standards, and submittal requirements necessary to provide for the adaptive
reuse of eligible properties within the City to support the local economic and
employment base without adversely affecting the public health, safety, and
welfare of the City as a whole.
   (b)   Qualifying Criteria.
      (1)   The City Council shall approve the adaptive reuse of nonresidential
buildings and uses. In qualifying a site for adaptive reuse, the City Council
shall find the following conditions to exist:
         A.   The subject site is zoned in compliance with the City of Davison
Master Plan;
         B.   The use can no longer be reasonably continued for its existing
purpose by reason of market conditions or operational constraints (i.e.,
limited site size, floor area deficiencies, parking or loading area, etc.);
         C.   Site redevelopment in accordance with local development codes
would be unnecessarily burdensome by reason of ordinance compliance
(restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of
the structure or its location on the lot) or cost; and
         D.   The subject site has frontage on, or direct access to, an
improved major or secondary thoroughfare.
      (2)   The City Council may not grant adaptive reuse status to any
property whose principal structures are found to be destroyed by any means to
the extent of more than sixty (60) percent of its replacement cost. Any
subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located.
   (c)   Data Required.
      (1)   Application for an adaptive reuse project as provided under the
provisions of this Zoning Code shall be made to the Building Official by filing
an application form; submitting required data, exhibits, and information; and
depositing the required fee as established by resolution of the City Council,
and as may be amended from time to time. No portion of such fee shall be
reimbursable to the applicant.
      (2)   An application shall contain the following:
         A.   The applicant's name, address, and telephone number.
         B.   The address and tax description number of the subject parcel.
         C.   A signed statement that the applicant is the owner of the subject
parcel, or is acting as the owner's representative.
         D.   A certified survey drawing of the subject parcel.
         E.   Supporting statements, evidence, data, information and exhibits
which address those qualifying criteria for assessing special condition use
permit applications outlined in subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Public Hearing Requirements. Upon receipt of an application for an
adaptive reuse project, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing,
one (1) notice of which shall be published not less than five (5) nor more than
fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing date in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City and sent by first class mail to the owners of the
property for which an adaptive reuse project is being considered, to the owners
of record of all real property and to the occupants of all structures located
within three hundred (300) feet of the boundaries of the property in question.
The notice shall:
         A.   Describe the nature of the adaptive reuse request.
         B.   Adequately describe the property in question.
         C.   State the date, time, and place of the public hearing.
         D.   Indicate when and where written comments concerning the request
will be received.
   (e)   Project Classification.
      (1)   Upon holding a public hearing and receipt of the recommendations by
the City administration, the Planning Commission shall determine whether the
qualifying criteria have been met as set forth in subsection (b) hereof.
         The Planning Commission shall, within thirty (30) days of making such
determination, forward to the City Council its finding and recommendation.
      (2)   The City Council, upon receipt of the finding, may table action for
purposes of further study or gaining additional information, deny the
application for adaptive reuse upon finding that the criteria have not been
met, or approve the application for adaptive reuse upon finding that the
qualifying criteria have been met.
      (3)   If the applicant for adaptive reuse is approved, the City Council
shall designate the applicant's property as either a Class I or Class II site.
         A.   Class I sites permit the conversion of institutional or business
uses in residential zones. Properties may be redeveloped and/or converted to
offices, multifamily developments, care facilities and similar uses deemed no
more objectionable then the aforementioned uses.
         B.   Class II sites permit the conversion of industrial uses in
residential or commercial zones. Properties may be redeveloped and/or converted
to any Class I purpose, business uses, as well as less intensive industrial
development in areas zoned for business.
   (f)   Development Standards.
      (1)   In areas meeting the above criteria, development standards
governing setbacks, building height, minimum lot sizes, and lot coverage may be
modified by the Planning Commission upon finding adequate evidence that the
proposed use:
         A.   Will be compatibly designed, constructed and maintained with the
existing and intended character of the vicinity;
         B.   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future
neighboring uses;
         C.   Will be served adequately by essential public services and
facilities or the agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed
use shall be able to adequately provide for such services; and
         D.   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials,
equipment, and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any person,
property, or the general welfare by reason of excessive smoke, fumes, glare,
noise, vibration, or odor.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may require such additional safeguards as
deemed necessary for the protection of the general welfare and for insuring
individual property rights and for insuring that the intent and objectives of
this Zoning Code will be observed.
   (g)   Site Plan Requirements. Site plan approval shall be required in
accordance with
Chapter 1262 of this Zoning Code and all applicable ordinances. The Planning
Commission may, at its discretion, concurrently review the site plan at the
time of its review of qualifying criteria.
   (h)   Design Review Requirements. Design review approval shall be required
in accordance with
Chapter 1263.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1288.21 RECREATIONAL VEHICLE STORAGE.
   (a)   Storage of recreational vehicles is permitted on property that is
zoned or used for residential purposes when a principal building is on site
when said vehicle(s) are located:
      (1)   In the rear yard.
      (2)   In the side yard, when parked on an approved surface limited to
asphalt, concrete, or pavers, as approved by the Building Official. This
surface is not the same as the paved parking pad described in Section 1290.05
(d) and is not applicable to the storage of recreational vehicles.
      (3)   In the front yard, only when adequate ingress and egress is not
available because of a permanent difficulty to the side or rear yard setback
area, as determined by the Building Official. In these cases, storage may be

1288.22 LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Intent. Landscaping, greenbelts, and screening are necessary for the
protection and enhancement of the environment and for the continued vitality of
all land uses in the City. Landscaping and greenbelts are capable of enhancing
the visual environment, preserving natural features, improving property values,
and alleviating the impact of noise, traffic, and visual disruption related to
intensive uses. Screening is important to protect less intensive uses from the
noise, light, traffic, litter and other impacts of intensive nonresidential
uses. The purpose of this section is to set minimum standards for the
protection and enhancement of the environment through requirements for the
design and use of landscaping, greenbelts, and screening.
   (b)   Scope of Application. The requirements set forth in this section shall
apply to all uses, lots, sites, and parcels requiring site plan review which
are developed or expanded following the effective date of this Zoning Code. No
site plan shall be approved unless said site plan shows landscaping consistent
with the provisions of this section. Furthermore, where landscaping is
required, a building permit shall not be issued until the required landscape
plan is submitted and approved, and a certificate of occupancy shall not be
issued unless provisions set forth in this section have been met or a
performance bond has been posted in accordance with the provisions set forth in
Section
1262.14.
   In cases where the use of an existing building changes or an existing
building is changed or otherwise altered or re-occupied, all of the standards
set forth herein shall be met.
   The requirements of this section are minimum requirements, and nothing
herein shall preclude a developer and the City from agreeing to more extensive
landscaping.
   (c)   Landscaping Design Standards. Except as otherwise specified in the
general requirements for each zoning district, all landscaping shall conform to
the following standards:
      (1)   General landscaping. All developed portions of the site shall
conform to the following general landscaping standards, except where specific
landscape elements, such as a greenbelt, berms, or screening, are required:
         A.   All portions of the landscaped area shall be planted with grass,
ground cover, shrubbery, or other suitable plant material, except that paved
patios, terraces, sidewalks and similar site features may be incorporated with
Planning Commission approval.
         B.   A mixture of evergreen and deciduous trees shall be planted at
the rate of one (1) tree for each three thousand (3,000) square feet or portion
thereof of landscaped open-space area.
         C.   Required trees and shrubs may be planted at uniform intervals, at
random, or in groupings.
         D.   In consideration of the overall design and impact of the
landscape plan, the Planning Commission may reduce or waive the requirements
outlined herein for general landscaping, or for landscaping in greenbelt areas,
on berms, or as part of a screen, provided that any such adjustment is in
keeping with the intent of this Zoning Code, and, more specifically, with the
intent of subsection (a) hereof, and upon a finding that the existing
vegetation to be maintained on the site generally accomplishes the same effect
in accordance with this subsection.
         E.   The total landscaped area shall be the basis for determining the
required number of trees or shrubs, irrespective of the portion which is
devoted to patios, terraces, sidewalks, or other site features.
      (2)   Greenbelt buffer. Where required, greenbelts and greenbelt buffers
shall conform to the following standards:
         A.   A required greenbelt or greenbelt buffer may be interrupted only
to provide for roads or driveways for vehicular access.
         B.   Grass, ground cover, or other suitable live plant material shall
be planted over the entire greenbelt area, except that paving may be used in
areas of intensive pedestrian circulation.
         C.   A minimum of one (1) deciduous tree or evergreen tree shall be
planted for each fifty (50) linear feet or portion thereof of required
greenbelt length. Required trees may be planted at uniform intervals, at
random, or in groupings.
         D.   For the purpose of determining required plant material, required
greenbelt area length shall be measured along the periphery of the greenbelt
area.
      (3)   Berms. Where required, earth berms or landscaped berms shall
conform to the following standards:
         A.   The berm shall be at least three (3) feet above the grade
elevation, and shall be constructed with slopes no steeper than one (1) foot
vertical for each four (4) feet horizontal with at least a two (2)-foot flat
area on the top. For the purposes of this provision, grade elevation shall be
the ground elevation at the property line adjacent to the proposed berm.
         B.   The berm area shall be planted with grass or other suitable
ground cover to ensure that it withstands wind and weather and retains its
height and shape.
         C.   A minimum of one (1) deciduous or evergreen tree shall be planted
for each fifty (50) linear feet or portion of required berm.
         D.   Eight (8) shrubs per tree may be planted as substitutes for trees
required in paragraph (c)(3)C. hereof.
         E.   Required trees and shrubs may be planted at uniform intervals, at
random, or in groupings.
         F.   For the purpose of determining required plant material, required
berm length shall be measured along the exterior periphery of the berm.
         G.   Berms shall not disrupt the natural flow of water/runoff.
      (4)   Parking lot landscaping. Off-street parking areas shall be
landscaped as follows:
         A.   In off-street parking areas containing greater than twenty (20)
spaces, at least five (5) percent of the total parking area shall be used for
interior landscaping. Whenever possible, parking lot landscaping shall be
arranged to improve the safety of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, guide
traffic movement, and improve the appearance of the parking area.
         B.   Parking lot landscaping shall be no less than five (5) feet in
any single dimension and no less than one hundred fifty (150) square feet in
any single area and shall be protected from parking areas with curbing or other
permanent means to prevent vehicular encroachment onto the landscaped areas.
         C.   The landscape plan shall designate the sizes, quantities, and
types of plant material to be used in parking lot landscaping.
         D.   Required landscaping elsewhere on the parcel shall not be counted
in meeting the parking lot landscaping requirements.
         E.   A minimum of one (1) deciduous tree shall be planted in each
landscaped area.
      (5)   Evergreen screening. Where required, evergreen screening shall
consist of closely-spaced plantings which form a complete visual barrier that
is at least six (6) feet above ground level within five (5) years of planting.
      (6)   Landscaping of rights-of-way and other adjacent public open space
areas. Public rights-of-way and other public open-space areas adjacent to
required landscaped areas and greenbelts shall be planted with grass or other
suitable ground cover and maintained by the owner of the adjacent property as
if they were part of required landscaped areas and greenbelts.
      (7)   Regulations pertaining to landscaping areas used for sight distance
(clear vision zone). When a driveway intersects a public right-of-way or when
the subject property abuts the intersection of public rights-of-way, all
landscaping within the corner triangular areas described below shall permit
unobstructed cross-visibility. Shrubs located in the triangular area shall not
be permitted to grow to a height of more than twenty-four (24) inches above the
centerline elevation of abutting pavement. Portions of required berms located
within sight distance triangular areas shall not exceed a height of twenty-four
(24) inches above the centerline elevation of abutting pavement. Trees may be
maintained in this area provided that all branches are trimmed to maintain a
clear vision for a vertical height of eight (8) feet above the roadway surface,
except that not more than two (2) trees with trunks of not more than thirty
(30) inches in diameter each, and clear of any branches for such heights, may
be located within such area. Landscaping, except grass or ground cover, shall
not be located closer than three (3) feet from the edge of a driveway.
            The triangular areas referred to above are:
         A.   The area formed at the corner intersection of a public right-of-
way and a driveway, two (2) sides of the triangle area being ten (10) feet in
length measured along the right-of-way line and driveway line and the third
side being a line connecting these two (2) sides.
         B.   The area formed at a corner intersection of two (2) public right-
of-way lines, the two (2) sides of the triangular area being twenty-five (25)
feet in length measured along the abutting public right-of-way lines and the
third side being a line connecting these two (2) sides.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)

(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1288.24 WALLS.
   (a)   For the use districts and uses listed below, there shall be provided
and maintained on those sides abutting or adjacent to a Residential District an
obscuring wall. Required walls shall be located adjacent to the lot line except
where underground utilities interfere and except in instances where this Zoning
Code requires conformance with yard setback lines. Upon review of the site
plan, the Planning Commission may approve an alternate location for the wall,
or may modify the wall requirement by approving either an earth berm or
evergreen screen in its place. The Planning Commission may also waive the wall
requirement if, in specific cases where natural or man-made barriers exist, the
same would accomplish the same obscuring effect and, due to these
circumstances, the Planning Commission would find that no good purpose would be
served by compliance with the requirements of this section.
   (b)   The height of the wall shall be in accordance with the following
schedule measured from the surface of the parking area or land on the
nonresidential side of the wall:
         Use               Height Requirements

   (c)   In the case of variable wall height requirements such as in paragraphs
(b)(1), (2) and (3) hereof, the extent of an obscuring wall shall be determined
by the Planning Commission on the basis of land usage, provided that no wall or
berm shall be less than the above required minimum, nor greater than the above
required maximum height.
   (d)   Required walls shall have no openings for vehicular traffic or other
purposes, except as otherwise provided in this Zoning Code and except such
openings as may be approved by the Planning Commission. All walls herein
required shall be constructed of materials approved by the Building Official to
be durable, weather resistant, and easily maintained.
   (e)   The requirement for an obscuring wall between off-street parking
areas, outdoor storage areas, and any abutting residential district may be
waived at the discretion of the Planning Commission when such areas are located
more than two hundred (200) feet distant from an abutting Residential District.

required.
   (d)   Information and Data Required. The submission of a site plan review as
provided by
Chapter 1262 of this Zoning Code shall be accompanied by a natural resources
analysis, which shall be submitted by and at the expense of the petitioner.
Submission shall be made concurrently with the payment of site plan review
fees.
   The natural resources analysis shall include, but not be limited to, the
following information:
      (1)   Site conditions of the subject property indicating the location,
size, and type of existing natural resources. Such information shall be
displayed on a map in relation to the subject parcel's property lines and

block highway, street, ally, or pedestrian walkways when emptying, installing,
or replacing solid waste containers.
   (f)   Solid waste containers shall be located on a sufficiently solid
surface that the emptying vehicle or mechanical device, regardless of weather
condition, will not disturb the surface upon which the containers are placed or
the approach to the containers used by the emptying vehicle or mechanical
device.
   (g)   Solid waste containers used temporarily for special events do not
require screening, but the solid surface requirements in subsection (f) apply.
Users of temporary solid waste containers shall notify the City of the purpose,
placement and time-frame for temporary solid waste containers. Temporary solid
waste containers shall not block traffic or visibility on any street, sidewalk,
or thoroughfare.

1289.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and control the development of
land within the City, which for any reason is not otherwise subject to the
Subdivision Regulations, in order to promote the public health, safety,
comfort, convenience and general welfare of the residents of the City; to
provide for the orderly growth and harmonious uniform development of the City
consistent with the Master Plan or such portions thereof as have been
promulgated; to secure adequate traffic circulation through coordinated street
systems so as to lessen congestion on the streets and highways; to ensure
adequate provisions for water, drainage and sanitary sewer facilities and other
health requirements; to achieve the maximum utility and liveability on
individual land parcels or lots; to encourage the subdivision of large tracts
into smaller tracts; and to provide logical procedures for the achievement of
these purposes.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1289.02 SCOPE; CONFLICTS.
   This chapter shall not apply to any lot forming part of a subdivision
platted and recorded under the provisions of the Subdivision Regulations.
Further, this chapter shall not apply to the lot size of any lot forming part
of a subdivision platted and recorded under the Subdivision Regulations adopted
May 19, 1958, or any applicable ordinance antedating those Regulations so long
as the boundaries of any such lot are not altered by division or other means.
In this connection, the filing of an Assessor's Plat without an actual boundary
change shall not be construed as altering the boundary of any lot or parcel of
land. Further, this chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, annul or in
any way impair or interfere with existing provisions of other laws or
ordinances, or with private restrictions placed upon property by deed, covenant
or other private agreement, or with restrictive covenants running with the land
to which the City is a party. Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction
upon land than is imposed or required by such existing provisions of law,
ordinance, contract or deed, the provisions of this chapter shall control.

appurtenances, and sanitary and storm sewer lines and their appurtenances.
         Should the Planning Commission determine that the services of an
engineer, architect or planning consultant are necessary to properly evaluate a
proposed site plan and related documents for a condominium project, the cost of
such services shall be reimbursed by the developer prior to the granting of
project approval. Such costs shall be reasonable for the services rendered.
   (b)   All nonpublic service drives, driveways and parking areas shall be

Utilities and Public Services Code.
   (e)   Of the total open space within the project, the portion planned and/or
maintained for the recreational use of condominium members may, after
development, be given to the City as a public park, provided that Council
agrees to accept the same. Council shall not accept any such parcel unless it
is so situated as to be readily used by the general public and maintained by
the City and unless it conforms to the Davison Community Master Plan prepared
by Wade-Trim/Associates.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1289.11 PUBLIC EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Water System. Public easements shall be provided for all water mains
and service lines. The easements shall exist on service lines to the point
where the service valve is installed outside of each structure for each meter
located within such structure. A separate water meter and service shall be
provided for each unit in each structure. Each such meter shall have as its
water source a separate service valve located outside of the structure. No
building or structure shall be located over any water easement. In the case of
multiple service valves for any structure, each shall be clearly and
permanently marked in an approved manner as to which unit it serves within the
structure.
   (b)   Sanitary Sewer System. All sanitary sewer lines with an inner diameter
of eight (8) inches or more shall be located within a public easement. No
building or structure shall be located over any sanitary sewer easement. Where
necessary to permit the logical extension of such sewers for the development of
adjacent property, such easements may be required as a part of the site review
procedure.
   (c)   Storm Sewer System. Storm sewer easements may be required by the City
where essential to permit the logical extension of such sewers for the
development of adjacent property. The requirement for such easements, if any,
shall be established during the site plan review procedure. No building or
structure shall be located over any such storm sewer easement.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1289.12 UNCOMPLETED SUBDIVISIONS UNDER FORMER SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE.
   If the improvements of any proposed subdivision, approval for which was
given by Council prior to the adoption of this Zoning Code have not been
completed by the effective date of this chapter, the improvements required in
all such cases shall be those specified in the Subdivision Regulations, and no
building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued without such
compliance as herein provided. In all such cases, agreements shall be entered
into between the current developer of such uncompleted subdivision and the
City, in accordance with Section
1246.03.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1289.13 AGREEMENTS AS TO IMPROVEMENTS.
   If the Planning Commission approves a proposed development and Council
concurs, then Section
1246.03 shall apply and the builder or developer and the City shall enter into
the agreements indicated therein before proceeding with development.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1289.14 IMPROVEMENT PLANS.
   Owners or developers of individual land parcels which require improvements
or provisions therefor under the provisions of this chapter prior to the
issuance of a building permit shall prepare suitable plans for such
improvements, after consultation with the Planning Commission, and file them
with the City Clerk, who shall transmit them to the Commission within three (3)
working days. Such owner or developer shall secure approval of the Commission
and the Building Official for such improvement plans. The Commission shall
indicate by resolution that it has reviewed such plans and found them to be in
conformity with the requirements of this chapter. The Building Official shall
indicate his or her approval by a certificate of approval, prior to
consideration of the plans by the Commission. Such approval shall be given
within thirty days of the date of submission to the City Clerk unless the plans
are rejected for cause, in which case the submitter shall be so notified in
writing within such thirty (30)-day period.
   After the Commission and the Building Official have approved the plans, the
approval action shall be confirmed by Council within thirty (30) days of the
date of Commission approval. At the time of consideration of the improvement
plans by Council, the owner or developer shall also submit to Council the
agreements as to improvements herein required in a form suitable for execution.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1289.15 CITY APPROVAL REQUIRED PRIOR TO FILING CONDOMINIUM APPLICATION.
   The approval of the City shall be obtained prior to the filing by the
developer of an application for a condominium project, either part one or part
two or both parts, with the Michigan Department of Commerce, Securities Bureau,
in accordance with Act No. 59 of the Public Acts of 1978, as amended. The
approval procedure shall be as follows:
   Where condominium projects consisting of new construction are proposed,
approval of both the condominium subdivision plan and the corresponding master
deed of which it is a part shall be obtained concurrently using the procedures
provided in the Subdivision Regulations, as supplemented by this chapter. These
approval procedures shall also serve as and shall include the site plan review
procedure required in this Zoning Code.
   (a)   Filing for Preliminary Approval. The developer shall file with the
City Clerk an application for preliminary approval, together with a fully
completed copy of the State Department of Commerce, Securities Bureau,
application for condominium project, parts one and two, except that part one
may be omitted if the developer certifies that he or she will not take
nonbinding reservations prior to the sale of apartments. In addition, he or she
shall file the required copies of a site plan in accordance with this Zoning
Code, together with at least the following portions of the proposed master
deed:
      (1)   A legal description of the land; and
      (2)   The proposed bylaws for the association of co-owners, which shall
comply with Section
1289.18, and the proposed articles of incorporation for the association if it
is to be incorporated. These shall be accompanied by a preliminary filing fee
of five dollars ($5.00) per gross acre included within the project.
   (b)   Preliminary Approval. Upon approval of the site plan and related
documents by the Planning Commission, a notice of conditional approval shall be
given as provided in the Subdivision Regulations. Upon concurrence by Council,
the developer may, if he or she so elects and has filed such part one with his
or her application, file part one of the State application for condominium
project with the Department of Commerce, Securities Bureau. Following
preliminary approval, the master deed should be completed and shall include all
modifications and amendments required by the Planning Commission and confirmed
by Council.
   (c)   Filing for Final Approval. The application for final condominium
project approval shall be filed within one (1) year after the date of
preliminary condominium project approval by Council, unless an extension of
this period has been granted by Council for good cause prior to the expiration
of the one-year period; otherwise, the preliminary approval shall be considered
void and the procedure for filing for preliminary approval shall again be
followed. The developer, during either the one (1)-year period or a valid
extension thereof and at least one (1) week prior to the Planning Commission
meeting at which it is to be considered, shall file with the City Clerk an
application for final approval, together with five (5) copies of the proposed
complete master deed, together with agreements relative to proposed public
improvements, as indicated in Section
1246.03, and all other applicable documents required. These shall be
accompanied by the final filing fee of five dollars ($5.00) per unit in the
project, or in the portion of the total project for which approval is then
being requested, and either a revised copy of part two (2) of the State
application for condominium project or a statement certifying that there have
been no changes affecting such application since its filing with the
application for preliminary approval. The master deed with all accompanying
documents shall be examined by both the City Attorney and the Building Official
within one (1) week after filing in order to determine that the project is in
full compliance with the formal and technical provisions of this chapter, this
Zoning Code and the Condominium Act, with all agreements in order and
enforceable upon their formal acceptance by Council.
      Further, the Building Official shall find that all amendments upon which
contingent approval of the site plan was granted by the Planning Commission and
confirmed by Council have been incorporated in the master deed. The City
Attorney and the City Manager shall endorse the application for final approval
with their individual findings and return it to the City Clerk for appropriate
action. If the master deed and related documents are not approved by either the
City Attorney or the Building Official, or both, the developer shall be
immediately so notified by the City Clerk so that he or she may take necessary
corrective action. The refiling of such a corrected master deed and/or related
documents shall be done in the same manner as the original filing as provided
herein, except that no fee shall be required.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1289.16 CONVERSION OF EXISTING STRUCTURES TO CONDOMINIUM OWNERSHIP.
   Where conversion to condominium ownership is proposed, approval shall follow
the same procedure outlined above for new construction with the following
additional requirements:
   (a)   Such change in ownership shall be defined as a change in use, in
accordance with the Building Code of the City. Accordingly, the Building
Official shall inspect the structures and shall find compliance with the
provisions of the Building Code prior to any approval. Where substantial
noncompliance is found by such inspection, the Building Official shall order
necessary corrections which shall be completed prior to final approval, unless
agreements are provided guaranteeing such corrections prior to issuance of
certificates of occupancy, following approval of the conversion condominium
project by the State.
   (b)   The Building Official shall inspect all private streets, walks,
drives, driveways, parking areas, water systems and sanitary and storm sewer
systems serving the proposed condominium conversion project. He or she shall
find them of adequate size and in good repair and of such quality as likely to
be free of need for repair for at least five (5) years. He or she shall find
that all such streets, drives, walks, driveways and parking areas are
adequately paved and drained. Unless he or she so finds, no approval shall be
granted for a condominium conversion project unless agreements are supplied
guaranteeing necessary repairs and/or improvements to facilities which shall be
completed either prior to final approval or prior to issuance of certificates
of occupancy, following approval of the conversion condominium project by the
State.
   (c)   In the event of the disapproval of any proposed condominium project by
the State, all subsequent changes shall be submitted to the City for its
approval prior to their resubmission to the State. If the revisions do not
conflict with the provisions and intent of this chapter and other relevant City
ordinances, the Building Official and the Chairperson of the Planning
Commission are authorized to grant approval for resubmission to the State.
Should the revisions substantially change any part of the master deed as
approved, in the opinion of either the Building Official or the Chairperson of
the Planning Commission, then the revised project shall be resubmitted to the
Planning Commission for final approval in accordance with this chapter. Fees in
such case shall be twenty percent of the original final application fee.
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1289.17 ACTION FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF CITY APPROVAL.
   Following City approval of the master deed and condominium subdivision plan,
as herein provided, the City Clerk shall endorse each with a notice of City
approval and the date of Council's action, together with his or her signature,
and return the same to the developer for filing with the Michigan Department of
Commerce, Securities Bureau. The developer shall furnish the City with a
reproducible duplicate of the complete master deed, on polyester drafting film,
as approved by the City and the Michigan Department of Commerce, Securities
Bureau, within thirty (30) days of the Bureau's approval. In addition, one (1)
copy of the master deed reduced to eight and one-half by fourteen (8-1/2 x 14)
inches in accordance with the Bureau's regulations, and as recorded by the
County Register of Deeds and bearing the information about recording, shall be
filed with the City Clerk, together with the Bureau's "permit to sell order."
(Res. 24-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
1289.18 BYLAWS OF CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATION OF CO-OWNERS.
   The bylaws of each condominium project association of co-owners shall be
subject to City approval and shall contain provisions indicating that the water
lines, sewer lines, streets, street lighting, sidewalks and other elements
which constitute public services between each structure, are a part of the
general common elements of the project to be designed, constructed, operated,
and maintained in conformity with City standards by the persons designated to
administer the affairs of the project or by the City when turned over to and
accepted by the City. The bylaws shall also state that the City shall have the
right to withhold or deny occupancy permits for any or all apartments until all
required improvements have been provided or until agreements have been signed
ensuring that all such required improvements will be provided in strict
conformity with these Codified Ordinances at no cost to the City and providing
an acceptable means of financing such improvements if the developer does not
complete such improvements by an acceptable date. The bylaws shall also contain
the provision that any future revision of the bylaws, as provided therein,
shall not be effective until and unless approved by the City. City approval in
any such case shall be given only when either the proposed changes do not
affect public services or their maintenance as indicated or, if they do affect
public services, they are satisfactory in their revised form to the Planning
Commission with concurrence by Council.

1290.04 OFF-STREET PARKING MODIFICATIONS AND REDUCTIONS.
   (a)   If public parking spaces are provided within five hundred (500) feet
of the subject property line, public parking may count towards up to seventy-
five (75) percent of the total minimum parking requirement for the requested
use.
   (b)   During review of a site plan or conditional use, the Planning
Commission may authorize a reduction or modification of any of the off-street
parking regulations provided in this
Chapter 1290 based upon findings, standards, and conditions as provided below.
      (1)   The Planning Commission may defer the construction of a portion of
parking spaces required in
Table 1290-A, subject to all of the following requirements:
         A.   All deferred parking spaces must be reflected on the approved
site plan. The applicant must demonstrate the ability to accommodate the
minimum off-street parking requirement but is not required to install the
deferred parking spaces until such time it is deemed necessary by the Planning
Commission.
         B.   The owner shall demonstrate that the required number of parking
spaces is excessive for the nature of their business or operational
characteristics.
         C.   An area of sufficient size to meet the deferred number of parking
spaces, along with setbacks, landscaping, access drives, aisles and other
required parking lot features, shall be retained as open space.
         D.   A deferred parking site plan shall identify the area where
parking is being deferred, including dimensions and parking lot layout.
         E.   Stormwater management requirements shall be based on the full
amount of required parking to ensure adequate capacity if additional parking is
determined to be necessary at a later date.
         F.   The owner shall provide a written agreement to construct the
deferred parking within six (6) months of a written notice from the Zoning
Administrator based on observed need, or to give at least thirty (30) days
prior notice to the Zoning Administrator if the deferred parking area is to be
constructed.
      (2)   The Planning Commission is authorized to reduce the minimum number
of parking spaces up to twenty-five (25) percent upon finding that the
applicant meets the requirements for one (1) or more of the allowable
reductions of this section.
      (3)   In reviewing a parking reduction, the Planning Commission shall
consider the following factors, as applicable.
         A.   The land use and development character of the area to be served
by the parking facility, including the relative intensity of uses requiring
parking, proximity of nearby employment centers and residential uses, and other
relevant factors;
         B.   The availability of other publicly available parking in the area,
including information such as number of spaces, any applicable restrictions
(time limits, dedicated parking areas, etc.), or other uses also counting
spaces in the same parking area for meeting parking requirements;
         C.   The timing of parking use relative to other uses in the area
including information regarding hours of operation or other operational parking
needs that would permit use of the spaces;
         D.   Whether the location of all provided parking meets the
requirements of this chapter;
         E.   Whether compliance with
Table 1290-A. is made to the maximum extent practicable taking into account
parking lot design and efficiency of the layout;
         F.   Whether other adjustments as described in this section should
apply in conjunction with or in lieu of the requested need-based adjustment;
and
         G.   Whether supporting documentation, if provided, adequately
demonstrates that sufficient parking is available to meet projected typical
demand.
         H.   The request for development of deferred parking spaces may
originate from the owner of the property, the Building Official, or the
Planning Commission upon a perceived demonstration of need. The Planning
Commission shall adhere to the site plan review process, including public
notice requirements, outlined in Section
1262.19, prior to requiring the installation of any previously deferred off-
street parking spaces.

District shall be provided with required paved parking areas on the same lot
with the building or on a lot immediately adjacent to the lot with the building
intended to be served.
   (b)   Such parking areas shall not be located in any required front yard or
required side yard, except that in a case of a dwelling with a driveway leading
to a garage or parking area, the drive may be used for parking. Yard setback
requirements for parking areas shall be the same as those required for

1466.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of the flood plain area to protect the natural, human and
economic resources of the City and to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare by application of special regulations for the use of land which
may be subject to periodic inundation at predictable intervals, which may be
subject to soil erosion or which may be particularly suited to provide for the
impoundment of waters for the purpose of storm water control or ground water
recharge. Such regulations, while permitting reasonable economic use and
considering the physical limitations of such land, will help to protect the
public health, safety and general welfare and will reduce the financial burden
imposed upon the community which may result from the improper use of land. All
lands included in such area shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter
in addition to the provisions of any other ordinance applicable to the district
in which such lands may be located.

1466.03 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and for promotion of the public health,
safety and welfare and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study.
Larger floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by
man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by
debris. Approval of the use of land or premises under this chapter shall not be
considered approval, guarantee or warranty of safety or suitability. This
chapter does not imply that areas outside the flood plain districts or land
uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood
damage. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 78-7. Passed 9-25-78.)
1466.04 DETERMINATION OF FLOOD PLAIN AREA.
   The flood plain area shall be considered to overlay existing zoning
districts and the regulations pertaining thereto are in addition to those
imposed by the underlying zoning districts. The flood plain area within the
jurisdiction of this chapter is hereby divided into three areas: ground water
recharge areas, floodway areas and floodway fringe areas. The location and
boundaries of ground water recharge areas shall be determined on a case by case
basis by the City Engineer or any other professional retained by the City who
is competent in the field of water resources or hydrology. The location and
boundaries of the floodway and floodway fringe areas shall coincide with those
locations and boundaries for floodways and floodway fringe areas as shown on
the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map and by the Flood Insurance Study, as
published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
