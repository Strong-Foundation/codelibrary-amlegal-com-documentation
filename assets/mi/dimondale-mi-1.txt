Ordinances that all provisions and sections of these Codified Ordinances be
liberally construed to protect and preserve the peace, health, safety and
welfare of the inhabitants of the Village. Should any provision or section of

this Code for the violation of any particular provision or section, every
person found responsible for a violation of this Code shall be guilty of a
Municipal civil infraction and shall pay a civil fine of not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00) plus costs, damages, and expenses as follows:
      (1)   A person found responsible by the judge or district court
magistrate for any violation of this Code charged as a Municipal civil
infraction shall pay the stipulated civil fine and costs to be determined by
the court or magistrate, which may include all expenses, direct and indirect,
to which the Village has been put in connection with the Municipal civil
infraction, up to the entry of the judgment. Costs of not less than nine
dollars ($9.00) or more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) shall be ordered.
      (2)   In addition to ordering the defendant to pay a civil fine, costs,
damages, and expenses, the judge or district court magistrate may issue such
writs or injunctive orders as necessary to abate a nuisance as provided in
M.C.L.A. 600.2940, or issue any judgment, writ or order necessary to enforce a
Village ordinance as provided in M.C.L.A. 600.8302.
      (3)   If a defendant fails to comply with an order or judgment issued
pursuant to this section within the time prescribed by the Court, the Court may
proceed under M.C.L.A. 600.8729 and M.C.L.A. 600.8731. A defendant who fails to
answer a citation or notice to appear in court for a Municipal civil infraction
is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine of not more than
five hundred dollars ($500.00) and imprisonment for not more than ninety days,
or both, plus court costs for each offense.
      (4)   If a defendant does not pay a civil fine or costs or expenses or an
ordered installment payment within thirty days after the date on which payment
is due in a Municipal civil infraction action brought for a violation involving
the use or occupation of land or a building or other structure, the Village may
obtain a lien against the land, building or structure involved in the violation
by recording a copy of the court order requiring payment of the fine, costs,
and expenses with the Eaton County Register of Deeds containing the legal
description of the property, which lien may be recorded and enforced in the
manner provided by M.C.L.A. 600.8731.
      (5)   In a Municipal civil infraction action involving the use or
occupancy of land or a building or other structure, a copy of the citation need
not be personally served upon the alleged violator but may be served upon an
owner or occupant of the land, building, or structure by posting the copy on
the land or attaching the copy to the building or structure. In addition, a
copy of the citation shall be sent by first-class mail to the owner of the
land, building, or structure at the owner's last known address.
      (6)   Each act of violation and every day upon which a violation shall
occur shall constitute a separate offense.
   (b)   Surcharges; Equitable Remedies. The imposition of any penalty provided
for in this section shall be in addition to any surcharge levied for a
violation or for noncompliance with a provision of these Codified Ordinances,
or a provision of a technical or other code adopted by reference in these
Codified Ordinances, or a rule, regulation or order promulgated or made under
authority of either, or of State law, and shall be in addition to any equitable
remedy provided by a provision of these Codified Ordinances, or a provision of
a technical or other code adopted by reference in these Codified Ordinances, or
a rule, regulation or order promulgated or made under authority of either, or
of State law, including the enforced removal of prohibited conditions.
   (c)   Complicity. Every person concerned in the commission of an offense
under these Codified Ordinances, whether he or she directly commits the act
constituting the offense or procures, counsels, aids or abets in its
commission, may be prosecuted, indicted, tried and on conviction shall be
punished as if he or she had directly committed such offense.

206.01 CHANGE OF BOUNDARIES INITIATED BY LANDOWNER.
   (a)   Petition. Any owner of land adjacent to or intersected by a boundary
of the Village, who wishes to have the entire parcel or portion thereof
included in or excluded from the Village, may petition the Village Council to
initiate a change in Village boundaries. Such petition shall contain a
description by metes and bounds of the lands proposed to be added to or taken
out of the Village and shall set forth the reasons for the proposed change.
Such petition shall be accompanied by a deposit in an amount to be set by
resolution of the Village Council to cover the expenses of said change of
boundaries.
   (b)   Fees. From the deposit there shall be deducted all expenses incurred
by the Village in the course of considering and acting upon said change of
boundaries, including fees for the publishing of required notices of boundary
change and zoning of added property, costs of special meetings, if any, of
bodies required to consider said boundary change and zoning, attorney's fees
for the drafting and presenting of necessary petitions and resolutions, and all
other expenses actually incurred by the Village. If the expenses incurred are
less than the deposit, the Clerk shall refund the difference to the landowner.
If the expenses incurred exceed the deposit, the landowner shall be required to
pay the difference to the Village. The Clerk has the discretion to require a
second deposit in an amount to be set by the Clerk whenever expenses actually
incurred exceed the deposit on hand prior to completion of the boundary change.
   (c)   Council Action. If the Village Council deems the boundary change
desirable, it shall resolve that a petition be filed for such change with the
Eaton County Board of Commissioners and that such other steps be taken as
required by law.

210.01 FINDINGS.
   The Village of Dimondale has determined that establishing procedures and
methods for the recovery of costs associated with emergency responses to the
release of hazardous materials, establishing the appropriate amount to be
charged for such services, and establishing a liability for costs associated
with a response to a hazardous materials release, are necessary to the health,
safety and welfare of the Village and its population, and that such recovery is
necessary to fairly allocate costs in connection with such activities.

where an incident arises which involves the release or threatened release of
hazardous materials on or about said building, premise, property and/or
vehicle, shall be required to reimburse the Village and Township for all
expenses of an emergency response to said hazardous materials incident.
   (b)   Charge Against Person Liable. The expenses of an emergency response
shall be a charge against the person liable for the expenses under this
chapter. The charge constitutes a debt of that person and is collectible by the
Village or Township in the same manner as an obligation under contract, express
or implied.
   (c)   Cost Recovery and Billing Procedures. Following the conclusion of the

   (e)   Failure to Pay; Procedure to Recover Costs. Any failure by the person
described in this chapter as liable or responsible for the expenses of an

response costs to the tax roll of such property involved in the hazardous
materials incident and to levy and collect such costs in the same manner as
provided for the levy and collection of real property taxes against said
property or premises. The Village and/or Township may also pursue such other
remedies or may institute any appropriate action or proceedings in any court of
competent jurisdiction to collect charges imposed pursuant to this chapter. The
recovery of charges imposed under this chapter shall not limit the liability of
responsible parties under local ordinances or State or Federal law, rule or
regulation. The responsible party may remit payment for all such charges
without admitting liability for any other purpose.
(Ord. 97-5. Passed 2-9-98.)
210.05 OTHER REMEDIES.
   The remedies provided in this chapter shall be in addition to any other
remedies available in equity or at law and such penalties as provided by law or
ordinance.

(Ord. 99-9. Passed 12-13-99.)
212.07 MUNICIPAL ORDINANCE VIOLATIONS BUREAU.
   (a)   Bureau Established. The Village hereby establishes a Municipal
Ordinance Violations Bureau ("Bureau"), as authorized under Section 8396 of the
Act, to accept admissions of responsibility for Municipal civil infractions in
response to Municipal civil infraction violation notices issued and served by
authorized Village officials, and to collect and retain civil fines and costs
as prescribed by this chapter or any other ordinance.
   (b)   Location; Supervision; Employees; Rules and Regulations. The Bureau
shall be located at the Village Office and shall be under the supervision and
control of the Village Manager. The Manager, subject to the approval of the
Village Board, shall adopt rules and regulations for the operation of the
Bureau and appoint any necessary qualified Village employees to administer the
Bureau.
   (c)   Disposition of Violations. The Bureau may dispose only of Municipal
civil infraction violations for which a fine has been scheduled and for which a
Municipal civil infraction violation notice (as compared with a citation) has
been issued. The fact that a fine has been scheduled for a particular violation
shall not entitle any person to dispose of the violation at the Bureau. Nothing
in this chapter shall prevent or restrict the Village from issuing a Municipal
civil infraction citation for any violation or from prosecuting any violation
in a court of competent jurisdiction. No person shall be required to dispose of
a Municipal civil infraction violation at the Bureau and may have the violation
processed before a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The unwillingness of any
person to dispose of any violation at the Bureau shall not prejudice the person
or in any way diminish the person's rights, privileges and protection afforded
by law.
   (d)   Bureau Limited to Accepting Admissions of Responsibility. The scope of
the Bureau's authority shall be limited to accepting admissions of
responsibility for Municipal civil infractions and collecting and retaining
civil fines and costs as a result of those admissions. The Bureau shall not
accept payment of a fine from any person who denies having committed the
offense or who admits responsibility only with explanation, and in no event
shall the Bureau determine, or attempt to determine, the truth or falsity of
any fact or matter relating to an alleged violation.
   (e)   Municipal Civil Infraction Violation Notices. Municipal civil
infraction violation notices shall be issued and served by authorized Village
officials under the same circumstances and upon the same persons as provided
for citations in Section
212.05. In addition to any other information required by this chapter or other
ordinance, the notice of violation shall indicate the time by which the alleged
violator must appear at the Bureau, the methods by which an appearance may be
made, the address and telephone number of the Bureau, the hours during which
the Bureau is open, the amount of the fine scheduled for the alleged violation,
and the consequences for failure to appear and pay the required fine within the
required time.
   (f)   Appearance; Payment of Fines and Costs. An alleged violator receiving
a Municipal civil infraction violation notice shall appear at the Bureau and
pay the specified fine and costs at or by the time specified for appearance in
the Municipal civil infraction violation notice. An appearance may be made by
mail, in person, or by representation.
   (g)   Procedure Where Admission of Responsibility Not Made or Fine Not Paid.
If an authorized Village official issues and serves a Municipal ordinance
violation notice and if an admission of responsibility is not made and the
civil fine and costs, if any, prescribed by the schedule of fines for the
violation are not paid at the Bureau, a Municipal civil infraction citation may
be filed with the District Court and a copy of the citation may be served by
first-class mail upon the alleged violator at the alleged violator's last known
address. The citation shall comply in all particulars with the requirements for
citations as provided by Sections 8705 and 8709 of the Act and shall fairly
inform the alleged violator as to how to respond to the citation.
(Ord. 99-9. Passed 12-13-99.)
212.08 SCHEDULE OF CIVIL FINES.
   (a)   A schedule of fines payable to the Municipal Ordinance Violations
Bureau for admissions of responsibility by persons served with Municipal

      (3)   Third offense      500.00
   (b)   A copy of the schedule, as amended from time to time, shall be posted
at the Bureau.
   (c)   Unless another penalty is expressly provided for in this section or by
any other Village ordinance for the violation of any particular provision or
section, every person found responsible by the judge or District Court
magistrate for a violation of any provision of a Village ordinance designated
as a Municipal civil infraction shall pay a civil fine of not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00), plus costs, damages and expenses, as follows:
      (1)   A person found responsible by the judge or District Court
magistrate for any violation of a Village ordinance charged as a Municipal
civil infraction shall pay the stipulated civil fine and costs to be determined
by the court or magistrate, which may include all expenses, direct and indirect
(including attorneys fees), to which the Village has been put in connection
with the Municipal civil infraction, up to the entry of the judgment. Costs of
not less than nine dollars ($9.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00)
shall be ordered.
      (2)   In addition to ordering the defendant to pay a civil fine, costs,
damages and expenses, the judge or District Court magistrate may issue such
writs or injunctive orders as are necessary to abate a nuisance as provided in
M.C.L.A. 600.2940, or issue any judgment, writ or order necessary to enforce
this chapter as provided in M.C.L.A. 600.8302.
      (3)   If a defendant fails to comply with an order or judgment issued
pursuant to this section within the time prescribed by the court, the court may
proceed under M.C.L.A. 600.8729 and M.C.L.A. 600.8731. A defendant who fails to
answer a citation or notice to appear in court for a Municipal civil infraction
is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine of not more than
five hundred dollars ($500.00) and costs of prosecution or by imprisonment for
not more than ninety days, or both such fine and imprisonment.
      (4)   If a defendant does not pay a civil fine or costs or expenses or an
ordered installment payment within thirty days after the date on which payment
is due in a Municipal civil infraction action brought for a violation involving
the use or occupation of land or a building or other structure, the Village may
obtain a lien against the land, building or structure involved in the violation
by recording a copy of the court order requiring payment of the fine, costs and
expenses with the Eaton County Register of Deeds containing the legal
description of the property, which lien may be recorded and enforced in the
manner provided by M.C.L.A. 600.8731.
      (5)   In a Municipal civil infraction action involving the use or
occupancy of land or a building or other structure, a copy of the citation need
not be personally served upon the alleged violator but may be served upon an
owner or occupant of the land, building or structure by posting the copy on the
land or attaching the copy to the building or structure. In addition, a copy of
the citation shall be sent by first-class mail to the owner of the land,
building or structure at the owner's last known address.
      (6)   Each act of violation and every day upon which a violation shall
occur shall constitute a separate offense.

necessary. The President of the Council shall rule on such requests. The ruling
will be based on the importance of the topic to the Village, the number of
persons present concerned with that and other topics, the length of the agenda
and other similar considerations.
      (7)   The topic of comments or presentations must be related to business
which may come before the Council or the health, safety and welfare of the
Village. The President shall rule out of order persons making comments as to
matters which may not be the subject of Council action.
      (8)   Members of the Council, Village officials or any other person
recognized by the President may have the privilege of asking questions of an
individual who has addressed the Council. Such questions and answers shall not
count against an individual's or group's time limit. The President of the
Council shall limit such questioning at such time as it becomes redundant, too
time-consuming or an attempt to extend the time limits set by these rules.
      (9)   If a presentation is to be made on a topic which is subject to a
closed session of the Council under Section 8 of Act 267, the President shall
halt the presentation for the purpose of Council consideration of whether the
presentation should be heard in closed session. After Council's decision on
whether to proceed in open or closed session and implementation of that
decision, the presentation will be allowed to proceed for the full allotted
time.
      (10)   Any order or decision of the President made under these rules may
be overruled by a majority vote of the trustees of Council in attendance at the
meeting.
(Ord. Unno. Passed 10-8-79.)
220.02 COMPENSATION.

284.01 PURPOSE.
   The placement of public art adds to the unique character and quality of life
of a community. Public art can play a part in strengthening civic identity and
community, and create a cultural economy. Arts and culture can enliven, awaken,
and stimulate a space and the people in and near that space.
   Public art can be the foundation for the creation of a “sense of place.”
Placemaking promotes health, happiness and wellbeing. Developing a sense of
place helps people identify with their region and with each other and thus
creates a sense of community. When public art is part of placemaking, creative
industries grow, populations and jobs stabilize, and residents and businesses
are attracted.
   Through this chapter, the Village of Dimondale seeks to provide
opportunities for public art, which further Dimondale’s goal of placemaking and
stimulate the local economy.
(Ord. 2015-3. Passed 6-8-15.)
284.02 DEFINITION.
   This chapter applies to all public art. “Public art”, as defined by this
chapter, encompasses the broadest definition of visual art including the
imaginative use and interplay of all artistic disciplines. Public art governed
by this chapter shall be art that is visually or physically accessible to the
public, and that is acquired by public funds, grants or donations, or provided
by a private entity as a community benefit.
(Ord. 2015-3. Passed 6-8-15.)
284.03 GOALS.
   Dimondale is committed to providing public art of exceptional quality which
adds to the community’s vibrancy and identity. Dimondale strives to:
   (a)   Use public art to help express the Village’s history and cultural
heritage.
   (b)   Foster the public’s understanding and enjoyment of public art.
   (c)   Use public art as a means to promote the Village’s sense of spirit,
pride, and development.
   (d)   Enrich the quality of life for Dimondale and the region by creating
exciting, appealing, and harmonious public spaces.
   (e)   Integrate public art into new community facilities.
   (f)   Enhance Dimondale’s image locally, regionally and nationally.
   (g)   Recognize public art’s contribution in economic development.
(Ord. 2015-3. Passed 6-8-15.)
284.04 ARTS COMMISSION ESTABLISHED.
   The Village President, with approval from the Village Council, shall create
an Arts Commission and subsequently instruct it to address a specific assigned
project, goal or need.
   (a)   The Commission’s responsibilities may include budget supervision,
securing a site location, releasing requests for proposals for artwork, the
selection of winning artists, making recommendations regarding the provision of
contracts with artists, supervising fabrication and placement, and the
dedication of art pieces.
   (b)   The Commission shall be made up of three to seven individuals
appointed by the Village Council, which may change for each project or
assignment. More than fifty percent of the Commission members shall be
residents of the Village. Efforts will be made to ensure that the members
represent the entire community including citizens, neighborhoods and
businesses, as appropriate according to the needs of each individual project.
Members shall be chosen from a diverse range of backgrounds, occupations and
artistic venues, with the intention of reflecting the full diversity of the
arts community.
   (c)   All Commission members must be free of conflict of interest or
potential for financial gain from the project or assignment.
   (d)   As appropriate, the Commission will be instructed to engage in an
outreach program that receives input from surrounding neighborhoods,
businesses, associations, artists, architects, landscape architects, engineers,
urban designers, etc.
   (e)   The Arts Commission shall adopt bylaws for the transaction of
business.
(Ord. 2015-3. Passed 6-8-15.)
284.05 ART SELECTION PROCESS.
   The information below outlines the suggested process for carrying out a
commissioned public art project. These steps are intended to be guidelines, as
it is recognized that each public art commission is unique and adjustments will
need to be tailored to each individual project.
   (a)   Step 1: Creation of Request for Proposals (RFP). Prior to sending out
the RFP, the Arts Commission will meet to assess the specific needs,
requirements and expectations of a public art installation. It is recommended
that the Commission establish scoring criteria and include it in an RFP.
      The RFP shall be provided to the Village Council along with a
recommendation from the Arts Commission. The Village Council shall approve the
recommendation, approve it with modifications or deny the recommendation.
      Once approval from the Village Council has been received, the Commission
shall send out the RFP to artists. The RFP shall at least include project
specific information regarding the location, style or nature of the placement,
type and theme of the project, and a project budget. The RFP will be
distributed to artists locally, throughout Michigan and nationally, as
appropriate, so that potential responses to the RFP come from the best possible
pool of potential artist candidates.
      The RFP may also request the following from artist candidates:
      (1)   Small scale model or rough draft of a three-dimensional work (when
appropriate) or complete drawing of a two-dimensional work.
      (2)   Drawings or photographs that demonstrate the relationship of the
artwork to the site.
      (3)   Material samples for the artwork and any relevant construction
materials.
      (4)   Installation details.
      (5)   Description of routine maintenance and estimate of maintenance
costs.
      (6)   Artist’s resume.
      (7)   Statement of interest in the project.
      (8)   Budget.
   (b)   Step 2: Artist Selection and Contracts. Proposed gifts, loans,
creation, and selection of Public Art will be reviewed by the Arts Commission
with a recommendation to the Village Council for final action. The following
criteria will be used in the development of recommendations:
      (1)   Quality and condition of the artwork.
      (2)   Use of local artists.
      (3)   Context in the Village’s collection. Does artwork enhance the
existing collection or add diversity? How does the piece engage the public? Are
the materials appropriate? Is the piece susceptible to vandalism or graffiti?
      (4)   Availability of an appropriate site.
      (5)   Durability of the artwork.
      (6)   Ability to maintain the artwork.
      (7)   Aesthetic merit.
Contracts will be completed under the supervision of the Village Manager, who
will facilitate attorney consultation when needed. Art ownership shall be
transferred to the Village of Dimondale at the time of installation, with no
rights remaining with the artist, unless otherwise established as “art on
loan", or a temporary installation. The contract should protect Dimondale from
the artist duplicating the exact work for sale to others without the permission
of the Village Council.
During design and installation, the Arts Commission shall work with the artist
to ensure all objectives are being met. After installation, the Arts Commission
will hold a dedication ceremony to formally introduce the art and the artist
will be identified with an appropriate plaque on the site when possible.
(Ord. 2015-3. Passed 6-8-15.)
284.06 GENERAL GUIDELINES.
   (a)   Donated or loaned artwork will include identifying plaques.
   (b)   All donated art will become part of Dimondale’s art collection and as
such may be relocated or decommissioned.
   (c)   Monetary donations to help fund public art acquisitions will be
accepted at any time and Dimondale will set those funds aside in a separate
account to be used only for new art purchases or upkeep of existing art.
   (d)   Proposed commissioned memorial art shall not ordinarily honor a living
person, unless that person has made a significant and outstanding contribution
to the arts or service in the community.
   (e)   Relocation or decommissioning of artwork is at the sole discretion of
the Village Council upon recommendation by the Arts Commission, and may be
implemented for any reason. Examples of reasons that may be considered include,
but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   The condition or security of the artwork cannot be reasonably
guaranteed in its present location.
      (2)   The artwork presents a public safety risk.

810.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose and intent of this section are to regulate the location of, but
not to exclude, adult businesses in the Village by preventing the concentration
of such uses in close proximity to each other and to minimize the negative
impacts of their operation by separating such uses from residential, office/
commercial and other areas of public congregation. This regulation is done with
the understanding that the Village recognizes that there are some uses which,
because of their very nature, have serious objectionable operational
characteristics, particularly if several of them are concentrated under
circumstances having a deleterious effect upon adjacent residential, office and
commercial areas. The Village recognizes that the regulation of such uses is
necessary to ensure that adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting
or downgrading of surrounding residential neighborhoods, nonresidential areas
or other places of public congregation.

822.01 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   It is the intent and purpose of this section to establish regulations and
concepts for placement of wireless communication towers and antennas. In this
regard, it is the desire of the Village to protect residential and commercial
areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of such towers and antennas;
and encourage the location of towers in agricultural areas, minimize the total
number of towers throughout the Village, encourage the joint use of new and
existing tower sites as a primary option, rather than construction of
additional single-use towers; encourage owners and users of such facilities to
place same to the extent possible in areas where adverse impact on the Village
is minimized; to encourage owners and users of such facilities to adopt designs
and configurations that minimize the adverse visual impact of said facilities,
including but not limited to siting, landscape, screening, camouflage technique
and coloration; to enhance the ability of providers of telecommunication
services to provide such services to users within the Village; to consider
public health and safety; and to avoid potential damage to adjacent properties
from tower failure through engineering and site selection.
(Ord. 2001-2. .Passed 8-13-01.)
822.02 APPLICABILITY.

(Ord. 2001-2. Passed 8-13-01.)
822.04 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Principal or Accessory Use. Antennas and towers may be considered
either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use of an existing
structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or
tower on such lot.
   (b)   Lot Size. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a
tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but
not limited to setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such
requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the
antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lot.
   (c)   Inventory of Existing Sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or
tower shall provide to the Zoning Administrator an inventory of its existing
towers, antennas, or sites approved for towers or antennas, that are either
within the jurisdiction of the Village or within one mile of the border
thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design
of each tower. The Zoning Administrator may share such information with other
applicants applying for administrative approvals or site plan approval under
this section or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the
jurisdiction of the Village; provided, however, that the Zoning Administrator
is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that
such sites are available or suitable.
   (d)   Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject
to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to
reduce visual obtrusiveness.
      (2)   At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures
shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and
landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting and surrounding
buildings.
      (3)   If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral
color that is identical to, or closely compatible with the color of the
supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
   (e)   Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by
the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting
alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the
surrounding views.
   (f)   State or Federal Requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current
standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the
state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas.
If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers
and antennas governed by this section shall bring such towers into compliance
with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective
date of such standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule
is mandated by the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring towers
and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall
constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's
expense.
   (g)   Building Codes; Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity
of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable State or local building codes
and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic
Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the
Village concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards
and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being
provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such
tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into
compliance within 30 days shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower
or antenna at the owner's expense.
   (h)   Measurement. For purposes of measurement, tower setbacks and
separation distances shall be calculated and applied to facilities located in
the Village, irrespective of municipal boundaries.
   (i)   Not Essential Services. Towers and antennas shall be regulated and
permitted pursuant to this section and shall not be regulated or permitted as
essential services, public utilities or private utilities.
   (j)   Franchises. Owners and/or operators of towers or antennas shall
certify that all franchises required by law for the construction and/or
operation of a wireless communication system in the Village have been obtained
and shall file a copy of all required franchises with the Zoning Administrator.
   (k)   Public Notice. For purposes of this section, any site plan review
request, variance request or appeal of an administratively approved use or site
plan review shall require public notice to all abutting property owners in
addition to any notice otherwise required by this section.
   (l)   Signs. No signs shall be allowed on an antenna or tower or related
fencing or accessory buildings. Provided, however, a weather resistant sign of
two square feet shall be placed on the perimeter fence near the entrance, with
the name and address of the owner of the tower and emergency phone number.
Also, signs for public safety may be provided on the perimeter fence, such as
"DANGER" or "NO TRESPASSING".
   (m)   Building and Support Equipment. Buildings and support equipment
associated with antennas or towers shall comply with the requirements of
Section
822.07(b)(8) of this chapter.
   (n)   Multiple Antenna/Tower Plan. The Village encourages the users of
towers and antennas to submit a single application for approval of multiple
towers and/or antenna sites. Applications for approval of multiple sites shall
be given priority in the review process.
   (o)   Consent to Co-location. All applicants for approval of tower placement
shall submit a written verification of the commitment of the tower owner and
said owner's successors and assigns to shared use of the tower if a future
applicant/co-locator agrees to pay a reasonable fee for such co-location.
Verification shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator prior to issuance of
any permit authorizing such use or tower construction. If co-location is
denied, the tower owner shall demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence,
that such co-location is not feasible and/or the fee for such use is not
reasonable.
   (p)   Liability and Property Insurance. All towers shall be covered by
liability and property and casualty insurance in specific dollar amounts as
shall be approved by the Zoning Administrator. The tower and structures shall
be insured at all times, and insurance coverage shall continue to be provided
in the event that the owner abandons the structure. The Village shall be named
as an additional insured so as to receive notice of any cancellation of the
insurance policy.
(Ord. 2001-2. Passed 8-13-01.)

      (7)   If an administrative approval is denied, the applicant shall file
an application for site plan review pursuant to Section
822.07of this chapter prior to filing any appeal that may be available under
this section.
   (b)   List of Administratively Approved Uses. The following uses may be
approved by the Zoning Administrator after conducting an administrative review:
      (1)   Existing structures or towers. Locating antennas on existing
structures or towers consistent with the following terms:
         A.   Antennas on existing structures. Any antenna which is not
attached to a tower may be approved by the Zoning Administrator as an accessory
use to any commercial, industrial, professional, institutional, or multi-family
structure of eight or more dwelling units, provided:
            1.   The antenna does not extend more than 30 feet above the
highest point of the structure;
            2.   The antenna complies with all applicable FCC and FAA
regulations; and
            3.   The antenna complies with all applicable building codes.
         B.   Antennas on existing towers. An antenna which is attached to an
existing tower may be approved by the Zoning Administrator and, to minimize
adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of
towers, co-location of antennas by more than one carrier
on existing towers shall take precedence over the construction of new towers,
provided such co-location is accomplished in a manner consistent with the
following: A tower which is modified or reconstructed to accommodate the co-
location of an additional antenna shall be of the same tower type as the
existing tower, unless the Zoning Administrator allows reconstruction as a
monopole.
      (2)   Height.
         A.   An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height,
not to exceed 30 feet over the tower's existing height, to accommodate the co-
location of an additional antenna.
         B.   The height change referred to in Section
822.06(b)(2)A. may only occur one time per communication tower.
         C.   The additional height referred to in Section
822.06(b)(2)A. shall not require an additional distance separation as set forth
in Section
822.07(b)(5). The tower's pre-modification height shall be used to calculate
such distance separations.
      (3)   On-site location.
         A.   A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the co-location of
an additional antenna may be moved on-site within 50 feet of its existing
location.
         B.   After the tower is rebuilt to accommodate co-location, only one
tower may remain on the site.
         C.   A relocated on-site tower shall continue to be measured from the
original tower location for purposes of calculation separation distances
between towers pursuant to Section
822.07(B)(5). The relocation of a tower hereunder shall in no way be deemed to
cause a violation of Section
822.07(b)(5).
         D.   The on-site relocation of a tower which comes within the
separation distances to residential units or residentially zoned lands as
established in Section
822.07(b)(5) shall only be permitted when approved by the Zoning Administrator.
(Ord. 2001-2. Passed 8-13-01.)
822.07 SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   (a)   General. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of site
plan approval for towers or antennas by the Planning Commission:
      (1)   If the tower or antenna is not a permitted use under Section
822.05(b) of this chapter or permitted to be approved administratively pursuant
to Section
822.06(b) of this chapter, then site plan review and approval shall be required
for the construction of a tower or the placement of an antenna in the A-
1 Agricultural Zoning District or for the location of any alternative tower
structure in any zoning district if, in the judgement of the Planning
Commission, the proposal is in conformity with the goals set forth in Section
822.01 of this chapter.
      (2)   Applications for site plan review under this division shall be
subject to the procedures and requirements of
Chapter 1290, except as modified in this division.

      (2)   Factors considered in approving site plan review applications for
towers. In addition to any standards for consideration of application for site
plan review pursuant to
Chapter 1290, the Planning Commission shall consider the following factors in
determining whether to approve the application for site plan review, although
the Planning Commission may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one
or more of these criteria if the Planning Commission concludes that the goals
of this section. are better served thereby:
         A.   Height of the proposed tower;
         B.   Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries;
         C.   Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
         D.   Surrounding topography;
         E.   Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
         F.   Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness;
         G.   Proposed ingress and egress; and
         H.   Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or structures, as
discussed in division (b)(3) of this section.
      (3)   Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technology. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant
demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Planning Commission that no
existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does not require the
use of towers or structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna.
An applicant shall submit information requested by the Planning Commission
related to the availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or
alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing
tower, structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's
proposed antenna may consist of any of the following:
         A.   No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area which meet applicant's engineering requirements;
         B.   Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet applicant's engineering requirements;
         C.   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment;
         D.   The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the
antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant's proposed antenna;
         E.   The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner
in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower
or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower
development are presumed to be unreasonable;
         F.   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors
that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
      (4)   Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all
towers for which site plan review is required; provided, however, that the
Planning Commission may reduce the standard setback requirements if the purpose
and goals of this section would be better served thereby:
         A.   Towers must be set back a distance equal to at least the height
of the tower from all property lines, unless a licensed engineer shall certify
that said tower is self-collapsing and will not collapse beyond the setback
proposed by the owner in the application.
         B.   Accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum zoning district
setback requirements.
      (5)   Separation. The following separation requirements shall apply to
all towers and antennas for which site plan review is required; provided,
however, that the Planning Commission may reduce the standard separation
requirements if the purpose and goals of this section would be better served
thereby:
         A.   Separation from off-site uses/designated areas:
            1.   Tower separation shall be measured from the base of the tower
to the lot line of the off-site uses and/or designated areas as specified in
Table 1, except as otherwise provided in Table 1.
            2.   Separation requirements for towers shall comply with the
minimum standards established in Table 1.
TABLE 1
Off-Site Use/Designated Area Separation Distance
TABLE 1
Off-Site Use/Designated Area             Separation Distance
Single-family or duplex residential      200 feet or 300% of height of tower,

greater than duplex units                whichever is greater
Land zoned TC Town Center District       100 feet or 100% of height of tower,
                                         whichever is greater.
Land zoned B-1 Business District         None; only setbacks apply
Notes:
1   Includes modular homes and mobile homes used for living purposes.
2   Separation measured from base of tower to closest building setback line.
3   Includes any unplatted residential use properties without a valid
preliminary subdivision plan or valid development plan approval and any multi-
family residentially zoned land greater than duplex.
 
         B.   Separation distances between towers: When it is determined that a
new tower is permitted pursuant to the criteria listed in division (b)(3) of
this section, the separation distance between towers shall be sufficient to
allow both the existing and proposed towers to operate at maximum efficiency.
Also, the separation distance shall be adequate to protect the aesthetic
character of the surrounding area.
      (6)   Security fencing. Towers and all associated equipment shall be
enclosed by security fencing not less than 8 feet in height and shall also be
equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, that the
Planning Commission may waive such requirement as it deems appropriate.
      (7)   Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the
landscaping surrounding towers for which site plan review is required;
provided, however, that the Planning Commission may waive such requirements if
the purpose and goals of this section would be better served thereby:
         A.   Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant
materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from property
used for residences. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at
least 4 feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound. A landscape, screening
and buffering plan shall be submitted for review and approval with the
application for tower approval.
         B.   In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be
minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived.
         C.   Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as
towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property
perimeter may be a sufficient buffer.
      (8)   Buildings or other equipment storage. Buildings to house equipment
used in association with antennas or towers shall not exceed 360 square feet in
floor area and 9 feet in height for each tower. Provided, however, upon good
cause shown, an additional or a larger structure may be allowed to serve the
particular tower or number of users. Equipment cabinets utilized for antennas
mounted on structures, rooftops, utility poles, light poles or similar
facilities shall be no larger than necessary to serve each user of said
antenna.
      (9)   Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. The tower owner shall
advise the Village of discontinuance of tower use or abandonment. Any antenna
or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be
considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove the
same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the Village notifying the owner
of such abandonment. Failure to remove an abandoned antenna or tower within
said 90 days shall be grounds to remove the tower or antenna at the owner's
expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision
shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower. The Village
may, as a condition of approval, require a financial guarantee in the form of a
performance bond, cash deposit, or irrevocable letter of credit to provide
sufficient funds for removal of abandoned towers and buildings associated
therewith.
      (10)   Nonconforming uses; no expansion of nonconforming use. Towers that
are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the
provisions of this section shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a
nonconforming use or structure.
      (11)   Final determinations: written decision. For uses approved
administratively, the Zoning Administrator shall issue a final decision in
writing when a determination is made to approve, approve with conditions or
reject a request to place, construct or modify personal wireless facilities,
including wireless communication towers. For uses approved through the site
plan review process, action by the Planning Commission shall be recorded in the
meeting minutes.

exemption for such housing is a valid public purpose; further, that the
continuance of the provisions of this chapter for tax exemption and the service
charge in lieu of taxes during the periods contemplated in this chapter are
essential to the determination of economic feasibility of housing developments
which are constructed and financed in reliance on such chapter and service
charge.

1010.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to enable the streets of the Village of
Dimondale to provide safe, convenient, and comfortable routes for walking,
bicycling, and public transportation that encourage increased use of these
modes of transportation, enable convenient travel as part of daily activities,
improve the public welfare by addressing a wide array of health and
environmental problems, and meet the needs of all users of the streets,
including children, older adults, and people with disabilities.
(Ord. 2017-2. Passed - -17.)
1010.02 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   Complete Streets. A comprehensive, integrated transportation network
with infrastructure and design that allows safe and convenient travel along and
across streets for all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motor vehicle
drivers, public transportation riders and drivers, and people of all ages and
abilities, including children, youth, families, older adults, and individuals
with disabilities.
   (b)   Complete Streets Infrastructure. Roadways and/or public rights-of-way
planned, designed, and constructed to provide appropriate access to all legal
users in a manner that promotes safe and efficient movement of people and goods
whether by car, truck, transit, assistive device, foot, or bicycle.
   (c)   Street Project. The construction, reconstruction, retrofit, or
alteration, and includes the planning, design, approval, and implementation
processes, except that “Street Project” does not include maintenance such as
cleaning, sweeping, mowing, spot repair, or interim measures on detour routes.
   (d)   Users. Legal users of the roadways and public right-of-way, including
pedestrians, bicyclists, motor vehicle drivers, public transportation riders
and drivers, and people of all ages and abilities including children, youth,
families, older adults, and individuals with disabilities.
(Ord. 2017-2. Passed - -17.)
1010.03 REQUIREMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE ENSURING SAFE TRAVEL.
   (a)   The Village shall endeavor to make complete streets practices a
routine part of operations, strive to make every street project accessible for
all users, and coordinate efforts with other agencies and jurisdictions to
achieve complete streets.
   (b)   To the extent possible, the Village resolves to consider complete
streets practices for every street project in order to provide reasonably safe
travel along and across the road right-of-way for each category of users;
provided, however, that such infrastructure may be excluded, upon agreement of
the Village and the applicable public road agency, subject to each agency’s
powers and duties, where documentation and data indicate that:
      (1)   Use by non-motorized users is prohibited by law;
      (2)   The cost would be excessively disproportionate to the need or
probable future use over the long term;
      (3)   There is an absence of current or future need;
      (4)   Inclusion of such infrastructure would be unreasonable or
inappropriate in light of the scope of the project; or
      (5)   Implementation of complete streets infrastructure is not possible
due to physical restraints imposed by the project area.
   (c)   As feasible, the Village will consider incorporating complete streets
infrastructure into existing streets to improve the safety and convenience of
users, construct and enhance the transportation network for each category of
users, and create a walkable community.
   (d)   As feasible, if the safety and convenience of users can be improved
within the scope of a street project that includes pavement resurfacing,
restriping, or signalization operations, the Village will review the
possibility of incorporating complete streets improvements.
   (e)   The Village will review all appropriate plans, zoning and subdivision
codes, laws, procedures, and rules, including the Comprehensive Plan of the
Village to attempt to address the needs of all users in all street projects on
public and private streets. This shall be done through the normal course of
revisions and updates to these documents.
   (f)   All street projects requiring funding or approval by the Village
shall:
      (1)   Evaluate the effect of the proposed project on safe travel by all
users.
      (2)   Identify measures to mitigate any adverse impacts on such travel
that are identified.
      (3)   Achieve implementation of complete street infrastructure to the
extent feasible.

estimated cost of such improvement and shall thereupon refer it to the
Treasurer who shall without delay proceed to make a special assessment roll.
The Treasurer shall list on such roll all of the lands and tenements situated
in said special assessment district liable to taxation, under the proper
description and with the names of the owners or occupants, including the number
of front feet of each property abutting on said improvement. The Treasurer
shall assess to the owners or occupants of each and against each parcel of land
so liable to taxation a percentage, as determined by Council, of such sums of
money as shall be equal to the pro rata share per front foot of all property
abutting thereon. All costs exceeding said percentage of said improvements on
all such lots or premises in said special assessment district shall be paid
from the General Fund of the Village.
1022.06 REVIEW OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ROLL.

places within the Village for a like period.
   (c)   At the time so fixed for the review of said special assessment roll or
at any duly adjourned time, Council shall meet in the Council Chambers as a
board of review to hear any objections thereto by any interested person who may
appear in person, by agent or attorney. Council shall correct the same, if
necessary, and confirm it as reported or corrected, or it may refer the
assessment back to the Village Treasurer for revision, or annul it and direct a
new assessment. If the special assessment roll is confirmed, the Clerk shall
endorse a certificate upon the roll showing the date of confirmation.
   (d)   If the special assessment roll is confirmed, Council, at its next
meeting, shall so declare by resolution by a vote of a majority of all elected
members.
1022.07 CERTIFICATION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ROLL; PAYMENT.
   After the confirmation of any such special assessment roll, it shall be the
duty of the Clerk to certify the said assessment roll, together with the
resolution of confirmation, to the Treasurer, commanding him or her to collect
from every person assessed in said special assessment roll the sum of money
assessed to and set opposite his or her name therein. The said taxes or
assessment shall become payable and due in equal annual installments, the
number of which shall be determined by Council. The first installment shall
become payable in the month of September next after any such assessment roll
shall have been confirmed, along with the Village taxes and annually thereafter
until fully paid. Interest on all of the said taxes and assessments shall be
charged at a rate established by the Treasurer and the Council, payable
annually, the same to start thirty-one days from and after the date of the
confirmation of any such assessment roll by Council. Any such person against
whom any such tax or assessment shall have been assessed shall be at liberty to
pay the same or any installment thereof in one payment at any time after such
assessment roll shall have been certified to the Treasurer, with interest only
from the date that interest becomes chargeable as herein prescribed, provided
that at any time after a special assessment has become payable, the same may be
collected by suit in the name of the Village against the person assessed in an
action in any court having jurisdiction of the amount. In every such action, a
declaration upon the common counts for money paid shall be sufficient. The
special assessment roll and a certified order or resolution confirming the same
shall be prima facie evidence of the regularity of all the proceedings in
making the assessment and the right of the Village to recover judgment
therefor.
1022.08 REPORTING AND COLLECTION OF UNPAID ASSESSMENTS.
   Each and every year in which any public improvement tax or assessment shall
remain unpaid, and be due and payable, the Village Clerk shall report to the
Village Treasurer all unpaid and payable taxes and assessments who in turn will
therefore spread upon the general Village tax roll of that year all such taxes
and assessments previously approved by the Village Council.

1040.07 GENERAL DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
   No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or indirectly,
any pollutant or wastewater which will interfere with the operation or
performance of the POTW or cause a pass-through to the receiving stream. These
general prohibitions apply to all such users of a POTW, whether or not the user
is subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or any other
national, State or local pretreatment standards or requirements. A user may not
contribute any of the following substances to the POTW:
   (a)   Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological
activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case
wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the POTW which exceeds
forty degrees Centigrade (104 degrees Fahrenheit), or lower than minus one
degree Centigrade (thirty degrees Fahrenheit), unless the POTW treatment plant
is designed to accommodate such temperature.
   (b)   Any wastewater or waste which may contain more than 100 mg/l of fat,
oil or grease.
   (c)   Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or
quantity are, or may be, sufficient, either alone or by interaction with other
substances, to cause a fire or explosion hazard in the POTW, including, but not
limited to, waste streams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees
Fahrenheit (sixty degrees Centigrade) using the test methods specified in 40
CFR 261.21, or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or the operation of
the POTW. At no time shall two successive readings on any explosion hazard
meter at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the system)
be more than five percent nor shall any single reading be over ten percent of
the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials include, but
are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene,
ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates,
promates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides and any other substance which the
Village, the State or the EPA has notified the user is a fire hazard or a
hazard to the system.
   (d)   Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow in
a sewer or other interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment
facilities, such as, but not limited to, grease, garbage with particles greater
than one-half inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues, paunch manure,
bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes,
cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings,
grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, wastepaper, wood, plastics,
gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining or processing of fuel or
lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding or polishing wastes, petroleum oil,
non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in amounts
that will cause interference or pass-through.
   (e)   Any wastewater having a pH lower than 6.0 or higher than 9.0, or
having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to
structures, equipment and/or personnel of the POTW, unless the POTW is
specifically designed to accommodate such wastewater.
   (f)   Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity,
either singularly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or
interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans
or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW or to
exceed the limitations set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. The
toxic pollutants shall include, but not be limited to, any pollutant identified
pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act.
   (g)   Any wastewater containing pollutants which, either singularly or by
interaction with other wastes, result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors or
fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and
safety problems.
   (h)   Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the treatment
process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning
solutions.
   (i)   Any wastewater containing any radioactive waste or isotopes of such
half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by State or Federal
regulations.
   (j)   Any wastewater batch discharge containing industrial processing wastes
in excess of standards established by State or Federal regulations or
containing such substances as may impair the sewage treatment process or cause
a deviation from the NPDES permit requirements, pretreatment standards and all
State and Federal regulations.
   (k)   Any wastewater containing suspended solids of such character or
quantity that unusual attention or expense is required to handle such materials
at the POTW.
   (l)   Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a public
nuisance.
   (m)   Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES and/or
State disposal system permit or the receiving water quality standards.
   (n)   Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.)
released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which a user knows or
has reason to know will cause interference to the POTW. In no case shall a slug
load lasting longer than fifteen minutes have a flow rate, concentration or
qualities of pollutants that exceed more than five times the average twenty-
four hour concentration, quantities or flow during normal operation.
   (o)   Any substance which may cause the POTW effluent or other product of
the POTW, such as residues, sludges or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation
and re-use, or which interferes with the reclamation process.
   (p)   Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points
designated by the Superintendent.
   When the Superintendent determines that a user is contributing to the POTW
any of the above enumerated substances in such amounts as to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, the Superintendent shall advise the user of the impact
of the contribution on the POTW; develop effluent limitations for such user to
correct the interference with the POTW; and enforce such effluent limitations
in the manner provided in Section
1040.12. (Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.08 GREASE, OIL AND SAND INTERCEPTORS.
   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of
the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid waste
containing grease, oil and sand in excessive amounts, except that such
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters of dwelling
units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Village
and shall be located so as to be readily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. Grease and oil interceptors shall be of substantial construction,
of impervious materials, capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes of
temperature, and equipped with easily removable covers which, when bolted in
place, shall be gastight and watertight. When installed, all grease, oil and
sand interceptors shall be maintained by the owner, at the owner's expense, and
shall remain in continuously efficient operation at all times.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.09 ADDITIONAL DISCHARGE LIMITATIONS; APPROVAL REQUIRED.
   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the public sewers

(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.11 STATE AND LOCAL REQUIREMENTS.
   State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case
where they are more stringent than Federal requirements and limitations or
those in this chapter. Local requirements and limitations shall apply in any
case where they are more stringent than State or Federal requirements.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.12 PRETREATMENT REQUIRED.
   If any wastewaters or waters as heretofore described in Sections
1040.07 to
1040.11 are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the POTW, which
contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in such
sections, or which, in the judgment of the Superintendent, may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewage works, equipment or receiving waters, or
which otherwise create hazards of life or constitute a public nuisance, the
Village may, where necessary in the opinion of the Superintendent:
   (a)   Reject the waste;
   (b)   Require the owner to control the quantities and rates of discharge of
such waters or waste to meet all applicable State and Federal regulations,
including the NPDES permit;
   (c)   Require the owner to provide, at the owner's sole expense, such
preliminary treatment as may be necessary to:
      (1)   Reduce the BOD to 300 parts per million, the suspended solids to
350 mg/l, the chlorine demands to fifty mg/l and the phosphorous to five mg/l;
and/or
      (2)   Reduce objectionable characteristics or constituents to within the
maximum limits provided in Sections
1040.07 to
1040.11; and/or
      (3)   Require the owner to pay the added costs of handling and treating

(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.13 NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   Upon the promulgation of the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards for
a particular industrial subcategory, if the Federal standard is more stringent
than limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory,
Federal standards shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under
this chapter. The Superintendent shall notify all affected users of the
applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.14 MODIFICATION OF NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   Where the POTW wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of
pollutants limited by Federal pretreatment standards, the Board may, at the
request of a user, apply to the approval authority for a modification of
specific limits in the Federal pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal"
shall mean the reduction in the amount of a pollutant or the alteration of the
nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or
harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in ninety-five
percent of the samples taken and measured according to the procedures set forth
in 40 CFR 403.7(c)(2). The Board may then modify pollutant discharge limits and
the Federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR
403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained.
Any user requesting application for modification shall reimburse the POTW for
all costs of testing and data compilation required by 40 CFR 403.7.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.15 CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF PRETREATMENT FACILITIES.
   (a)   Where pretreatment facilities are required by the POTW, plans,
specifications and any other pertinent information relating to proposed
preliminary treatment, including a semi-annual report of progress regarding
compliance with pretreatment standards, shall be submitted for approval by the
Superintendent and no construction of such facility shall be commenced until
such approvals are obtained in writing.
   (b)   Where pretreatment facilities are provided for any waters or waste,
they shall be maintained in satisfactory and effective operation at all times
by the owner, at the owner's sole expense.
   (c)   The owner shall regularly submit a waste treatment report to the POTW
as often as required by the permit. Such report shall include all measurements,
tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and waste as referred to in
this section and any other pertinent information as may be required. The owner
shall be required to install a flow meter for continued monitoring.
   (d)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater
and the Federal guidelines establishing the procedures for the analysis of
pollutants, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided for in
Section
1040.25 or upon suitable samples taken at such control manhole. In the event
that no special manhole is available, sampling shall be at the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer
is connected.
   (e)   Every industrial or commercial entity operating a pretreatment or
control facility which discharges liquid wastes into the public sewer
(sanitary, combined or storm) shall have the waste treatment or control
facilities under the specific supervision and control of a person who has been
certified by the State of Michigan, Department of Environmental Quality, as
being properly qualified to operate the facilities under the requirements as
set forth in Act 245 of the Public Acts of 1929, as amended, being Section
323.2 of the Compiled Laws of 1948, and under the Water Resources Commission
Rules entitled Part 10 Treatment Plant Operators.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.16 ALTERNATIVE CALCULATION OF LIMITS.
   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in
terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Superintendent may
convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
   (a)   When calculating equivalent mass-per-day limitations under this
section, the Superintendent shall calculate such limitations by multiplying the
limits in the standard by the industrial user's average rate of production.
This average rate of production shall be based not upon the designed production
capacity, but, rather, upon a reasonable measure of the industrial user's
actual long-term daily production, such as the average daily production during
a representative year. For new sources, actual production shall be estimated
using projected production.
   (b)   When calculating equivalent concentration limitations under this
section, the Superintendent shall calculate such limitations by dividing the
mass by the average daily flow rate of the industrial user's regulated process
wastewater. This average daily flow rate shall be based upon a reasonable
measure of the industrial user's actual long-term average flow rate, such as
the average daily flow rate during the representative year.
   (c)   Equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with this section
shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of Section 307(d) of
the Act and this chapter. Industrial users will be required to comply with the
equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from
which the equivalent limitations were derived.
   (d)   If categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average limitations, where
applied, the same production of flow figure shall be used in calculating both
types of equivalent limitations.
   (e)   Any industrial user operating under a control mechanism incorporating
equivalent mass of concentration limits calculated from a production-based
standard shall notify the Superintendent within two business days after the
user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the
Superintendent of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or
concentration limits in its control mechanism that were used on the original
estimate of the long-term average production rate.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.17 COMPLIANCE DEADLINE; EXISTING SOURCES; NEW SOURCES.
   Compliance by existing sources with categorical pretreatment standards shall
be within three years of the date the standard is effective, unless a shorter
compliance time is specified in the appropriate sub-part of 40 CFR, Chapter
(I), Subchapter (N). Existing sources which become industrial users subsequent
to the promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall be
considered existing industrial users, except where such sources meet the
definition of new source as defined in Section
1040.02(37). New sources shall install and have in operating condition, and
shall "start up," all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable
pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest
feasible time (not to exceed ninety days), new sources must meet all applicable
pretreatment standards.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.18 DILUTION PROHIBITED.
   Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment
standard or requirement, no industrial user shall ever increase the use of
process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial
or complete substitute for adequate treatment, to achieve compliance with a
pretreatment standard or requirement. The Superintendent may impose mass
limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition
of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.19 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES; OPERATING UPSETS; SLUG LOADS; NOTICES TO POTW.
   Each categorical and non-categorical user shall provide necessary protection
from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated
by this chapter. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost
and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide this protection shall be submitted to the POTW for review when
required, and shall be approved by the Board before construction of the
facility. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective
date of this chapter shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system
until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the POTW. Review
and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the
industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as
necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.
   In the case of an accidental discharge or operations upset which places the
user in a temporary state of noncompliance with this chapter or which could
cause problems to the POTW, including any slug loadings as defined by Section
1040.07(n), it is the responsibility of the user to immediately (within twenty-
four hours) telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification
shall include the location of the discharge, the type of waste, the
concentration and volume and corrective actions.
   Within five days following oral notification of an accidental discharge or
operations upset, the user shall submit to the Superintendent a detailed
written report containing the following:
   (a)   A description of the upset, the cause thereof and its impact on the
discharger's compliance status;
   (b)   The duration of the noncompliance, including exact dates and times. If
such noncompliance is to continue, a statement addressing when compliance can
reasonably be expected to occur; and
   (c)   All steps taken, or to be taken, to reduce, eliminate and prevent a
recurrence of such an upset or other condition of noncompliance.
   Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or
other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to persons or
property, nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil
penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other
applicable law.
   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other
prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous
discharge. Employers shall insure that all employees who may cause or suffer
such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of emergency notification
procedures.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.20 DISPOSAL AT POTW TREATMENT PLANT; WASTE HAULERS.
   (a)   Haulers of waste from individual sewage systems may be subject to
volume limits as determined necessary by the Superintendent based on available
capacity at the POTW.
   (b)   All waste from individual sewage systems must be processed through a
communuter before acceptance by the POTW if determined necessary by the
Superintendent.
   (c)   The Superintendent may at any time discontinue service to waste
haulers based on noncompliance with the conditions as stated herein or changes
in treatment standards as required by the Department of Environmental Quality.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDING SEWERS
1040.21 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   No person, firm, or corporation shall lay, alter, repair or do any
kind of work connected with any building sewer, connection or sewer work or
make any connections whatever with any sewer, house or building which is to be
connected to the sanitary sewer system, unless the requirements as stated in
subsection (b) hereof are met in full.
   (b)   Any person desiring to do business as a sewer builder in connection
with the sanitary sewer system shall file a bond with sufficient surety or
sureties to be approved by the Village or the POTW in the sum of ten thousand
dollars ($10,000), conditioned that he or she will indemnify and save harmless
the POTW from all accidents and damages caused by any negligence in protecting
his or her work or employees, and that he or she will also promptly and in a
proper time replace and restore any sidewalk, pavement or other street surface
over any opening he or she may have made to as good a state as existed previous
to opening the same, and to keep and maintain said surface in good order to the
satisfaction of the Village or the Township for the period of one year next
thereafter, and that he or she will pay all fines imposed upon him or her for a
violation of any of the rules and regulations prescribed by this chapter. In
addition, he or she will indemnify and save harmless the POTW from any
imperfect, careless or improper work done by him, her or them as such sewer
builder for a period of one year from the completion of such work.
   Any person, firm or corporation doing business as a sewer builder shall file
a certificate of carriage of workers' compensation insurance, and public
liability and property damage insurance in a minimum amount of five hundred
thousand dollars ($500,000)/three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) with a
company authorized to do business in the State of Michigan.
   (c)   An application for a permit to connect to the sewer system must be
made in writing by the owner of the property to be sewered or his or her
authorized agent. Such application shall give the exact location of the
property, the lot number, the name of the owner and the name of the sewer
builder employed to do the work, and shall be made on forms furnished for this
purpose by the Village Clerk or the Township Supervisor, provided, however,
that the permit shall be granted with the express condition that the owner, for
whose benefit the connection is made, shall, on behalf of himself or herself,
or his or her heirs or assigns, hold the Board, its constituent municipalities
and the POTW harmless from any loss or damage that may in any way result or be
caused by the making of any such connection.
   (d)   Within five days after completion of the work, the sewer builder shall
file with the Superintendent a record showing the number of feet of pipe laid,
its location with respect to the property and building or buildings connected,
together with such other information as may be required by the Superintendent
or his or her authorized representative to make a complete record of the work.
   (e)   Y-branches and stubs have been placed at frequent intervals along the
main or lateral sewer. A record of such Y's or stubs is kept in the office of
the Superintendent (the "as built" plans) and will be furnished to the sewer
builder for his or her information, but the POTW does not guarantee the
accuracy or actual existence of the location. All connections with the sewers
of the sanitary sewer system must be made at such Y-branches or stubs except as
approved by the Superintendent. The breaking of any pipe or any main or lateral
sewer to connect a house connection shall be deemed a misdemeanor and shall
subject the sewer builder to a fine as hereinafter provided, and, in addition
thereto, he or she shall pay all expenses of taking up such sewer and
rebuilding it to the satisfaction of the Board or its authorized
representative. Upon his or her failure to do so, the charges shall be
collected from his or her sureties.
   In the event that the Y-branch or stub cannot be found with a reasonable
effort, the Superintendent may permit the connection to be made by tapping the
main or lateral sewer with a hole of sufficient size to receive the pipe used
in the house connection and connecting the building sewer to the POTW sewer
with a sewer saddle or Y-connection which has been approved by the Village.
   (f)   The Superintendent must be given notice when any work is ready for
inspection and all work must be left uncovered and convenient for examination
until inspected and approved. Such inspection shall be made within twenty-four
hours after such notification. If the inspector determines that any work does
not conform with this chapter, the sewer builder shall remove and replace any
such rejected work and shall make all work meet the requirements of this
chapter to the full satisfaction of the inspector.
   (g)   No downspouts from roofs, water from air conditioning units,
refrigeration units and cooling units, sump pumps or building footing drains
shall be connected to the sanitary sewer system.
   (h)   No surface water from a paved area, yard, court or courtyard shall be
connected to the sanitary sewer system.
   (i)   No open gutter, street drain, catch basin or other surface water
source shall be connected with any sewer or house drain. Any licensed sewer
builder making any such connection shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and
shall be subject to the penalty hereinafter provided.
   (j)   Persons, firms or corporations making any kind of improvement to the
public streets and alleys, upon which sewers and house connections have been
laid, shall so plan and execute their work that damage will not occur to any
public sewer or house connection connected therewith.
   (k)   If a water, gas or other conduit or obstruction shall come in the way
of a drain or sewer, the question of passing over or under the same shall be
determined by the Superintendent upon consultation with the Engineer. In no
case shall a sewer builder be allowed to decide the question. All expenses
connected with passing both over and under such pipes, conduits or obstructions
shall be borne by the owner of the property for whose benefit the connection is
being made.
   (l)   Openings on any street or alley for sewer connections shall be made by
a sewer builder and asphalt repairs shall be made by, or under the direction
of, entities having jurisdiction over the roadway involved. All costs shall be
borne by said licensed sewer builder.
   (m)   All openings and obstructions in any street, land or alley must be
guarded at all times with sufficient State-approved barriers and such other
precautions as shall be necessary to guard the public against accidents, and at
all times the work shall be so done as to cause the least inconvenience to
property owners and the general public.
   (n)   No house drain, surface drain or main sewer shall be laid in the same
trench with water pipes, and in no case closer together than ten feet without
special permission from the Superintendent.
   (o)   Before any old private sewer or any house sewer built before the
effective date of this chapter shall be connected with the sewer system, the
owner of the private sewer or house sewer shall prove to the full satisfaction
of the Superintendent that it is entirely clean and that it conforms, in every
respect, with the rules and regulations prescribed by this chapter. Cellar or
basement sewers may be connected with any sewer or house connection only when
they are trapped in such a manner that the water seal cannot be broken,
provided, however, that all such connections shall be above the elevation
established for the 100-year flood plain for said property.
   (p)   A house connection from a point three feet outside of the house to the
sewer shall be at least six inches in diameter and constructed of materials
approved by the Superintendent or authorized by the State Construction Code. If
laid at less than three feet of depth, said connection shall be constructed of
cast-iron pipe. All pipe shall be of the best quality, conforming with the
latest specifications for this product approved by the American Society for
Testing Materials. All joints shall be permanently watertight.
   (q)   The cover of the Y-branch or stub on the sewer shall be carefully
removed to avoid damage to the socket or bell. The first length of pipe
attached to the Y-branch or stub shall be laid so as to give a good fall into
the sewer. The entire length of pipe on any house connection shall be laid in a
straight line and on a uniform grade from a point three feet outside the wall
of the building to be served, to the Y-branch or stub. Such grade shall be a
fall of not less than one foot in 100 feet from the house to the sewer, unless
by special permission of the Superintendent, in which case provision must be
made for regular and efficient flushing. Curved pipe shall be used for every
deflection from a straight line of more than three inches in two feet. Unless
otherwise specified in writing by the Superintendent, the manner of laying the
pipe and making the joints shall be as follows:
      (1)   The sanitary sewer service from the street to the building shall be
composed of such approved materials as shall be specified by the Superintendent
in specifications published from time to time and filed with the Village and
Township Clerks, entitled Standards for Sanitary Sewer Construction.
      (2)   The sanitary service installed for a new building, or when
replacing an old or damaged sanitary service, shall be made to a wye or tee. If
there is no existing wye or tee, a new wye or tee may be installed or it shall
be connected to a saddle, properly connected, in the presence of the inspector.
      (3)   Separate sanitary sewer and water services shall be required for
each dwelling unit in duplex housing.
   (r)   All backfilling over part of any house drain, within the boundaries of
any street, alley or public grounds, must be tamped in layers not exceeding six
inches in thickness. The replacing of any gravel and/or sand shall be done
within forty-eight hours after laying the house drain or sewer and must be done
so as to make the surface at least as good as it was before it was disturbed,
and to the full satisfaction of the municipality where it is located, and the
sewer builder will be held responsible for any subsequent settling in the
ground and/or pavement. All water pipes must be protected to the satisfaction
of the sewer inspector and all gas pipes shall be protected to the satisfaction
of the company owning the same, and any subsequent damage to either water or
gas pipes, by reason of the construction of the house drain, or subsequent
settling of the earth, shall be paid for by the sewer builder.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
   (s)   House drains and sewers laid within the Village and Township in and
for houses on streets where no public sewers are yet laid, shall be done
according to the regulations of this chapter in every particular. The owner
and/or agent of such property, within three months after a public sewer is
built past the property and is available, must secure a permit to connect the
same with a public sewer.
(Ord. 97-6. Passed 12-8-97.)
   (t)   All costs, expenses and liabilities incident to the installation and
connection of the building sewer shall be borne by the property owner. The
property owner shall indemnify and save harmless the Village from any loss or
damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the
building sewer.
      (1)   It shall be the duty of each property owner to maintain, clean and
repair the private sewer lines on his or her property at his or her own expense
as necessary to keep such lines free and clear of obstructions and in good
working order and to maintain and keep clear of obstructions the lateral lines
servicing his or her property.
      (2)   It shall be the duty of the Village to maintain, clean and repair
as necessary and at its expense the sewer trunk lines and to repair or replace
any broken or crushed lateral lines. The Village shall not be responsible for
cleaning or maintenance of lateral lines.
      (3)   In the case of a bona fide dispute as to whether needed
maintenance, cleaning or repair of a portion of sewer line is the
responsibility of the property owner or the Village under the provisions of
this section, it shall be the duty of the property owner to establish that the
obstruction, disrepair or defect has occurred in that portion of the line for
which the Village is responsible.
      If the property owner fails to establish the Village's responsibility, it
shall be the property owner's responsibility to perform the necessary
maintenance as provided in this section.
      If the Village's responsibility is established, the Village shall perform
the necessary maintenance and shall reimburse the property owner for reasonable
expenses incurred in locating the defect in the line or in otherwise
establishing the Village's responsibility.
      The property owner would be responsible under this section for the total
maintenance and repair of the private sewer lines on his or her property and
for the maintenance and cleaning, although not including major repair, of the
entire sewer line out to the trunk line. The Village, on the other hand, is
responsible for major repair of the trunk line and lateral lines only and has
no responsibility of any sort for the private lines. The Village has no
responsibility to clean lateral lines.
      (4)   Any property owner who shall violate the provisions of this chapter
shall be liable to the Village for civil damages incurred in correcting the
defect, in addition to the penalty provided in Section
1040.99.
      If any property owner fails to maintain a private sewer line as required
by this section, in addition to the other penalties prescribed, the sewer may
be declared a public nuisance by the Barry-Eaton District Health Officer and
the defect may be corrected by the Village. Any costs so incurred shall be
assessed against the property and become a lien on the property if not timely
paid.
   (u)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building, except that where one building stands at the rear of another building
or on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed
to the rear building through an adjoining alley, yard or driveway, the building
sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building.
   (v)   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid
parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be
weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. The
building sewer shall be laid at a uniform grade. The line shall be straight or
laid with properly curved pipe and fittings. Changes in direction greater than
forty-five degrees shall be provided with cleanouts accessible for cleaning.
   (w)   In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall
be lifted by artificial means approved by the Superintendent and discharged to
the building sewer. In no case shall fasting or eavestrough drains be allowed
to drain into the sanitary sewer.
   (x)   No sewer connection will be permitted unless there is capacity
available in all downstream sewers, lift stations, force mains and the sewage
treatment plant, including capacity for treatment of BOD and suspended solids.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)

following conditions shall apply to this schedule:
         A.   The schedule shall contain reasonably prompt increments of
progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major
events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment
required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (e.g.,
hiring an engineer or other appropriate personnel, completing preliminary
plans, completing final plans, executing contracts for major components,
commencing construction, completing construction and all other acts necessary
to achieve compliance with this chapter).
         B.   No later than fourteen days following each date in the schedule
and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to
the Superintendent including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increments of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it
expects to comply with the increments of progress, the reason for the delay and
the steps being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule

   All permits/applications shall be signed by the principal executive officer
of the user. The Superintendent will evaluate the data furnished by the user
and may require additional information. After evaluation and acceptance of the
data furnished, a wastewater discharge permit subject to the terms and
conditions provided herein may be issued.
   (b)   Permit Modifications. Within nine months of the promulgation of a
National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the wastewater discharge permit of
users subject to such standards shall be revised to require compliance with
such standard within the time frame prescribed by such standard. Where a user
subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard has not previously
submitted an application for a wastewater discharge permit as required by
subsection (a) hereof, the user shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit
within 180 days after the promulgation of the applicable National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard. In addition, the user with an existing wastewater
discharge permit shall submit to the Superintendent within 180 days after the
promulgation of an applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard the
information required by paragraphs (a)(8) and (9) hereof.
   (c)   Permit Conditions. Wastewater discharge permits shall be expressly
subject to all provisions of this Code and all other applicable regulations,
user charges and fees and compliance schedules established by the Village.

1040.28; and
      (11)   Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the Village to ensure
compliance with this chapter.
   (d)   Net/Gross Calculation of Limits. The Superintendent may adjust the
categorical pretreatment standards to reflect the presence of pollutants in the
industrial user's intake water in accordance with this subsection.
      (1)   Application. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for
intake pollutants must make application to the Superintendent. Upon request of
the industrial user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a "net"
basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if
the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) hereof are met.
      (2)   Criteria. The industrial user must demonstrate that the control
system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment
standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the
absence of pollutants in the intake waters.
      (3)   Credit. Credit for generic pollutants, such as BOD, total suspended
solids (TSS) and oil and grease, should not be granted unless the industrial
user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the user's
effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure
in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on
process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere.
   (e)   Duration of Permit. Permits shall be issued for a specified time
period, not to exceed five years. A permit may be issued for a period less than
a year or may be stated to expire on a specific date. The user shall apply for
permit reissuance a minimum of 180 days prior to the expiration of the user's
existing permit. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to
modification by the POTW during the term of the permit as limitations or
requirements, as identified in paragraph (c)(2) hereof, are modified or other
just cause exists. The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in his or
her permit at least thirty days prior to the effective date of such change. Any
changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time
schedule for compliance.
   (f)   Permit Transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific
user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be
reassigned, transferred or sold to a new owner, new source, different premises
or a new or changed operation without the approval of the POTW. Any succeeding
owner or user shall also comply with the terms and conditions of all existing
permits.
   (g)   Permit Fees and Charges. Each user required to obtain a wastewater
discharge permit shall reimburse the POTW, upon demand, the reasonable and
necessary cost of monitoring, inspection, surveillance and review of accidental
discharges. Such expenses shall be charged to the user at 1.4 times the lowest
hourly rate of the person qualified to perform the service and shall include
necessary equipment expense and actual cost of outside testing and consulting
services.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.24 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   Within ninety days following the date for final compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement
of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any categorical user subject
to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the Superintendent a
report showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons
per day, from regulated process streams and such other streams as necessary to
allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) and
identifying the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. In
addition, the report shall include the results of sampling and analysis
identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required) of regulated
pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and
average concentration (or mass) shall be reported. The sample shall be
representative of daily operations and shall be taken in the frequency and
manner provided by 40 CFR 403(12)(b)(5). The report shall state whether the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent
basis and, if not, what additional O & M and/or pretreatment is necessary to
bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements.
   (a)   Periodic Compliance Reports.
      (1)   Any user subject to a pretreatment standard after the compliance
date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new user, after
commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the Superintendent
during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently by the
POTW, a report indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or
regulated substances in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment
standard. In addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. Flows shall
be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided, however, where cost
or feasibility considerations justify, the Village may accept reports of
average and maximum flows estimated by variable techniques. At the discretion
of the Superintendent, in consideration of such factors as local high or low
flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Superintendent, for good cause
shown, may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be
submitted.
      (2)   If the Superintendent has imposed mass limitations on users, the
report required by paragraph (a)(1) hereof shall indicate the mass of
pollutants regulated by a pretreatment standard in the effluent of the user.
For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits, the
report required by paragraph (a)(1) hereof shall contain a reasonable measure
of the user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject
to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable
pollutant discharge period of production (or other measure of operation), the
report shall include the user's actual average production rate for the
reporting period.
      Reports of users shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of
the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or the
production and mass where requested by the Superintendent, of pollutants
contained therein, which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standard.
The report shall be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and
analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which data is
representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The
frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed by the Superintendent to assess and
assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements. An analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established by the Superintendent pursuant to Section 304(h) of the Act and
contained in 40 CFR, Part 136, and amendments thereto, or with any other test
procedures approved by the Superintendent. Sampling shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques approved by the Superintendent.
      (Where 40 CFR, Part 136, does not include a sampling or analytical
technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA screening, or
amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedure
approved by the Superintendent.)
      (3)   If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation,
the user shall notify the Superintendent within twenty-four hours of becoming
aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis
and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Superintendent within
thirty days after becoming aware of the violation.
   (b)   Reporting Requirements. Industrial users with discharges which are not
subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall submit, at least once every
six months (on dates specified by the Superintendent), such reports as the
Superintendent deems necessary to verify compliance with all of the general
discharge limitations and prohibitions of this chapter as required by 40 CFR
403.12(h).
   (c)   Base Line Monitoring Report. At least ninety days prior to the
commencement of discharge, new sources, and sources that become industrial
users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard,
shall be required to submit to the Superintendent a report which contains
estimates of the measured average daily and maximum daily flow of process
streams and waste streams and the flow and amount of regulated pollutants in
the form and containing the information required by 40 CFR 403.12(b)(1) through
(5), and shall include in this report information on the method of pretreatment
standards.
   (d)   Signatory Requirements. All reports required by this section shall
contain the certification statement as set forth in 40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii) and
shall be signed as follows:
      (1)   By a responsible corporate officer, if the industrial user
submitting the reports required by subsections (a), (b) and (c) hereof is a
corporation. For the purpose of this paragraph, a responsible corporate officer
means a president, secretary, treasurer or vice-president of the corporation in
charge of a principal business function, or any other person who performs
similar policy or decision-making functions for the corporation; or the manager
of one or more manufacturing, production or operation facilities employing more
than 250 persons or having gross annual sales or expenditures exceeding twenty-
five million dollars ($25,000,000) (in second quarter 1980 dollars), if
authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in
accordance with corporate procedures.
      (2)   By a general partner or proprietor if the industrial user
submitting the reports required by subsections (a), (b) and (c) hereof is a
partnership or sole proprietorship, respectively.
      (3)   By a member if the industrial user submitting the reports is a
limited liability company.
      (4)   By a duly authorized representative of the individual designated in
paragraph (d)(1) or (2) hereof if:
         A.   The authorization is made in writing by the individual described
in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) hereof;
         B.   The authorization specifies either an individual or a position
having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility from which the
industrial discharge originates, such as the position of plant manager,
operator of a well or well field superintendent, or a position of equivalent
responsibility for environmental matters for the company; and
         C.   The written authorization is submitted to the POTW.
      (5)   If an authorization under paragraph (d)(3) hereof is no longer
accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the
overall operation of the facility or overall responsibility for environmental
matters for the company, a new authorization satisfying the requirements of
paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) hereof must be submitted to the POTW prior to or
together with any reports to be signed by an authorized representative.
   (e)   Hazardous Waste Report.
      (1)   Any industrial user shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste
Management Division Director and the State hazardous waste authorities, in
writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise
disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification
must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the
EPA hazardous waste number and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or
other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste
per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the
following information, if known and readily available to the industrial user:
An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an
estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the
wastestream discharged during that calendar month and an estimation of the mass
of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the
following twelve months. All notifications must take place within 180 days of
the effective date of this chapter. Industrial users who commence discharging
after the effective date of this chapter shall provide the notification no
later than 180 days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic
hazardous waste. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only
once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed
discharges must be submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(j). The notification
requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under
the self-monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b), (d) and (e).
      (2)   Discharges are exempt from the requirements of this subsection
during a calendar month in which industrial users discharge no more than
fifteen kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous
wastes, as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than
fifteen kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any
quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33
(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the
industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do
not require additional notification.
      (3)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA,
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the
POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director and the State
hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety
days of the effective date of such regulations.
      (4)   In the case of any notification made under this subsection, the
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous waste generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.25 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   The POTW shall require to be provided and operated, at the user's own
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the
POTW may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to
allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the POTW's
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety days following
written notification by the POTW.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.26 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   The POTW shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the
purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being complied
with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the POTW or its representative ready access at all
reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling or records examination or in the performance of any of their other
duties. The POTW, the approval authority and the EPA shall have the right to
set up the inspection compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a
user has security measures in force which would require proper identification
and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the POTW, the approval authority and the EPA
will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.27 PRETREATMENT FACILITIES; PLAN APPROVAL REQUIRED; SIGNIFICANT
NONCOMPLIANCE; ANNUAL PUBLICATION OF NAMES.
   Users shall provide necessary wastewater pretreatment as required to comply
with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations specified by the Federal
pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a
level acceptable to the Village shall be provided, operated and maintained at
the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and
operating procedures shall be submitted to the POTW for review and shall be
acceptable to the POTW before construction of the facility. The review of such
plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent
acceptable to the POTW under the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent
changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported
to and be acceptable to the POTW prior to the user's initiation of such
changes.
   The Village, Township and POTW shall annually publish in the Eaton County
newspaper a list of the users which were in significant noncompliance with any
pretreatment requirements or standards at least once during the twelve previous
months in accordance with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(vii). For purposes of this
section, the term "significant noncompliance" shall have the meaning ascribed
to it by 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(vii).
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.28 BYPASS OF PRETREATMENT FACILITIES.
   (a)   Definitions.
      (1)   "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of an industrial user's treatment facility.
      (2)   "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (b)   Bypass Not Violating Applicable Pretreatment Standards or
Requirements. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) hereof.
   (c)   Notice.
      (1)   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the POTW, if possible, at least ten days before
the date of the bypass.
      (2)   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within
twenty-four hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the
time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission
shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or
planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The
Superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within twenty-four hours.
   (d)   Prohibition of Bypass.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW, the Board, the Village and/or
the Township may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a
bypass, unless:
         A.   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage;
         B.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
         C.   The industrial user submitted notices as required under
subsection (c) hereof.
      (2)   The Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass after
considering its adverse effects if the Superintendent determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (d)(1) hereof.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.29 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit
applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be
available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction,
unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the POTW that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade
secrets of the user.
   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report
which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written
request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the NPDES
permit, the State disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs;
provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by
the State or any State agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.
   Information accepted by the POTW as confidential shall not be transmitted to
any governmental agency or to the general public by the POTW until and unless a
ten-day notification is given to the user.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
ENFORCEMENT
1040.30 HARMFUL CONTRIBUTIONS; SUSPENSION OF WASTEWATER TREATMENT SERVICE AND/
OR WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT.
   The Board may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater
discharge permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual
or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the
environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the violation of any
condition of the NPDES permit.
   Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/
or the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the Board or its representative shall take such
steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to
any individuals. The wastewater contribution permit and/or the wastewater
treatment service shall be reinstated upon proof of the elimination of the
noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the Superintendent on the
date of occurrence.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.31 REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   Any user who violates the following conditions of this chapter, or
applicable State and Federal regulations, is subject to having its permit
revoked in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sections
1040.30 through
1040.35.
   (a)   Failure of the user to factually report the wastewater constituents
and characteristics of his or her discharge;
   (b)   Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater constituents and characteristics;
   (c)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of
inspection or monitoring; or
   (d)   Violation of conditions of the permit.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.32 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   Whenever any user has violated or is violating this chapter, a wastewater
contribution permit or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained
herein, the Board may serve upon such person a written notice stating the
nature of the violation. Within thirty days of the date of the notice, a plan
for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted by the user.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.33 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   The Board may order any user who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge
to enter the POTW to show cause before the Board why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the
time and place of a hearing to be held by the Board regarding the violation,
the reasons why the action is to be taken and the proposed enforcement action,
and directing the user to show cause before the Board why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of hearing shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at
least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer
of a corporation.
   (a)   The Board may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or may
designate any of its members or an officer or employee of the Village to:
      (1)   Issue, in the name of the Board, notices of hearings requesting the
attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant
to any matter involved in such hearings;
      (2)   Take the evidence;
      (3)   Transmit a report of the evidence and the hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the Village or
the Township for action thereon.
   (b)   At any hearing held pursuant to this chapter, testimony taken must be
under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded, will be
made available to any member of the public or to any party to the hearing upon
payment of the usual charges thereof.
   (c)   After the Board has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to
the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified
time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices or other related appurtenances shall have been installed or
existing treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are
properly operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and
appropriate may be issued. Any person aggrieved by a final order may appeal to
the Eaton County Circuit Court within twenty days of entry of the order.
   (d)   In the event that the user does not substantially prevail on the
substance of the matter in dispute before the Board, the user shall be assessed
an appeal fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00), plus attorney fees, expert
witness fees and stenographic fees for transcribing the proceedings.
   The hearing described in this section shall not be deemed a condition
precedent to legal action initiated by the Board for a violation of this
chapter or any regulation promulgated by the POTW or the Board or necessary to
achieve compliance with the NPDES permit applicable to said POTW.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.34 DECLARATION OF PUBLIC NUISANCE; ABATEMENT.
   If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes into the
wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this chapter, Federal
or State pretreatment requirements or any order of the Village, Township, Board
or POTW, such discharge is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and a
nuisance per se. An action may be commenced for appropriate legal, injunctive
and/or other equitable relief in the Circuit Court of the County, or an action
for civil or criminal penalties in the Eaton County District Court.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.35 ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS.
   (a)   In order that the provisions of this chapter may be reasonably applied
and substantial justice done in instances where unnecessary hardship would
result from carrying out the strict letter of this chapter, the Board shall
serve as a Wastewater Board of Appeals. The duty of such Board shall be to
consider appeals from a decision of the Superintendent and to determine, in
particular cases, whether any deviation from strict enforcement will violate
the intent of any order or jeopardize the public health or safety.
   (b)   An informal hearing before the Superintendent may be requested, in
writing, by any user or contractee deeming itself aggrieved by any citation,
order, charge, fee, surcharge, penalty or action, within ten days after the
date thereof, stating the reasons therefor, with supporting documents and data.
   The informal hearing shall be scheduled at the earliest practicable date,
but not later than five days after receipt of the request, unless extended by
mutual written agreement.
   The hearing shall be conducted on an informal basis at such place as
designated by the Superintendent.
   (c)   Appeals from orders of the Superintendent (including determinations
relating to assignment of residential equivalents pursuant to the Table of
Equivalent Unit Factors) may be made to the Board of Appeals within thirty days
from the date of any citation, order, charge, fee, surcharge, penalty or other
action. Such appeal may be made by any person aggrieved. The appellant shall
file a notice of appeal with the Superintendent and with the Board, specifying
the ground therefor. Prior to a hearing, the Superintendent shall transmit to
the Board a summary report of all previous action taken. The Board may, at its
discretion, call upon the Superintendent to explain the action. The final
disposition of the appeal shall be in the form of a resolution, either
reversing, modifying or affirming, in whole or in part, the appealed decision
or determination. In order to find for the appellant, a majority of the Board
must concur.
   The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give
due notice thereof to interested parties and decide the same within a
reasonable time. Within the limits of its jurisdiction, the Board may reverse
or affirm, in whole or in part, or may make such order, requirements, decision
or determination as, in its opinion, ought to be made in the case under
consideration, and to that end have all the powers of the official from whom
said appeal is taken. The decision of said Board shall be final.
   The Board shall meet at such times as the Board may determine. There shall
be a fixed place of meeting and all meetings shall be open to the public in
accordance with applicable laws. The Board shall adopt its own rules of
procedure and keep a record of its proceedings, showing findings of fact, the
action of the Board and the vote of each member upon each question considered.
The presence of three members shall be necessary to constitute a quorum.
   The Board may prescribe the sending of notice to such persons as it deems to
be interested in any hearing by the Board.
   (d)   All charges for service, penalties, fees or surcharges outstanding
during any appeal process shall be due and payable. Upon resolution of any
appeal, the Board shall adjust such amounts accordingly. However, such
adjustments shall be limited to the previous one year's billing unless
otherwise directed by court order.
   (e)   If an informal or formal hearing is not demanded within the periods
specified herein, such administrative action shall be deemed final. In the
event either or both such hearings are demanded, the action shall be suspended
until a final determination has been made, except for immediate cease and
desist orders issued pursuant to this section.
   (f)   Appeals from determinations of the Board may be made to the Circuit
Court for the County of Eaton within twenty days as provided by law. Such
appeals shall be governed procedurally by the Administrative Procedures Act of
the State of Michigan (Act 306 of the Public Acts of 1979, as amended, being
M.C.L.A. 24.201 et seq., as amended). All findings of fact, if supported by the
evidence, made by the Board, shall be conclusive upon the Court.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
RATES AND CHARGES
1040.36 RATES ESTABLISHED; APPLICABILITY; BASIS FOR COMPUTATION.
   Inasmuch as the POTW treatment plant and certain appurtenances to be used by
Village and Township users are owned by the Village, rates and charges for the
use of the wastewater system of the Village are hereby established as set forth
in the Village Schedule of Charges and Fees on file with the Village and
Township Clerks. Revisions to the rates for sanitary sewer service shall be as
established from time to time by resolution of the Village Council, which rates
and charges shall be and are hereby incorporated by reference. Such charges and
rates shall be made against each lot, parcel of land or premises which may have
any sanitary sewer connections to the sewer system of the Village (POTW), or
which may otherwise discharge sewage or industrial waste, either directly or
indirectly, into such system or any part thereof. Charges for use of the
sanitary sewage collection system shall be designated herein as sewer service
charges and shall include:
   (a)   User charges, which shall distribute operation, maintenance and
replacement costs for the Village wastewater collection and treatment system to
each user on a proportional basis.
   (b)   Capital charges, which shall distribute capital costs for the
wastewater collection and treatment system to each user on an equitable basis.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.37 BILLING RATES.
   (a)   Except as provided in Section
1040.42, the rates and charges for service furnished by the wastewater system
of the Village shall be levied upon each lot or parcel of land, building or
premises having any sewer connection with such system, on the basis of the
Table of Equivalent Unit Factors provided in Appendix I at the end of this
chapter, except that in cases where the character of the sewage from a
manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that
unreasonable additional burden is placed upon the system, greater than that
imposed by the normal domestic sewage delivered to the system plant, the
additional cost of treatment created thereby shall be an additional charge over
the regular rates hereinafter set forth, or the user may be required to
pretreat such sewage prior to discharge into the sewage disposal system.
   (b)   The rate to be billed for use of the system within the Township shall
be the same as the rates charged for sanitary sewer service within the Village,
except as otherwise provided herein:
      (1)   User charge. Sewer use charges to each single-family residential
premises served by the system shall be in a flat amount per month as set forth
in the Village Schedule of Charges and Fees. Each premises, other than a
single-family residence, shall pay the monthly charge multiplied by a factor
representing a ratio of sewage use by such class of premises to normal single-
family residential sewage use, as provided in the Table of Equivalent Unit
Factors provided in Appendix I at the end of this chapter, which Table may,
from time to time, be amended.
      (2)   Surcharges. A surcharge rate for the following substances shall be
established per Council resolution and set forth in the Village Schedule of
Charges and Fees on file with the Clerk:
         A.   BOD for wastewater;
         B.   Suspended solids;
         C.   Phosphorus;
         D.   TKN; and
         E.   FOG for wastewater.
   There shall be an additional charge for laboratory testing of wastewater
samples. The laboratory charge shall be for the cost thereof and will be
determined for each user.
   The above charges are user charges to pay for the operation, maintenance and
replacement of the sewage works. They are the same for customers located inside
or outside the Village and the equality of rates shall exist in any future
modifications.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.38 PERIODIC AUDITS.
   The rates hereby fixed are estimated to be sufficient to provide for the
expenses of the operation, maintenance and replacement of the system as are
necessary to preserve the same in good repair and working order. Such rates
shall be fixed and revised from time to time as may be necessary to produce
these amounts. A periodic audit shall be prepared. Based on said audit, rates
for sewage services shall be reviewed and revised as necessary by Council, by
resolution, in order to meet system expenses and to insure that all user
classes pay their proportionate share of operation, maintenance and equipment
replacement costs.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.39 FREE SERVICE PROHIBITED.
   No free service shall be allowed for any user of the wastewater system.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.40 BILLING FOR WASTEWATER SERVICE; PENALTY FOR LATE PAYMENT.
   Billing for wastewater service shall be made by the Village. Sewer use
charge bills will be rendered at a frequency established by a resolution of the
Village Council, payable without penalty within twenty days after the date
thereon. Payment received after such period shall bear a penalty of ten percent
of the amount of the bill.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97; Ord. 2005-2. Passed 6-13-05.)
1040.41 COLLECTION OF DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS; LIENS.
   Unpaid charges for sewage disposal service furnished to any premises
connected to the POTW shall be a lien against the premises. Enforcement of this
lien shall be made pursuant to these Codified Ordinances and/or State statute.
This lien remedy does not preclude any other remedy provided by law. The
Township, pursuant to State statute and contract with the Village, will assist
in the collection of all delinquent charges.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.42 BILLING FOR USE OF THE POTW; LIENS; COLLECTION.
   A billing for use of the POTW shall be made directly by the Village of
Dimondale. Pursuant to M.C.L.A. 123.162, all such charges shall constitute a
lien on the premises served and, if not paid within six months after the same
are due, the official in charge of collection shall, prior to the first day of
May for Village residents and the first day of October for Township residents,
certify to the appropriate Treasurer the fact of such delinquency. Upon receipt
of such certification, the Treasurer shall enter the delinquent charge as a
lien upon the property on the general property tax roll, which lien shall be
enforced in the same manner as provided by law for collection of delinquent
property taxes. Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Village or
the Township from establishing additional rates as may be necessary to finance
said system and/or services rendered in connection therewith. All such rates
and charges shall be adopted and/or amended from time to time by resolution.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.43 FISCAL YEAR.
   The system shall be operated on the basis of a fiscal year commencing on the
first day of March and ending on the last day of February.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.44 CONNECTIONS; PERMIT REQUIRED; FEES.
   No person, firm or corporation shall make any connections with any public
sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the
Village Clerk or the Township Supervisor.
   The owner or his or her agent shall make application for a sewer tap on a
form furnished by the Village Clerk or Township Supervisor. The permit
application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications or other
information required by this section or considered pertinent in the judgment of
the Superintendent. Each single-family residential premises tapping into the
system and securing service shall pay, in cash, at the time of application for
a zoning transmittal, an amount as set forth in the Village Schedule of Charges
and Fees, except in cases where the property to be connected to the sewer main
has participated directly (other than by payment of the general property tax)
in the cost of the sewer facility or has been assessed the cost by special
assessment.
   The owner of each premises, other than a single-family residence, shall pay
a tap charge equal to the product of the fee, as stated above, times the
appropriate residential equivalent ratio established by the Table of Equivalent
Unit Factors provided in Appendix I at the end of this chapter. Such charge is
due, in cash, at the time of application for a zoning transmittal or upon
notice of the Clerk or Supervisor. Should the use of any premises be
intensified, altered or expanded so as to increase the premises' residential
equivalent ratio, a tap charge equal to the product of the fee, as stated
above, times the unit increase in ratio, shall be due upon notice from the
Clerk or the Supervisor. No refunds of tap charges shall be made.
   If a street opening is required to make the lead connection, an additional
fee as set forth in the Village Schedule of Charges and Fees must accompany the
application for sewer service.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)
1040.45 CONNECTION INSPECTION FEE.
   A fee, as set forth in the Village Schedule of Charges and Fees, to cover
the cost of inspection for the connection of a building sewer to the main,
shall be paid to the Village at the time that application is made for sewer
service.
(Ord. 97-4. Passed 9-8-97.)

      (3)   In case of upset, the industrial user shall control production or
all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with the National
Categorical Pretreatment Standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its
treatment facility, until the facility is restored or an alternative method of

1050.01   PURPOSE; APPLICATION.
   (a)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to establish minimum storm
water management requirements and controls to accomplish, among others, the
following objectives:
      (1)   To reduce artificially induced flood damage;
      (2)   To minimize increased storm water runoff rates and volumes from
identified new land development and redevelopment;
      (3)   To minimize the deterioration of existing watercourses, culverts
and bridges, and other structures;
      (4)   To encourage water recharge into the ground where geologically
favorable conditions exist;
      (5)   To prevent an increase in non-point source pollution;
      (6)   To maintain the integrity of stream channels for their biological
functions, as well as for drainage and other purposes;
      (7)   To minimize the impact of development upon stream bank and
streambed stability;
      (8)   To reduce erosion from development or construction projects;
      (9)   To preserve and protect water supply facilities and water resources
by means of controlling increased flood discharges, stream erosion, and runoff
pollution;
      (10)   To reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution, wherever practicable, from lands that were developed
without storm water management controls meeting the purposes and standards of
this chapter;
      (11)   To reduce the adverse impact of changing land use on water bodies
and, to that end, this chapter establishes minimum standards to protect water
bodies from degradation resulting from changing land use where there are
insufficient storm water management controls;
      (12)   To protect the health, safety and welfare of Village residents.
   (b)   Application. This chapter shall apply to any development site which
requires approval of a plat, a site development plan, building permit, or any
other permit for work which will alter storm water drainage characteristics of
the development site, provided, however, that this chapter shall not apply to
the following:
      (1)   Plats with preliminary plat approval and other developments with
final land use approval prior to the effective date of this chapter, where such
approvals remain in effect.

1050.14   PERFORMANCE AND DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   Performance Standard. In order to achieve the goals and purposes of
this chapter, the following performance standard for storm water control
facilities will be used: The goal of this performance standard is to preserve
the natural condition of water bodies included in and adjacent to the Village,
in whole or in part. Within the Village of Dimondale, unless otherwise
approved, storm water runoff shall be conveyed via natural drainage systems
such as swales and vegetated buffer strips. When site conditions permit,
infiltration of storm water runoff is strongly recommended. Storm water managed
in this way provides greater protection for surface water quality, and also
assists in augmenting stream base flow, reduction of flash storm flows and
prevention of stream bank erosion. Section 1050.14(b) specifies design
criteria, in order that the volume and rate of storm water runoff are
controlled at predevelopment levels.
   (b)   Design Standards. The design standards for storm water runoff
facilities, are the following:
 
                      Use BMPs and site design techniques such as those found
                      in the most current edition of the SEMCOG Low Impact
Design Standards      Design Manual, the Best Management Practices for Michigan
                      Watersheds published by the State of Michigan, design
                      standards adopted by the Dimondale Village Council or
                      equivalent design literature to achieve the following.
                      Treat the first 1" of runoff from the contributing
Water Quality Control watershed such that a minimum of 80 percent removal of
                      suspended solids is achieved.
                      Control storm runoff such that there is no net increase
Bank Erosion Control  in runoff volume or rate from all storm events up to the
                      two-year, 24-hour event from the conditions existing
                      prior to the development.
                      Contain storm water runoff such that there is no net
                      increase in runoff volume or rate from the conditions
Flood Control         existing prior to the proposed development onto any
                      adjacent property in a one hundred year storm event.
                      Detain with infiltration when conditions permit. Limit
                      rate of release to 0.13 cfs/acre per ECDC rules.

   (c)   For those parcels outside of the District, in order to promote the
public health and safety of the public-at-large, and to protect and enhance the
storm drainage system within the special assessment district, certain charges,
costs, and connection fees, will be charged to defray the cost of actual
connection. In fairness to those properties which bore the cost of
construction, to prevent free-riding so as to protect the integrity of the
system, and to promote the maintenance and to enhance the system and its users,
an enterprise fee shall be charged.
(Ord. 2003-3. Passed 3-10-03.)
1052.02 COSTS, CHARGES, CONNECTION FEES, AND ENTERPRISE FEES.
   The following costs, charges, connection fees, and enterprise fees shall be
made for storm sewer connection to the Village of Dimondale's Cherry Street
Drain Assessment District:
   (a)   The actual cost for connection incurred by the Village of Dimondale,
including any inspection fees.
   (b)   An enterprise fee, which shall be calculated using the following
formula:
      (1)   Undeveloped - Al   =   $ 647.87/acre
      (2)   Residential - R1C   =   $1,295.74/acre
      (3)   Commercial - B1   =   $2,267.53/acre
The derived number shall be multiplied by a factor as determined by the Village
Manager, or his or her designee, representing the inflation factor since those
fees were first determined in February, 1988.
(Ord. 2003-3. Passed 3-10-03.)
1052.03 APPLICATION.
   Each person seeking to connect to the Cherry Street Drain Assessment
District who was not otherwise in the district shall make application with the
Village on forms and in a manner as approved by the Village Manager.
(Ord. 2003-3. Passed 3-10-03.)
1052.04 USE OF PROCEEDS OF ENTERPRISE FEE.
   The proceeds of the enterprise fee shall be used to retire any outstanding
bonded indebtedness or to repay the Village General Fund, if the cost of
construction of the system were borne by the General Fund. Once the bonds have
been retired or the General Fund repaid, any enterprise fees received shall be
used solely for maintaining or making enhancements to the Cherry Street Drain
System within that area defined as Cherry Street Drain Assessment District,
plus those additional properties which have paid the enterprise fee pursuant to
the terms of this chapter.

   Section 3.1 Specifications for Plans and Plats. In addition to the general
requirements set forth in Sections 111 and 112 of Act 288, the following
information shall be required with submission of the preliminary plat:
   (a)   A location map showing the relationship of the proposed plat to the
surrounding area.
   (b)   A map indicating plans for the development of the entire area, if the
proposed plat is a portion of a larger holding intended for subsequent
development.
   (c)   Streets, street names, right of way and roadway widths.
   (d)   Other rights of way or easements, showing location, width and purpose
as available.
   (e)   Contours at two-foot intervals or less where necessary.
   (f)   Recorded high water elevations in the vicinity of rivers and lakes;
the elevation of the maximum ground water table in cases where it is less than
ten feet from ground surface, to determine limitations of drainage and sewage
systems.
   (g)   Proposed and existing storm and sanitary sewers and watermains.
   (h)   All existing structures and other physical features which would
influence the layout and design of the subdivision.
   (i)   Proposed sites, if any, for multifamily dwellings, shopping centers,

dwellings.
   (j)   Any sites proposed for parks, playgrounds, schools or other public
uses.
   (k)   Two copies of proposed protective covenants and deed restrictions as
an indication of conformance with present zoning.
   To obtain the public viewpoint, the Planning Commission shall call a public
hearing within forty-five days of the filing of the preliminary plat with the
Village.
   Street names should be named after presidents or trees.
   Section 3.2 Subdivision Design Standards.
   (a)   Traffic Ways.
      (1)   Street Location and Arrangement: When a major street plan has been
adopted, subdivisions shall be required to conform to the plan. Arterial
streets shall be dedicated or reserved in the locations and widths shown on the
plan as a condition of plat approval.
      (2)   Through Traffic: Local streets shall be arranged, where possible,
as to discourage their use by through traffic.
      (3)   Street Continuation and Extension: The arrangement of streets shall
provide for the continuation of existing streets from adjoining areas into new
subdivisions.
      (4)   Stub Streets: Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the
arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall be extended to the boundary
line of the tract to make provisions for the future projection of streets into
adjacent areas.
      (5)   Alleys: Alleys shall not be permitted in single-family or two-
family residential areas.
      (6)   Marginal Access Streets: Where a subdivision abuts or contains an
arterial street, marginal access streets may be provided approximately parallel
to and on each side of the right of way, at a distance suitable for the use of
the intervening lands for park purposes or planting screens. This will provide
protection for residential properties and separate through traffic from local
traffic.
      (7)   Street Widths: Any section line or quarter line road shall be a
minimum of 100 feet in width. Minimum widths for local streets shall be sixty-
six feet.
      (8)   Half-Streets: Half-streets shall be prohibited, except where
essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision and where it will be
practical to obtain dedication of the other half of the street from the
adjoining land at the same time.
      (9)   Private Streets: Private streets shall not be permitted.
      (10)   Cul-de-sacs: A cul-de-sac shall not be more than 600 feet in
length and shall have a minimum external diameter of 150 feet.
      (11)   Conformity to County Standards: All traffic ways shall conform to
the standards of the County Road Commission.
   (b)   Intersections.
      (1)   Angle of Intersection: Streets shall intersect as nearly to ninety
degrees as possible.
      (2)   Sight Triangles: Minimum clear sight distance shall be established
for all intersections in which no building, pole or other visual obstruction
higher than two feet would be permitted. Vehicles should be visible to the
driver of another vehicle when each is seventy-five feet from the center of the
intersection for minor streets. The standards of the Village shall apply on
other street types.
      (3)   Number of Streets: No more than two streets shall cross at any one
intersection.
      (4)   Centerline Offsets: Slight jogs at intersections are unsafe. Where
such jogs are unavoidable, street centerlines should be offset by a distance of
125 feet or more.
   (c)   Pedestrianways.
      (1)   Crosswalks: Right-of-way for pedestrian crosswalks in the middle of
long blocks shall be required where necessary. See Section 3.3(d)(4).
      (2)   Sidewalks: Sidewalks shall be required. See Section 3.3(d)(4) for
improvement requirements.
   (d)   Lots.
      (1)   Conformity to Zoning Code: The lot width, depth and area shall not
be less than the particular district requirements of the Zoning Code, except
where outlots are provided for some indicated purpose.
      (2)   Back-Up Lots: Lots shall back, rather than face, onto such features
as freeways, shopping centers or industrial properties. Also lots should back,
rather than face, onto arterial streets.
   Section 3.3 Subdivision Improvements.
   (a)   Purpose: It is the purpose of this section to establish and define the
public improvements which will be required to be constructed by the subdivider
as conditions for final plat approval and also to outline the procedures and
responsibilities of the subdivider and the various public officials and
agencies concerned with the administration, planning, design, construction and
financing of public utilities and facilities, and to further establish
procedures for assuring compliance with these requirements.
   (b)   Responsibility for Plans: It shall be the responsibility of the
subdivider of every proposed subdivision to have prepared by a registered
engineer a complete set of construction plans, including profile, cross-
sections, specifications and other supporting data, for the hereinafter
required public streets, utilities and other facilities. Such construction
plans shall be based on preliminary plans which have been approved with the
preliminary plat, and shall be prepared in conjunction with the final plat. All
construction plans shall be prepared in accordance with the following public
improvement standards or specifications as approved by the various public
agencies of the Village and County.
   (c)   Procedure on Submittal: One complete set of reproducible as-built
engineering plans of each required public improvement shall be filed with the
Clerk upon completion of construction.
   (d)   Required Public Improvements: Every subdivision developer shall be
required to install the following public and other improvements in accordance
with the conditions and specifications as follows:
      (1)   Water Supply System: When a proposed subdivision is located
adjacent to or reasonably near the service area of a public water supply
system, fire hydrants or other required water system appurtenances shall be
constructed in such a manner as to adequately service all lots shown on the
subdivision plat, both for domestic use and fire protection. In the event of
the nonexistence or nonavailability of a public water supply system, a
subdivision water supply system, if considered economically feasible (as
determined by the Planning Commission with the advice of the designated Village
engineer and approval by Council) shall be installed by the developer. If it is
not feasible to install any type of public water supply system in a proposed
subdivision (in the judgment of the Commission with the advice of the
designated Village engineer and the Barry-Eaton District Health Department),
then the subdivider shall, with the approval of the Commission, install
individual wells in accordance with the requirements of the Barry-Eaton
District Health Department.
         The sizes of water mains, the location and type of valves and
hydrants, the amount of soil cover over the pipes, and other features of the
installation shall be approved by the designated Village engineer and shall
conform to the accepted standards of sound practices for municipal water supply
and fire protection systems.
         All easements and water supply improvements shall be dedicated to the
public and accepted by Council for administration, operation and maintenance.
No proprietary rights of any type or description shall be retained by the
developer or owner of the subdivision. In the event that land reserved for well
sites is not used for that purpose and it is appropriate for lot development,
such land shall revert to the subdivider for such use.
      (2)   Sanitary Sewer System: When a proposed subdivision is located
within, adjacent to or reasonably near the service area of a public sanitary
sewer system, sanitary sewers and other required appurtenances thereto shall be
installed in such a manner as to serve adequately all lots with connections to
the public sewer system. Sewer systems shall be installed in accordance with
plans prepared or approved by the Planning Commission, the designated Village
engineer, and Council.
(Ord. Unno. Passed 9-13-76.)
      (3)   Street Name Signs, Traffic Control Signals, Devices and Signs:
Street name signs shall be installed in the appropriate locations at each
intersection in accordance with the requirements of the Village. Appropriate
traffic and parking control signals, devices and signs meeting the standards of
the Michigan Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices shall be installed as
directed by the Village Traffic Engineer. (Ord. Unno. Passed 3-12-79.)
      (4)   Sidewalks and Crosswalks: Where the average width of lots, as
measured at the street frontage line or at the building setback line, is less
than 100 feet but in excess of eighty feet, sidewalks on one side shall be
required. Where lot widths are eighty feet or less, sidewalks shall be required
on both sides of the street. Where lots average over 100 feet in width,
sidewalks shall be as required by the Planning Commission.
         Sidewalks and crosswalks shall be constructed in accordance with the
requirements of the Village.
         Crosswalks, when required by the Commission, shall be at least ten
feet in width and include a paved walk, the width of said pavement to be
determined by the Commission at the time of application. They shall be fenced
along the side lines with a chain link fence at least four feet in height.

placement of utilities or other public improvements shall be replaced by the
contractor or utility responsible, by a registered surveyor or by a registered
engineer.
      (6)   Streets and Alleys: All streets and alleys shall be constructed and
dedicated in accordance with the standards, regulations and specifications
adopted by the County Road Commission, the State Department of Transportation,
and the requirements of these regulations.
      (7)   Curbs and Gutters: Curbs and gutters shall be required on all
streets and shall be constructed in accordance with the standards and
specifications adopted by the Eaton County Road Commission.
      (8)   Telephone and Electric Utility Lines: All new telephone and
electric utility lines shall be required to be installed underground.
      (9)   Storm Drainage: An adequate storm drainage system, including
necessary storm sewers, drain inlets, manholes, culverts, bridges and other
appurtenances, shall be required in all subdivisions. The requirements for each
particular subdivision shall be established by the County Drain Commissioner
and the designated Village Engineer. Construction shall follow the
specifications and procedures established by the County Drain Commissioner and
the designated Village Engineer. All proposed storm drainage construction plans
for proposed plats shall be approved by the County Drain Commissioner and the
designated Village Engineer. The drainage system and all necessary easements
thereto shall be dedicated pursuant to the regulations and requirements of the
County Drain Commissioner.

requirements of the Village, the County Road Commission or any other agency
responsible for the administration, operation and maintenance of the applicable
public improvement. No financial guarantee of performance shall be required

   Section 3.5 Variances.
   (a)   General Variance: The Planning Commission may recommend to Council a
variance from the provisions of this chapter when, in its opinion, undue
hardship may result from strict compliance. In granting any variance, the
Commission shall prescribe only conditions that it deems necessary to or

property that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his or her land.
      (2)   The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right of the petitioner.
      (3)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which said property is
situated.
   (b)   Applications Required: Application for any such variance shall be
submitted in writing by the subdivider at any time when the preliminary plat is
filed for the consideration of the Commission. The petition shall state fully

1260.01 SHORT TITLE.
   This Title Six of Part Twelve of these Codified Ordinances shall be known as
the "Zoning Code of the Village of Dimondale" or just the "Zoning Code."
(Ord. 89. Passed 4-10-72.)
1260.02 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this Zoning Code to promote the safety, health, morals,
convenience and general welfare; to encourage the use of lands and natural
resources in the Village in accordance with their character, adaptability and
suitability for particular purposes; to enhance social and economic stability;
to prevent excessive concentration of population; to reduce hazards due to
flooding; to lessen congestion on the public streets and highways; to
facilitate the adequate provision of streets and highways, sewerage and
drainage, water supply and distribution, and the expenditure of funds for
public facilities and services by establishing herein standards for physical
development in accordance with the objectives and policies contained in the
Master Plan for the Village of Dimondale; and to provide for the enforcement of
such standards.
(Ord. 89. Passed 4-10-72; Ord. 2009-7. Passed 12-14-09.)
1260.03 AMENDMENTS.
   (a)   Amendments Authorized. The regulations and provisions stated in the
text of this Zoning Code and the boundaries of zoning districts shown on the
Zoning District Map of the Village may be amended, supplemented or changed by
resolution of Council in accordance with the Zoning Act, as amended.
   (b)   Initiation. Proposals for amendments, supplements or changes may be
initiated by Council on its own motion, by the Planning Commission or by
petition of one or more owners of property to be affected by the proposed
amendment.
(Ord. 89. Passed 4-10-72.)
   (c)   Procedure.
      (1)   Each petition by one or more persons for an amendment shall be
submitted in an application to Council through the Clerk on a standard form
provided by the Village, and shall be accompanied by a fee established in a
schedule of fees adopted by Council to cover administrative and publication
costs. No part of such fee shall be returnable to a petitioner if a public
hearing is held. Petitions for zoning of property which is the subject of a
request for annexation shall accompany said requests for annexation. Council
will consider the request for annexation and the petition for zoning at the
same time.
(Ord. Unno. Passed 9-13-76.)
      (2)   Council will refer the application to the Commission for action, if
it deems that such amendment is a possibly desirable amendment.
      (3)   The Commission shall consider each proposal for amendment in terms
of its own judgment on the particular factors related to the individual
proposal and in terms of the most likely effect on the community's physical
development. The Commission may recommend any additions or modifications to the
original amendment proposal.
      (4)   Prior to making a recommendation on a proposed amendment, the
Planning Commission shall conduct a public hearing. Notice of the hearing shall
be provided in a newspaper of general circulation not less than 15 days before
the date of the hearing. Notice shall be sent by mail or personal delivery to
the owners of the property for which the approval is being considered. Notice
shall also be given to all persons to whom real property is assessed within 300
feet of the property that is the subject of the request and to all occupants of
all structures within 300 feet of the subject property regardless of whether
the property or structures are located in the zoning jurisdiction. Notification
need not be given to more than one occupant of a structure, except that if a
structure contains more than one dwelling unit or spatial area owned or leased
by different persons, one occupant of each unit or spatial area shall be given
notice. If a single structure contains more than four dwelling units or other
distinct spatial areas owned or leased by different persons, notice may be
given to the manager or owner of the structure, who shall be requested to post
the notice at the primary entrance to the structure. Notice is considered to be
given when personally delivered or when deposited during normal business hours
for delivery with the United States postal service or other public or private
delivery service. The notice shall be given not less than 15 days before the
date the request will be considered. If the name of the occupant is not known,
the term “occupant” may be used for the intended recipient of the notice. The
notice shall describe the nature of the request, indicate the property that is
the subject of the request to include street addresses if such addresses exist,
state when and where the request will be considered and indicate where written
comments will be received concerning the request. If the proposed amendment
contains 11 or more adjacent properties, no individual addresses are required.
Notice of the time and place of the public hearing shall also be given by mail
to each electric, gas and pipeline public utility company and each
telecommunication service provider operating with the district or zone
affected.
      (5)   The Commission shall then transmit the proposed amendment to
Council and, if Council shall deem any amendments, changes, additions or
departures advisable as to the proposed text or district boundaries, it shall
refer the same to the Commission for a report thereon within a time specified
by Council. After receiving the report, Council shall grant a hearing on the
proposed amendment to any property owner who has filed a written request to be
so heard and shall request the Commission to attend such hearing. Thereafter,
Council may adopt the amendment with or without changes.
      (6)   An amendment to the zoning ordinance is subject to a protest
petition. If a protest is filed, approval of the amendment to the zoning
ordinance shall require two-thirds vote of the legislative body. The protest
petition shall be presented to the Village Council before final legislative
action on the amendment and shall be signed by one or more of the following:
         A.   The owners of at least 20% of the area of land included in the
proposed change.
         B.   The owners of at least 20% of the area of land included within an
area extending outward 100 feet from any point on the boundary of the land
included in the proposed change.
         C.   Publicly-owned land shall be excluded in calculating the 20% land
area requirement.
      (7)   No application for a rezoning which has been denied by Council
shall be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of the last denial,
except on grounds of newly discovered evidence or proof of changed conditions
found upon inspection by Council to be valid.
(Ord. 89. Passed 4-10-72.)
   (d)   Fact Finding.
      (1)   In reviewing any petition for a zoning amendment, the Planning
Commission shall identify and evaluate all factors relevant to the petition,
and shall report its findings in full, along with its recommendations for
disposition of the petition, to the Village Council. The facts to be considered
by the Planning Commission shall include, but are not limited to, the
following:
         A.   The requested zoning change is justified by a change in
conditions since the original ordinance was adopted or by an error in the
original ordinance;
         B.   The precedents, and the possible effects of such precedents,
which might likely result from approval or denial of the petition are not
contrary to the public interest or to the intent and purpose of this Zoning
Code;
         C.   The Village or other government agencies are able to provide any
services, facilities, and/or programs that might be required if the petition is
approved;
         D.   There are no negative environmental impacts which would
reasonable occur if the petitioned zoning change and resulting permitted
structures are built, including, but not limited to, surface water drainage,
waste disposal, or impact on natural resources; and
         E.   Approval of the petition does not conflict with any adopted
development policies of the Village and/or other governmental units.
      (2)   All findings of fact shall be made a part of the public records of
the meetings of the Planning Commission and the Village Council.
(Ord. 2002-2. Passed 4-8-02; Ord. 2009-7. Passed 12-14-09.)
1260.04 CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   In the interpretation, application and enforcement of the provisions of this
Zoning Code, whenever any of the provisions or limitations imposed or required
by this Zoning Code, conflict with any other law or ordinance, then the
provisions of this Zoning Code, shall govern, provided that whenever the
provisions of any other law or ordinance impose more stringent requirements
than are imposed or required by this Zoning Code, then the provisions of such
other law or ordinance shall govern.
(Ord. 89. Passed 4-10-72.)
1260.05 SEPARABILITY.
   Should any article, section, clause or provision of this Zoning Code be
declared by the courts to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the

so declared to be invalid.

   When a notice of appeal has been filed in proper form with the Board of
Appeals, the Secretary of the Board shall immediately place said request for
appeal on the calendar for hearing and shall cause notices to be given as
follows:
   (a)   The Board of Appeals shall provide notice of the hearing in a
newspaper of general circulation not less than 15 days before the date of the
hearing. Notice shall be sent by mail or personal delivery to the owners of
property for which the approval is considered. Notice shall also be given to
all persons to whom real property is assessed within 300 feet of the property
that is the subject of the request and to the occupants of all structures
within 300 feet of the subject property regardless of whether the property or
structures are located in the zoning jurisdiction. Notification need not be
given to more than one occupant of a structure, except that if a structure
contains more than one dwelling unit or spatial area owned or leased by
different persons, one occupant of each unit or spatial area shall be given
notice. If a structure contains more than four dwelling units or other distinct
spatial areas owned or leased by different persons, notice may be given to the
manager or owner of the structure, who shall be requested to post the notice at
the primary entrance to the structure. Notice is considered to be given when
personally delivered or when deposited during normal business hours for
delivery with the United States postal service or other public or private
delivery service. The notice shall be given not less than 15 days before the
date the request will be considered. If the name of the occupant is not known,
the term “occupant” may be used for the intended recipient of the notice. The
notice shall describe the nature of the request, indicate the property that is
the subject of the request to include street addresses if such addresses exist,
state when and where the request will be considered and indicate where written
comments will be received concerning the request.
   (b)   If the Board of Appeals receives a written request seeking an
interpretation of the zoning ordinance or an appeal of an administrative
decision, the Board of Appeals shall conduct a public hearing on the request.
Notice shall be given as required under division (a) above. However, if the
request does not involve a specific parcel of property, notice need only be
published in a paper of general circulation and given to the person making the
request. The Board may adjourn any meeting held in order to allow the obtaining
of additional information or to provide further notice as it deems necessary.

within 60 days after a request or appeal has been filed, unless an extension of
time is requested by a majority of the members of the Board. Any decision of
the Board shall not become final until the expiration of five days from the
date of entry of such order, unless the Board shall find the immediate effect
of such order is necessary for the preservation of property or personal rights,
and shall so certify on the record. Further appeal from the decision of the
Board to the Eaton County Circuit Court shall be in accordance with the Zoning
Act.
(Ord. 89. Passed 4-10-72; Ord. 2001-9. Passed 12-10-01; Ord. 2009-5. passed 11-

1264.06 MAJORITY VOTE REQUIRED.
   The concurring vote of a majority of the members of the Board of Appeals

of the designated Village officer(s) appealed from or to decide in favor of the
applicant on a matter upon which they are required to pass under this Zoning
Code or to effect any variation in this Zoning Code.
(Ord. Unno. Passed 9-13-76; Ord. 2001-9. Passed 12-10-01.)

aggrieved, or by any officer, department or board of the Village. Any appeal
from the ruling of the designated Village officer(s) concerning the enforcement
of the provisions of this Zoning Code may be made to the Board within ten days
after the date of the mailing of the Village officer's decision which is the
subject of the appeal. Such appeal shall be filed with the Clerk. The appellant
shall submit a clear description of the order, requirement, decision or
determination for which the appeal is made and the grounds for the appeal on an
application provided by the Clerk. The appellant may be required by the Board
of Appeals to submit additional information to clarify the appeal. The Clerk
shall transmit to the Board of Appeals copies of all papers constituting the
record upon which the action appealed was taken.
(Adopting Ordinance)
   (b)   Stay. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the
action appealed from, unless the designated County and/or Village officer(s)
certifies to the Board after notice of appeal has been filed with him or her
that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his or her
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the
proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which
may be granted by the Board or, upon application, by a court of record.
   (c)   Fees. A fee as established by Council shall be paid to the Secretary
at the time of filing the application with the Board. The purpose of such fee

expenses incurred by the Board in connection with the appeal.
(Ord. Unno. Passed 9-13-76; Ord. 2001-9. Passed 12-10-01.)
1264.08 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   The Board of Appeals shall not have the power to alter or change the zoning
district classification of any property, nor to make any change in the terms or
intent of this Zoning Code, but does have power to act on those matters where
this Zoning Code provides for an administrative review, interpretation,
variance, exception or special approval permit as defined in this chapter.
1264.09 DECISIONS SUBJECT TO REVIEW.
   The Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by
the appellant that there is an error in any order, requirement, permit,
decision or refusal made by the Zoning Officer or by any other official in
administering or enforcing any provisions of this Zoning Code. The Board of
Appeals may, so long as such action is in conformity with this Zoning Code,
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement,
decision or determination appealed.
(Ord. 89. Passed 4-10-72; Ord. 2001-9. Passed 12-10-01.)
1264.10 INTERPRETATIONS.
   The Board of Appeals shall have the power to:
   (a)   Interpret, upon request, the provisions of this Zoning Code in such a
way as to carry out the intent and purpose of this Zoning Code;
   (b)   Determine the precise location of the boundary lines between zoning
districts;
   (c)   Classify a use which is not specifically mentioned as part of the use
regulations of any zoning district, so that it conforms to a comparable
permitted or prohibited use, in accordance with the purpose and intent of each
district.
   (d)   Determine the off-street parking and loading space requirements of any
use not specifically mentioned in
Chapter 1288.
(Ord. 89. Passed 4-10-72.)
1264.11 VARIANCES.
   The Board of Appeals shall have the power to authorize upon an appeal
specific variances from such requirements as lot area and width regulations,
building height and bulk regulations, yard and depth regulations, and off-
street parking and loading space requirements, provided that all of the basic
conditions listed herein and any one of the special conditions listed
thereafter can be satisfied.
   (a)   Basic Conditions. Any variance granted from this Zoning Code shall
meet the following basic conditions:
      (1)   It will not be contrary to the public interest or to the intent and
purpose of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   It shall not permit the establishment within a district of any use
which is not permitted by right within that zone district, or any use or
dimensional variance for which a conditional use permit or a temporary use
permit is required.
      (3)   It will not cause a substantial adverse effect upon property values
in the immediate vicinity or in the district in which the property of the
applicant is located.
      (4)   It is not one where the specific conditions relating to the
property are so general or recurrent in nature as to make the formulation of a
general regulation for such conditions reasonably practical.
      (5)   It will relate only to property that is under the control of the
applicant.
      (6)   It does not result from a condition created by the applicant.
      (7)   It does not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is
denied by this Zoning Code to other lands, structures or buildings in the same
district.
   (b)   Special Conditions. When all of the foregoing basic conditions can be
satisfied, a variance may be granted when any one of the following special
conditions can be clearly demonstrated:
      (1)   There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships which
prevent carrying out the strict letter of this Zoning Code. These hardships or
difficulties shall not be deemed economic, but shall be evaluated in terms of
the use of a particular parcel of land.
      (2)   There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or physical
conditions, such as narrowness, shallowness, shape or topography of the
property involved, or to the intended use of the property, that do not
generally apply to other property or uses in the same zoning district. Such
circumstances or conditions shall not have resulted from any act of the
applicant subsequent to the adoption of this Zoning Code.
      (3)   Such variance is necessary for the preservation of a substantial
property right possessed by other properties in the same zoning district.
   (c)   Rules for Granting. The following rules shall be applied in the
granting of variances:
      (1)   The Board may specify, in writing, such conditions regarding the
character, location and other features that will, in its judgment, secure the
objectives and purposes of this Zoning Code. The breach of any such condition
shall automatically invalidate the permit granted.
      (2)   Each variance granted under the provisions of this Zoning Code
shall become null and void unless:
         A.   The construction authorized by such variance or permit has been
commenced within six months after the granting of the variance.
         B.   The occupancy of land, premises or buildings authorized by the
variance has taken place within one year after the granting of the variance.
      (3)   No application for a variance which has been denied wholly or in
part by the Board shall be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date
of the last denial, except on the grounds of newly discovered evidence or proof
of changed conditions found upon inspection by the Board to be valid.
(Ord. 89. Passed 4-10-72.)
1264.12 SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
   When, in its judgment, the public welfare will be served and the use of
neighboring property will not be injured thereby, the Board of Appeals may hear
and decide, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, requests for
exceptions and for decisions on special situations on which this chapter
specifically authorizes the Board to pass. Any exception shall be subject to
such conditions as the Board may require to preserve and promote the character
of the district in question. The granting of a special exception shall in no
way constitute a change in the basic uses permitted in the district affected,
nor on the property wherein the exception is permitted. The Board may issue
either temporary or conditional permits as special exceptions for the following
land and structure uses.
   (a)   Temporary Permits. The granting of such special exceptions for
temporary structures for dwelling purposes, including mobile homes, shall be
subject to the following procedures and limitations:
      (1)   An application for a permit for the erection or movement of a
temporary structure for dwelling purposes, including mobile homes, shall be
made to the Board on a special form used exclusively for that purpose.
      (2)   The Board shall give due notice to the applicant and to all
property owners as provided for in Section
1264.04(a).
      (3)   A temporary permit shall not be granted unless the Board finds
adequate evidence that the proposed location of use will not be detrimental to
property in the immediate vicinity and that the proposed water supply and
sanitary facilities have been approved by the County Health Department.
      (4)   The Board may impose any reasonable conditions, including setbacks,
land coverage, off-street parking, landscaping and other requirements deemed
necessary to protect adjoining properties and the public welfare. The violation
of any such condition shall automatically invalidate the permit.
      (5)   The permit issued shall clearly set forth the conditions under
which the permit is granted and shall state that the proposed temporary
dwelling structure is to be vacated upon expiration of a specific time limit
not to exceed six months. No permit shall be transferable to any other owner or
occupant.
   (b)   Conditional Permits. When conditions exist that are unique to a
particular situation, a conditional permit may be issued with specific
limitations imposed by the Board. The land or structure use may be permitted to
be established and to continue in use as long as the conditions unique to the
use exist. The permit may be cancelled when the conditions upon which the
permit was issued cease to exist. The permit issued shall contain all the
specified conditions under which continued use may be allowed. Conditional
permits may be issued for the following uses:
      (1)   The Board may authorize a reduction, modification or waiver of any
of the off-street parking or off-street loading regulations in
Chapter 1288, when it can be demonstrated that circumstances of extreme
practical difficulty exist that would unquestionably result in hardship to the
applicant when a literal interpretation of the regulations is required.
Hardship shall not be deemed economic, but shall be evaluated in terms of the
use of a particular parcel of land. A hardship that is a result of any action
of the applicant shall not be considered by the Board. Under all these
circumstances, in no case shall the off-street parking or off-street loading
standards be reduced by more than 25%.

Passed 11-9-09.)
1264.13 EXPANSION AND SUBSTITUTION OF NONCONFORMITIES.
   The Board of Appeals shall determine whether a nonconforming building or
structure may be expanded, except as otherwise provided in
Chapter 1286, and whether a nonconforming use may be substituted for another
nonconforming use.
(Ord. 2001-9. Passed 12-10-01.)
1264.14 SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   If an appeal to the Board of Appeals involves a lot, structure or use for
which a site plan approval is required, the appellant shall first apply for
preliminary site plan approval as set forth in this Zoning Code. The Planning
Commission shall review the site plan and shall determine the layout and other
features required to obtain approval of the site plan. The Planning Commission
shall then transmit a copy of the site plan and the Commission's findings
thereon to the Board of Appeals. The Board shall, upon deciding on the appeal,
return the plan and its decision to the Planning Commission for Commission
action.

   (e)   Boundaries following the shoreline of a stream, lake or other body of
water shall be construed to follow such shorelines, and in the event of change
in the shoreline shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline;
boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerline of streams,
rivers, canals or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such
centerlines.
   (f)   Where the application of the aforesaid rules leaves a reasonable doubt
as to the boundaries between two districts, the regulations of the more
restrictive district shall govern the entire parcel in question, unless
otherwise determined by the Board of Appeals after recommendation from the
Planning Commission.
1266.04 SCOPE OF REGULATIONS.

   There may be certain land use situations where it is in the best interest of
the Village, as well as beneficial to property owners seeking a change in
zoning district boundaries, if certain conditions are proposed by property
owners as part of a rezoning application. It is the intent of this section to
provide a process consistent with the provisions of the Michigan Zoning

with conditions shall be the same as that for considering rezoning requests
made without an offer of conditions, except as provided for in this section.
   (c)   The voluntary offer of conditions by the property owner may be made at
the time the rezoning application is filed or at any time in the rezoning
process.

permissible in the zoning district for which the conditional rezoning
application is made, dimensional requirements of the proposed zoning district,
infrastructure and utility requirements for the proposed development, energy
conservation measures, open space provision within the proposed development,
preservation of natural resources, donation of land for public purposes,

the proposed development by the applicant. Applications for conditional
rezoning shall not increase the intensity of use for the proposed rezoning
district.

the voluntary offer of conditions for the proposed rezoning as part of the
rezoning application process. The request for conditional rezoning may be made
at any time during the rezoning process.
   (c)   Public Hearing. The Planning Commission conducts the required public
hearing as specified for rezoning applications by the Zoning Ordinance.
   (d)   Planning Commission Recommendation. Following the public hearing, and
following appropriate review and discussion, the Planning Commission shall

1268.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The R-1A One-Family Rural Residential District is established to allow
for the development of residential properties of a semi-rural character with
larger lots within areas of the Village and to provide for limited agricultural
uses. The District includes existing low density one-family properties as well
as areas within which such development appears both likely and desirable.
   (b)   (1)   In order to avoid the intrusion of undesirable uses and to
foster all possible benefits for a continued high quality residential
environment, all nonresidential land and structure uses in the District, as
well as other residential districts in this Zoning Code have been classified
into three categories:
         A.   Those uses permitted by right;
         B.   Those uses permitted under special conditions;
         C.   Those uses permitted by special permit.
      (2)   The latter classification has been established to facilitate the
inclusion within the District of certain nonresidential uses that have been
generally accepted as reasonably compatible with one-family neighborhoods, but
that present potential injurious effects upon residential and other property,
unless authorized under specific and controlled conditions.
(Ord. 89. Passed 4-10-72; Ord. 2010-5. Passed 1-10-11.)

1281.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The Town Center District is designed and intended to promote a blend
of pedestrian accessible commercial and residential uses. The district will
provide for a wide range of retail, commercial, office, civic and residential
uses which may be concurrent within the same building. The Town Center District
is intended to provide and promote attractive development while at the same
time protecting and maintaining existing mature and/or historic areas of the
community. A central characteristic of the Town Center is its focus on
pedestrian activity. This activity helps to create a unique social environment
where people can gather and enjoy the friendly atmosphere, attractive
landscaping and greenery and a diversity of retail shops.
   (b)   The provisions of this District are intended to encourage the planned
development of pedestrian amenities and open space, and closely regulate the
need for direct automobile access to each establishment. Also important in the
development of the Town Center is the concept of mixed-use development, which
is defined as the combination of commercial and residential land uses within
the same building and/or on the same lot. Since the Town Center contains a
limited geographic area for expansion, the mixed-use development is an
important tool for expanding both housing and shopping opportunities available
in the Town Center.

   (a)   Number of Structures per Lot. Only one principal structure may be
established for each lot. Accessory buildings and structures are permitted,
provided they are clearly incidental to, and located on the same lot as the
principal structure to which they are related.
   (b)   Space Within Public Ways. No use conducted on any premises within this
district shall be permitted to occupy or use space within the public roadway,
or operate a business which would unreasonably restrict the use of a public
street or sidewalk.
   (c)   Minimum Front Yard Depth. None.
   (d)   Minimum Rear Yard Depth. None, except if the rear yard abuts any
residential district, then the minimum setback shall be 10 feet.
   (e)   Minimum Side Yard Width. None, except if the side yard abuts any
residential district then the minimum setback shall be 10 feet.
   (f)   Minimum Lot Area and Width. The minimum lot area and width shall be
determined on the basis of parking, loading, yard setbacks, landscape or open
space requirements as set forth in this Zoning Code.
   (g)   Maximum Building Height. Maximum building height shall be two and one-
half stories or 35 feet. Refer to Section
1294.06  for accessory building regulations. Refer to Section
1294.18  for building height limitations for nonresidential structures in
residential districts.

be 80%, and shall include the total of area of the principal building and all
accessory buildings. Maximum ground coverage shall be 85%, and shall include
building coverage and paving necessary for adequate vehicular circulation,
including ingress and egress, of street loading and on-site parking. Ground
coverage does not include facilities serving pedestrian traffic such as
sidewalks, patios and plazas.
   (i)   Existing Structures. Proposed changes to existing facades which
require a building permit shall be in keeping with the architectural character
of the neighborhood and shall be reviewed and approved by the Zoning
Administrator. Any proposed changes which change the architectural style of the
building shall also be reviewed by the Planning Commission, which may reverse
or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the Zoning Administrator's
recommendations. These provisions shall apply to both principal and accessory
structures.
   (j)   New Construction. The architectural style of proposed new structures,
both principal and accessory, shall be in keeping with the architectural
character of the neighborhood and shall be reviewed and approved as part of the
Site Plan Review process by the Zoning Administrator and/or the Planning

Chapter 1296.
   (k)   Screening for Dumpster/ Recycling Areas. All solid waste dumpsters and
disposal facilities, recycling bins, and similar areas and structures located
in this district shall be screened from view of passing pedestrians, passing
vehicular traffic and any adjacent residential use.
   (l)   Temporary Buildings. Temporary buildings are prohibited except in the
following instances:
      (1)   Those temporary buildings which are incidental to construction
work, which may include “tool trailers” or “job trailers.” This would not be
for on-site residence during construction, but would be an office for a larger
job or a place to lock tools on-site during construction.
      (2)   Temporary buildings which serve a public or semi-public
institutional use.
   (m)   Access.
      (1)   No more than one driveway approach shall be permitted per lot,
including corner lots.
      (2)   Driveways shall be located, designed and constructed in compliance
with the requirements of the Driveway Policy and Specifications adopted by the
Village. If the site fronts on two or more streets, the driveway shall be
located as far as possible from the street intersection as practical.
      (3)   All areas intended to serve vehicular traffic shall be paved with a
permanent surface of concrete, asphalt or a structurally equivalent material
approved by the Village Engineer.
   (n)   Lighting. Lighting from any luminaire shall be shaded, shielded or
directed to prevent direct light from being distributed beyond an angle of 35
degrees from a vertical plane onto adjacent properties and/or surrounding
areas. Unshielded lamps, bulbs and tubes are not permitted, except for
temporary holiday lighting. Lighting shall be designed so that the illumination
does not exceed 0.1 footcandles beyond the property line on which the lighting
originates.
   (o)   Landscaping. A minimum of 15% of the gross site area of a development
shall be devoted to permanently landscaped open spaces and pedestrian plaza
areas accessible to the public. Pedestrian plaza areas shall include pedestrian
walkways and may also include amenities such as decorative paving, pedestrian
scale lighting, benches, trash receptacles, planters, screening walls and major
architectural features at entrance ways and focal points of the development
(i.e. arch, gateway, tower, fountain). All required setback areas must be
landscaped. All landscaped open spaces and pedestrian plaza areas shall be
maintained by the owner of the development it serves.
   (p)   General Standards. Uses in this District shall also conform to the
following general standards:
      (1)   Emit no obnoxious, toxic or corrosive fumes or gases which are
detrimental to the public health, safety or general welfare.
      (2)   Emit no smoke, odorous gases or other odorous matter in such
quantities as to be offensive at or beyond any boundary of the parcel. For the
purpose of grading the density of smoke, the Ringelmann Chart, published and
used by the United States Bureau of Mines, shall be employed. The emission of
smoke or particulate matter of a density greater than No. 2 of the Ringelmann
Chart and an excess of 15 smoke units per hour is prohibited.
      (3)   Produce no heat or glare to such an extent as to be detrimental to
the health, safety and general welfare at or beyond the lot boundaries.
      (4)   Produce no physical vibrations to such an extent as to be

Passed 4-11-22.)
1281.07 PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS.
   The Town Center parking provisions are designed to be consistent with the
purpose of the District to facilitate pedestrian circulation through the
District and to closely regulate the need for direct automobile access to each
establishment for both pedestrian safety and general aesthetics.
   (a)   The parking space requirements of Section
1288.09 shall apply to uses in the Town Center District. However, consistent
with the purpose of the District and a recognition by the Village of the need
for additional, off-site parking facilities (both public and private), space
requirements may be met through a combination of on- and off-site parking
spaces meeting the following conditions. Adjoining lots may propose a joint use
of parking areas pursuant to Section
1288.08, with paving extended to the property line.
      (1)   Parking spaces for customers or residents must be located within
500 feet of the use, as measured along probable pedestrian travel paths. Where
a portion of an off-street parking lot or a contiguous series of on- street
parking spaces fall within the 500-foot area, all of the spaces within the lot
or the series of spaces shall be counted.
      (2)   The parking spaces must be available at all times consistent with
the anticipated peak parking demands of the proposed use.
   (b)   The applicant shall submit a parking plan study demonstrating
compliance with these parking standards. The parking plan study shall include
existing traffic volumes passing on all streets abutting the proposed
development during the peak hour, projected peak-hour generation rate and peak
hours of generation for the proposed development and a statement of the total
impact the projected generations will have on the existing level of service and
parking as determined and certified by a registered engineer. The study shall
be validated by the Planning Commission or by a consultant retained by the
Planning Commission. Exceptions to this requirement will be site plans or plats
that will generate less than 3 vehicle trips per unit per peak hour or 50
vehicle trips per peak hour. The generation of trips shall conform to the
methods specified in the current edition of the Trip Generation Manual, a
publication by the Institute of Transportation Engineers.
   (c)   Applications for a building and/or occupancy permit to expand a
building or to convert or extend the use of a building which would result in an
increased parking demand shall also require a parking plan study be submitted
according to the provisions and exceptions listed in division (b) above.
   (d)   The off-street loading areas shall be provided as required by Section
1288.12, except that a single loading area may be shared by two or more uses
which are individually required to maintain an off- street loading area. This
practice is encouraged whenever such use is practical, and when all
requirements for location, design and construction are met. A copy of an
agreement between the joint owners of an off-street loading area shall be
recorded with the Eaton County Register of Deeds and the Village Manager. Such
agreements shall guarantee the long-term use and maintenance of the parking
facility by each party.
(Ord. 2001-5. Passed 11-12-01.)
1281.08 SIGNS.
   Signs may be permitted as provided in
Chapter 846.
(Ord. 2001-5. Passed 11-12-01; Ord. 2003-7. Passed 1-12-04.)
1281.09 TOWN CENTER RESIDENTIAL OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICT.
   (a)   Purpose. The Town Center Residential Overlay District exists as an
overlay zoning district to the Town Center District in order to expand the
physical area of the Town Center District beyond the limits of the existing
“downtown,” and to provide appropriate site development standards for those
parcels. On parcels with an existing residential structure, the Town Center
Residential Overlay District is intended to permit the conversion of the
structure for commercial use, provided that the residential character of the
parcel is retained. By protecting the residential character of the structure
and parcel, the overall impact of commercial expansion of the Town Center
District into the adjacent neighborhoods will be minimized. The site
development standards listed below replace those of Section
1281.06 in the Overlay Zoning District to preserve the residential character of
the parcel. All other provisions of the Town Center Zoning Districts apply to
the overlay zone as well.
   (b)   Site Development Standards. The following site development standards
shall apply to all areas of the Town Center Residential Overlay District:
      (1)   Number of structures per lot. Only one principal structure may be
established for each lot. Accessory buildings and structures are permitted
provided they are clearly incidental to, and located on the same lot as the
principal structure to which they are related and provided they meet the
following conditions and standards:
         A.   Setback, front. Accessory buildings and structures must be
located behind the rear building line of the principal building.
         B.   Setback, side. Accessory buildings and structures must have side
setbacks which are greater than or equal to the minimum required for the
principal structure, except where otherwise noted.
         C.   Setback, rear. Accessory buildings and structures must have a
rear yard setback of at least 5 feet.
         D.   Phasing. Accessory buildings and structures shall not be erected
on a lot or parcel prior to the establishment of a principal building upon the
premises.
      (2)   Minimum lot area. Minimum lot area shall be 8,500 square feet.
      (3)   Minimum lot width. Minimum lot width shall be 66 feet.
      (4)   Minimum front yard depth. The front yard requirements for the Town
Center Residential Overlay District shall be equal to the existing front yard
of the structure. In the case of new construction, the front yard setback shall
not be less than the average front yard setback of the lots which are within
180 feet and within the same block face as the lot involved.
      (5)   Minimum side yard setback. The side yard requirements for the Town
Center Residential Overlay District shall be 10 feet on each side or the
existing side yard of the structure, whichever is less.
      (6)   Minimum rear yard depth. The rear yard setback requirements for the
Town Center Residential Overlay District shall be 40 feet or the existing rear
yard of the structure, whichever is less.
      (7)   Maximum building height. Maximum building height shall be two and
one-half stories or 35 feet. Refer to Section

shall be retained. Any proposed change to the exterior of the structure which
requires a building permit shall be reviewed and approved by the Zoning
Administrator. Any proposed changes which change the architectural style of the
building shall also be reviewed by the Planning Commission, which may reverse
or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the Zoning Administrator's
recommendations. These provisions shall apply to both principal and accessory
structures.
      (10)   Existing nonresidential structures. Proposed changes to existing
nonresidential facades which require a building permit shall be in keeping with
the architectural character of the neighborhood and shall be reviewed and
approved by the Zoning Administrator. Any proposed changes which change the
architectural style of the building shall also be reviewed by the Planning
Commission, which may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the
Zoning Administrator's recommendations. These provisions shall apply to both
principal and accessory structures.
      (11)   New construction. The architectural style of proposed new
principal and accessory structures shall be in keeping with the architectural
character of the neighborhood and shall be reviewed and approved as part of the
required review process.

1286.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the continuance of
lawful uses of land or structures which do not conform with the provisions of
this Zoning Code and existed before the effective date of an amendment to this
Zoning Code.
   (b)   Such nonconformities are regulated as Class I or Class II
nonconformities and are permitted to continue under the regulations established
in this chapter.
(Ord. 2002-4. Passed 6-10-02.)
1286.02 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
      (1)   "Abandonment" or "discontinuance of a nonconforming use" means the
cessation for use for six consecutive months or for 18 months during a three
year period. Abandonment or discontinuance shall be measured by the following
documentation provided to the Village Zoning Administrator by the property
owner, continuous utility connection, continuous marketing activity (rent and/
or sale), and proof of tenant occupancy.
      (2)   "Class I nonconforming use" means a desirable nonconforming use
determined by the Village Planning Commission based on criteria established in
the Zoning Ordinance which concludes that a low land use impact (low intensity
of use) exists between the nonconforming use and adjacent land uses and the
immediate area. Class I uses are considered permissive and are regulated by
Section
1286.05.
      (3)   "Class II nonconforming uses" means an undesirable nonconforming
use determined by the Village Planning Commission based on criteria established
in the Zoning Ordinance which concludes that a high land use impact (high
intensity of use) exists between the nonconforming use and adjacent land uses
in the immediate area. Class II uses are considered restrictive and are
regulated by Section
1286.06.
      (4)   "Intensity of use" means a measurement of land use impact which
utilizes specific, measurable characteristics which can reasonably be evaluated
by the Planning Commission to determine the effect on adjacent properties and/
or the immediate area. The characteristics of the existing nonconforming use
utilized to determine the intensity of use shall be, but are not limited to,
the following:
         A.   The number of existing off-street parking spaces and their
proximity to adjacent uses;
         B.   Existing outdoor storage;
         C.   Exterior lighting;
         D.   Hours of operation;
         E.   Existing noise, odor and vibration;
         F.   Existing landscaping, screening and buffering;
         G.   Existing front, side or rear yard setbacks;
         H.   The residential density of the existing use; and
         I.   The lot coverage of the existing use.
      (5)   "Nonconforming use" means a use of land and/or structure which is
legally in existence prior to the adoption or amendment of the ordinance which
made it nonconforming.
      (6)   "Permissive nonconforming use" means nonconforming uses determined
to be Class I uses by the Village Planning Commission which would allow one
nonconforming use to change to another nonconforming use, building or structure
as long as the change is equal to or less intense than the original use.
      (7)   "Restrictive nonconforming use" means nonconforming uses determined
to be Class II uses by the Village Planning Commission and which can only be
changed to conforming uses.
(Ord. 2002-4. Passed 6-10-02.)
1286.03 NONCONFORMING USE CLASSIFICATION PROCESS.
   The following process shall be utilized by the Village in the classification
of a nonconforming use:
   (a)   All nonconforming uses shall be considered a Class II use until
changed to a Class I use by the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Before the Planning Commission shall make a determination on a Class I
request, a completed application must be filed with the Village.
   (c)   The Planning Commission may require a public hearing for any
classification application.
   (d)   The Planning Commission shall utilize the criteria outlined in Section
1286.04 in making a determination on a nonconforming use classification.
   (e)   The Planning Commission may place reasonable conditions on a Class I
nonconforming use.
   (f)   Nonconforming uses determined to be Class I by the Planning Commission
shall file a final site plan with the Village which meets the requirements of
Section
1296.05 and contains any conditions imposed by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 2002-4. Passed 6-10-02.)
1286.04 EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING A NONCONFORMING USE CLASSIFICATION.
   The Planning Commission shall utilize the following criteria in determining
the classification of a nonconforming use:
   (a)   A completed application with fees.
   (b)   A recommendation from the Zoning Administrator based on a review of
the intensity of use characteristics.
   (c)   The impact of the existing nonconforming use on adjacent properties
and the immediate area.
   (d)   Any additional data from the applicant that the Planning Commission
requires to evaluate the intensity of use at the applicant's expense.
   (e)   The intent of the Master Plan in the immediate area.
   (f)   The purpose and intent of the existing zoning districts which abut the
nonconforming use.
(Ord. 2002-4. Passed 6-10-02; Ord. 2009-7. Passed 12-14-09.)
1286.05 CLASS I NONCONFORMING USE REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Class I nonconforming uses may be enlarged or expanded if approved by
the Planning Commission through the Site Plan Review process as outlined in
Chapter 1296. The Planning Commission or Zoning Administrator may approve the
enlargement or expansion of a Class I nonconforming structure when the proposed
construction does not enlarge or expand the nonconforming aspect(s) of the
structure. In addition to the site plan review criteria, the Planning
Commission and the Zoning Administrator shall utilize the following additional
criteria in considering any enlargement or expansion:
      (1)   The expansion will not unreasonably extend the duration of the
nonconforming use and that the expansion takes place on the same parcel as the
existing use.
      (2)   The need for the expansion should not be created by an increase in
the intensity of use.
      (3)   The expansion will not lead to requests for similar expansions in
the immediate area.
      (4)   The expansion will not have a negative effect on adjacent
properties.
      (5)   The expansion will not require additional off-street parking.
   (b)   Class I nonconforming uses may be substituted with another
nonconforming use provided that the new use is equal to or less intense than
the existing nonconforming use. The Planning Commission may approve a
substitution based on a written request from the property owner and a
determination regarding the level of intensity.
(Ord. 2002-4. Passed 6-10-02.)
1286.06 CLASS II NONCONFORMING USE REGULATIONS.
   Class II nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged or expanded except in
conformance with the Zoning Code. Class II nonconforming uses shall not be
substituted.
(Ord. 2002-4. .Passed 6-10-02.)
1286.07 NONCONFORMING LOT OF RECORD.
   A lot of record is a parcel that is legally recorded in the Register of
Deeds Office. A nonconforming lot of record is a parcel which does not meet the
existing dimensional requirements of the Zoning Code and is recorded in the
Register of Deeds Office. Nonconforming lots of record may be used if they meet
the average of the front, side and rear yard setbacks within 200 feet of either
side of the subject property on the same side of the street. The Board of
Zoning Appeals may reduce the average front, side or rear yard setbacks which
have been established for a nonconforming lot of record.
(Ord. 2002-4. Passed 6-10-0-2.)
1286.08 REPAIR OF NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS.
   Nonconforming buildings may be repaired to correct deterioration,
obsolescence, depreciation and wear, provided that such repair does not result
in the enlargement of the structure or an increase in the intensity of use.
(Ord. 2002-4. Passed 6-10-02.)
1286.09 RECONSTRUCTION OF NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS.
   Any nonconforming structure damaged by fire, explosion, flood, or other
causes may be restored, rebuilt or repaired, provided that such reconstruction
does not exceed 50 percent of the fair market value which existed prior to
damage and provided that it does not increase the intensity of use on the
property. If damage is greater than 50 percent, the reconstruction may be
permitted with the approval of the Board of Appeals.
(Ord. 2002-4. Passed 6-10-02.)
1286.10 DISCONTINUANCE OR ABANDONMENT.
   Whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued for six consecutive
months, or for 18 months during any three-year period, such discontinuance
shall be considered conclusive evidence of an intention to abandon the
nonconforming use. At the end of this period of abandonment, the nonconforming
use shall not be reestablished, and any future use shall be in conformity with
the provisions of the Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2002-4. Passed 6-10-02.)

satisfactory to each of the uses intended to be served, and when all
requirements for location, design and construction can be satisfied.

total space requirement is the sum of the individual requirements that will
occur at the same time. If space requirements for individual uses occur at
distinctly different times, the total of such off-street parking facilities
required for joint or collective use may be reduced below the sum total of the
individual space requirements.
   (b)   Record of Agreement. A copy of an agreement between joint users shall
be filed with the application for a building permit and recorded with the
Register of Deeds of Eaton County. The agreement shall include a guarantee for
continued use of the parking facility for each party to the joint use.

1288.11 SITE DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   All off-street parking areas shall be designed, constructed and maintained
in accordance with the following standards and requirements:
   (a)   A minimum area of 180 square feet shall be provided for each vehicle
parking space. Each space shall be definitely designated and reserved for
parking purposes, exclusive of space requirements for adequate ingress and

orderly and safe movement and storage of vehicles.
   (c)   Adequate ingress and egress to the parking area by means of clearly
limited and defined drives shall be provided.
      (1)   Except for parking space provided on single-family and two-family
residential lots, drives for ingress and egress to the parking area shall be
not less than 20 feet wide and so located as to secure the most appropriate
development of the individual property.
      (2)   Each entrance to and exit from any off-street parking area shall be
at least 25 feet from any adjacent lot within a Residential District.
   (d)   Each vehicular parking space within an off-street parking area shall
be provided adequate access by means of maneuvering lanes. Backing directly
onto a street shall be prohibited.

reflect light away from any residential property adjacent to the parking area.
   (g)   Where a parking area with a capacity of more than five vehicles abuts
a residential district or public right of way in a Residential District, a
buffer strip at least 10 feet wide shall be provided between the parking area
and the adjoining property, and a vertical screen shall be erected consisting
of structural or plant materials no less than four feet in height and spaced so
as to effectively screen the parking area from the residential area.
   (h)   Parking areas will have to conform to front yard setback requirements
and shall be no closer to any principal building than five feet.
   (i)   Each off-street parking area that serves a building, except single and

1290.01 PURPOSE.
   This chapter, together with previous references in other chapters of this
Zoning Code, designates specific uses that require a special use permit and, in
addition, specifies the procedures and standards which must be met before such
a permit can be issued.
(Ord. 2001-7. Passed 11-12-01.)
1290.02 PERMIT PROCEDURES.
   An application for a special use permit for any land or structure use
permitted under this chapter shall be submitted and processed, along with an
application for site plan review, under the following procedures:
   (a)   Submission of Application. An application for a special use permit
shall also require site plan approval according to Section
1296.03. Any application shall be submitted through the Zoning Administrator on
a special form for that purpose. Each application shall be accompanied by the
payment of a fee as established by Council to cover costs of processing the
application.
   (b)   Data Required. Every application shall be accompanied by the following
information and data:
      (1)   The application form for a special use permit supplied by the
Zoning Administrator, filled out in full by the applicant, including a
statement of supporting evidence concerning the required findings specified in
Section
1290.03;
      (2)   A complete application for Site Plan Review, including site plan,
as required in Sections
1296.05; and
      (3)   Preliminary plans and specifications of the proposed development
and for all construction.
   (c)   Planning Commission Review and Hearing. Upon receipt of the
application, the Planning Commission shall review the application at its next
regular meeting following filing and shall set a date for public hearing within
45 days thereafter. The Village Clerk shall provide notice of the hearing in
accordance with the Zoning Act as described in Section
1264.04(a). Upon the conclusion of such hearing procedures, the Commission
shall transmit a written recommendation within 60 days to Council, setting
forth the reasons for the acceptance, denial or modification of the special use
permit application.
   (d)   Council Action. Upon receipt of the Commission's recommendation,
Council shall consider the special use permit application at its next regular
meeting. Council shall approve or disapprove the recommendations of the
Commission. Only upon the approval of Council may a special use permit be
issued by the Zoning Administrator.
   (e)   Issuance of Special Use Permits. A special use permit shall be issued
in writing, specifying all conditions of approval, the specific requirements
and a copy of the site plan stamped “Approved” and signed by the Zoning
Administrator.
   (f)   Duration of a Special Use Permit. A special use permit shall be valid
as long as the permitted use continues in accordance with the conditions,
requirements and site plan included in said permit, unless otherwise stated in
the SUP. Provided, however, that an applicant must have all exterior work
completed within one year from the date of issuance of said permit. Approval of
a SUP shall be valid regardless of change of ownership, provided that all terms
and conditions of the permit are met by the subsequent owner.
   (g)   Revocation by Council. Council shall have the authority to revoke any
special use permit after it has been proved that the holder of the permit has
failed to comply with any of the applicable requirements in this chapter. After
a revocation notice has been given, the use for which the permit was granted
must cease within 60 days.
   (h)   Reapplication. No application for a special use permit which has been
denied wholly or in part by Council shall be resubmitted until the expiration
of one year or more from the date of such denial, except on the grounds of
newly discovered evidence or proof of changed conditions.
   (i)   Transfer of Special Use Permit. In order to insure continued
compliance with the terms of this chapter and a special use permit issued under
it, each SUP shall specify reasonable terms for transfer of a valid SUP from
the present landowner or operator to a subsequent owner or operator. The
responsibility for said transfer in accordance with the terms of the SUP shall
be that of the permit holder of record with the Village. Failure of a SUP
holder to properly transfer a SUP shall not release the permit holder of record
from ordinance penalties for any subsequent action undertaken on the land in
violation of the terms of the SUP. Transfer of a SUP shall be made on a form
supplied by the Village for that purpose. Proper completion of the form shall
require documentation of assumption by the new owner of an interest in the
land/operation in question and a written agreement that the new owner/operator
will assume obligations and responsibilities specified in the SUP, including
deposit of a bond or other performance guarantee when so required by the SUP.
When such transfer has been properly completed and any bond or other
performance guarantee deposited properly with the Village by the new permit
holder, any bond or performance guarantee on deposit with the Village by the
previous permit holder shall be returned in accordance with the terms of this
chapter.
   (j)   Bonding. The Planning Commission may require that a bond be furnished
to insure compliance with conditions imposed with the granting of a SUP. The
amount and type of bond shall be determined by the Planning Commission. The
bond shall be reasonable, appropriate and commensurate with the scope of the
project. The amount of the bond shall be reduced at a rate equal to the percent
of work completed on the required improvements as work progresses. The term
“improvements” should not be construed to mean the project itself, but rather
those features associated with the project which are deemed necessary to
protect the health, safety and welfare of the Village residents, resources,
environment, and future users or inhabitants of the proposed project.
   (k)   Appeal of Decisions. A person aggrieved by the decision of the
Planning Commission may have that decision reviewed by the Board of Appeals;
provided the petition for appeal is filed with the Village Manager within 15
days of the Planning Commission decision.
(Ord. 2001-7. Passed 11-12-01; Ord. 2009-5. Passed 11-9-09.)
1290.03 BASIS FOR DETERMINATIONS.
   Before making a recommendation on a special use permit application, the
Planning Commission shall establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the
following general standards, as well as the specific standards outlined in each
applicable section of this chapter, shall be satisfied:
   (a)   General Standards. The Commission shall review each application for
the purpose of determining that each proposed use meets the following standards
and, in addition, shall find adequate evidence that each use on its proposed
location will:
      (1)   Be harmonious with and in accordance with the general principles
and proposals of the Master Plan of the Village;
      (2)   Be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and so that such a use will not change the
essential character of the area in which it is proposed.
      (3)   Not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future uses in the
same general vicinity, and will be a substantial improvement to property in the
immediate vicinity and to the community as a whole.
      (4)   Be served adequately by essential public facilities and services,
such as highways, streets, police, fire protection, drainage structures, refuse
disposal, water and sewage facilities, or schools.
      (5)   Not involve uses, activities, processes, materials and equipment or
conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any person, property or
general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke,
fumes, glare or odors.
      (6)   Be consistent with the intent and purposes of the zoning district
in which it is proposed to locate such use.
   (b)   Conditions and Safeguards. The Commission may impose such additional
conditions and safeguards deemed necessary for the general welfare, the
protection of individual property rights and for insuring that the intent and
objectives of this Zoning Code will be observed. The breach of any condition,
safeguard or requirement shall automatically invalidate the permit granted.
   (c)   Specific Requirements. The general standards and requirements of this
section are basic to all uses authorized by special use permit. In addition,
there may be specific, applicable requirements set forth in the zoning district
provisions and/or in
Chapter 1294, Supplementary Regulations.
(Ord. 2001-7. Passed 11-12-01; Ord. 2009-5. Passed 11-9-09.)
1290.04 AMENDMENTS.
   Amendments to an approved site plan shall be made according to the
provisions of Section
1296.11. No change may be made to an existing special use permit except through
reapplication, according to the procedures of Section
1290.02.

1292.01 INTENT.
   The intent of this chapter is to provide an optional method for residential
land development which allows for flexibility in the application of the
standards governing the types of residential structures permitted and their
placement on the property. A Planned Unit Development will provide for the
development of residential land as an integral unit which incorporates within a
single plan the location and arrangement of all buildings, drives, parking
areas, utilities, landscaping and any other improvements or changes within the

1296.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to require site plan review approval for
certain building structures and uses that can be expected to have a significant
impact on natural resources, traffic patterns, adjacent land uses, and the
character of future development in the area.
   The requirements contained in this chapter are intended to reduce the
hazards to life and property due to fire, flooding, soil erosion, poor surface
water drainage, inadequate sewage disposal systems, pollution, dust, fumes,
noise vibrations, noxious odors and other hazards; to promote and facilitate
the adequate provision of a system of roads, streets and parking, sewage
