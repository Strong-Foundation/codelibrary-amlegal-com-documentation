§ 110.01  FINDINGS.
   (A)   The township hereby adopts and incorporates herein its findings and
record related to the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment
businesses, as detailed herein.
   (B)   (1)   The Township Board also relies upon findings concerning
secondary effects contained in additional reports, as well as in further
judicial opinions, including those upholding regulations of nudity and the
time, place and manner of operation of adult entertainment businesses in
finding that:
         (a)   Adult entertainment businesses, as a category of commercial
uses, are often associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects
including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution,
potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, illicit drug use and
drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight,
litter and sexual assault and exploitation; and
         (b)   Illegal and unsanitary acts involving nudity, including lewd
conduct, masturbation, oral and anal sex, occur at unregulated adult
entertainment businesses, including those businesses which provide private or
semi-private rooms, booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live
performances.
      (2)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm
which the township has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or
abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects,
which is the township’s rationale for this chapter, exists independent of any
comparative analysis between adult entertainment businesses and non-sexually
oriented businesses. Additionally, the township’s interest in regulating adult
entertainment businesses extends to prevent future secondary effects of either
current or future adult entertainment businesses that may locate in the
township. The township finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this
chapter are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
(Prior Code, Ch. XXXV, § 1)  (Ord. 2011-8, passed 5-9-2011)
§ 110.02  DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   The terms in this chapter shall have the meanings ascribed to them in

   The Township Board finds and declares that the interests of the public
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the township require the
regulation, licensing and control of assemblies of large numbers of people in
excess of those normally drawing on the health, sanitation, fire, police,
ambulance service, transportation, utility and other public services regularly
provided in the township.
(Prior Code, Ch. XXXVI, § 1)  (Ord. 1-2014, passed 6-23-2014)

§ 151.01  NATURE; PURPOSE AND EFFECT; RATIONALE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide definitions, standards and
procedures for the regulation of earth-changing activities (e.g., mining
excavation and the like) in the township, in accordance with the provisions of
the Township Rural Zoning Act, Public Act 184 of 1943, being M.C.L.A. §§
125.271 through 125.301, as amended. The intent of this chapter is to
discourage undesirable land uses which create unsafe or nuisance conditions or
destroy the utility of site and adjoining land. This chapter provides for the
issuance of permits, the imposition of conditions on the performance of such
activities and penalties for the violation of standards and permit conditions.
Owners and occupants of property in or adjoining Agricultural and R-1 Zoning
Districts will be affected, principally.
   (B)   (1)   Mining-related activities are currently allowed without any
regulation in the Agricultural and R-1 Zoning Districts. Such activities are
beneficial in most circumstances; provided that, they do not create the
undesirable conditions referred to above.
      (2)   Some property owners of Hopkins and nearby townships have been
negatively affected by earth-changing activities recently. Some areas of the
township adjoining lakes and residential area are especially vulnerable to
environmental damage. The township has suffered a diminution of property value
and tax revenue in one such instance and desires to avoid any recurrence of
that experience.
(Prior Code, Ch. XXIV)  (Ord. 1992-3, passed - -; Ord. 2001-1, passed 7-17-
2001)

which is the subject of a building permit.
      (6)   No earth-changing activity shall be conducted in such a manner as
to create a substantial risk of endangering the public health and safety.

time by the Zoning Inspector who shall enforce this chapter and make all
initial determinations related to the enforcement, applicability and
interpretation of this chapter, the assessment of fees and charges, the terms

   (D)   Any aggrieved party may appeal from any determination of the Zoning
Inspector by making a request (in writing within ten days of receipt of a
written determination) for a hearing before the Board of Appeals. Such hearings
shall be conducted in the same manner as hearings on a zoning variance; except
that, it shall be satisfactory to notify adjoining property owners, permit
holders and site owners by telephone, posting on the site or by first class
mail to their last known addresses no less than 24 hours prior to such hearing.
   (E)   Earth-changing permits may be issued subject to conditions imposed to
prevent unduly hazardous conditions, to protect the public health, safety and
welfare and to curtail the imposition of indirect costs associated with the
activity upon the township, including, but not limited to, conditions that
require the following:
      (1)   The restoration of the site at project completion (or of parts of
the site where partial completion has occurred and the project is in operation
more than 60 calendar days after permit issuance) to an elevation compatible
with the surrounding area and suitable for subsequent development and the
support of ground cover, including reforestation. Slopes restored to a
relationship of three feet of run to one foot of rise shall be deemed
satisfactory;
      (2)   The placement of fencing around the site for the purpose of
preventing a dangerous, visibly blighted or unattractive nuisance condition;
      (3)   The payment of fees to defer additional costs associated with the
application of adequate dust control and unscheduled or accelerated
maintenance, cleaning and repair to public streets traveled in connection with
the activity;
      (4)   The exclusive use of designated routes on public streets for
ingress and egress to the site at designated times;
      (5)   The grading of the site at all times to avoid interference with
surface water drainage affecting adjoining properties;
      (6)   The stockpiling on site of sufficient topsoil and/or overburden to
restore the site at partial completion and before abandonment;
      (7)   The hard-topping, with concrete, bituminous substance, chemical
treatment or other means, of those portions of any street adjoining the site
and within 300 feet of a dwelling;
      (8)   The filing of a bond, performance security, cash or other secured
undertaking, satisfactory to the Township Supervisor or Attorney, to ensure the
faithful, lawful and complete performance of and compliance with all standards,
restrictions and conditions of the permit. The amount of the bond shall reflect
the scale of the activities, the prevailing cost to cure or rehabilitate the
property, court costs, attorney fees and the salaries and expenses of
regulatory personnel; and
      (9)   The indemnification of the township, its agents and employees, from
any loss, damage, expense or liability to any person or property arising
directly or indirectly from the earth-changing activity, supported by a
certificate of an indemnity company licensed to do business in the state.

§ 152.01  PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to establish general guidelines for the
setting of wireless communications towers and antennas.
   (B)   The goals of this chapter are to:
      (1)   Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impacts of towers and antennas;
      (2)   Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas;
      (3)   Minimize the total number of towers throughout the township;
      (4)   Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as
a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers;
      (5)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them to the extent
possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the township is minimal;
      (6)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way
that minimizes their adverse visual impact through careful design, siting,
landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques;
      (7)   Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services
to provide such services to the township quickly, effectively and efficiently;
      (8)   Consider public health and safety of the township and its
residents; and
      (9)   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through engineering and careful siting of tower structures.
   (C)   In furtherance of these goals, the township shall give due
consideration to its Master Land Use Plan, zoning map, existing land uses and
environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites for the location of towers
and antennas.
(Prior Code, Ch. XXI, § 21.000)  (Ord. 2000-4, passed 8-29-2000)
§ 152.02  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ALTERNATIVE TOWER STRUCTURE. Human-made truss, clock towers, bell steeples,
light poles and similar alternative-design mounting structures that camouflage
or conceal the presence of antennas or towers.
   ANTENNA. Any exterior transmitting or receiving device mounted on a tower,
building or structure and used in communications that radiate or capture
electromagnetic waves, digital signals, analog signals, radio frequencies
(excluding radar signals), wireless communications signals or other
communication signals.
   BACKHAUL NETWORK. The lines that connect the provider’s towers/cell sites to
one or more cellular telephone switching offices and/or long distance providers
or the public switched telephone network.
   CO-LOCATION. The use of a common structure, tower or building by two or more
wireless communications providers at a single location, with the view toward
reducing the number of overall structures required in the township.
   FAA. The Federal Aviation Administration.
   FCC. The Federal Communications Commission.
   HEIGHT. When referring to a tower or other building or structure upon which
an antenna is mounted, the distance measured from the finished grade of the
parcel at the center of the front of the building or structure to the highest
point on the tower or other building or structure, including the base pad and
any antenna.
   LATTICE TOWER. A support structure constructed of vertical metal struts and
cross-braces, forming a triangular or square structure which often tapers from
the foundation to the top.
   PRE-EXISTING TOWERS and PRE-EXISTING ANTENNAS. Any tower or antenna for
which a building permit or special use permit has been properly issued prior to
the effective date of the amendment adding these sections, or any tower or
antenna for which no building and/or special use permit was required, including
permitted towers or antennas that have not yet been constructed so long as such
approval is current and not expired.
   TOWER. Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the
purpose of supporting one or more antennas for telephone, radio and similar
communication purposes, including self-supporting (i.e., without guy wires or
other external means of support) lattice towers or monopole towers. The term
includes radio and television transmission towers, micro-wave towers, common-
carrier towers, cellular telephone towers, alternative tower structures and the
like. The term includes the structure and support thereto.
   WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY. Includes all structures noted in the
definition of “tower” above and all accessory equipment and buildings relating
to the transmission and reception of radio signals.
(Prior Code, Ch. XXI, § 21.001)  (Ord. 2000-4, passed 8-29-2000)
§ 152.03  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered
either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use of an existing
building or structure on the same lot shall not prelude the installation of an
antenna or tower on such lot.
   (B)   Lot size. The lot on which the tower is located is not required to
have public or private road frontage, but can be accessed by means of a 20-foot
easement and must have at least a one to one ratio of tower height to ensure
fall zone to adjacent properties.
   (C)   Easement for ingress and egress. A minimum 20-foot wide easement is
required where permitted.
   (D)   Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or
tower shall provide to the Zoning Administrator an inventory of its existing
towers, antennas or sites approved for towers or antennas, that are either
within the jurisdiction of the township or within one mile of the border
thereof, including specific information about the location, height and design
of each tower or antenna. The Zoning Administrator may share such information
with other applicants applying for permits under this chapter or other
organizations seeking to locate towers or antennas within the jurisdiction to
the township; provided, however, that, the Zoning Administrator is not, by
sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites
are available or suitable.
   (E)   Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following requirements.
      (1)   Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject
to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to
reduce visual obtrusiveness.
      (2)   At the tower site, the design of the buildings and related
structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures,
screening and landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting and
surrounding building.
      (3)   If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral
color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the
supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
   (E)   Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by
the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting
alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the
surrounding views. The light at the top of the tower must flash red from dusk
until dawn.
   (F)   State or federal requirements. All towers and antennas must meet or
exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other
agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers
and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of
the tower and antennas governed by this chapter shall, to the extent required
by the FAA or the FCC, bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such
revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of
such standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is
mandated by the controlling state of federal agency. Failure to bring towers
and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall
constitute grounds for the township to seek a court order, authorizing the
township or its designee to remove the tower or antenna at the owner’s expense.
   (G)   Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity
of towers and antennas, the owner of a tower or antenna shall ensure that it is
maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local
building codes and the applicable standards for towers and antennas that are
published by the Electronics Industries Association, or any similar successor
organization, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the township
believes that a tower or antenna fails to comply with such codes and standards
and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then the township may proceed
under applicable state law (i.e., Public Act 144 of 1992, being M.C.L.A. §§
125.539 through 125.542, as amended, or any successor statute) or common law to
bring the tower or antenna into compliance or to remove the tower or antenna at
the owner’s expense.
   (H)   Not essential services. Towers and antennas shall be regulated and
permitted pursuant to this chapter and shall not be regulated or permitted as
essential services, public utilities or private utilities.
   (I)   Franchises. Owners and/or operators of towers or antennas shall
certify that all franchises required by law for the construction an/or
operation of a wireless communication system in the township have been obtained
and shall file a copy of all required franchises with the Zoning Administrator.
   (J)   Public notice. For purposes of this chapter, any special use request,
variance request or appeal shall require public notice to all abutting property
owners and all properties that are located with corresponding separation
distance listed, in addition to any notice otherwise required by this chapter
and the Zoning Act, being M.C.L.A. §§ 125.3101 et seq.
   (K)   Signs. No signs or advertising shall be allowed on an antenna, tower
or facility, except for a required informational sign listing parties
responsible for activities on the site.
   (L)   Buildings and support equipment. Accessory buildings shall not be
greater than 144 square feet and no more than ten feet in height.
   (M)   Multiple antenna/tower plan. The township encourages the users of
towers and antennas to submit a single application for approval of as many
towers and/or antenna sites as the user deems necessary to provide coverage for
the particular use throughout the township. Applications for approval of
multiple sites shall be given priority in the review process over applications
for approval of single sites.
   (N)   Metal towers. Metal towers shall be constructed with a corrosion-
resistant material or coating.
   (O)   No interference. Towers and antennas shall not interfere with
television or radio reception on surrounding properties.
   (P)   Paving requirements. Parking and drive areas are not required to be
paved. However, accessibility to the site must be maintained at all times in
case of emergency.

(Prior Code, Ch. XXI, § 21.004)  (Ord. 2000-4, passed 8-29-2000)
§ 152.06  FACTORS CONSIDERED IN GRANTING SPECIAL PERMITS FOR TOWERS OR
ANTENNAS.
   In addition to any other standards specified in this chapter for considering
special use permit applications, the Planning Commission shall consider the
following factors in determining whether to issue a special use permit under
this chapter:
   (A)   Check Master Plan for future development of proposed area;
   (B)   Height of the proposed tower or antenna;
   (C)   Proximity of the tower or antenna to residential structures and
residential district boundaries;
   (D)   Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
   (E)   Surrounding topography;
   (F)   Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
   (G)   Design of the tower or antenna, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness;
   (H)   Proposed ingress and egress; and
   (I)   Availability of suitable existing towers or antennas, other structures
or alternative technologies not requiring the use towers or antennas, as
discussed in the following section.
(Prior Code, Ch. XXI, § 21.005)  (Ord. 2000-4, passed 8-29-2000)
§ 152.07  AVAILABILITY OF SUITABLE EXISTING TOWERS, ANTENNAS OR OTHER
STRUCTURES OR ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGY.
   (A)   No new tower or antenna shall be permitted unless the applicant
demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Planning Commission that no
existing tower, antenna structure or alternative technology can accommodate the
applicant without the erection of the applicant’s requested new tower or
antenna. An applicant shall submit information requested by the Planning
Commission related to the availability of suitable existing towers, antennas or
other structures or alternative technology.
   (B)   Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower, antenna,
structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant’s proposed
antenna may consist of any of the following.
      (1)   No existing towers, antennas or other structures are located within
the geographical area which meet the applicant’s engineering requirements.
      (2)   Existing towers, antennas or other structures are not of sufficient
height to meet the applicant’s engineering requirements.
      (3)   Existing towers or other structures do not have sufficient strength
to support the applicant’s proposed antenna and related equipment.
      (4)   The applicant’s proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the
antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant’s proposed antenna.
      (5)   The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner in
order to share an existing tower, antenna or other structure or to adapt an
existing tower, antenna or other structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs
exceeding the new tower or antenna development are presumed to be unreasonable.
      (6)   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors
that render existing towers, antennas and other structures unsuitable.
      (7)   The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does
not require the use of towers, antennas or other structures, such as cable
micro-cell network using multiple tow-powered transmitters/receivers attached
to a wire-line system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that
exceed new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the
technology unsuitable.
(Prior Code, Ch. XXI, § 21.006)  (Ord. 2000-4, passed 8-29-2000)
§ 152.08  SETBACKS.
   The following setback requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas
for which a special use permit is required.
   (A)   Towers must be set back a distance equal to at least 100% of the
height of the tower from any adjoining lot line. The setback is measured from
the perimeter or outside edge of the base of the tower.
   (B)   Accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum setback requirements for
the applicable zoning district in which it is located.
   (C)   Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in
height. The towers shall also be equipped with appropriate anti-climbing
devices.
   (D)   (1)   Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as
towers sited on large wooded lots, the Planning Commission may conclude that
natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer.
      (2)   The required landscaping shall be maintained for the duration of
the special use permit.
   (E)   In order to facilitate removal of abandoned antennas or towers, the
applicant shall post security in one of the following forms at the election of
the applicant cash; surety bond; letter of credit; or an agreement in a form
approved by the attorney for the township and recorded at the office of the
Register of Deeds, establishing a promise of the applicant and owner of the
property to remove the facility in a timely manner as required herein, with the
further provision that the applicant and owner shall be responsible for the
payment of any costs and attorney fees incurred by the township in securing
removal.

§ 154.01  DECLARATION OF PURPOSE.
   (A)   Economic importance of agricultural land. Agricultural land situated
in the township is a valued and economically important resource which provides
the essential and irreplaceable basis for production of diary products,
livestock, hay, grains, vegetables, fruit, nursery plants and greenhouse crops.
Climate, topography, soil composition and accessibility make agricultural land
in the township ideally suited for production, processing and distribution of
agricultural products locally, regionally, nationally and internationally.
Agricultural land in the township also supports a broad range of
agriculturally-dependant businesses such as farm machinery sales and
maintenance, sale of farm supplies and fuel, services of veterinarians, grain
dealers, transportation services and packaging plants, all of which contribute
significantly to local and regional economies.
   (B)   Importance of non-agricultural attributes of farmland. In addition to
its economic importance, agricultural land in the township enhances overall
quality of life for all township residents by providing scenic beauty,
preserving open space, maintaining rural character, promoting hunting and
recreational opportunities, preserving cultural heritage, as well as protecting
valued environmental benefits such as watershed quality and preservation of
wildlife habitat.
   (C)   Farmland loss results from development trends. The township is not
exempt from the pressures of ever-increasing population which necessarily
results in agricultural land lost to residential and commercial development.
   (D)   Impact of farmland loss. Land suitable for farming is a finite and
irreplaceable natural resource, the quality of which has been enhanced by the
labor of generations of farming families in the township. When such land is
lost to residential or other developed uses which do not require the special
characteristics inherent in agricultural land, quality of life in the township
is irreparably degraded. Further, non-farm development in agricultural areas
makes farming more difficult because it causes conflict concerning existing
farm practices, and increases the incidence of trespass, which in turn
heightens exposure to personal injury liability, and increases risk of property
damage. Because agricultural land is a crucial natural, aesthetic and economic
resource, the township must endeavor to ensure its continued existence, and
thereby to protect both the long-term viability of the business of agriculture
and the quality of life for all residents.
   (E)   State and local policies.
      (1)   It is the policy of the state and the township to protect and
preserve farmland. This policy is evidenced by such enactments as the
township’s Master Land Use Plan, the State Agricultural Preservation Fund, the
Conservation and Historic Preservation Easement Act, being M.C.LA. §§ 324.2140
through 324.2144, provisions of the township and county zoning acts, along with
other state and local statutes, ordinances and policies.
      (2)   However, these measures alone do not effectively provide adequate
long-term protection for farmland in the township from existing and impending
pressures of residential and commercial development.
   (F)   Value of development rights. The features of good farmland such as
perkable soils and open space views, are the same features sought for
residential home sites, which results in speculative purchase of farmland
without regard to existing agricultural zoning designations. Agricultural
investment is not sustainable when market value of farmland as potential
building sites exceeds its agricultural value.
   (G)   Purpose of the Program. It is the purpose of the Township Farmland
Preservation Program and this chapter to protect farmland in order to maintain
a long-term business environment for agriculture in the township, to preserve
the rural character and scenic attributes of the township, to enhance important
environmental benefits and to maintain the quality of life of township
residents.
   (H)   Mechanism to achieve purpose. Acquisition of development rights/
conservation easements on farmland and other eligible land through the Township
Farmland Preservation Program and this chapter is a public purpose of the
township. Acquisition of development rights by the township shall be
accomplished by entering into written agreements with landowners. Such written
agreements shall provide that any real property from which the township has
purchased or otherwise acquired development rights shall remain undeveloped and
available for agricultural use unless otherwise specifically provided for
herein.
   (I)   Intent of chapter. The intent of this chapter is to establish a
framework for the preservation of farmland and other eligible land. Mechanisms
such as funding and scale of the program are left to the discretion of the
Township Board.
(Prior Code, Ch. XXXI, § 1)  (Ord. passed 8-16-2004)

154.10 of this chapter.
   (J)   Upon mutual agreement to the terms of the purchase by the property
owner and the Township Agricultural Preservation Board, but not before approval
of the Township Board, a title search shall be conducted to establish that
there exist no hindrances or encumbrances on the applicant’s clear title to the
selected property affecting the ability of the applicant to sell or otherwise
convey associated development rights. Any question as to clear title shall be
resolved by the applicant to the satisfaction of the Township Board prior to
closing on the sale or conveyance and prior to creation of the required
agricultural conservation easement. Mutual agreement as to terms of the
purchase referenced above shall be in writing and shall be contingent upon the
applicant’s ability to convey clear title to development rights and upon

   (M)   Compliance with restrictions set forth in agricultural conservation
easements shall be monitored in accordance with procedures and guidelines
established by the Agricultural Preservation Board and strictly enforced by the
township.
(Prior Code, Ch. XXXI, § 7)  (Ord. passed 8-16-2004)
§ 154.08  AGRICULTURAL CONSERVATION EASEMENT PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Simultaneously with any conveyance of development rights under this
chapter, an agricultural conservation easement, as drafted by the Township
Board, shall be properly executed by any individual or entity having an
interest in the subject property and recorded at the County Register of Deeds’
office. It is the intent of this chapter that any easement so created shall
perpetually protect the parcel’s farmland and other eligible land by strictly
precluding any activity which could impair or interfere with agricultural use
of the farmland or impact the natural qualities of any other eligible land.
Agricultural conservation easements created under this chapter shall run with
the land and shall not be terminated, except as provided for expressly in this
chapter or in any easement so created.
   (B)   Restrictions on that portion of the property included in agricultural
conservation easements shall include, but not be limited to:
      (1)   Property shall not be divided into parcels less than 40 acres in
size;
      (2)   Construction of residences for new owners of any divisions shall be
prohibited;
      (3)   Construction of any other buildings, unless intended for uses
consistent with typical farming operations in the township, are prohibited;
      (4)   Commercial or industrial activity inconsistent with typical farming
operations in the township, shall be prohibited; and
      (5)   Excavation of topsoil, sand, gravel, rock, minerals or other
materials which would impair or interfere with the agricultural values of the
property or which would impair the natural values of other eligible land shall
not be permitted without the prior approval of the Township Board or its
designee.
   (C)   Permitted uses and development rights retained by the landowner in the
land subject to the agricultural conservation easement shall include, but not
be limited to, the following:
      (1)   Construction of buildings necessary for and consistent with
agricultural uses;
      (2)   The right to construct one additional residence for an individual
essential to the farm operation as defined in § 36110(5) of the Natural
Resources and Environmental Protection Act, being M.C.L.A. § 324.36110(5). Such
structures must be built in conformity with all applicable federal, state and
local laws, ordinances and regulations;
      (3)   The right to maintain, renovate, add on to or replace existing
structures. Such maintenance, renovations, additions and replacement structures
must be in conformity with all applicable federal, state and local laws,
ordinances and regulations; and
      (4)   The right to sell, mortgage, bequeath or donate the property;
provided that, any such conveyance, encumbrance, devise or donation is made
subject to the terms and restrictions set forth in the agricultural
conservation easement.
(Prior Code, Ch. XXXI, § 8)  (Ord. passed 8-16-2004)
§ 154.09  DURATION OF AGRICULTURAL CONSERVATION EASEMENTS.
   (A)   It is the intent of this chapter to preserve farmland through the
establishment of permanent conservation easements. Therefore, agricultural
conservation easements created pursuant to this chapter shall run with the land
without regard to subsequent transfers of ownership in associated property.
Development rights acquired pursuant to this chapter shall be held by the
township in perpetuity, the single exception being when a court of competent
jurisdiction has made the determination based on the doctrine of eminent
domain, that the use of such development rights is necessary for a specific
public interest, need or purpose.
   (B)   Based upon the determination of eminent domain by a court of competent
jurisdiction that development rights held by the township must be purchased to
serve a specific public interest, need or purpose, the township shall be paid
either by the party or parties exercising eminent domain over such development
rights or by the landowner. The purchaser shall pay to the township the current
fair market value of the development rights at the time of the condemnation.
Fair market value shall be calculated at the time of termination, either by a
state-certified appraiser or by utilization of the points based appraisal set
forth in §
154.10 of this chapter. If an appraiser selected can discern any actual or
potential conflict of interest arising from his or her performance of an
assigned appraisal, the appraiser shall, before undertaking work on the
appraisal, disclose such actual or potential conflict of interest to the
Township Board. In the event of an actual conflict of interest or an
unacceptable potential conflict of interest, the Township Board shall select a
different appraiser. A determination of the appropriate fair market value shall
be made prior to termination of the applicable agricultural conservation
easement. The value of the development rights shall be calculated as the
difference between the current fair market value of the property which includes
the value of its development rights and the current fair market value of the
property based on its agricultural use under the existing agricultural
conservation easement.
   (C)   The township shall deposit the proceeds from any development rights
repurchase(s) made pursuant to the doctrine of eminent domain into the Farmland
Preservation Fund, the proceeds of which shall be used to purchase additional
development rights/agricultural conservation easements on additional farmland
and other eligible land in the township.
(Prior Code, Ch. XXXI, § 9)  (Ord. passed 8-16-2004)
§ 154.10  DETERMINING THE VALUE OF DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS/AGRICULTURAL CONSERVATION
EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Prior to each application cycle, the Township Agricultural
Preservation Board shall select which method it will utilize to determine the
value of development rights/agricultural conservation easements. The
Preservation Board shall utilize either the points-based appraisal method as
set forth in Public Act 262 of 2000, being M.C.L.A. §§ 324.36201 et seq., or
state certified appraisals. State certified appraisals shall calculate the
value of development rights/agricultural conservation easements as the
difference between the fair market value of properties with development rights
intact and the value of properties for agricultural use with agricultural
conservation easements in place. The Township Agricultural Preservation Board
shall establish guidelines, consistent with state standards, for state
certified appraisals. The appraisal formula shall establish a base value
according to the parcel’s size, soil characteristics and proximity to other
protected farmland. The base value shall be increased if any parcel qualifies
for a market value adjustment based on its location in the township and length
of road frontage. In determining a market value adjustment, an average of
actual vacant land sales in the township of parcels over 20 acres zoned for
agricultural purposes during the prior three years shall be calculated. Parcels
may also qualify for a premium based on proximity to sewer and water as
determined by formula established by the Township Agricultural Preservation
Board. The Preservation Board shall review the points-based appraisal method at
the end of each application cycle and compare the value of development rights/
agricultural conservation easements with actual fair market sales in the
township.
   (B)   A property owner may obtain an independent appraisal of the value of
the development rights/agricultural conservation easement. Such independent
appraisal shall be conducted by a state certified appraiser, shall be at the
property owner’s sole expense and shall be completed within the time period set
by the Preservation Board. The appraisal shall calculate the value of the
property with development rights intact and the value of the property for
agricultural use with an agricultural conservation easement in place. Methods
utilized by independent appraisals shall be consistent with those established
in division (A) above.
   (C)   Subject to approval by the Township Board, the Agricultural
Preservation Board shall set the purchase price for the development rights/
agricultural conservation easement. If the property owner obtains an
independent appraisal reflecting a different price, it is within the discretion
of the Agricultural Preservation Board to renegotiate terms.
   (D)   The property owner may be paid in one cash payment, by installment
payment or by a combination of both. Payment shall occur at the time of closing
with the landowner, and shall be made by check from the township to the
landowner or, in the alternative, shall be made as an installment purchase upon
agreement of the terms of the installment purchase between the landowner and
the township.
(Prior Code, Ch. XXXI, § 10)  (Ord. passed 8-16-2004)
§ 154.11  OPERATING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.
   (A)   The costs of services ordered by the Township Board for the Farmland
Preservation Program shall be paid from available Farmland Preservation Program
funding sources in the township as well as state and federal matching funds.
Such costs include, but are not limited to, expenses for appraising,
engineering, surveying, planning, financing, legal fees, conducting
environmental assessments, searching titles, developing baseline assessments
and monitoring compliance with easement restrictions. The township shall not be
responsible for any expenses incurred by property owners incidental to
applications for purchase of development rights/agricultural conservation
easements which the Township Agricultural Preservation Board has identified as
the responsibility of property owners such as title searches, appraisals and
land surveys.
   (B)   Division (A) above shall not preclude agreement by the township and
the landowner to share such costs as engineering and surveying as an outcome of
negotiation.
(Prior Code, Ch. XXXI, § 11)  (Ord. passed 8-16-2004)
§ 154.12  FARMLAND PRESERVATION FUND.
   (A)   Available funding for the Township Preservation Program shall be
deposited in a special Farmland Preservation Fund. Money in the Fund may be
temporarily deposited with institutions or invested in obligations which are
lawful for any other township deposit or investments. Revenue generated from
such deposits and/or investments shall be used solely for the purposes of
purchasing development rights/agricultural conservation easements, making
payments under installment purchase contracts, promoting farmland preservation
programs, paying costs of administering and enforcing the program or for any
other purpose consistent with the intent of this chapter.
   (B)   In the event that funds become available from private sources or from
state or federal agencies to pay a portion of the purchase price of development
rights/agricultural conservation easements or to enlarge such purchases, the
Agricultural Preservation Board is authorized by the Township Board to
recommend specific uses of such funds consistent with the intent of this
chapter.
   (C)   The Township Preservation Board, upon approval by the Township Board,
may finance the Township Farmland Preservation Program through one or more of
the following sources:
      (1)   General appropriations by the township;
      (2)   Proceeds from the sale of development rights by the township under
§
154.09 of this chapter;
      (3)   Grants;
      (4)   Donations;
      (5)   General Fund revenue;
      (6)   Bonds or notes as permitted by law;
      (7)   Special assessments as permitted by law; and/or
      (8)   Other sources approved by the Township Board and permitted by law.

tentatively approve and note its approval on the copy of the preliminary plat
to be returned to the subdivider or set forth in writing its reasons for
rejection and for tentative approval with conditions.
         (a)   The Township Board shall not review, approve or reject a
preliminary plat until it has received a report and recommendation from the
Planning Commission; provided, however, that, the Township Board can act
without a report and recommendation from the Planning Commission if the
Planning Commission does not issue such report and recommendation within 60
days.
         (b)   Tentative approval shall guarantee for a period of one year that
the general terms and conditions under which preliminary plat approval was
granted will not be changed by the township and, further, shall confer upon the
subdivider approval of lot sizes, lot orientation and street layout for a
period of one year from the date of tentative approval. Such tentative approval
may be extended if applied for by the subdivider and granted by the Township
Board in writing.
         (c)   Subsequent to tentative approval by the Township Board, the
subdivider shall submit copies of the preliminary plat, as necessary, to the

required fees.
      (7)   The Township Board, after receipt of the necessary agency approvals
of the preliminary plat, shall consider and review the preliminary plat at its
next meeting or within 20 days from the date of submission of the approved
copies and approve the preliminary plat if the subdivider has met all
conditions laid down for approval of the preliminary plat. The Township Clerk
shall promptly notify the subdivider of approval or rejection in writing and,
if rejected, will give the reasons.
         (a)   Approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of
the final plat, but rather that final plat approval shall be conditioned on all
requirements being met.
         (b)   Final approval of the preliminary plat by the Township Board
shall be for a period of two years from the date of its approval. The Township
Board may extend the two-year period if applied for and granted in writing, but
only concerning the township’s own requirements.
         (c)   No grading or tree removal or construction of improvements shall
be commenced until the proprietor has received final approval of the
preliminary plat by the township and has entered into the necessary agreements
with the township and other agencies for construction of all required

the township, county or other governmental unit concerning improvement or
maintenance of any such dedicated or reserved area.
(Prior Code, Ch. XXXIII, § 3.3)  (Ord. 2-2004, passed 8-9-2004)
DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 156.035  STREETS AND ROADS.
   The provisions of this chapter shall be the minimum township requirements
for streets, roads and intersections. In the event that any other public
agencies having jurisdiction shall adopt any statutes, ordinances, rules or
regulations imposing additional, different or more stringent requirements, the
terms of such statutes, ordinances, rules or regulations shall govern.
   (A)   Street location and arrangement. When a street or transportation plan
has been adopted, subdivision streets shall substantially conform to the
adopted plan.
   (B)   Minor street. Such streets shall be so arranged as to discourage their
use by through traffic.
   (C)   Street continuation and extension. The arrangement of streets shall
provide for the continuation of existing streets from adjoining areas into new
subdivisions.
   (D)   Stub streets. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the
arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall be extended to the boundary
line of the tract to make provision for the future projection of streets into
adjacent areas. Stub streets are subject to the requirements of division (I)
below and §
156.041 of this chapter.
   (E)   Relation to topography. Streets shall be arranged in proper relation
to topography so as to result in usable lots, safe streets and reasonable
gradients.
   (F)   Alleys. Alleys may not be permitted in areas of detached single- or
two-family residences unless approved by the County Road Commission or as
private access easements under the township’s planned unit development zoning
provisions. Dead-end alleys shall be prohibited.
   (G)   Marginal access street. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an
arterial street, the Township Board may require:
      (1)   Marginal access streets approximately parallel to, and on each side
of, the right-of-way; and
      (2)   Such other treatment as it deems reasonably necessary for the
adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of
through and local traffic such as planted buffer strips or the redesign of all
or part if the street layout within the proposed plat.
   (H)   Dead-end streets and single access subdivision. Permanent dead-end
streets are prohibited unless approved as a cul-de-sac by the Township Board
and the County Road Commission. Single access subdivisions serving more than 75
residential lots are prohibited unless it can be shown to be temporary or that
topography or subdivision shape precludes an additional access or indicates
that a small increase in the number of lots served is warranted. Single-access
commercial and industrial subdivisions shall be similarly discouraged. Approval
of such shall take into consideration the length of looped utilities,
alternative emergency access points, traffic volumes and the ability to
adequately handle peak traffic flow with one access without negatively
impacting adjoining streets and properties. As a general rule, commercial and
industrial subdivisions that are expected to generate more than 300 vehicle
trips in the peak hour will be required to have more than one access point to a
paved collector or primary street.
   (I)   Cul-de-sac streets. All temporary and permanent dead-end streets must
be provided with cul-de-sacs (turnarounds) at their termini. Temporary
turnarounds shall be provided at the termini of streets where a future
extension is contemplated. Temporary turnarounds need not be a part of the
dedicated right-of-way; however, easements must be furnished to the County Road
Commission for their use. Cul-de-sacs shall have a minimum radius of 60 feet
for residential plats and 75 feet minimum in commercial and industrial plats.
   (J)   Half streets. Half streets are prohibited, except where unusual
circumstances make it essential to the reasonable development of a tract in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter and where satisfactory
assurance for dedication of the remaining part of the street is provided.
Whenever a tract to be subdivided borders on an existing half or partial
street, the other part of the street shall be dedicated within such tract,
according to the requirements of the County Road Commission.
   (K)   Private streets. Private streets and roads are prohibited.
   (L)   Street rights-of-way and roadway widths. Street and road rights-of-way
and roadway widths shall conform to the Major Thoroughfare Plan of the
township, if adopted and the rules of the County Road Commission and the State
Department of State Highways and Transportation.
   (M)   Street alignment; horizontal alignment. Horizontal curves are to be
used, as practical, at all changes in direction of the centerline of a
continuous street. When street lines deflect from each other by more than ten
degrees in alignment, the centerlines must be connected by a curve with a
minimum radius of 350 feet of centerline radius. On local non-continuous
residential streets, 90-degree curves are permissible.
   (N)   Street names. Street names may not duplicate any existing street name
in the county, except where a new street is a continuation of an existing
street of the same name. Any street name which is spelled differently, but
sounds the same as an existing street name in the county is prohibited. All new
streets shall be named as follows: streets with predominant north/south
directions shall be named “Street” or “Roads”; streets with predominant east/
west direction shall be named “Avenue”; meandering streets shall be named
“Drive”, “Lane”, “Path” or “Trail”; and cul-de-sacs shall be named “Circle”,
“Court”, “Way” or “Place”.
   (O)   Outlots. Outlots which are to become the right-of-way for future
streets must be described as such on the plat.
(Prior Code, Ch. XXXIII, § 4.1)  (Ord. 2-2004, passed 8-9-2004)
§ 156.036  INTERSECTIONS.
   (A)   Angle of intersection. Streets shall intersect at 90 degrees or as
closely thereto as practical. In no event shall the angle of an intersection be
less than 80 degrees.
   (B)   Sight triangles. Minimum clear sight distance at all minor street
intersections shall permit vehicles to be visible to the driver of another
vehicle when each is 125 feet from the center of the intersection. No fence,
wall, embankment, structure, sign or planting is allowed to obstruct vision in
this area.
   (C)   Number of streets. No more than two streets may meet at any one
intersection.
   (D)   “T” intersection. “T” type intersections shall be used where practical
at intersections of minor streets with any street.
   (E)   Centerline offsets. Slight jogs at intersections are to be eliminated
where practical. Where such jogs cannot be practically avoided, street
centerlines must be offset by a distance of 125 feet or more.
(Prior Code, Ch. XXXIII, § 4.2)  (Ord. 2-2004, passed 8-9-2004)
§ 156.037  PEDESTRIAN WAYS.
   (A)   Crosswalks. Right-of-way for pedestrian crosswalks in the middle of
long blocks shall be provided where necessary to obtain convenient pedestrian
circulation to schools, parks, shopping areas or other activity centers. Such
pedestrian right-of-way shall be at least ten feet wide and extend entirely
through the block.
   (B)   Sidewalks. Sufficient right-of-way shall be provided so that five-foot
wide sidewalks may be installed on both sides of all streets.
(Prior Code, Ch. XXXIII, § 4.3)  (Ord. 2-2004, passed 8-9-2004)
§ 156.038  EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Easement location. Where practical, easements ten feet in width shall
be provided along front property lines for utilities and also along rear or
side lot lines when necessary. The total width shall not be less than six feet
along each property line or a total of 12 feet for adjoining lots. The easement
width may be six feet for lots abutting unplatted property.
   (B)   Drainage.
      (1)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage,
channel, floodplain or stream, a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way
shall be provided which conforms substantially with the lines of such
watercourse or right-of-way to minimize flooding during periods of heavy rain.
      (2)   The subdivider shall provide drainage easements as required by the
rules of the County Drain Commissioner.
(Prior Code, Ch. XXXIII, § 4.4)  (Ord. 2-2004, passed 8-9-2004)
§ 156.039  BLOCKS.
   (A)   Arrangements. A block shall be designed to provide two tiers of lots,
except in those cases where lots back onto an arterial street, natural feature
or subdivision boundary.
   (B)   Minimum length. Blocks shall not be less than 500 feet long from
center of street to center of street.
   (C)   Maximum length. The maximum length allowed for residential blocks
shall be approximately 1,000 feet long from center of street to center of
street.
(Prior Code, Ch. XXXIII, § 4.5)  (Ord. 2-2004, passed 8-9-2004)
§ 156.040  LOTS.
   (A)   Conform to zoning. The lot width, depth, building setback line and
area may not be less than the particular district requirements of
Ch. 157 of this code of ordinances, as amended, except where outlots are
provided for some permitted purpose.
   (B)   Lot lines. Side lot lines shall be as close to right angles to
straight streets and radial to curve streets as practical.
   (C)   Width related to length. The depth of a lot shall not exceed three
times the width as measured at the building line.
   (D)   Corner lots. Corner lots shall have sufficient width so as to permit
appropriate building setback from both streets or orientation to both streets
is such that the requirements of §
156.036 of this chapter are met. Lots abutting a mid-block pedestrian crosswalk
shall be treated as corner lots.
   (E)   Uninhabitable areas. Lands subject to flooding or otherwise deemed by
the Planning Commission to be uninhabitable shall not be platted for
residential purposes, or for uses that may, in the judgment of the Planning
Commission and Township Board, increase the danger to health, life or property
or increase the flood hazard. Such land within a subdivision shall be set aside
for other uses such as parks or other open space or may be included in the
developable lots provided that such area is not included within the minimum lot
area requirements as specified by this chapter or in the zoning ordinance.
   (F)   Back-up-lots. Lots shall not back into such features as freeways,
arterial streets, shopping centers or industrial properties, except where there
is a marginal access street, or unless a secondary access is provided. Such
lots shall contain a landscaped easement along the rear at least 20 feet wide
in addition to the utility easement to restrict access to the arterial street
to minimize noise and to protect outdoor living areas.
   (G)   Double frontage lots. Lots extending through a block and having
frontage on two local streets is prohibited.
   (H)   Lot frontage. All lots shall front upon a publicly dedicated street.
Variances may be permitted for approved planned unit developments.
   (I)   Future arrangements. Where parcels of land are subdivided into
unusually large lots (such as when large lots are required for septic tank
operations), the parcels shall be configured, where feasible, so as to allow
for re-subdividing into smaller parcels in a logical fashion. Lot arrangements
shall allow for the ultimate extension of adjacent streets through the middle
of wide blocks. Whenever future re-subdividing or lot splitting is to be
undertaken, the plan therefor shall first be approved by the Planning
Commission prior to submission to the Township Board for approval pursuant to
division (J) below.
   (J)   Division of platted lots.
      (1)   Prohibition of division. No lot, outlot or other parcel of land
located in a recorded plat shall be further partitioned or divided unless such
partition or division is first approved by the Township Board, which approval
may include actions in the Circuit Court to amend, modify or vacate a plat or
portion thereof.

(Prior Code, Ch. XV, § 19.01)  (Ord. 1977-1, passed 10-10-1977)
§ 157.007  CONDITIONAL REZONING.
   (A)   Intent. It is recognized that there are certain instances where it
would be in the best interests of the township, as well as advantageous to
property owners seeking a change in zoning boundaries, if certain conditions
could be proposed by property owners as part of a request for a rezoning. It is
the intent of this section to provide a process consistent with the provisions
of § 161 of the Township Zoning Act, being M.C.L.A. § 125.3405 by which an
owner seeking a rezoning may voluntarily propose conditions regarding the use
and/or development of land as part of the rezoning request.
   (B)   Application and offer of conditions.
      (1)   An owner of land may voluntarily offer in writing conditions
relating to the use and/or development of land for which a rezoning is
requested. This offer may be made either at the time the application for
rezoning is filed or may be made at a later time during the rezoning process.
      (2)   The required application and process for considering a rezoning
request with conditions shall be the same as that for considering rezoning
requests made without any offer of conditions, except as modified by the
requirements of this section.
      (3)   The owner’s offer of conditions may not purport to authorize uses
or developments not permitted in the requested new zoning district.
      (4)   The owner’s offer of conditions shall bear a reasonable and
rational relationship to the property for which rezoning is requested.
      (5)   Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions
that would require a special land use permit under the terms of this chapter
may only be commenced if a special land use permit for such use or development
is ultimately granted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
      (6)   Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions
that would require a variance under the terms of this chapter may only be
commenced if a variance for such use or development is ultimately granted by
the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
      (7)   Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions
that would require site plan approval under the terms of this chapter may only
be commenced if site plan approval for such use or development is ultimately
granted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
      (8)   The offer of conditions may be amended during the process of
rezoning consideration provided that any amended or additional conditions are
entered voluntarily by the owner. An owner may withdraw all or part of its
offer of conditions any time prior to final rezoning action of the Township
Board; provided that, if such withdrawal occurs subsequent to the Planning
Commission’s public hearing on the original rezoning request, then the rezoning
application shall be referred to the Planning Commission for a new public
hearing with appropriate notice and a new recommendation.
   (C)   Planning Commission review. The Planning Commission, after public
hearing and consideration of the factors for rezoning set forth in §
157.406 of this chapter, may recommend approval, approval with recommended
changes or denial of the rezoning; provided, however, that, any recommended
changes to the offer of conditions are acceptable to and thereafter offered by
the owner.
   (D)   Township Board review. After receipt of the Planning Commission’s
recommendation, the Township Board shall deliberate upon the requested rezoning
and may approve or deny the conditional rezoning request. The Township Board’s
deliberations shall include, but not be limited to, a consideration of the
factors for rezoning set forth in §
157.406 of this chapter. Should the Township Board consider amendments to the
proposed conditional rezoning advisable and, if such contemplated amendments to
the offer of conditions are acceptable to and thereafter offered by the owner,
then the Township Board shall, in accordance with § 11 of the Township Zoning
Act, being M.C.L.A. § 125.3202, refer such amendments to the Planning
Commission for a report thereon within a time specified by the Township Board
and proceed thereafter in accordance with said statute to deny or approve the
conditional rezoning with or without amendments.
   (E)   Approval.
      (1)   If the Township Board finds the rezoning request and offer of
conditions acceptable, the offered conditions shall be incorporated into a
formal written statement of conditions acceptable to the owner and conforming
in form to the provisions of this section. The statement of conditions shall be
incorporated by attachment or otherwise as an inseparable part of the ordinance
adopted by the Township Board to accomplish the requested rezoning.
      (2)   The statement of conditions shall:
         (a)   Be in a form recordable with the Register of Deeds of the county
in which the subject land is located or, in the alternative, be accompanied by
a recordable affidavit or memorandum prepared and signed by the owner giving
notice of the statement of conditions in a manner acceptable to the Township
Board;
         (b)   Contain a legal description of the land to which it pertains;
         (c)   Contain a statement acknowledging that the statement of
conditions runs with the land and is binding upon successor owners of the land;
         (d)   Incorporate by attachment or reference any diagram, plans or
other documents submitted or approved by the owner that are necessary to
illustrate the implementation of the statement of conditions. If any such
documents are incorporated by reference, the reference shall specify where the
document may be examined;
         (e)   Contain a statement acknowledging that the statement of
conditions or an affidavit or memorandum giving notice thereof may be recorded
by the township with the Register of Deeds of the county in which the land
referenced in the Statement of Conditions is located; and
         (f)   Contain the notarized signatures of all of the owners of the
subject land preceded by a statement attesting to the fact that they
voluntarily offer and consent to the provisions contained within the statement
of conditions.
      (3)   Upon the rezoning taking effect, the zoning map shall be amended to
reflect the new zoning classification along with a designation that the land
was rezoned with a statement of conditions. The Township Clerk shall maintain a
listing of all lands rezoned with a statement of conditions.
      (4)   The approved statement of conditions or an affidavit or memorandum
giving notice thereof shall be filed by the township with the Register of Deeds
of the county in which the land is located. The Township Board shall have
authority to waive this requirement if it determines that, given the nature of
the conditions and/or the time frame within which the conditions are to be
satisfied, the recording of such a document would be of no material benefit to
the township or to any subsequent owner of the land.
      (5)   Upon the rezoning taking effect, the use of the land so rezoned
shall conform thereafter to all of the requirements regulating use and
development within the new zoning district as modified by any more restrictive
provisions contained in the statement of conditions.
   (F)   Compliance with conditions.
      (1)   Any person who establishes a development or commences a use upon
land that has been rezoned with conditions shall continuously operate and
maintain the development or use in compliance with all of the conditions set
forth in the statement of conditions. Any failure to comply with a condition
contained within the statement of conditions shall constitute a violation of
this chapter and be punishable accordingly. Additionally, any such violation
shall be deemed a nuisance per se and subject to judicial abatement as provided
by law.
      (2)   No permit or approval shall be granted under this chapter for any
use or development that is contrary to an applicable statement of conditions.
   (G)   Time period for establishing development or use. Unless another time
period is specified in the ordinance rezoning the subject land, the approved
development and/or use of the land pursuant to building and other required
permits must be commenced upon the land within 18 months after the rezoning
took effect and thereafter proceed diligently to completion. This time
limitation may upon written request be extended by the Township Board if:
      (1)   It is demonstrated to the Township Board’s reasonable satisfaction
that there is a strong likelihood that the development and/or use will commence
within the period of extension and proceed diligently thereafter to completion;
and
      (2)   The Township Board finds that there has not been a change in
circumstances that would render the current zoning with statement of conditions
incompatible with other zones and uses in the surrounding area or otherwise
inconsistent with sound zoning policy.
   (H)   Reversion of zoning. If approved development and/or use of the rezoned
land does not occur within the time frame specified under division (G) above,
then the land shall revert to its former zoning classification as set forth in
M.C.L.A. § 125.3405. The reversion process shall be initiated by the Township
Board requesting that the Planning Commission proceed with consideration of
rezoning of the land to its former zoning classification. The procedure for
considering and making this reversionary rezoning shall thereafter be the same
as applies to all other rezoning requests.
   (I)   Subsequent rezoning of land. When land that is rezoned with a
statement of conditions is thereafter rezoned to a different zoning
classification or to the same zoning classification, but with a different or no
statement of conditions, whether as a result of a reversion of zoning pursuant
to division (H) above or otherwise, the statement of conditions imposed under
the former zoning classification shall cease to be in effect. Upon the owner’s
written request, the Township Clerk shall record with the Register of Deeds of
the county in which the land is located a notice that the statement of
conditions is no longer in effect.
   (J)   Amendment of conditions.
      (1)   During the time period for commencement of an approved development
or use specified pursuant to division (G) above or during any extension thereof
granted by the Township Board, the township shall not add to or alter the
conditions in the statement of conditions.
      (2)   The statement of conditions may be amended thereafter in the same
manner as was prescribed for the original rezoning and statement of conditions.
   (K)   Township right to rezone. Nothing in the statement of conditions nor
in the provisions of this section shall be deemed to prohibit the township from
rezoning all or any portion of land that is subject to a statement of
conditions to another zoning classification. Any rezoning shall be conducted in
compliance with this chapter and the Township Zoning Act, being M.C.L.A. §§
125.3101 et seq.
   (L)   Failure to offer conditions. The township shall not require an owner
to offer conditions as a requirement for rezoning. The lack of an offer of
conditions shall not affect an owner’s rights under this chapter.
   (M)   Planning Commission review. In reviewing an application for the
rezoning of land, whether the application be made with or without an offer of
conditions, factors that should be considered by the Planning Commission and
the Township Board include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Whether the rezoning is consistent with the policies and uses
proposed for that area in the township’s Master Land Use Plan;
      (2)   Whether all of the uses allowed under the proposed rezoning would
be compatible with other zones and uses in the surrounding area;
      (3)   Whether any public services and facilities would be significantly
adversely impacted by a development or use allowed under the requested
rezoning; and
      (4)   Whether the uses allowed under the proposed rezoning would be
equally or better suited to the area than uses allowed under the current zoning
of the land.

qualities of the waters, minimize conflicting land uses, promote safety and
help preserve the quality of recreational use of lands and water within the
township. For the purpose of this section, a LAKE shall mean any natural or
human-made body of water having a surface area greater than five acres and over
which riparian access has been extended to more than one parcel, lot, unit or
person.
      (1)   Development parcels. In all zoning districts, for any new lot
supporting a single-family dwelling unit or any other form of residential
development there shall be at least 75 feet of water frontage, as measured
along the high water mark of the lake and each lot or parcel shall otherwise
meet the minimum dimensional requirements for such lots in the zoning district
in which it is located.
      (2)   Access (keyhole) parcels.
         (a)   In any zoning district where there is an existing parcel of
record having water frontage of less than 75 feet, which by intent of the owner
or by its dimensional or physical limitations will not support building
development, such parcel or lot may not be used or conveyed as a riparian
access parcel for not more than one other parcel, lot, unit or person.
         (b)   In any zoning district where there is an intent to create and
use a new lot, parcel, easement or common area for the purpose of providing
riparian rights by deeded access, the new lot, parcel, easement or common area
shall have at least 75 lineal feet of water frontage and a depth of at least
100 feet. The number of parcels, lots, units or persons permitted to have
deeded riparian access over the lot, parcel, easement or common area shall be
one for the first 75 feet of water frontage, plus one additional lot, parcel,
unit, apartment or person for each additional 75 feet of frontage that the
access parcel has on the body of water.
      (3)   Boat access. In all zoning districts, where multiple unit
residential development is permitted, any multiple-unit residential development
shall have not more than one boat access for each 75 feet of water frontage, as
measured along the normal high water mark of the lake.
      (4)   Lake access and the like. In all zoning districts, no lake access,
boat ramp, shore station, dock, boat launch or shoreline abutting a lake shall
be utilized for commercial business, outdoor recreational (or entertainment)
facilities, institutional, non-residential or non-agricultural uses or purposes
unless such use complies with the requirements of the zoning district in which
it is located and is also approved as a special land use.
      (5)   Easements and the like. In addition to the above limitations, no
easement, private park, common area, condominium arrangement, lake access
device or lot or access property abutting or adjoining a lake shall be used to
permit access to the lake for more than one single-family property, dwelling
unit, condominium unit or apartment unit unless such use is also approved as a
special land use.
      (6)   Channels and canals. No new channel or canal shall be created
abutting, enlarging or tied into a lake, nor shall existing canals or channels
be enlarged. Canals or channels which touch or abut a lake and were lawfully in
existence as of the date of enactment of this chapter may be cleaned and
dredged, so long as they are not enlarged beyond their original dimensions.
   (B)   The restrictions of this section shall apply to all lots and parcels
on or abutting any lake, regardless of whether access to the lake shoreline or
waters shall be by easement, park, common-fee ownership, condominium
arrangement, license or lease.
   (C)   Although the owner of a property with frontage on a lake may permit
family members and occasional invitees to use the water frontage, dock and
watercraft owned by the owner as incidental to the residential use of the
property, the owner shall not permit anyone other than a family member of a
person co-owning or residing on the property fronting on the water to moor a
watercraft overnight at the dock on the property or in the waters adjacent to
the property. Nor shall the owner of such a property enter into an agreement to
permit anyone to use the shoreline (or dock thereof) of water unless such
person is leasing a residence on the property and is in possession of the
entire waterfront property.
   (D)   The non-conforming use provisions of §§
157.300 through
157.304 of this chapter shall be applicable to this section; except, the
following shall be permissible notwithstanding the provisions hereof.
      (1)   Any lot of record having frontage on a body of water may have one
dock even though the lot has less than 75 feet of frontage on the water. This
section shall not be construed to prevent docks, even if docks have not been
installed, where recorded vested rights were granted prior to the adoption of
this chapter.
      (2)   Any easement, park, common area or access property having frontage
on a body of water which lawfully exists as of the date of the adoption of the
section may have one dock even though it has less than 75 feet of frontage on
the water.
      (3)   If a given property, easement, park, common area or access property
has a right to have a dock under this section or §
157.021 of this chapter, that right to utilize a dock shall continue even if
the dock is seasonal in nature, has to be repaired or replace or is not
utilized every year.

granted until all parcels involved conform to the zoning district in which they
are located.

§ 157.052  CAMPING ON VACANT PROPERTIES.
   (A)   Camping on vacant, non-riparian properties. Camping or the occupancy
or use of tents, campers, motor homes or the storage thereof is prohibited on
vacant, non-riparian lots or parcels of record within the AG, R-1, R-1A, R-2 or
R-3 Districts, except under the following circumstances:
      (1)   The lot is adjacent to a lot or parcel on which there is an
occupied dwelling and both lots are under the same ownership;
      (2)   The camping, use or storage is located within a campground as
permitted and authorized under the provisions of this chapter; or
      (3)   On a vacant, non-riparian parcel or tract in excess of ten acres in
size, camping is permitted under the following provisions except that camping
is permitted without interruption during deer hunting seasons established by
the state for any state-wide or special Zone 3 archery or firearm deer hunting
season.
         (a)   Not more than four camping units consisting of any combination
of tents, motor homes, travel trailers or campers shall be permitted on the lot
or parcel at any given time.
         (b)   The camping activity shall be limited to the owner of the parcel
and to guests of the parcel owner, without remittance.
         (c)   Camping is permitted without interruption during deer hunting
seasons established by the state for any state-wide or special Zone 3 archery

occupancy may exceed 14 consecutive days. Unless the camping unit is owned or
licensed by the property owner, the unit shall be removed from the premises
after each period of permitted occupancy. Each period of use or permitted
occupancy must be separated from the next by at least 14 days.

line of any nearby structures and at least 20 feet from all property lines.
         (e)   The camping unit shall not have fixed connections to
electricity, water, gas or sanitary sewage.
   (B)   Camping on vacant lots having frontage (riparian lands).
      (1)   It is recognized that certain vacant riparian lots within the
township have an intrinsic outdoor recreational quality and character that
makes seasonal camping an attractive interim or alternative use for the lot.
Care must be taken however, to ensure that any such allowed activity, whether
temporary or permanent, would not diminish the character and value of adjacent
and nearby single-family residential use home sites.
      (2)   Camping on vacant lots having lake frontage may therefore only be
authorized subject to a site plan review by the Zoning Administrator. In such
cases, and as approved by the Zoning Administrator, the Zoning Administrator
shall limit the number, location and duration of camping and RV storage
activity commensurate with the size and character of the site and the use and
character of the surrounding residential lots and area.
      (3)   In reviewing an application to allow the use of a vacant lot for
such use, the Zoning Administrator may not approve an activity that exceeds the
limiting standards contained in §
157.051 of this chapter and shall consider the following in deciding whether to
authorize the use permit:
         (a)   The number and location of proposed campsites or recreation
vehicles on the site;
         (b)   The size, width and depth of the parcel lot or parcel;
         (c)   Setbacks and screening;
         (d)   The existence of nearby developed residential dwellings, the
distances to adjacent developed home sites;
         (e)   Accessibility and parking constraints;
         (f)   Potential impacts on adjoining property values;
         (g)   The duration of the proposed camping activity;
         (h)   Whether or not the activity will entail the prolonged storage of
recreation vehicles on the site and whether such storage would have a negative
impact on adjoining properties; and
         (i)   The existence or non-existence of similar camping or storage
activity on nearby non- riparian lots as permitted under division (B)(1) above.

setbacks in this district, such larger lot is permitted; provided, it is the
minimum practically necessary to accommodate the existing buildings while
meeting other applicable standards of this chapter; and
      (7)   All the standards of this section are met by so documenting on
forms accompanying each application.
   (E)   The township shall apply the following procedures in administering

§ 157.167  SPECIAL USES BY PERMIT.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   In development and execution of this subchapter, it is recognized
that there are some uses which, because of their very nature, have serious
objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them
are concentrated in near proximity to a residential area or community and
neighborhood shopping areas, thereby having a deleterious effect upon such
areas. It is also recognized that the controlled uses have legitimate rights
under the United States Constitution as well as locational needs similar to
many other retail establishments. Special regulation of these uses within the
C-2 General Commercial is therefore necessary to ensure that adverse effects of
such uses will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of residential
areas or the quality of the community’s neighborhood business areas. At the
same time, these controls are intended to provide commercially viable locations
within the township where these uses are considered more compatible and less
deleterious. The controls do not legitimize activities that are otherwise
illegal under this chapter or various other local, state and federal statutes.
      (2)   Uses subject to these controls are as follows:
         (a)   Adult motion picture theaters;
         (b)   Adult book and video stores;
         (c)   Adult cabarets;
         (d)   Nude artist and photography studios;
         (e)   Massage parlors;
         (f)   Host or hostess establishment;
         (g)   Sauna, hot tub or other similar health or body improvement or
enjoyment enterprise;
         (h)   Open dance hall;
         (i)   Adult smoking or sexual novelty and paraphernalia store;
         (j)   Adult motel;
         (k)   Escort agency;
         (l)   Sexual encounter center; and
         (m)   Any combination of the foregoing.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.

SITE CONDOMINIUM PROJECTS
§ 157.270  PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Site condominium projects are condominium developments in which each
condominium unit consists of an area of vacant land and a volume of vacant air
space within which a building or other improvements may be constructed by the
condominium unit owner. Each site condominium unit may also have an appurtenant
limited common element reserved for the exclusive use of the owner of the
condominium unit. Either the condominium unit by itself, or the condominium
unit taken together with any contiguous, appurtenant limited common element,
shall be considered to constitute a building site which is the functional
equivalent of a “lot” for purposes of determining compliance with the
requirements of this subchapter and other applicable laws, ordinances and
regulations. Site condominium projects may also include general common elements
consisting of common open space, recreational areas, streets and other areas
available for use by all owners of condominium units within the project.
   (B)   This subchapter requires preliminary review by the Planning Commission
followed by final review and approval by the Township Board of site condominium
project plans to ensure that site condominium projects comply with this
subchapter. Site condominium projects may be approved as provided by this
subchapter only for the support of land uses that are permitted in the zoning
district in which the project is proposed.

standards and requirements.
      (1)   In its review of a site condominium project plan, the Planning
Commission may consult with the Zoning Administrator, Township Attorney,
Township Engineer, Township Fire Chief, Township Planner or other appropriate
persons regarding the adequacy of the proposed common elements and maintenance
provisions, use and occupancy restrictions, utility systems and streets,
project layout and design or other aspects of the proposed project.
      (2)   Prior to acting on a preliminary site condominium project plan, the
Planning Commission will hold a public hearing thereon. Notice of the time and
place of the hearing will be mailed to the proprietor and to the owners of land
immediately adjoining the land to be developed and to those owning land and/or
occupying structures within 300 feet of the proposed project land area. The
notice will be mailed in advance of the hearing and specify the place, time and
date of the hearing. The notice will be given not less than five, nor more than

can be advantageously used for a use permitted in the applicable zoning
district.

§ 157.325  STANDARDS FOR SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   (A)   The Planning Commission shall review the site plan based on the
purpose, objectives and requirements of this chapter and on the standards
provided by this section. As a part of its review, the Planning Commission may
distribute copies of the plan to other governmental departments or officials.
Their review and comment would be on matters related to the plan that would
fall under their jurisdiction or involve the discharge of their duties.
   (B)   In reviewing the site plan, the Planning Commission shall specifically
consider the following standards, as applicable.
      (1)   Dimensional requirements. The dimensional arrangement of buildings
and structures shall conform to the required yards, setbacks and height
restrictions of this chapter.
      (2)   Building arrangement. The proposed buildings and structures shall
have a harmonious relationship to the site terrain, landscaping, open space and
other buildings and structures, existing and proposed. The bulk, location and
height of proposed buildings and structures, as well as the general character
of the development, shall minimize any adverse effect on other uses of property
in the surrounding area and shall not place demands on public services or
facilities in excess of township capacity.
      (3)   Drainage of surface water. Proper site surface drainage shall be
provided so that the removal of surface waters will not adversely affect
neighboring properties or the public storm drainage system. If practical, storm
water shall be removed from all roof areas, canopies and paved areas and
carried away in an underground drainage system. The peak rate of storm water
runoff from the site shall not increase as a result of the proposed development
and temporary on-site storage to reduce peak runoff from the site is
encouraged. Surface water in all paved areas shall be collected at intervals so
that it will not create ponding.
      (4)   Public access and parking. The location, availability and
compatibility of sewer, water and storm drainage facilities shall be considered
to determine whether the use will be adequately served by necessary
improvements. Utility distribution lines or associated utility installations
shall be located so as to avoid adverse impacts both to neighboring properties
and to the site.
      (5)   Vehicular access and parking. The provisions for vehicular loading
and unloading and parking and for vehicular and pedestrian circulation on the
site and onto adjacent public streets and ways shall not create hazards to
safety and shall not place demands on public services or facilities on excess
of township capacity. All buildings and structures shall be accessible by
emergency vehicles.
      (6)   Exterior lighting. All lighting shall be installed and maintained
in such a manner as to confine the illumination source or divert glare to the
property upon which the use is located and to prevent glare or illumination
from adversely affecting the safety or welfare of adjacent property or streets.
      (7)   Signs. The size, location, design and lighting of signs shall be
considered in relation to signs on adjacent sites, glare, traffic safety and
compatibility with adjoining properties, consistent with all applicable sign
regulations. Signs shall be located and designed to avoid creating distraction
or clutter.
      (8)   Special features. Storage areas, mechanical areas, service areas,
truck loading areas, utility buildings and structures and similar features
shall be located, buffered and/or screened so as to be unobtrusive; so as not
to detract from the visual impression of the site. Trash containers shall be
enclosed on at least three sides by a structure aesthetically compatible with
the development and surrounding property. Waste storage areas shall be
maintained free from litter and in sanitary condition.
      (9)   Landscaping. The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state,
insofar as practical, by minimizing tree and soil removal. Grade changes made
shall be in keeping with the general appearance of neighboring developed areas.
Plant materials shall be used to enhance the appearance of the site; to screen
unsightly or harsh elements and to provide visual relief from large monotonous
features, such as parking lots.
      (10)   External effects (general). Noise, odor, light, dust, dirt, smoke
or other external effects from any aspect of the proposed use shall not
adversely affect adjacent and neighboring properties or uses.
      (11)   Compliance with all applicable laws. The Planning Commission shall
not approve a site plan that violates or that is inconsistent with local, state
or federal laws or regulations.

§ 157.330  ENFORCEMENT.
   A site plan, approved by the Planning Commission, in connection with use or
activity, shall have the full force and effect of this chapter. Subsequent
actions relating to the use or activity authorized shall be consistent with the

for the township to order that all construction be stopped and to order that
zoning permits, building permits and certificates of occupancy be withheld
until the violation is removed or until adequate guarantee of removal of the
violation is provided to the township. In addition, a violation of any approved

shall have the right to appeal the decision to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
      (2)   An aggrieved party must allege and prove to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Board of Appeals that he or she suffered some special damages not common
to other property owners similarly situated. The mere increase in traffic in
the area, proof of general economic and aesthetic losses or the mere fact that
the appellant owns adjacent property are not sufficient to show special
damages.
   (B)   Appeals process.
      (1)   The appeal shall state the aggrieved parties’ grounds for appeal
and shall be filed with the Township Clerk within seven days of the decision of
the Planning Commission, Township Board or Zoning Administrator.

and determine if he, she or they are an aggrieved party.
         (a)   If the Board determines that the appellant(s) is not an
aggrieved party, the Board shall note its findings in resolution form, state
its reasons and inform the appellant(s) in writing.
         (b)   If the Board determines that the appellant(s) is an aggrieved
party, the Board should note their findings in resolution form, state its
reasons and schedule a meeting date to consider whether to confirm or overturn
the original decision.
      (4)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall review the public record and
determine whether or not there was support on the record for the original
decision. The appellant shall not have the right to present new evidence, but
shall be bound by the record. The appellant and the appellee may present oral
arguments pertaining to the record. The extent of the oral arguments shall be
at the discretion of the Chairperson. The Board of Appeals shall decide upon
all site plan appeals within a reasonable time, not to exceed 45 days from the
date on which the appeal was filed.
      (5)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall approve the site plan if
requirements of this chapter and other applicable township ordinances are met.
   (C)   Stay. The filing of a site plan appeal shall act to stay the issuance
of a final site plan approval, issuances of any certificates of zoning
compliance or the issuance of any building permit authorizing improvements on
the property which is the subject of appeal.
(Prior Code, Ch. XV, § 12D.17)  (Ord. 2001-1, passed 7-17-2001)
§ 157.332  VALIDITY OF FINAL SITE PLANS.
   (A)   Approval of the final site plan is valid for one year. If actual
physical construction of a substantial nature of the on-site utility systems
and/or building improvements included in the approved site plan has not
commenced and proceeded meaningfully toward completion during that period, the
approval of the final site plan shall be null and void.
   (B)   Final site plans whose approval has expired shall be required to be
resubmitted and processed as an original application.

will not materially impair the intent and purpose of this chapter or of the
public health, safety and welfare and, further that, at least two of the
following facts and conditions exist:
   (A)   There exists exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions
applying to the specific property that do no apply generally to other
properties in the same zone;
   (B)   Such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right similar to that possessed by other properties in the
zone; provided that, increased financial return shall not be deemed sufficient
to warrant a variance; and
   (C)   The condition or situation of the specific property or the intended
use is not of so general or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably practical
a general regulation as part of this chapter.

§ 157.422  OVERLAY SUB-AREAS: NATURAL VEGETATION ZONES AND TRANSITION ZONES:
DEFINITION, INTENT AND DELINEATION.
   (A)   Definition and intent. The land area subject to the riparian area
overlay protection standards of this section shall be comprised of two sub-area
zones. The definitions and intended purposes of each of these sub-areas are as
follows:
      NATURAL VEGETATION ZONE. The natural vegetation zone includes all lands
located within 35 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the stream, and all
contiguous wetlands as defined in this subchapter. The natural vegetation zone
is intended to provide a functional vegetative corridor along the edge of a
stream. Its functions shall be to protect water quality, animal habitat and
aesthetic values of the riparian feature by minimizing erosion, stabilizing the
bank, minimizing nutrient flows into the water, shading the water to maintain
low water temperatures, and screening man-made structures.
      TRANSITION ZONE. The transition zone, extends for a distance of 15 feet
beyond the edge of the natural vegetation zone. The transition zone is intended
to provide distance between upland development and the natural vegetation zone,
in an area outside of the natural vegetation zone where there are fewer
restrictions on disturbance and improvements, but where some restrictions
remain necessary to protect water quality, animal habitat and the integrity of
the adjacent stream and its contiguous wetlands.
   (B)   Delineation of sub-area zones. The limits of the natural vegetation
zone and the transition zone as used and defined in this subchapter is required
to be accurately shown on all site plans, land division plans, subdivision
plans (plats), site condominium plans, plans for planned unit developments, and
all applications for building permits submitted for review by the township. Any
such plans for sites on which is located any protected riparian area subject to
these regulations shall include the following statement: “There shall be no
clearing, grading, earth change, placement of fill, construction or disturbance
of vegetation within the area labeled as being subject to the riparian area
protection standards of the Hopkins Township zoning regulations, except as
permitted by Chapter 121 of the Hopkins Township Code of Ordinances.”
(Ord. passed - -2007)
§ 157.423  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS: NATURAL VEGETATION ZONE.
   Land located within the natural vegetation zone shall be subject to the
following development standards:
   (A)   Units and buildings not permitted; structures permitted. No dwelling
unit or other principal building and no accessory building may be constructed
within the natural vegetation zone. The following structures may be permitted:
      (1)   Flood control or bank protection structures permitted or
constructed by authorized state or federal agencies.
      (2)   Pedestrian or vehicular bridges when designed and constructed in a
manner that minimizes impact on the riparian feature.
      (3)   Boardwalk access to or through wetlands when constructed in
accordance with a permit issued by the Michigan Department of Environmental
Quality.
      (4)   One pump house per lot housing a pump used for irrigation when
setback at least 15 feet from the high water mark, and having a maximum ground
coverage of nine square feet.
   (B)   On-site sanitary waste treatment systems. On-site sanitary waste
treatment systems are prohibited within the natural vegetation zone.
   (C)   Predominately natural condition. The area within the natural
vegetation zone shall be kept in a predominantly natural condition. Clearing or
removal of existing trees shrubs and groundcover shall be limited to the
following:
      (1)   Removal of isolated diseased or dead trees and damaged trees that
are in an unstable condition and that pose a safety hazard. The stumps and root
structures of removed trees shall be left in place.
      (2)   Removal of noxious plants and shrubs, including poison ivy, poison
sumac and poison oak and other plants regarded as common nuisance in § 2,
Public Act 359 of 1941 as amended and species that are recognized as highly
invasive, as contained on a list of invasive species maintained on file in the
office of the Township Clerk.
      (3)   Planting of native species that are contained on a list of native
species maintained on file in the office of the Township Clerk is permitted.
      (4)   Limited removal of vegetation in order to provide a filtered view
of the riparian feature from adjacent property and to provide reasonable
private access to the riparian feature. The term filtered view connotes the
maintenance or establishment of woody vegetation of sufficient density to
screen the riparian feature from adjacent property, while also providing for
bank stabilization and erosion control and to serve as an aid to infiltration
of surface runoff.  The vegetation need not be so dense as to completely block
the view of the riparian feature. To that end the following standards shall
apply:
         (a)   Sufficient live root system and vegetation must be retained to
provide for bank stabilization and erosion control, to encourage infiltration
of runoff, and to provide shading of the water surface.
         (b)   Existing vegetation between a height of three feet above the
ground and the ground surface shall remain undisturbed and in a natural
condition except as otherwise provided for herein.
         (c)   Select pruning and removal of vegetation above a height of three
feet shall be permitted.
         (d)   Existing vegetation may be removed and/or managed, including
maintaining a turf lawn, in an area with a maximum width of 15 feet to, and ten
feet along, one or both sides of the riparian feature. Within this corridor a
paved or unpaved trail or path with a maximum width of nine feet is permitted.
         (e)   Clearing that is required to construct the exempt structures
permitted in §
157.421(b) above, is permitted.
   (D)   Prohibited activities. The following activities are prohibited in the
natural vegetation zone:
      (1)   Storage of motorized vehicles or petroleum products;
      (2)   Storage or use of toxic or hazardous materials;
      (3)   Storage of herbicides or pesticides;
      (4)   Storage of fertilizer;
      (5)   Placement of fill or dumping of any refuse;
      (6)   Concentrated drainage flow by ditches, under drains or other
similar systems;
      (7)   Topsoil, sand and gravel extraction.

NATURAL VEGETATION ZONE AND CONTIGUOUS WETLANDS).
   Land located within the transition zone shall be subject to the following
development standards and restrictions:
   (A)   No dwelling unit or other principal building and no accessory building
may be constructed within the transition zone. The following structures may be
permitted:
      (1)   Flood control structures constructed by authorized state or federal
agencies.
      (2)   Pedestrian or vehicular bridges, when deemed necessary and designed
and constructed in a manner that minimizes impact on the riparian feature.
      (3)   One viewing platform deck or gazebo with maximum ground coverage of
200 square feet.
      (4)   One pump house per lot housing a pump used for irrigation when
setback at least 15 feet from the high water mark, and ground coverage of not
more than nine square feet.
   (B)   On-site sanitary waste treatment systems are prohibited within the
transition zone.
   (C)   Except for public or private access and recreational trails not
exceeding ten feet in width, the construction of impermeable surfaces such as

   Within any agricultural, residential, commercial or industrial zoning
district affected by the riparian area protection overlay, the minimum lot
width and depth for all lots with any part located within this riparian area
protection overlay and created after the effective date of this subchapter
shall be as follows:
   (A)   Minimum lot area: 40,000 square feet.
   (B)   Minimum lot width: 100 feet.
   (C)   Maximum lot depth: The depth of each lot shall be sufficient to

   (D)   Minimum principal structure setback: No principal structure shall be
erected closer than (100 feet) from the high water mark of the stream or
contiguous wetland except on non-conforming lots of record or where there are
steep banks.
      (1)   Non-conforming lots of record.
         (a)   A lot of record existing on the effective date of this
subchapter that is non-conforming by reason of width or depth on may be used
and a principal structure and accompanying septic system may be sited closer to
the stream than the required setback line, only if after review by the Zoning
Board of Appeals it is found that:
            1.   The lot could not be developed in conformance with the
requirements of this section.
            2.   The proposal for use will place the principal structure in a
location as nearly in conformance with the setback requirements of both this
subchapter and the underlying zoning district as possible.
            3.   Such location does not result in placement within the flood
plain or a wetland without appropriate approvals by the Michigan D.E.Q.
         (b)   The Board of Appeals may attach reasonable conditions to its
approval.
      (2)   Principal structure exception for steep banks. Where there is a
steep stream bank, a principal structure (but not a septic system) may be
constructed closer to the riparian feature according to the following schedule:
 
Where the bank height, at the bluff, is (a) feet as measured in vertical feet
from the high water mark, the principal structure may locate no closer than (b)
horizontal feet from the bluff or the high water mark, whichever is greater:
