    The City of Perry shall have, and by appropriate action of its Council
shall exercise, all powers which home rule cities are required to exercise or
are permitted to exercise in its Charter, and no specific enumeration of an
authorized power shall be considered as exclusive of any other powers permitted
by the laws of this State and this Charter.
   The City and its officers shall have the power to exercise all municipal
powers in the management and control of municipal property and in the
administration of the municipal government, whether such powers be expressly

and general laws of the State and provisions of this Charter.
Section 2.2    Further Definition of Powers
    It is the purpose of this Charter to establish procedures for the exercise
of control and management of all municipal affairs pertaining to the public

which employ residents of the City.

of persons to be elected to each City office, who shall receive the highest
number of votes at such primary election, shall be declared the nominees for
election to the respective offices for which they are candidates.
   (d)   When No Primary Election Necessary. If, upon the expiration of the
time for filing nomination petitions, the number of candidates on said

or primary, the same election officials shall act in both the City and the
national, State or County election or primary.

Section 3.14    Nominating Petitions.
    Persons desiring to qualify as candidates for any elective office under
this Charter shall file a petition therefor with the City, signed by not less
than fifteen nor more than thirty registered electors of the Clerk, not later
than the date and time for the filing of nominating petitions for State and
County offices. The form of the petition shall be substantially as that
designated by the Secretary of State for the nomination of nonpartisan judicial
officers. A supply of official petition forms shall be provided and maintained
by the Clerk.
   The Clerk shall publish notice of the last day and time for filing
nomination petitions at least one week before and not more than three weeks
before that date.
   No person shall sign his name to a greater number of petitions for any one

signatures bearing the most recent date shall be invalidated. If his signature
bears the same date, such signature shall not be counted on any petitions for
that office.
Section 3.15    Approval of Petitions.

the required number of valid signatures for candidates having those

Charter. When a petition is filed by persons other than the person whose name
appears thereon as a candidate it may be accepted only when accompanied by the
written consent of the candidate. The Clerk shall, forthwith after the filing
of a petition, notify in writing any candidate whose petition is then known not
to meet the requirements of this section, but the failure to so notify any
candidate shall in no way prevent a final determination that the petition does
not meet such requirements. Within five days after the last date for filing
petitions the Clerk shall make his final determinations as to the validity and
sufficiency of each nomination petition and whether or not the candidate has
the qualifications required for those respective elective City offices by this
Charter, and shall write his determinations thereof on the face of the petition
and shall notify in writing the candidate whose name appears thereon of his
determination.

    All nomination petitions shall be open to public inspection in the office
of the Clerk beginning five days after the filing date for such petitions.

party designation or emblem shall appear upon any City ballot. The names of
qualified nominees for each office shall be listed in a single column and shall
be rotated on the ballots as prescribed by State statute.
Section 3.18    Tie Vote.
    If, at any City election, there shall be no choice between candidates by
reason of two or more candidates having received an equal number of votes, then
the Board of Canvassers shall name a date for the appearance of such candidates
for the purpose of determining the election of such candidates by lot as
prescribed by State law.
Section 3.19    Recall.
    Any official may be removed from office by the electors in the manner
prescribed by the general law of the State. A vacancy created by the recall of
any elective official shall be filled in the manner prescribed by law.
Section 3.20    Recount.
    A recount of the votes cast at any City election for any office, or upon

State.

    Except by procedures provided in this Charter, the terms of the elective
officers of the City shall not be shortened during the term for which he was
elected. The terms of elective officers of the City may not be extended beyond
the period for which any such officer was elected, except that an elective
officer of the City may, after his term has expired, continue to hold office
until his successor is elected or appointed and has qualified. The Council
shall not grant or authorize extra compensation to any City officer, agent or
contractor after the service has been rendered or the contract entered into;

after his election during any fixed term of office for which he was elected.

effect until repealed or amended.

    All legislation of the City of Perry shall be by ordinance or by
resolution. The word "resolution," as used in this Charter, shall be the

required by this Charter, if preliminary publication is accomplished by posting
copies thereof in conspicuous locations in five public places in the City; and

under the record of the ordinance, a certificate under his hand stating the

his name in ink or indelible pencil, and shall place thereon, after his name,
the date and his place of residence by street and number or by other customary
designation. To each petition paper there shall be attached a sworn affidavit
by the circulator thereof, stating the number of signers thereto and that each
signature thereon is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports
to be, and that it was made in the presence of the affiant. Such petition shall
be filed with the Clerk who shall, within ten days, canvass the signatures
thereof to determine the sufficiency thereof. If found to contain an
insufficient number of signatures of registered electors of the City, or to be
improper as to form, or compliance with the provisions of this section, the
Clerk shall notify forthwith the persons filing such petition and ten days from
such notification shall be allowed for filing of supplemental petition papers.
When found sufficient and proper, the Clerk shall present the petition to the
Council at its next regular meeting.
Section 5.10    Council Procedure.
    Upon receiving an initiatory or referendary petition from the Clerk, the
Council shall, within thirty days, either:
   (a)   If it be an initiatory petition, adopt the ordinance as submitted in
the petition or determine to submit the proposal to the electors of the City;
   (b)   If it be a referendary petition, repeal the ordinance to which the
petition refers or determine to submit the proposal to the electors of the
City.
Section 5.11    Submission to Electors.
    Should the Council decide to submit the proposal to the electors, it shall
be submitted at the next election held in the City for any purpose, or, in the
discretion of the Council, at a special election. The result shall be
determined by a majority vote of the electors voting thereon, except in cases
where otherwise required by the Constitution or laws of the State of Michigan.
Section 5.12    Ordinance Suspended.
    The certification by the Clerk of the sufficiency of a referendary petition
filed within ninety days after the passage of the ordinance to which such
petition refers shall automatically suspend the ordinance in question pending
repeal by the Council or final determination by the electors as the case may
be. An ordinance adopted by the electorate through initiatory proceedings may
not be amended or repealed by the Council for a period of two years, and then
only by the affirmative vote of the majority of the Councilmen elect. Should
two or more ordinances adopted at the same election have conflicting
provisions, the one receiving the highest vote shall prevail as to those
provisions.
Section 5.13    Franchises, Contracts and Leases Remain in Effect.
    All franchises, contracts and leases to which the City is a party when this
Charter becomes effective shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with their respective terms and conditions.
Section 5.14    Granting of Public Utility Franchise.
    Public utility franchises and all renewals and extensions thereof and
amendments thereto shall be granted by ordinance only. No exclusive franchise
shall ever be granted. No franchise shall be granted for a longer period than
thirty years.
   No franchise ordinance which is not subject to revocation at the will of the
City shall be enacted nor become operative until the same shall have first been
referred to the people at a regular or special election and received the
affirmative vote of three-fifths of the electors voting thereon. No such
franchise ordinance shall be approved by the Council for referral to the
electorate before thirty days after publication thereof has been filed with the
Council, nor until a public hearing has been held thereon, nor until the
grantee named therein has filed with the Clerk his unconditional acceptance of
all terms of such franchise. No special election for such purpose shall be
ordered by the Council unless the expenses of holding such election, as
determined by the Council, shall have first been paid to the Treasurer by the
grantee.
   A franchise ordinance which is subject to a revocation at the will of the
City may be enacted by the Council without referral to the voters, but shall
not be enacted nor become operative unless it shall have been complete in the
form in which it is finally enacted and remain on file with the Clerk for
public inspection for at least four weeks before the final enactment thereof.
Section 5.15   Conditions of Public Utility Franchise.
    All public utility franchises granted after the adoption of this Charter,
whether it be so provided in the granting ordinance or not, shall be subject to
the following rights of the City:
   (a)   To repeal the same for misuse, non-use or failure to comply with the
provision thereof;
   (b)   To require reasonable and adequate extension of plant and service and
maintenance thereof at the highest practicable standard of efficiency;
   (c)   To establish reasonable and practicable standards for service and
quality of products and prevent unjust discrimination in service or rates;
   (d)   To require continuous and uninterrupted service to the public in
accordance with the terms of the franchise throughout the entire period
thereof;
   (e)   To impose such other reasonable regulations as may be conducive to the
health, safety and accommodation of the public;
   (f)   To use, control and regulate the use of its streets, alleys, bridges
and public places and the space above and beneath them. The above enumeration
shall not be exclusive or impair the right of the Council to insert in such
franchise any provision within the power of the City to impose or require.
Section 5.16   Restrictions on Council.
    The Council shall not have the power to make any contract with or give any
official position to one who is in default to the City. Further, the Council
shall not have the power to sell any park, cemetery or any part thereof, except
where such park is not required under an official master plan of the City, or
to engage in any business enterprise requiring an investment of money in excess
of one-half percent of the assessed valuation, unless these actions are
approved by a simple majority of the electors voting thereon at a regular or
special election.
   Unless by the affirmative vote of four Councilmen, no office shall be
created or abolished, no tax or assessment shall be imposed, no street, alley
or public ground shall be vacated, no real estate or any interest therein shall
be sold or disposed of, no action shall be taken to condemn private property
for public use, no money shall be appropriated, nor shall any vote of the
Council be reconsidered or rescinded.
Section 5.17   Investigations.
    The Council, or any person or committee authorized by it for the purpose,
shall have the power to inquire into the conduct of any department, office or
officer of the City and to make investigations as to Municipal affairs, and for
that purpose may subpoena witnesses, administer oaths and compel the production
of books, papers and other evidence. Failure on the part of any officer of the
City to obey such subpoena to produce books, papers or other evidence as
ordered under the provisions of this section shall constitute and may be deemed
cause for removal. A majority vote of the members elect of the Council,
exclusive of any member whose removal may be being considered, shall be
required for any such removal.
Section 5.18   Severability of Ordinances.
    Unless an ordinance shall expressly provide to the contrary, if any portion
of an ordinance or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall
be found to be invalid by a court, such invalidity shall not affect the
remaining portions or applications of the ordinance which can be given effect
without the invalid portion or application, provided such remaining portions
are not determined by the court to be inoperable, and to this end ordinances
are declared to be severable.
CHAPTER 6

adopt the budget for the next fiscal year and shall provide for a levy of the
amount necessary to be raised by taxation for Municipal purposes, which amount

real and personal property subject to taxation by the City.
(Amended 11-7-06; 11-8-22)
Section 6.4   Transfer of Appropriations.
    After the budget has been adopted, no money shall be drawn from the
Treasury of the City, nor shall any obligation for the expenditure of such
money be incurred, except pursuant to the budget appropriation. The Council may
transfer any unencumbered appropriation balance or any portion thereof from one
department fund or agency to another. The balance in any appropriation which
has not been encumbered at the end of the fiscal year shall revert to the
General Fund and be reappropriated during the next fiscal year. In the case of
emergency arising from a pressing need other than a regular or recurring
requirement and necessary to protect the public health, welfare or safety, the
Council may make additional appropriations to cover unanticipated expenditures
required of the City because of such emergency.
Section 6.5   Budget Control.
    At the first regular Council meeting of each quarter (unless requested more
often by the Council), the Treasurer shall submit to the Council, data showing
the relation between the estimated and actual income and expense to date; and
if it shall appear that the income is less than anticipated, the Council may
reduce appropriations, except amounts required for debt and interest charges,
to such degree as may be necessary to keep expenditures within the cash income.
If the revenues exceed the amounts estimated in the budget, the Council may
make supplemental appropriations if all six of the members of Council
affirmatively approve the supplemental appropriations; otherwise, excessive
revenue shall be carried forward as surplus to the next fiscal year.
Section 6.6   Purchasing Agent.
   The Council may designate, and define in the City’s Purchasing Policy, one
of the administrative officers of the City as Purchasing Agent, and the Agent
shall be responsible for the purchase of City personal property within budget
limitations and the sale of all City property except real estate. In all sales
or purchases in excess of the amount defined by the Council and documented in
the City’s Purchasing Policy, the sale or purchase shall be approved by the
Council and formal sealed bids shall be obtained unless the Council, by formal
unanimous resolution of those present at the meeting, determines that no
advantage to the City would result from competitive bidding. The Council may
authorize the making of public improvements or the performance of any other
City work by a City agency without competitive bidding. The Council may
establish detailed purchasing, sale and contract procedure by ordinance or
resolution.
(Amended 11-8-22)
Section 6.7   Depository.
    The Council shall designate the depository or depositories for City funds,
and shall provide for the regular deposit of all City moneys. The Council shall

deemed proper security.

    An independent audit shall be made of all accounts of the City government
at the close of each fiscal year, and shall be completed within ninety days
thereafter. Special independent audits may be made at any time that the Council
may designate. All such audits may be made at any time that the Council may
designate. All such audits shall be made to the Council by a certified public
accountant designated by it. Each audit and reports supplemental thereto shall

    The City shall have the power to assess taxes and levy and collect rents,
tolls and excises.
Section 6.10    Subjects of Taxation.

    No exemptions from taxation shall be allowed, except as expressly required
or permitted by statute.
Section 6.12    Tax Day.
    Subject to the exceptions provided or permitted by law, the taxable status
of persons and property shall be determined as of the thirty-first day of
December, or such other date as may subsequently be required by law, which
shall be deemed the tax day. Values on the assessment roll shall be determined
according to the facts existing on the tax day for the year for which such roll
is made, and no change in the status or location of any such property after
that day shall be considered by the Assessor or the Board of Review.
Section 6.13    Preparation of Assessment Roll.
    On or before the first Monday in March in each year, the Assessor shall
prepare and certify an assessment roll of all property in the City subject to
taxation. Such roll shall be prepared in accordance with statute and this
Charter. Values shall be estimated according to recognized methods of
systematic assessment. The records of the Assessor shall show separate figures
for the value of the land, of the building improvements and of the personal
property; and the method of estimating all such values shall be as nearly
uniform as possible.
   On or before the first Monday in March, the Assessor shall give by first
class mail a notice of any increase over the previous year in the assessed
value of any property or of the addition of any property to the roll to the
owner as shown by such assessment roll. The failure to give any such notice or
of the owner to receive it shall not invalidate any assessment roll or
assessment thereon.
Section 6.14    Personal Property; Jeopardy Assessment.
    If the Treasurer finds or reasonably believes that any person who is or may
be liable for taxes upon personal property, the taxable situs of which was in
the City on tax day, intends to depart or has departed from the City; or to
remove or has removed therefrom personal property which is or may be liable for
taxation; or to conceal or conceals himself or his property; or does any other
act tending to prejudice, or to render wholly or partly ineffectual the
proceedings to collect such tax, he shall proceed to collect the same as a
jeopardy assessment in the manner provided by law.
Section 6.15    Board of Review.
   (a)   A Board of Review is hereby created, composed of three members who are
taxpayers and who own property in the City of Perry as set forth in
Section 3.1 of this Charter.
   (b)   The members of the Board of Review shall be appointed by the Council
and may be removed for reasons of nonfeasance or misfeasance by the vote of
five members of the Council. One member shall be appointed in the month of
January of each year for a term of three years, commencing on the following
February 1.
   (c)   The Board shall, annually, on the first day of its meeting, select one
of its members as Chairman for the ensuing year. The Assessor shall be Clerk of
the Board, and shall be entitled to be heard at its sessions, but shall have no
vote on any proposition or question.
Section 6.16    Meetings of the Board of Review.
    The Board of Review shall convene as prescribed by State laws. One of the
sessions of the Board of Review shall be an evening session. Two members of the
Board of Review shall constitute a quorum.
Section 6.17    Notice of Meetings.
    Notice of the time and place of the sessions of the Board of Review shall
be published by the Clerk at least ten days prior to the Board's first session.
In each case where assessed value of any property is increased or any property
added to the rolls by the Board, the City Assessor shall give notice to the
owners thereof, according to the first assessment roll, by letter mailed first
class not later than midnight following the end of the session at which the
Board made the increase or addition. Such notice shall state the date, time and
place that the Board of Review will hear objections to the changes made by the
Board of Review, which date shall be not less than five days after the mailing
of such notice. The failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not
invalidate any assessment roll or assessment thereof.
Section 6.18    Duties and Functions of Board of Review.
    For the purpose of revising and correcting assessments, the Board of Review
shall have the same powers and perform like duties in all respects as are by
statute conferred upon and required of boards of review in townships, except as
otherwise provided in this Charter. It shall hear the complaints of all persons
considering themselves aggrieved by assessments, and if it shall appear that
any person or property has been wrongfully assessed or omitted from the roll
the Board shall correct the roll in such manner as it deems just. In all cases
the roll shall be reviewed according to the facts existing on the tax day and
no change in the status of any property after said day shall be considered by
the Board in making its decisions. Except as otherwise provided by statute, no
person other than the Board of Review shall make or authorize any change upon
or additions or corrections to the assessment roll. It shall be the duty of the
Assessor to keep a permanent record of all proceedings and to enter therein all
resolutions and decisions of the Board.
Section 6.19    Endorsement of Roll.
    After the Board of Review has completed its review of the assessment roll,
and not later than the first Monday in April, the majority of its members shall
endorse thereon and sign a statement to the effect that the same is the
assessment roll of the City for the year in which it has been prepared. The
omission of such endorsement shall not affect the validity of such roll.
Section 6.20    Certification of Taxation and Assessments.
    Within three days after the Council has adopted the budget for the ensuing
year, the Clerk shall certify to the Assessor the total amount which the
Council determines shall be raised by general ad valorem tax. He shall also
certify all amounts of current or delinquent special assessments and all other
amounts which the Council requires to be assessed, reassessed or charged upon
any property or against any person.
Section 6.21    City Tax Roll.
    After the Board of Review has completed its review of the assessment roll,
the Assessor shall prepare a copy of the assessment roll to be known as the
"City Tax Roll" and upon receiving the certification of the several amounts to
be raised as provided in Section 6.19, the Assessor shall spread upon said tax
roll the several amounts determined by the Council to be charged, assessed or
reassessed against persons or property. He shall also spread the amounts of the
general City tax according to and in proportion to the several valuations set
forth in said assessment roll. To avoid fractions in computation on any tax
roll, the Assessor may add to the amount of several taxes to be raised not more
than the amount prescribed by statute. Any excess created thereby on any tax
rolls shall belong to the City.
Section 6.22    City Tax Roll Certified for Collection.
    After spreading the taxes the Assessor shall certify the tax roll and
attach his warrant thereto directing and requiring the City Treasurer to
collect, prior to the date required by statute, from the several persons named
in said roll, the several sums mentioned therein opposite their respective
names as a tax or assessment and granting to him, for the purpose of collecting
the taxes, assessments and charges on such roll, all the statutory powers and
immunities possessed by township treasurers for the collection of taxes. The
tax roll shall be delivered to the Treasurer for collection on or before the
first day of June.
Section 6.23    Taxes a Lien.
    On June 15 the taxes thus assessed shall become a debt due to the City from
the persons to whom they are assessed. On July 1 the amounts assessed on any
interest in real property shall become a lien upon such real property for such
amounts and for all interest and charges thereon, and all personal taxes shall
become a first lien on all personal property of such persons so assessed.
   The liens shall take precedence over all other claims, encumbrances and
liens to the extent provided by statute, and shall continue until such taxes,
interest and charges are paid.
Section 6.24    Taxes Due; Notification.
    City taxes shall be due on the first day of July of the year when levied.
The Treasurer shall not be required to call upon the persons named in the City
tax roll, nor to make personal demand for the payment of taxes, but he shall
give notice to the taxpayers of the City by publication in a newspaper at least
twice, the last of which publication of notice shall be made at least ten days
prior to the first day of July in each year, of the time when said taxes will
be due collection, or shall give such notice by first class mail addressed to
the owners of the property upon which taxes are assessed according to the names
of such owners and their addresses as indicated on the tax roll, which notice
shall be deemed sufficient for the payments of all taxes on said roll. Failure
on the part of the Treasurer to give said notice shall not invalidate the taxes
on said tax roll nor release any person or property assessed from the penalty
provided in this Charter in case of nonpayment of the same.
Section 6.25    Collection of City Taxes.
    City taxes shall be due and payable on the first day of July of each year.
To all taxes there shall be added one percent as an administrative fee. To all
taxes paid after September 30, there shall be added a two percent penalty. The
added administrative fee, penalties and interest herein provided shall belong
to the City and shall constitute a charge and shall be a lien against the
property to which the taxes themselves apply, collectible in the same manner as
the taxes to which they are added.
Section 6.26    Return to County Treasurer.
    All City taxes on real property remaining uncollected by the City Treasurer
at the end of the last day for collection of County and School taxes shall be
returned to the County Treasurer in the manner and with like effect as provided
by statute for returns by township treasurers of township, school and county
taxes. Such returns shall include all the additional assessments, charges and
fees hereinbefore provided, which shall be added to the amount assessed in said
tax roll against each property or person. The taxes thus returned shall be
collected in the same manner as other taxes returned to the County Treasurer
are collected, in accordance with statute, and shall be and remain a lien upon
the property against which they are assessed until paid. If by change in
statute or otherwise, the County Treasurer is no longer charged with the
collection of delinquent real property taxes, such taxes shall be collected in
the manner then provided by statute for the collection of delinquent township,
school and county taxes.
Section 6.27    Failure or Refusal to Pay Personal Property Tax.
   If any person, firm or corporation shall neglect or refuse to pay any
personal property tax assessed to him or them by November first, the Treasurer
shall collect the same by seizing the personal property of such person, firm or
corporation to an amount sufficient to pay such tax, fees and charges for
subsequent sale, wherever the same may be found in the State, and from which
seizure no property shall be exempt. He may sell the property seized to an
amount sufficient to pay the taxes and all charges in accordance with statutory
provisions. The Treasurer may, if otherwise unable to collect a tax on personal
property, sue, in accordance with statute, the person, firm or corporation to
whom it is assessed.
Section 6.28    Protection of City Lien.
    The City shall have the power to acquire by purchase any premises within
the City at any tax or other public sale, or by direct purchase from the State
of Michigan or the fee owner, when such purchase is necessary to protect the
lien of the City, lease or sell the same for the purpose of securing therefrom
the amount of such taxes or special assessments, or both, together with any
incidental expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of this power. Any
such procedure exercised by the City in the protection of its tax lien shall be
deemed to be for a public purpose. The Council may adopt any ordinances that
may be necessary to make this section effective.
Section 6.29    State, County and School Taxes.
    For the purpose of assessing, levying and collecting taxes for State,
County and School purposes, the City shall be considered the same as a
township, and all provisions of the law relative to the collection and
accounting for such taxes shall apply. For these purposes, the City Treasurer
shall perform the same duties and have the same powers as are granted and
imposed upon township treasurers by law.
Section 6.30    Municipal Borrowing Power.
   (a)   Subject to the applicable provisions of law, the City may borrow money
for any purpose within the scope of its powers or which may be permitted by
law, and may issue bonds or other evidences of indebtedness therefor.
   (b)   All collections on special assessment rolls or on any combination of
such rolls shall be set apart in a separate fund and shall be used for the
purpose for which levied, and for the payment of the principal and interest of
bonds issued in anticipation of such special assessments. As to such of said
bonds as are also a general obligation of the City, if there is any deficiency
in any special assessment fund to meet the payment of the principal or interest
to be paid therefrom, moneys shall be advanced from the general funds of the
City to meet such deficiency, and shall be replaced in the general funds when
the special assessment fund shall be sufficient therefor.
   (c)   Each bond or other evidence of indebtedness shall contain on its face
a statement specifying the purpose for which the same is issued, and the
proceeds thereof shall not be used for any other purpose, except that whenever
the proceeds of any bond issued, or a part thereof, remain unexpended and
unencumbered for the purpose for which said bond issue was made, the Council
may, by a unanimous vote, authorize the use of such unexpended and unencumbered
funds:
      (1)   For the retirement of such bond issue; or
      (2)   If such bond issue has been fully retired, then for the retirement
of other bonds or obligations of the City provided for by this section;
provided that in the case of special assessment bonds, such funds shall be
refunded to the owners of property against which special assessments therefor
were made, pro rata according to payments made toward the total cost of the
improvement for which the bonds were issued; or
      (3)   For such other purposes as may be permitted by law, subject to the
proviso in paragraph (2) above; or
      (4)   If such funds cannot be used as above permitted, then in any manner
approved by a unanimous vote of the Council.
   (d)   No bond or other evidence of indebtedness, regardless of type or
purpose, shall bear interest at a rate exceeding that fixed by law.
   (e)   All bonds and other evidences of indebtedness shall be signed by the
Mayor and countersigned by the Clerk, under the Seal of the City. Interest
coupons may be executed with the facsimile signatures of the Mayor and Clerk. A
complete and detailed record of all bonds and other evidences of indebtedness
shall be kept by the City Treasurer. Upon the payment of any bond or other
evidence of indebtedness, the same shall be marked "cancelled" or otherwise
defaced by the City Treasurer to indicate payment.
Section 6.31    Limitations Upon Borrowing Power.
   (a)   The net bonded indebtedness incurred for all public purposes shall not
at any time exceed ten percent of the assessed value of all the real and
personal property in the City; provided that in computing such net bonded
indebtedness, there shall be excluded all money borrowed which, by law, does
not constitute an indebtedness of the City within any constitutional or
statutory debt limitation or which is permitted by law to be in excess thereof.
The resources of the sinking fund pledged for the retirement of any outstanding
bonds shall also be deducted from the amount of the bonded indebtedness.
   (b)   No bonds shall be sold to obtain funds for any purpose other than for
which they were specifically authorized, and, if such bonds are not sold within
three years after authorization, such authorization shall be null and void.
CHAPTER 7
PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS, CONTRACTS AND UTILITIES
Section 7.1    General Power Re Special Assessments.
    The Council shall have the power to determine the necessity of any local or
public improvement and to determine that the whole or any part of the expense
thereof shall be defrayed by special assessment upon the property especially
benefited and shall so declare by resolution, provided that all special
assessments levied shall be based upon or be in proportion to the benefits
derived or to be derived. Such resolution shall state the estimated cost of the
improvement, what proportion of the cost thereof shall be paid by special
assessment and what part, if any, shall be a general obligation of the City,
and the number of installments in which assessments may be paid, and shall
designate the districts or land and premises upon which special assessments
shall be levied.
Section 7.2    Detailed Procedure to be Fixed by Ordinance.
    The Council shall prescribe by general ordinance the complete special
assessment procedure concerning the initiation of projects, plans and
specifications, estimates of costs, notice of hearings, making and confirming
assessment rolls in advance of starting the improvement, correction of errors
therein, collection of special assessments and any other matters concerning the
making of improvements by the special assessment method, subject to the
provisions of this Charter.
Section 7.3    Objection to Improvements.
    If, at or prior to final confirmation of any special assessment, more than
fifty percent of the number of owners of privately owned real property to be
assessed for any improvement, or in case of paving or similar improvements,
more than fifty percent of the number of owners of frontage to be assessed for
any such improvement, shall object in writing to the proposed improvement it
shall not be made by the proceedings authorized in this Charter without a five-
sixths vote of the members of the Council, provided that this section shall not
apply to sidewalk construction.
Section 7.4    Disposition of Excessive Special Assessments.
    The excess by which any special assessment proves larger than the actual
cost of the improvement and expenses incidental thereto may be placed in the
General Fund of the City if such excess is five percent or less of the
assessment, but should the assessment prove larger than necessary by more than
five percent, the entire excess shall be refunded on a pro rata basis to the
owners of the property assessed. Such refund shall be made by credit against
future unpaid installments to the extent such installments then exist and the
balance of such refund shall be in cash. No refunds may be made which
contravene the provisions of any outstanding evidence of indebtedness secured
in whole or in part by such special assessment.
Section 7.5    Contested Assessments.
    No suit or action of any kind shall be instituted or maintained for the
purpose of contesting or enjoining the collection of any special assessment or
reassessment (a) unless, within thirty days after confirmation of the special
assessment roll, written notice is given to the Clerk for attention of the
Council indicating an intention to file such suit or action and stating the
grounds on which it is claimed such assessment is illegal and (b) unless such
suit or action shall be commenced within sixty days after the confirmation of
the roll. If the City Attorney submits a written opinion finding said roll
illegal, in whole or in part, the Council may revoke its confirmation, correct
the illegality if possible and reconfirm the same as amended, provided that no
property which is not involved in the illegality shall be assessed more than
was imposed upon the original confirmation without future notice and hearing
thereon.
Section 7.6    Delinquent Special Assessments.
    Special assessments and all interest and charges thereon, from the date of
confirmation of the roll, shall be and remain a lien upon the property assessed
of the same character and effect as the lien created by general law for the
State and County taxes and by this Charter for City taxes, until paid. From
such date after confirmation as shall be fixed by the Council, the same
collection fees, penalties and interest shall be paid on delinquent special
assessments and upon delinquent installments of such special assessments as are
provided by this Charter to be paid on delinquent City taxes. In case any
assessment or any part thereof shall remain unpaid on the first Monday of May
following the date when the same became delinquent, the same shall be reported
unpaid by the Treasurer to the Council, and such delinquent assessments,
together with all accrued interest, shall be transferred and reassessed on the
next annual City tax roll in a column headed "special assessments" with a
penalty of four percent upon such total amount added thereto, and when so
transferred and reassessed upon said tax roll shall be collected in all
respects as provided for the collection of City taxes.

    The Council may provide by ordinance for the deferred payment of special
assessments.

repair, maintain, encumber, convey, dispose of or sell, either within or
without its corporate limits, public utilities, including, but not by way of
limitation, public utilities for supplying water, light, heat, power, gas,
sewage treatment, garbage disposal and facilities for the parking of vehicles,
and also to sell and deliver the products or service thereof, both within and
without its corporate limits, subject to limitations provided by State law. The
power to supply utility service shall include the power to purchase such
services from others.
Section 7.10    Control of Utilities.
    The Council may enact such ordinances and adopt such resolutions as may be
necessary for the care, protection, preservation, control and operation of any
public utilities which the City may in any manner acquire, own or operate, and
all fixtures, appurtenances, apparatus, building and machinery connected
therewith or belonging thereto, and to carry into effect the powers conferred
upon the City by the provisions of this Charter.
Section 7.11    Power to Fix Rates.
    The Council shall have the power to fix, from time to time, said just and
equitable rates as may be deemed advisable for supplying the inhabitants of the
City and others with water and sewer, with electricity for light, heat and
power and with such other utility services as the City may provide.
Section 7.12    Management of Municipal Utilities.
    Municipally owned utilities shall be administered as a regular department
of the City government and not by an independent board or commission.
Section 7.13    Collection of Utility Charges.
    The Council shall provide by ordinance or resolution for the collection of
all public utility charges made by the City under Act 178 of the Public Acts of
1939, as amended. When any person or persons, or any firm or corporation, shall
fail or refuse to pay to the City any sums due on utility bills, the utility
service or services upon which such delinquency exists may be shut off or
discontinued and suit may be instituted by the City for the collection of the
same in any court of competent jurisdiction. The City shall have as security
for the collection of such utility rates and charges for utility service
furnished any person or persons, or any firm or corporation, a lien upon the
real property for which such utility service is supplied, which lien shall
become effective immediately upon the supply of such utility service, and may
be enforced in accordance with the provisions of said Act No. 178 of the Public
Acts of 1939, as amended.
Section 7.14    Disposal of Utility Plants and Property.
    Unless approved by a three-fifths majority vote of the electors voting
thereon at a regular or special election, the City shall not sell, exchange,
lease or in any way dispose of any property, easement, equipment, privilege or
asset belonging to and appertaining to any Municipally owned utility. All
contracts, negotiations, licenses, grants, leases or other forms of transfer in
violation of this section shall be void and of no effect as against the City.
The restrictions of this section shall not apply to the sale or exchange of any
articles of machinery or equipment of any City owned utility which are worn out
or useless or which have been or could with advantage to the service be
replaced by new and improved machinery or equipment.
Section 7.15    Utility Accounts.
    Transactions pertaining to the ownership and operation by the City of each
public utility shall be recorded in a separate group of accounts under an
appropriate fund caption, which accounts shall be classified in accordance with
generally accepted utility accounting practice. Charges for all service
furnished to or rendered by other City departments or agencies shall be
recorded. An annual report shall be prepared to show fairly the financial
position of the utility and the results of its operation, which report shall be
available for inspection at the office of the Clerk.
Section 7.16    Contracts Generally.
    The authority to contract on behalf of the City is vested in the Council,
and shall be exercised in accordance with the provisions of the statutes and
this Charter. The Council shall establish procedures for the letting and making
of contracts. No contract, except an agreement of employment or an agreement
for the purchase or sale of goods, wares or merchandise in an amount of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) or more, shall be made unless the same shall have
first been submitted to the Attorney and his opinion obtained with respect to
its legality and form. Any such contract in an amount of less than five hundred
dollars ($500.00) may be approved by the head of the department to be charged.
Department heads shall certify that sufficient funds are available in the
budget or that an appropriation has been made for the payment of all contracts
thereof. In the case of a contract obligating the City for periodic payments in
future fiscal years for the furnishing of a continuing service or the leasing
of property, such certification need not cover payments on the contract which
will be due in future fiscal years, but this exception shall not apply to a
contract for the construction of a public improvement. A copy of all contracts
requiring such opinion and certification shall be filed in the office of the
Clerk.
   No contract shall be amended after the same has been made except upon the
authority of the Council.
   No compensation shall be paid to any contractor except in accordance with
the terms of the contract.
   No contract shall be made with any person, firm or corporation who is in
default to the City.
Section 7.17    Deferred Payment Contracts.
    The City Council may enter into installment contracts for the purchase of
property or capital equipment. Each such contract shall not extend over a
period greater than ten years, nor shall the total amounts of principal payment
under all such contracts exceed a sum permitted by law. Each such deferred
payment shall be included in the budget for the year in which each respective
installment is payable.
Section 7.18    Conflicts of Interest.
    An officer or employee of the City who intends to have business dealings
with the City whereby he may derive any income or benefits, other than such as
are provided as remuneration for his official duties, shall file with the Clerk
a statement, under oath, setting forth the nature of such business dealings and
his interest therein. The statement shall be filed with the Clerk not less than
ten days before the date when action may be taken by the Council or any other
officer or agency of the City upon the matter involved. The statement shall be
spread upon the proceedings of the Council for the meeting at which it is
received and published in full therewith. In each case where the type of
dealings with the City is on a continuing basis, involving more than one or a
sequence of transactions described in the statement, each such statement shall
stand for and apply to such transactions for a period of one year and may be
renewed at the end of each one-year period for so long as such transactions
continue. Each such renewal shall be spread upon the proceedings of the Council
and published as in the case of the original statement. In the event that the
interest of any officer or employee of the City in any business dealings with
the City changes at any time, he shall file a statement thereof as herein
required, which statement shall also be spread upon the proceedings of the
Council and published as herein required. Any business dealing made in
violation of this section shall be void.

resolution, shall be given in such manner as shall be prescribed by ordinance
or resolution. Objections to such proposed action of the Council may be filed

   (a)   Definitions. As used in this Chapter, “Authorized local official”
means a police officer or the Ordinance Enforcement Officer, whose is hereby
legally authorized to issue municipal civil infraction citations.
   (b)   Procedure to Enforce Codified Ordinance Violations.   
      (1)   Initial identification of an ordinance violation. The authorized
local official shall meet with any individual(s) responsible for a violation of
the Ordinance to educate and inform them of the infraction. The alleged
violator shall have a minimum of three business days to take corrective action
evidenced in writing with agreement of the Authorized local official to correct
the alleged violation. If corrected timely, no further action will be taken.
      (2)   Written notice. If violation is not addressed based on the initial
discussion with the authorized local official, the authorized local official
will document the situation using an ordinance violation notification form
approved by the City Council for the City and present a copy to the individual
responsible for the infraction. The notification shall specify the violation
and provide that the violation must be addressed within three business days or
a municipal civil infraction citation may be issued.
      (3)   Continued violation. In the event an alleged violation continues
after written notice, the authorized local official is authorized to issue a
municipal civil infraction. In the sole discretion of the authorized local
official, the authorized local official may issue a municipal civil infraction
citation without advance verbal or written notification as provided above.
   (c)   Municipal Civil Infraction. Any violation or failure to comply with
the ordinance requirements herein is a municipal civil infraction. An
authorized local official, including the Ordinance Enforcement Officer may
issue a municipal civil infraction citation upon personally witnessing a
violation. The authorized local official may also issue a citation to a person
if, based upon investigation of a complaint by someone who allegedly witnessed
the person violate an ordinance, a violation of which is a municipal civil
infraction, the official has reasonable cause to believe that the person is
responsible for a municipal civil infraction and if the City Attorney approves
in writing the issuance of the citation.
   (d)   Minors. If the person is cited as a minor, that individual shall be
permitted to appear in court or to admit responsibility for a civil infraction
without the necessity of appointment of a guardian or next friend. A court
having jurisdiction over a municipal civil infraction shall have jurisdiction
over the minor and may proceed in the same manner as if that individual were an
adult.which the defendant is alleged to be responsible for a municipal civil
infraction as defined by state law and this Code. The plaintiff in a municipal
civil infraction action shall be the City of Perry if the alleged municipal
civil infraction is a violation of this Code, any other City ordinance
designating the violation as a municipal civil infraction or a state law
designating a violation as a municipal civil infraction.
   (f)   Continuing violation. As provided for in this Chapter, each act of
violation and every day upon which any violation is permitted or suffered to
exist or continue shall constitute a separate violation and shall be punished
separately upon admission or determination of responsibility. The penalty
provided by this Chapter, shall apply to any amendment or addition to this
Chapter or to the provisions of this Code defining substantive violations of
this Section whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory
ordinance.
   (g)   Disposition of Municipal Civil Infraction Cases.
      (1)   If a defendant is determined to be responsible or responsible “with
explanation” for a municipal civil infraction, the judge or district court
magistrate may order the defendant to pay a civil fine, costs as provided for
by law, and, if applicable, damages and expenses as provided in Michigan
Compiled Laws Section 8733(2). In the order of judgment, the judge or district
court magistrate may grant a defendant permission to pay a civil fine, costs,
and damages and expenses within a specified period of time or in specified
installments. Otherwise, the civil fine, costs, and damages and expenses are
due immediately. If a defendant is ordered to pay a civil fine, the judge or
district court magistrate shall summarily tax and determine the costs of the
action, which are not limited to the costs taxable in ordinary civil actions
and may include all expenses, direct and indirect, to which the plaintiff has
been put in connection with the municipal civil infraction, up to the entry of
judgment. Costs of not less than nine dollars ($9.00) or more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00) shall be ordered. Except as otherwise provided by state law,
costs shall be payable to the general fund of the plaintiff. In addition to
ordering the defendant to pay a civil fine, costs, and damages and expenses,
the judge or district court magistrate may issue a writ or order under Michigan
Compiled Laws Section 8302.
      (2)   The schedule of civil fines and costs to be imposed for municipal
civil infractions which are required to be posted shall also be readily
available for public inspection. The schedule need not include all municipal
civil infractions. The schedule may exclude cases on the basis of a defendant’s
prior record of municipal civil infractions.
      (3)   A default in the payment of a civil fine, costs, or damages or
expenses ordered pursuant to state law and this Code or an installment of the
fine, costs, or damages or expenses as determined by the court may be collected
by a means authorized for the enforcement of a judgment pursuant to state
law.   
      (4)   If a defendant fails to comply with an order or judgment issued
pursuant to state law within the time prescribed by the court, the court may
proceed under Michigan Compiled Laws Sections 8729, 8731, or 8733, as
applicable.
      (5)   A defendant who fails to answer a citation or notice to appear in
court for a municipal civil infraction is guilty of a misdemeanor as provided
for in state law.
      (6)   Default in payment of fines, costs, damages, or expenses.
         A.   If a defendant defaults in the payment of a civil fine, costs,
or, if applicable, damages or expenses as provided in state law, or any
installment, as ordered, the court, upon the motion of the plaintiff or upon
its own motion, may require the defendant to show cause why the defendant
should not be held in civil contempt and may issue a summons, order to show
cause, or a bench warrant of arrest for the defendant’s appearance.   
         B.   If a corporation or an association is ordered to pay a civil
fine, costs, or damages or expenses, the individuals authorized to make
disbursement shall pay the fine, costs, or damages or expenses, and their
failure to do so shall be civil contempt unless they make the showing required
in this section.
         C.   Unless the defendant shows that the default was not attributable
to an intentional refusal to obey the order of the court or to a failure on his
or her part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for
payment, the court shall find that the default constitutes a civil contempt and
may order the defendant committed until all or a specified part of the amount
due is paid.   
         D.   If it appears that the default in the payment of a fine, costs,
or damages or expenses does not constitute civil contempt, the court may enter
an order allowing the defendant additional time for payment, reducing the
amount of payment or of each installment, or revoking the fine, costs, or
damages or expenses.
      (7)   Fines. Each municipal civil infraction shall carry a fine of fifty
dollars ($50.00) for each occurrence. All subsequent offense for the same or
similar violation by the same defendant shall carry a fine of two hundred
dollars ($200.00) and shall be denoted on the Municipal Civil Infraction
Citation.

believe that the person is responsible for a municipal civil infraction; or   
         B.   Based upon investigation of a complaint by someone who allegedly
witnessed the person commit a municipal civil infraction, the official has
reasonable cause to believe that the person is responsible for an infraction,
and the City Attorney approves in writing the issuance of the citation.   
      (6)   Municipal civil infraction citations shall be served by an
authorized City official as follows:
         A.   Except as provided below, an authorized City official shall
personally serve a copy of the citation upon the alleged violator.
         B.   If the municipal civil infraction involves the use or occupancy

or occupant of the land, building or structure by posting the copy on the land
or attaching the copy to the building or structure. In addition, a copy of the
citation shall be sent by first class mail to the owner of the land, building

made the discretion of Council. When Council determines to make any public
improvement or repair, and to defray the whole or any part of the cost and
expense thereof by special assessment, Council shall so declare by resolution,
stating the improvement and portion of the expense thereof which shall be paid
by special assessment and what part, if any, shall be appropriated from the
general funds of the City or from street funds, and shall designate the
district or lands and premises upon which the special assessment shall be
levied.
(Ord. 94. Passed 11-22-65.)
206.02   ESTIMATES; NOTICE OF PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS; PETITIONS.
   Before ordering any public improvement or repair, any part of the expense of
which is to be defrayed by special assessment, Council shall cause estimates of
the expenses thereof, and plats and diagrams, when practical, of the work and
of the locality to be improved, to be made, and shall deposit the same with the
City Clerk for public examination. Council shall give notice thereof, of the
proposed improvement or work, of the district to be assessed and of the time
when Council will meet and consider objections thereto by publication for at
least two weeks in a newspaper circulated in the City. Unless a majority of the
persons to be assessed petition therefor, no such improvement or work shall be
ordered, except by the concurrence of two-thirds of the Councilpersons elect.
(Ord. 94. Passed 11-22-65.)
206.03   COSTS OF IMPROVEMENTS; LIMITS.
   The cost and expense of any improvement which may be defrayed by special
assessment shall include the costs of surveys, plans, assessments and
construction. In no case shall the whole amount to be levied by special
assessment upon any lot or premises for any one improvement exceed seventy-five
percent of the value of such lot or land, as valued and assessed for State and
County taxation in the last preceding tax roll. Any cost exceeding seventy-five
percent, which cost would otherwise be chargeable on such lot or premises,
shall be paid by the lot owner prior to the assessment thereof, or the same may
be paid from the General Fund of the City.
(Ord. 94. Passed 11-22-65.)
206.04   ASSESSMENTS LEVIED PRIOR TO IMPROVEMENTS.
   Special assessments to defray the estimated cost of any improvement shall be
levied before the making of the improvement.
(Ord. 94. Passed 11-22-65.)
206.05   ASSESSMENT DISTRICTS.
   When any special assessment is to be made pro rata upon the lots and
premises in any special district, according to frontage or benefits, Council
shall, by resolution, direct the same to be made by the City Assessor, shall
state therein the amount to be assessed and whether according to frontage or
benefits, and shall describe or designate the lots and premises or locality
constituting the assessment district.
(Ord. 94. Passed 11-22-65.)
206.06   ASSESSMENT ROLL.
   Upon receiving the order and directions provided for in Section 206.05, the
City Assessor shall make out an assessment roll, entering and describing
therein all lots, premises or parcels of land to be assessed, with the names of
the persons, if known, chargeable with the assessments thereon, and shall levy
thereon and against such persons the amount to be assessed, in the manner
directed by Council and this chapter, applicable to the assessment. In all
cases where the ownership of any description is unknown to the City Assessor,
he or she shall, in lieu of the name of the owner, insert the name "unknown."
If, by mistake or otherwise, any person shall be improperly designated as the
owner of any lot, parcel of land or premises, or if the same shall be assessed
without the name of the owner or in the name of a person other than the owner,
such assessment shall not, for any such cause, be vitiated, but shall, in all
respects, be as valid upon and against such lot, parcel of land or premises as
though assessed in the name of the proper owner. When the assessment roll has
been confirmed, the same shall be a lien on such lot, parcel of land or
premises and shall be collected as in other cases.
(Ord. 94. Passed 11-22-65.)
206.07   METHOD OF DETERMINATION; CERTIFICATES.
   If an assessment is required to be according to frontage, the City Assessor
shall assess, to each lot or parcel of land, such relative portion of the whole
amount to be levied as the length of the front of such premises abutting upon
the improvement bears to the whole frontage of all the lots to be assessed,
unless on account of the shape or size of any lot an assessment by a different
number of feet would be more equitable. If the assessment is directed to be
according to benefits, the City Assessor shall assess upon each lot such
relative portion of the whole sum to be levied as shall be proportionate to the
estimated benefit resulting to such lot from the improvement. When the City
Assessor has completed the assessment, he or she shall report the same to
Council. Such report shall be signed by the City Assessor and may be in the
form of a certificate, endorsed on the assessment roll, as follows:
   STATE OF MICHIGAN   )

(Ord. 94. Passed 11-22-65.)
206.11   ASSESSMENTS AS LIENS.
   All special assessments shall, from the date of the confirmation thereof,
constitute a lien upon the respective lots or parcels of land assessed, and
shall be charged against the person to whom assessed until paid.
(Ord. 94. Passed 11-22-65.)
206.12   PAYMENTS.
   (a)   Upon the confirmation of any special assessment, the amount thereof
may be divided into not more than ten installments, one of which shall be
collected each year, at such time as Council shall determine, with annual
interest at a rate not exceeding six percent per annum. However, the whole
assessment after confirmation may be paid to the City Treasurer at any time in
full, with the proportionate interest thereon.
   (b)   All special assessments, except such installments thereof as Council
shall make payable in the future, as provided in subsection (a) hereof, shall
be due and payable upon confirmation.
   (c)   If any special assessment is divided into installments, a special
assessment roll shall be made for each installment as the same shall become
due, with the accrued interest upon all unpaid installments included and
assessed therein. Such special rolls may be made and confirmed without notice
to any person assessed.
(Ord. 94. Passed 11-22-65.)
206.13   DIVISION OF LOTS OR LAND; APPORTIONMENT.
   If any lot or land is divided after a special assessment thereon has been
confirmed and divided into installments, and before the collection of all
installments, Council may require the City Assessor to apportion the
uncollected amounts upon the several parts of lots and land so divided. The
report of such apportionment, when confirmed, shall be conclusive upon all
parties, and all assessments thereafter made upon such lot or land shall be
according to such division.
(Ord. 94. Passed 11-22-65.)
206.14   PRO RATA ASSESSMENTS; REFUNDS.
   If any special assessment proves insufficient to pay for the improvement or
work for which it was levied and the expenses incident thereto, Council may,
within the limitations prescribed for such assessments, make an additional pro
rata assessment to supply the deficiency. If a larger amount has been collected
than was necessary, the excess shall be refunded ratably to those by whom it
was paid.
(Ord. 94. Passed 11-22-65.)
206.15   INVALID ASSESSMENTS.
   Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of Council, be invalid
by reason of irregularity or informality in the proceedings, or if any court of
competent jurisdiction shall adjudge such assessment to be illegal, Council,
whether or not the improvement has been made, or whether or not any part of the
assessment has been paid, may cause a new assessment to be made for the same
purpose for which the former assessment was made. All proceedings on such
reassessment and for the collection thereof shall be conducted in the same
manner as provided for the original assessment. Whenever any sum or part
thereof levied upon any premises in the assessment so set aside has been paid
and not refunded, the payment so made shall be applied upon the reassessment on
such premises, and the reassessment shall, to that extent, be deemed satisfied.
(Ord. 94. Passed 11-22-65.)
206.16   LIENS TO STAND.
   No judgment or decree, nor any act of Council vacating a special assessment,
shall destroy or impair the lien of the City upon the premises assessed for
such amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged against the same, or
as by a regular mode of proceeding might have been lawfully assessed thereon.
(Ord. 94. Passed 11-22-65.)
206.17   LEVY OF ASSESSMENTS; COLLECTION.
   When any special assessment is confirmed and payable, Council may direct the
City Clerk to report to the City Assessor a description of the lots and
premises that are contained in the assessment roll, with the amount of the
assessment levied upon each and the name of the owner or occupant against whom
the assessment was made. Council may direct the City Assessor to levy the
several sums so assessed as taxes upon the several lots and premises to which
they were assessed, respectively. Upon receiving such report, the City Assessor
shall levy the sums therein mentioned upon the respective lots and premises to
which they are specially assessed, and against the persons chargeable
therewith, as a tax in the next tax roll thereafter, in a column for special
assessments. Thereupon, the amounts so levied in the tax roll shall be
collected and enforced with the other taxes in the tax roll and in the same
manner, and shall continue to be a lien upon the premises assessed until paid.
When such taxes are collected, they shall be paid into the City Treasury.
(Ord. 94. Passed 11-22-65.)
206.18   CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of this chapter and

CHAPTER 212
Freedom of Information Act Policy
212.01   Freedom of Information Act Policy.
212.01   FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT POLICY.
   (a)   Statement of Principles.
      (1)   It is the policy of The City of Perry that all persons, except
those incarcerated, consistent with the Michigan Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA), are entitled to full and complete information regarding the affairs of
government and the official acts of those who represent them as public
officials and employees. The people shall be informed so that they fully
participate in the democratic process.
      (2)   The City's policy with respect to FOIA requests is to comply with
State law in all respects and to respond to FOIA requests in a consistent,
fair, and even-handed manner regardless of who makes such a request.
      (3)   The City acknowledges that it has a legal obligation to disclose
all nonexempt public records in its possession pursuant to a FOIA request. The
City acknowledges that sometimes it is necessary to invoke the exemptions
identified under FOIA in order to ensure the effective operation of government
and to protect the privacy of individuals.
      (4)   The City of Perry will protect the public's interest in disclosure,
while balancing the requirement to withhold or redact portions of certain
records. The City's policy is to disclose public records consistent with and in
compliance with State law.
      (5)   The Perry City Council has established the following written
procedures and guidelines to implement the FOIA and will create a written
public summary of the specific procedures and guidelines relevant to the
general public regarding how to submit written requests to the public body and
explaining how to understand a public body's written responses, deposit
requirements, fee calculations, and avenues for challenge and appeal. The
written public summary will be written in a manner so as to be easily
understood by the general public.
   (b)   General Policies.
      (1)   The City of Perry, acting pursuant to the authority at M.C.L.A.
15.236, designates the Perry City Clerk as the FOIA Coordinator. He or she is
authorized to designate other City staff to act on his or her behalf to accept
and process written requests for the City's public records and approve denials.
      (2)   If a request for a public record is received by fax or email, the
request is deemed to have been received on the following business day. If a
request is sent by email and delivered to a City spam or junk-mail folder, the
request is not deemed received until one day after the FOIA Coordinator first
becomes aware of the request. The FOIA Coordinator shall note in the FOIA log
both the date the request was delivered to the spam or junk-mail folder and the
date the FOIA Coordinator became aware of the request.
      (3)   The FOIA Coordinator shall review City spam and junk-mail folders
on a regular basis, which shall be no less than once a month. The FOIA
Coordinator shall work with City Information Technology staff to develop
administrative rules for handling spam and junk-mail so as to protect City
systems from computer attacks which may be imbedded in an electronic FOIA
request.
      (4)   The FOIA Coordinator may, in his or her discretion, implement
administrative rules, consistent with State law and these Procedures and
Guidelines to administer the acceptance and processing of FOIA requests.
      (5)   The City is not obligated to create a new public record or make a
compilation or summary of information which does not already exist. Neither the
FOIA Coordinator nor other City staff are obligated to provide answers to
questions contained in requests for public records or regarding the content of
the records themselves. The FOIA Coordinator shall keep a copy of all written
requests for public records received by the City on file for a period of at
least one year.
      (6)   The City will make this Procedures and Guidelines document and the
Written Public Summary publicly available without charge. If it does not, the
City cannot require deposits or charge fees otherwise permitted under the FOIA
until it is in compliance.
      (7)   A copy of this Procedures and Guidelines document and the City's
Written Public Summary must be publicly available by providing free copies both
in the City's response to a written request and upon request by visitors at the
City Hall.
   (c)   Requesting a Public Record.
      (1)   No specific form to submit a request for a public record is
required. However the FOIA Coordinator may make available a FOIA Request Form
for use by the public.
      (2)   Requests to inspect or obtain copies of public records prepared,
owned, used, possessed or retained by the City may be submitted on the City
FOIA Request Form or in any other form of writing (letter, fax, email, etc.).
      (3)   If a person makes a verbal, non-written request for information
believed to be available on the City website, where practicable and to the best
ability of the employee receiving the request, the person shall be informed of
the pertinent website address.
      (4)   A request must sufficiently describe a public record so as to
enable City personnel to identify and find the requested public record.
      (5)   Written requests for public records may be submitted in person or
by mail to any City office. Requests may also be submitted electronically by
fax and email. Upon their receipt, requests for public records shall be
promptly forwarded to the FOIA Coordinator for processing.
      (6)   A person may request that public records be provided on non-paper
physical media, emailed or otherwise provided to him or her in digital form in
lieu of paper copies. The City will comply with the request only if it
possesses the necessary technological capability to provide records in the
requested non-paper physical media format.
      (7)   A person may subscribe to future issues of public records that are
created, issued or disseminated by The City of Perry on a regular basis. A
subscription is valid for up to 6 months and may be renewed by the subscriber.
      (8)   A person serving a sentence of imprisonment in a local, state or
federal correctional facility is not entitled to submit a request for a public
record. The FOIA Coordinator will deny all such requests.
   (d)   Processing a Request.
      (1)   Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the person making the
request, the City will issue a response within 5 business days of receipt of a
FOIA request. If a request is received by fax, email or other electronic
transmission, the request is deemed to have been received on the following
business day.
      (2)   The City will respond to a request in one of the following ways:
         A.   Grant the request.
         B.   Issue a written notice denying the request.
         C.   Grant the request in part and issue a written notice denying in
part the request.
         D.   Issue a notice indicating that due to the nature of the request
the City needs an additional 10 business days to respond for a total of no more
than 15 business days. Only one such extension is permitted.
         E.   Issue a written notice indicating that the public record
requested is available at no charge on the City website.
      (3)   When a request is granted:
         A.   If the request is granted, or granted in part, the FOIA
Coordinator will require that payment be made in full for the allowable fees
associated with responding to the request before the public record is made
available.
         B.   The FOIA Coordinator shall provide a detailed itemization of the
allowable costs incurred to process the request to the person making the
request.
         C.   A copy of these Procedures and Guidelines and the Written Public
Summary will be provided to the requestor free of charge with the response to a
written request for public records.
         D.   If the cost of processing a FOIA request is fifty dollars
($50.00) or less, the requester will be notified of the amount due and where
the documents can be obtained.
         E.   If the cost of processing a FOIA request is expected to exceed
fifty dollars ($50.00) based on a good-faith calculation, or if the requestor
has not paid in full for a previously granted request, the City will require a
good-faith deposit pursuant to subsection (e) of this policy before processing
the request.
         F.   In making the request for a good-faith deposit the FOIA
Coordinator shall provide the requestor with a detailed itemization of the
allowable costs estimated to be incurred by the City to process the request and
also provide a best efforts estimate of a time frame it will take the City to
provide the records to the requestor. The best efforts estimate shall be
nonbinding on the City, but will be made in good faith and will strive to be
reasonably accurate, given the nature of the request in the particular
instance, so as to provide the requested records in a manner based on the
public policy expressed by subsection (b) of the FOIA.
      (4)   When a request is denied or denied in part:
         A.   If the request is denied or denied in part, the FOIA Coordinator
will issue a Notice of Denial which shall provide in the applicable
circumstance:
            1.   An explanation as to why a requested public record is exempt
from disclosure; or
            2.   A certificate that the requested record does not exist under
the name or description provided by the requestor, or another name reasonably
known by the City; or
            3.   An explanation or description of the public record or
information within a public record that is separated or deleted from the public
record; and
            4.   An explanation of the person's right to submit an appeal of
the denial to either the Mayor or seek judicial review in the Shiawassee County
Circuit Court;
            5.   An explanation of the right to receive attorneys' fees, costs,
and disbursements as well actual or compensatory damages, and punitive damages
of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), should they prevail in Circuit Court.
            6.   The Notice of Denial shall be signed by the FOIA Coordinator
or City Attorney.
         B.   If a request does not sufficiently describe a public record, the
FOIA Coordinator may, in lieu of issuing a Notice of Denial indicating that the
request is deficient, seek clarification or amendment of the request by the
person making the request. Any clarification or amendment will be considered a
new request subject to the timelines described in this Section.
      (5)   Requests to inspect public records. The City shall provide
reasonable facilities and opportunities for persons to examine and inspect
public records during normal business hours. The FOIA Coordinator is authorized
to promulgate rules regulating the manner in which records may be viewed so as
to protect City records from loss, alteration, mutilation or destruction and to
prevent excessive interference with normal City operations.
      (6)   Requests for certified copies. The FOIA Coordinator shall, upon
written request, furnish a certified copy of a public record at no additional
cost to the person requesting the public record.
   (e)   Fee Deposits.
      (1)   If the fee estimate is expected to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00)
based on a good-faith calculation, the requestor will be asked to provide a
deposit not exceeding one-half of the total estimated fee. The deposit must be
received by the City within 48 days of the dated notice. If the deposit is not
received, by said date, the request shall be considered abandoned and the City
is no longer required to fulfill the request.
      (2)   If a request for public records is from a person who has not paid
the City in full for copies of public records made in fulfillment of a
previously granted written request, the FOIA Coordinator will require a deposit
of 100% of the estimated processing fee before beginning to search for a public
record for any subsequent written request by that person when all of the
following conditions exist:
         A.   The final fee for the prior written request is not more than 105%
of the estimated fee;
         B.   The public records made available contained the information
sought in the prior written request and remain in the City's possession;
         C.   The public records were made available to the individual, subject
to payment, within the time frame estimated by the City to provide the records;
         D.   Ninety (90) days have passed since the FOIA Coordinator notified
the individual in writing that the public records were available for pickup or
mailing;
         E.   The individual is unable to show proof of prior payment to the
City; and
         F.   The FOIA Coordinator has calculated a detailed itemization that
is the basis for the current written request's increased estimated fee deposit.
      (3)   The FOIA Coordinator will not require an increased estimated fee
deposit if any of the following apply:
         A.   The person making the request is able to show proof of prior
payment in full to the City;
         B.   The City is subsequently paid in full for the applicable prior
written request; or

made the request for which full payment was not remitted to the City.
   (f)   Calculation of Fees.
      (1)   A fee may be charged for the labor cost of copying/duplication.
      (2)   A fee will not be charged for the labor cost of search,
examination, review and the deletion and separation of exempt from nonexempt
information unless failure to charge a fee would result in unreasonably high
costs to the City because of the nature of the request in the particular
instance, and the City specifically identifies the nature of the unreasonably
high costs.
      (3)   Costs for the search, examination review, and deletion and
separation of exempt from non-exempt information are "unreasonably high" when
they are excessive and beyond the normal or usual amount for those services.
      (4)   The following factors shall be used to determine an unreasonably
high cost to the City:
         A.   Volume of the public record requested.
         B.   Amount of time spent to search for, examine, review and separate

responding to the particular request.
      (5)   The Michigan FOIA statute permits the City to charge for the
following costs associated with processing a request:

includes making paper copies, making digital copies, or transferring digital
public records to non-paper physical media or through the Internet.
         B.   Labor costs associated with searching for, locating and examining
a requested public record, when failure to charge a fee will result in
unreasonably high costs to the City.

delete information exempt from disclosure, when failure to charge a fee will
result in unreasonably high costs to the City.
         D.   The cost of copying or duplication, not including labor, of paper
copies of public records. This may include the cost for copies of records
already on the City website if you ask for the City to make copies.
         E.   The cost of computer discs, computer tapes or other digital or
similar media when the requester asks for records in non-paper physical media.
This may include the cost for copies of records already on the City website if

      (6)   Labor costs will be calculated based on the following requirements:

is less than 15 minutes, there will be no charge.
         B.   Labor costs will be charged at the hourly wage of the lowest-paid
City employee capable of doing the work in the specific fee category,
regardless of who actually performs work.
         C.   Labor costs will also include a charge to cover or partially
cover the cost of fringe benefits.
         D.   The City may add up to 50% to the applicable labor charge amount
to cover or partially cover the cost of fringe benefits, but in no case may it
exceed the actual cost of fringe benefits.

to by the requestor; overtime costs will not be used to calculate the fringe
benefit cost.
         F.   Contracted labor costs will be charged at the hourly rate of
forty- eight dollars, ninety cents ($48.90) (6 times the state minimum hourly
wage).
      (7)   The cost to provide records on non-paper physical media when so
requested will be based on the following requirements:
         A.   Computer disks, computer tapes or other digital or similar media
will be at the actual and most reasonably economical cost for the non-paper
media.
         B.   This cost will only be assessed if the City has the technological
capability necessary to provide the public record in the requested non-paper
physical media format.
         C.   The City will procure any non-paper media and will not accept
media from the requestor in order to ensure integrity of the City's technology

paper. Copies for non-standard sized sheets of paper will reflect the actual
cost of reproduction.
         B.   The City will provide records using double-sided printing, if it
is cost-saving and available.

time permitted under FOIA up to a 50% maximum reduction, if any of the

of the FOIA Coordinator.
      (2)   The appeal must be in writing, specifically state the word "appeal"
and identify the reason or reasons the requestor is seeking a reversal of the

      (4)   If the Mayor fails to respond to a written appeal, or if the Mayor

function.

      (1)   "Fee" means the total fee or any component of the total fee
calculated under subsection (e) of the FOIA, including any deposit.
      (2)   If a requestor believes that the fee charged by the City to process

fee reduction to the office of the FOIA Coordinator.
      (3)   The appeal must be in writing, specifically state the word "appeal"
and identify how the required fee exceeds the amount permitted. The City FOIA

of an appeal, the requesting person may commence a civil action in Shiawassee
County Circuit Court for a fee reduction.
      (8)   If a civil action is commenced against the City for an excess fee,
the City is not obligated to complete the processing of the written request for
the public record at issue until the court resolves the fee dispute.
      (9)   An action shall not be filed in Circuit Court unless one of the
following applies:
         A.   The City does not provide for appeals of fees;
         B.   The Mayor failed to respond to a written appeal as required; or
         C.   The Mayor issued a determination to a written appeal.
      (10)   If a court determines that the City required a fee that exceeds
the amount permitted under its publicly available procedures and guidelines or
subsection (e) of the FOIA, the court shall reduce the fee to a permissible
amount. Failure to comply with an order of the court may be punished as
contempt of court.
      (11)   If the requesting person prevails in court by receiving a

award all or an appropriate portion of reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and
disbursements. The award shall be assessed against the public body liable for
damages.

previous FOIA policies promulgated by The City, these Procedures and Guidelines

administrative rule promulgated by the FOIA Coordinator is controlling.
      (2)   To the extent that any provision of these Procedures and Guidelines
or any administrative rule promulgated by the FOIA Coordinator pertaining to

authorized to modify this policy and all previous policies adopted by the City
Council, and to adopt such administrative rules as he or she may deem
necessary, to facilitate the legal review and processing of requests for public
records made pursuant to Michigan's FOIA statute, provided that such

      (2)   Officers shall keep the safety of the participant in mind when
performing assignments. Instruction shall be given to the participant that is
consistent with the rules of the Program, it should be reinforced that unless
otherwise directed by the officer, they are to remain with the patrol vehicle

NOTE: If it is desired to have the participant to enter private property,
permission must be gained from the owner or person in control of the property.
      (3)   Officers shall familiarize the participant with the equipment in
the patrol vehicle and how it functions.
      (4)   Officers are expected to answer the participant’s questions in a
thoughtful and truthful manner. Tactical or operational information of the
Department that is considered confidential shall not be disclosed. Officers
shall keep in mind the rules of the Department considering the release of
information.
      (5)   The officer is responsible to pre-plan with the participant some
safe drop off places that can be utilized. If the officer is assigned or
becomes involved in a serious felony incident, motor vehicle pursuit or at any
other time the officer feels it is necessary, the officer is to drop the
participant at one of the safe places and then notify dispatch of the location.
As soon as practical the host officer shall retrieve the participant or cause

directions of the officer.
         B.   The participant creates conflict or an unsafe condition for the
officer.
         C.   Conditions exist that make it unsafe or inappropriate for the
participant to continue.
         D.   It is determined that the participant was untruthful in the
application for participation in the Program.
   (g)   Compliance. Violations of this policy, or portions thereof, may result
in disciplinary action.
   (h)   Application. This order constitutes Department policy, and is not
intended to enlarge the employer’s or employee’s civil or criminal liability in
any way. It shall not be construed as the creation of a higher legal standard
of safety or care in an evidentiary sense with respect to third party claims
insofar as the employer’s or employee’s legal duty as imposed by law.

additional sections and subsections are added as indicated.
   Sec. 2.5a. Abandoned vehicle procedures. (Amended)
   (1)   As used in this section, "abandoned vehicle" means a vehicle which has
remained on public property or private property for a period of 48 hours after
a police agency or other governmental agency designated by the police agency
has affixed a written notice to the vehicle.
   (2)   If a vehicle has remained on public or private property for a period
of time so that it appears to the police agency to be abandoned, the police
agency shall do all of the following:
      (a)   Determine if the vehicle has been reported stolen;
      (b)   Affix a written notice to the vehicle. The written notice shall
contain the following information:
         (i)   The date and time the notice was affixed.
         (ii)   The name and address of the police agency taking the action.
         (iii)   The name and badge number of the police officer affixing the
notice.
         (iv)   The date and time the vehicle may be taken into custody and
stored, at the owner's expense, or scrapped if the vehicle is not removed.
         (v)   The year, make and vehicle identification number of the vehicle,
if available.
   (3)   If the vehicle is not removed within 48 hours after the date the
notice was affixed, the vehicle is deemed abandoned and the police agency may
have the vehicle taken into custody.
   (4)   A police agency which has a vehicle taken into custody shall do all of
the following:
      (a)   Recheck to determine if the vehicle has been reported stolen;
      (b)   Within 24 hours after taking the vehicle into custody, enter the
vehicle as abandoned into the law enforcement information network;
      (c)   Within 7 days after taking the vehicle into custody, send to the
registered owner and secured party, as shown by the records of the secretary of
state, by first- class mail or personal service, notice that the vehicle has
been deemed abandoned. The form for the notice shall be furnished by the
secretary of state. Each notice form shall contain the following information:
         (i)   The year, make and vehicle identification number of the vehicle,
if available;
         (ii)   The location from which the vehicle was taken into custody;
         (iii)   The date on which the vehicle was taken into custody;
         (iv)   The name and address of the police agency which had the vehicle
taken into custody;
         (v)   The business address of the custodian of the vehicle;
         (vi)   The procedure to redeem the vehicle;
         (vii)   The procedure to contest the fact that the vehicle has been
deemed abandoned or the reasonableness of the towing fees and daily storage
fees;
         (viii)   A form petition which the owner may file in person or by mail
with the specified court which requests a hearing on the police agency's
action;
         (ix)   A warning that the failure to redeem the vehicle or to request
a hearing within 20 days after the date of the notice may result in the sale of
the vehicle and the termination of all rights of the owner and the secured
party to the vehicle or to the proceeds of the sale.
   (5)   The registered owner may contest the fact that the vehicle has been
deemed abandoned or the reasonableness of the towing fees and daily storage
fees by requesting a hearing thereon. A request for a hearing shall be made by
filing a petition with the court specified in the notice within 20 days after
the date of the notice. If the owner requests a hearing, the matter shall be
resolved after a hearing conducted pursuant to sections 2.5e and 2.5f. An owner
who requests a hearing may obtain release of the vehicle by posting with the
court the towing and storage bond in an amount equal to the accrued towing and
storage fees. The owner of a vehicle who requests a hearing may obtain release
of the vehicle by paying the towing and storage fees instead of posting the
towing and storage bond. If the court finds that the vehicle was not properly
deemed abandoned, the police agency shall reimburse the owner for the accrued
towing and storage fees.
   (6)   If the owner does not request a hearing, he or she may obtain the
release of the vehicle by paying the accrued charges to the custodian of the
vehicle.
   (7)   If the owner does not redeem the vehicle or request a hearing within
20 days after the date of the notice, the secured party may obtain the release
of the vehicle by paying the accrued charges to the custodian of the vehicle
and the police agency for its accrued costs.
   (8)   Not less than 20 days after the disposition of the hearing described
in subsection (5) hereof, or, if a hearing is not requested, not less than 20
days after the date of the notice, the police agency shall offer the vehicle
for sale at a public sale pursuant to section 2.5g.
   (9)   If the ownership of a vehicle which has been deemed abandoned under
this section cannot be determined, either because of the condition of the
vehicle identification numbers or because a check with the records of the
secretary of state does not reveal ownership, the police agency may sell the
vehicle at a public sale, pursuant to section 2.5g, not less than 30 days after
public notice of the sale has been published.
   Sec. 2.5b. Abandoned scrap vehicle procedures. (Added)
      (1)   As used in this section:
         (a)   "Registered abandoned scrap vehicle" means a vehicle which meets

      (2)   A police agency may have an unregistered abandoned scrap vehicle
taken into custody, in which case the police agency shall do all of the
following:
         (a)   Determine if the vehicle has been reported stolen;
         (b)   Take 2 photographs of the vehicle;
         (c)   Make a report to substantiate the fact that the vehicle is an
unregistered abandoned scrap vehicle. The report shall contain the following
information:

danger to any person or vehicle using such streets, alleys, public right of
ways or public places, and shall be properly and promptly repaired in a manner
specified and approved by the City, at such person's expense.
   (h)   Any person owning or maintaining a cable communications system or
facilities therefor in or on the streets, alleys, public right of ways or
public places in the City shall, at his or her expense and without
reimbursement from the City, upon request of the City, protect, support,
temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove from the street, alley, public right
of way or public place any property of such person when required by reason of
traffic conditions, public safety, street vacation, freeway or street
construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers,
drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines or tracks, the construction or
change of the transmission of distribution facilities of any telephone or
electric public utility or other public improvements. Any such person shall
also, at the request of any private party holding an appropriate permit issued
by the City, temporarily raise or lower its cable communication transmission or
distribution wires or cables to permit the moving of any building or other
structure, provided that the actual expense of such temporary raising or
lowering shall be paid in full by the party requesting the same.
   (i)      If any person fails to commence, pursue or complete any work
required by law or by this chapter to be done in any street, alley, public
right of way or public place as designated by the City, the City may cause such
work to be done, and such person shall pay to the City the cost thereof within
thirty days of the receipt of an itemized statement of such cost.
   (j)      The grantee shall secure, by fee or by easement, necessary right of

808.09   STANDARDS OF SERVICE.
   (a)   Any cable television company granted a franchise pursuant to this
chapter shall furnish reasonably adequate service and facilities to the public,
and its cable television system shall be installed, constructed, maintained and
operated in accordance with the accepted standards of the industry, in
conformity with the state of the art and any standards of operation or
maintenance for a cable television system which may be established or issued by
the Federal Communications Commission. It is the intention of the Cable
Communications Commission that any person granted a franchise to furnish a
cable television service to the public in the City shall possess the financial
and technical qualifications necessary to provide a cable television system
which will ensure its subscribers high quality service.
   (b)   Every cable television system franchised under this chapter shall have
at least 300 MHZ of bandwith (the equivalent of thirty-five television
broadcast channels) available for immediate or potential use for the totality
of cable services to be offered. However, a minimum of twelve such channels
shall be equipped and available for immediate use on the initial construction
of the system. Six or more additional available channels shall be available at
the option of the subscriber. Such system shall possess the capability for the
reception and distribution of quality FM broadcasts. A minimum of twenty such
channels shall be equipped for use at such time as the system commences service
to 1,000 or more subscribers.
   (c)   Every such cable television system shall maintain a plant having
technical capacity for return communications, nonvoice and voice, on all parts
of the system.
   (d)   Every such cable television system shall maintain and make available
without charge such public access channels, education access channels, local
government access channels and leased access channels as may from time to time
be designated, established, required or regulated by the rules and regulations
of the Federal Communications Commission, including the expansion of access
capacity as may be required to fulfill the needs for such access channels
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission,
and shall comply with all applicable rules, standards or requirements of the
Federal Communications Commission or other Federal or State agencies or
commissions which may have jurisdiction over the grantee.
   (e)   Every such cable television system shall maintain such capacity,
capability and technical standards as will enable it to interconnect with any
other cable television system located in any adjacent community.
(Ord. 175. Passed 7-21-81.)
808.10   DETERMINATION OF RATES AND CHARGES.
   (a)   No cable communications company shall make any unjust or unreasonable
discrimination in rates, charges, classifications, promotions, practices,
regulations, facilities or services for or in connection with like services. No
cable communications company shall subject any person to any prejudice or
disadvantage in any respect whatsoever. However, this shall not be deemed to
prohibit the establishment of a graded scale of charges and classification of
rates to which any subscriber coming within such classification shall be
entitled.
   (b)   No rate or charge for installation or basic cable communications
service provided in the City shall be effective, nor shall any cable
communications company advertise, collect or receive any rate or charge for its
services, until it has filed a complete schedule of rates and charges as
provided in Sections
808.22 et seq. and until such initial rates and charges have been approved as
provided in Sections 808.22 et seq. The charges made for services of the
franchisee hereunder shall be fair, reasonable and not higher than necessary to
meet all costs of the service (assuming efficient and economical management),
and shall provide a fair return to the franchisee. The franchisee shall receive
no consideration whatsoever for its service other than in accordance with this
section, Sections 808.22 et seq. or the franchise agreement, without the
approval of Council. The applicant for a franchise shall include in its
application its proposed rates, charges and deposits.
   (c)   No cable communications company may increase any rate or charge for
cable communications service contained in its filed schedule, or alter any
classification, contract, rule, regulation or practice as to result in any
increase in its schedule of rates or charges for such service, without first
filing such new increased rate or charge or alteration in its classification,
contract, rule, regulation or practice with the City Clerk, as provided for in
Sections
808.22 et seq., at least thirty days before such proposed increase is proposed
to become effective, accompanied by a notice and proof of publication thereof
for at least one insertion in a newspaper of general circulation in the City,
which notice shall state the increase proposed. Whenever a cable communications
company files with the City Clerk a schedule or notice increasing any rate or
charge then in effect, Council shall proceed as provided for in Sections
808.22 et seq. The cost of such publication and public hearing shall be borne
by the franchisee. The cable communications company shall have the burden of
proof to establish the reasonableness and lawfulness of the proposed increase
in its rates and charges.
(Ord. 175. Passed 7-21-81; Ord. 227. Passed 9-22-93.)
808.11   FREE SERVICE TO CITY BUILDINGS AND LIBRARIES; EMERGENCIES.
   (a)   Every cable communications company furnishing service in the City
shall, without charge for installation or service, provide one installation of
its cable communication service to each department of the City and to each fire
and police station in the City, and shall, without charge, provide cable
communications service to each public educational building and public library
(including any constructed after the grant of the franchise) within the
franchisee's current service area.
   (b)   Every cable communications company providing service in the City shall
make its cable system available without charge to the City, the County, the
State, the United States and emergency operations agencies for the prompt and
simultaneous communication to subscribers and the public of any information
resulting from or required by war, threat of war, natural catastrophe, riot or
insurrection, necessary to save or protect life or property.
(Ord. 175. Passed 7-21-81.)
808.12   BOND; INSURANCE; NONLIABILITY OF CITY.
   (a)   Every cable communications company shall, within thirty days of the
grant of a franchise to it pursuant to this chapter, file with the City Clerk,
and at all times thereafter maintain in full force and effect for the term of
the franchise, at its expense, a corporate surety bond or such other surety
arrangement as the City may approve in the amount of twenty-five thousand
dollars ($25,000), conditioned upon the faithful performance by such cable
communications company of its obligations under its franchise as herein set
forth, and upon the further condition that if such cable communications company
fails to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter, there shall be
recoverable jointly and severally from the principal and surety of such bond
any damages or loss suffered by the City as a result thereof, including the
full amount of any compensation, indemnification or cost of removal of any
property of such cable communications company as provided in this chapter, plus
attorney's fees and costs, up to the full amount of the bond. Such condition
shall be a continuing obligation for the duration of any franchise granted
under this chapter and any renewal thereof, and thereafter until such cable
communications company has liquidated all of its obligations to the City which
may have arisen under the franchise or from the exercise of any privilege or
right granted thereby. Any bond provided under this section shall provide that
at least thirty days prior notice of any intention to not renew, to cancel or
to make a material change therein shall be filed with the City. Nothing herein
shall be construed to excuse faithful performance by any cable communications
company or in any way to limit its liability for damages or otherwise. The bond
required hereunder may be reduced by Council in face amount to ten thousand
dollars ($10,000) at such time as the franchise is actively providing cable
communications service to 500 or more subscribers in the City. Such reduction
shall not be deemed a material change in the bond.
   (b)   Any cable communications company, within thirty days of the grant of a
franchise pursuant to this chapter, shall file with the City Clerk, in addition
to the bond as set forth in subsection (a) hereof:
      (1)   Proof of a general comprehensive liability insurance policy and an
automobile liability insurance policy issued by companies licensed to do
business in the State, protecting the City and its officers, boards,
commissions, agents and employees against liability for loss or damage for
personal injury, death and property damage occasioned by the installation,
construction, maintenance or operation of a cable communications system in the
City, with minimum liability limits of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000)
for personal injury or death of any one person and one million dollars
($1,000,000) for personal injury or death of two or more persons in any one
occurrence, and five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) for damages to
property resulting from any one occurrence. Such policy shall contain a
provision that written notice of cancellation or material change or reduction
in coverage shall be given the City Clerk at least thirty days in advance of
the effective date thereof.
      (2)   Proof of adequate insurance as required by the State Worker's
Compensation Law applicable to it.
   (c)   No franchise hereunder shall be effective until the provisions of
subsections (a) and (b) hereof have been fully complied with. Failure to file
the bond, proof of general comprehensive liability insurance, proof of
automobile liability insurance, and proof of adequate worker's compensation
insurance, or any of them, as required by subsections (a) and (b) hereof, with
the City Clerk within thirty days after the grant of a franchise, shall render
the franchise null and void without notice or further proceedings.
   (d)   The franchisee shall indemnify and hold harmless the City at all times
during the term of the franchise granted hereby and shall specifically pay all
damages and penalties which the City may be legally required to pay as a result
of granting the franchise. Such damages and penalties shall include, but not be
limited to, damages arising out of the installation, operation or maintenance
of the CATV system authorized herein, whether or not any act or omission
complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by the franchise, and the
cost of repair or replacement of streets, alleys, bridges and other public
places and ways as shall arise from the construction or maintenance of the CATV
system. If suit shall be filed against the City, either independently or
jointly with the franchisee, to recover for any claim or damages, the
franchisee, upon notice to it by the City, shall defend the City against the
action. In the event of a final judgment being obtained against the City,
either independently or jointly with the franchisee, solely by reason of the
acts of the franchisee, the franchisee will pay the judgment and all costs and
shall hold the City harmless therefrom.
(Ord. 175. Passed 7-21-81.)
808.13   EXPIRATION, REVOCATION, TERMINATION OR SURRENDER OF FRANCHISE.
   (a)   Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall expire without
further proceedings one year after its effective date if the person granted
such franchise has not commenced construction of a cable communications system
within such period.
   (b)   If any person granted a franchise pursuant to this chapter fails to
provide cable communications service within and throughout the franchise area
as required under the franchise agreement, such franchise shall, on the
anniversary of the effective date of such franchise next following the twelve-
month period during which cable communications service has not been extended as
required under the franchise agreement, be deemed revoked without the necessity
of Council action, unless prior to such date, such person shall have applied to
Council and Council shall have, for good cause shown, granted an extension of
the construction or service periods set forth in the franchise agreement.
   (c)   Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be terminated and
cancelled without further proceedings 120 days after the appointment of a
receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of a cable
communications company, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or
other action or proceedings, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have
been vacated prior to the expiration of such period. However, such receiver or
trustee may apply for a transfer or assignment of such franchise, as provided
in Section 808.05(e), within sixty days of the appointment of such receiver or
trustee, if duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises. In
case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the plant, property or
facilities of a cable communications company, with or without the appointment
of a receiver or trustee, including or excluding the franchise granted under
this chapter, such franchise as granted will be terminated and cancelled
without further proceedings upon thirty days written notice of termination
served upon the cable communications company and the purchaser thereof, unless
within such thirty days the purchaser applies to the City for a transfer or
assignment to it of the same as provided in Section 808.05(e).
   (d)   Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter is revocable by the
City prior to its expiration where the cable communications company has become
insolvent or has failed substantially to comply with any provision or
requirement of State or Federal law or this chapter, the representations made
in its franchise application or the provisions of its franchise agreement, or
has failed to apply to the Federal Communications Commission for a certificate
of compliance with sufficient promptness to avoid interruption or delay in
service required by the franchise agreement. The City may give a written notice
containing full particulars as to the provision or requirement with which
compliance is claimed deficient and may allow such cable communications company
sixty days to comply. At the expiration of such sixty days, such franchise will
be deemed terminated and revoked unless such cable communications company shall
request a hearing before Council upon its alleged failure to substantially
comply with this chapter. Such hearing shall be public with the cable
communications company being permitted to fully participate therein, including
the right to introduce testimony and exhibits and to examine and cross-examine
witnesses. The hearing shall be recorded, and at the conclusion thereof,
Council, if it finds that the cable communications company has not
substantially complied with this chapter, may terminate and revoke the
franchise. Such cable communications company shall have the same rights of an
appeal from an adverse decision as are granted by the statutes of the State for
appeals from the actions of administrative agencies.
   (e)   Any person granted a franchise pursuant to this chapter may surrender
it upon written notice of intent to surrender its franchise filed with the City
Clerk not less than sixty days prior to the surrender date. On the surrender
date specified in such notice, all rights, privileges and authority under such
franchise shall terminate, provided that such person shall have six months
thereafter to remove its towers, poles, wires, cables, fixtures or other
facilities from the streets, alleys, public right of ways or public places,
subject to the rights of the City as set forth in Section 808.08(d). At the
expiration of such six months, any property not removed by such person shall
become the property of the City to do with as it may choose. Any cost to the
City in removing such property from its streets, alleys, public right of ways
or public places shall be claimed against such person under the performance
bond required under Section 808.12(a). (Ord. 175. Passed 7-21-81.)
808.14   TIME LIMIT FOR CONSTRUCTION.
   (a)   Any person granted a franchise pursuant to this chapter shall commence
construction or installation of its cable communications system within sixty
days after issuance of a certificate of compliance by the Federal
Communications Commission, if such a certificate is required, otherwise within
sixty days after execution of the franchise agreement. Construction or
installation of such cable communications system shall be completed within
eighteen months after the execution of the franchise agreement or after the
issuance of a certificate of compliance by the Federal Communications
Commission, if such certificate is required.
   (b)   Any person granted such a franchise shall complete construction within
such areas and within such periods as are designated in the franchise
agreement. Any such person who is unable to construct according to this section
for good cause shall notify Council, in writing, within thirty days of the
occurrence of any delay or interruption of construction of more than fifteen
working days duration, which interruption or delay would affect its inability
to construct according to schedule. (Ord. 175. Passed 7-21-81.)
808.15   COMPLAINTS; HEARINGS; BUSINESS OFFICE.
   (a)   Council or any person, department or commission designated by it may,
upon its own motion or upon complaint of any person or subscriber of a cable
communications company, hear and determine all complaints concerning the rates,
charges, rules, regulations, practices, quality of service rendered or refused
to be rendered, equipment furnished or refused to be furnished or any other
matter relating to the service or operation of the cable communications system
or any person franchised under this chapter.
   (b)   Upon the filing of any complaint against any person pursuant to
subsection (a) hereof, at least twenty days notice of the time and place of a
hearing shall be given such person upon the matters alleged in the complaint.
Council or its designee may order such changes in the rates, charges, rules,
regulations, services, equipment or other matters relating to the service or
operation of the cable communications company as in its judgment, based upon
the record of the hearing and findings of act made thereon, appear to be just,
reasonable and lawful.
   (c)   Every person granted a franchise pursuant to this chapter shall have a
business office located in the City, suitably staffed, for the purpose, among
others, of receiving and investigating complaints, dealing with it subscribers,
receiving payment for service and otherwise conducting business, unless
otherwise provided in the franchise agreement. The requirement that the
franchise shall locate a business office in the City may be waived by Council
in the franchise agreement. (Ord. 175. Passed 7-21-81.)
808.16   INTERPRETATION OF FRANCHISE.
   Any right or privilege granted to any person under this chapter to use or
occupy any street, alley, public right of way or public place shall be
subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy of such property. Nothing in this
chapter shall be construed as limiting the City in any way in the lawful
exercise of its police power. The grant of a franchise to any person as
provided in this chapter shall confer no right, privilege or exemption not
specifically presented therein.
(Ord. 175. Passed 7-21-81.)
808.17   SURRENDER OF OTHER FRANCHISES.
   By the application for and acceptance of a franchise pursuant to this
chapter, a cable communications company agrees that upon subsequent additions
of areas to the City, either by annexation, consolidation or otherwise, all
franchises and/or licenses held by it to provide a cable communications service
or to install, construct, maintain or operate a cable communications system in
such areas shall be surrendered. Any rights or privileges in streets, alleys,
public right of ways or public places to install, construct, maintain or
operate a cable communications system or to furnish a cable communications
service in such areas as may subsequently be added to the City by annexation,
consolidation or otherwise shall thereafter be subject to and authorized by
this chapter.
(Ord. 175. Passed 7-21-81.)
808.18   REPORTS; MAPS.
   Every cable communications company shall file annually with the City a
current map showing the exact location of the transmission and distribution
facilities and equipment in the City used by it in providing cable
communications service. Such company shall prepare and furnish the City, on
written request therefor, at such times and in such form as may be prescribed,
such reports as to its operations, finances, facilities and activities as may
be reasonably necessary to enable the City to perform its obligations,
functions and duties under this chapter. (Ord. 175. Passed 7-21-81.)
808.19   RIGHTS OF CITY.
   Any franchise granted under this chapter is made subject to all applicable
provisions of law relating to the City and ordinances thereof, and specifically
subject to the rights and powers of the City and limitations upon the cable
communications company holding such franchise as are set forth in the statutes
of the State pertaining to local government, which statutes are herein
incorporated by reference. Such cable communications company shall abide by and
be bound by such rights, powers and limitations.
(Ord. 175. Passed 7-21-81.)
808.20   LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES.
   Any person granted a franchise pursuant to this chapter shall have no
recourse whatsoever against the City or its officers, boards, commissions,

808.23   PURPOSE; IMPLEMENTATION AND INTERPRETATION.
   The purpose of Sections
808.22 et seq. is to:
   (a)   Adopt regulations consistent with the Act and the FCC Rules with
respect to basic cable service rate regulation; and
   (b)   Prescribe procedures to provide a reasonable opportunity for
consideration of the views of interested parties in connection with basic cable
service rate regulation by the City.
   This chapter shall be implemented and interpreted consistent with the Act
and the FCC Rules.
(Ord. 227. Passed 9-22-93.)
808.24   COMPLIANCE WITH FCC RULES.
   In connection with the regulation of rates for basic cable service and
associated equipment, the City shall follow all FCC Rules.
(Ord. 227. Passed 9-22-93.)
808.25   FILING OF RATE SCHEDULES OR INCREASES BY OPERATORS; PROMULGATION OF
RULES AND REGULATIONS BY COUNCIL; ADDITIONAL INFORMATION; PROOF OF COMPLIANCE
WITH LAW.
   (a)   A cable operator shall submit its schedule of rates for the basic
service tier and associated equipment or a proposed increase in such rates in
accordance with the Act and the FCC Rules. The cable operator shall include, as
part of its submission, such information as is necessary to show that its
schedule of rates or its proposed increase in rates complies with the Act and
the FCC Rules. The cable operator shall file ten copies of the schedule of
rates or proposed increase in such rates with the City Clerk. For purposes of
this chapter, the filing of the cable operator shall be deemed to have been
made when at least ten copies have been received by the City Clerk. Council
may, by resolution or otherwise, adopt rules and regulations prescribing the
information, data and calculations which must be included as part of the cable
operator's filing of the schedule of rates or proposed increase in such rates.
   (b)   In addition to information and data required by rules and regulations
of the City adopted pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, a cable operator shall
provide all information requested by the Mayor in connection with the City's
review and regulation of existing rates for the basic service tier and
associated equipment or a proposed increase in such rates. The Mayor may
establish deadlines for submission of the requested information, and the cable
operator shall comply with such deadlines.
   (c)   A cable operator has the burden of proving that its schedule of rates
for the basic service tier and associated equipment or a proposed increase in

   (a)   If this chapter, any rules or regulations adopted by the City pursuant

(b), requires the production of proprietary information, the cable operator
shall produce the information. However, at the time the allegedly proprietary
information is submitted, a cable operator may request that specific,
identified portions of its response be treated as confidential and withheld
from public disclosure. The request must state the reason why the information
should be treated as proprietary and the facts that support such reason. The
request for confidentiality will be granted if the City determines that the
preponderance of the evidence shows that nondisclosure is consistent with the
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 USC 552. The City shall place
in a public file for inspection any decision that results in information being
withheld. If the cable operator requests confidentiality and the request is
denied:
      (1)   Where the cable operator is proposing a rate increase, it may
withdraw the proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary information will
be returned to it; or
      (2)   The cable operator may seek review within five working days of the
denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the information will be stayed
pending review.
   (b)   Any interested party may file a request to inspect material withheld
as proprietary with the City. The City shall weigh the policy considerations
favoring nondisclosure against the reasons cited for permitting inspection in
light of the facts of the particular case. It will then promptly notify the
requesting entity and the cable operator that submitted the information as to
the disposition of the request. It may grant, deny or condition a request. The
requesting party or the cable operator may seek review of the decision by
filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Disclosure will be stayed pending
resolution of any appeal.
   (c)   The procedures set forth in this section shall be construed as
analogous to, and consistent with, the rules of the FCC regarding requests for
confidentiality, including, without limitation, 47 CFR 0.459.

filing to the City Clerk not later than seven days after the public notice is
published.
   The City Clerk shall give notice to the cable operator of the date, time and
place of the meeting at which the City Council shall first consider the
schedule of rates or the proposed increase of such rates. This notice shall be
mailed by first-class mail at least three days before the meeting. In addition,

proposed increase of such rates is prepared for consideration of the City
Council, then the City Clerk shall mail a copy of the report by first-class

proposed increase in such rates, the existing schedule of rates will remain in
effect or the proposed increase in such rates will become effective after
thirty days from the date of filing under Section 808.25(a), unless the City
Council (or another properly authorized body or official) tolls the thirty-day
deadline pursuant to 47 CFR 76.933 by issuing a brief written order, by
resolution or otherwise, within thirty days of the date of filing. The City
Council may toll the thirty-day deadline for an additional ninety days in cases
not involving cost-of-service showings and for an additional 150 days in cases
involving cost-of-service showings.
   (b)   If a written order has been issued pursuant to subsection (a) hereof
and 47 CFR 76.933 to toll the effective date of existing rates for the basic
service tier and associated equipment or a proposed increase in such rates, the
cable operator shall submit to the City any additional information required or
requested pursuant to Section 808.25(b). In addition, the City Council shall
hold a public hearing to consider the comments of interested parties within the
additional ninety-day or 150-day period, as the case may be. The City Clerk
shall publish a public notice of the public hearing in a newspaper of general
circulation within the City which shall state:

objections of interested parties, the information requested from the cable
operator and its response, the staff or consultant's review and other
appropriate information) a recommendation for the decision of the City Council
provided for in Section
808.30. The City Clerk shall mail a copy of the report to the cable operator by
first-class mail not less than twenty days before the City Council acts under
Section
808.30. The cable operator may file a written response to the report with the
City Clerk. If at least ten copies of the response are filed by the cable

860.01   MARIJUANA ESTABLISHMENTS.
   Except as provided in this chapter all marihuana establishments are
prohibited within the boundaries of the City of Perry. No marihuana
establishments shall be commenced, operated or utilized in any zoning district,
on or from any property within the City, except for medical marihuana
provisioning centers/adult-use (recreational) marihuana retailers as designated
in Section
860.02.
(Ord. 366. Passed 9-1-22.)
860.02   PURPOSE.
   (a)   It is the intent of this chapter to authorize the establishment of two
locations for medical marihuana provisioning centers/adult-use (recreational)
marihuana retailer (Note: A single location may serve as both a medical
marihuana provisioning center and a marihuana retailer, if approved by
applications.) in the City of Perry and provide for the adoption of reasonable
restrictions to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the
community at large; retain the character of neighborhoods; and mitigate
potential impacts on surrounding properties and persons. It is also the intent
of this chapter to affirm that the City of Perry is upholding its prohibition
of all other marihuana establishments other than those specifically authorized
by this chapter. It is also the intent of this chapter to help defray
administrative and enforcement costs associated with the operation of a
marihuana facility in the City through imposition of an annual, nonrefundable
fee, as defined by resolution of the City Council, on each medical marihuana
facility licensee. Authority for the enactment of these provisions is set forth
in the Medical Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act, MCL 333.27101 et seq. and
the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act, M.C.L.A. 333.27951 et
seq. Further, the City does not intend that permitting and regulation under
this chapter be construed as a finding that such facilities comply with any
law.
   (b)   The City of Perry considers it necessary and pertinent to authorize
the establishment of two locations for medical marihuana provisioning center
facilities/ adult-use (recreational) marihuana retailers through a limited
application period and subsequent lottery system drawing to be specified by a
resolution of City Council at the time such application period and lottery
shall occur.
   (c)   Nothing in this chapter is intended to grant immunity from criminal or
civil prosecution, penalty, or sanction for the cultivation, manufacture,
possession, use, sale, or distribution of marihuana, in any form, that is not
in compliance with the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act, Initiated Law 1 of 2008,
MCL 333.26421 et seq.; the Medical Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act, MCL
333.27101 et seq.; the Marihuana Tracking Act, MCL 333.27901 et seq.; the
Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act, M.C.L.A. 333.27951 et seq.;
and all other applicable rules promulgated by the State of Michigan.
   (d)   As of the effective date of this chapter, marihuana remains classified
as a Schedule 1 controlled substance under the Federal Controlled Substances
Act, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 801 et seq., which makes it unlawful to manufacture,
distribute, or dispense marihuana, or possess marihuana with intent to
manufacture, distribute, or dispense marihuana. Nothing in this chapter is
intended to grant immunity from any criminal prosecution under federal laws.
   (e)   All medical marihuana/adult-use (recreational) marihuana facility
license holders must comply with all state building codes, including but not
limited to plumbing, mechanical, electrical, building energy and fire codes
which includes the City zoning ordinance, as applicable under law.

   (a)   No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connection with or
opening into, use, alter or disturb any public sewer or the appurtenance
thereof without first obtaining a written permit therefor from the City Clerk.
   Before a permit may be issued for excavating for plumbing in the City, the
contractor applying for such permit shall have executed unto the City and
deposited with the City Treasurer a corporate surety bond in the sum of five
thousand dollars ($5,000) and a minimum of one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000) liability insurance conditioned that he or she will perform
faithfully all work with due care and skill and in accordance with the laws,
rules and regulations established under the authority or any ordinances of the
City pertaining to plumbing. Such bond shall state that the person will
indemnify and save harmless the City and the owner of the premises against all
damages, costs, expenses, outlays and claims of every nature and kind arising
out of unskillfulness or negligence on his or her part in connection with
plumbing or excavating for plumbing as prescribed in this chapter. Such bond
shall remain in force and must be executed for one year, except that on such
expiration it shall remain in force as to all penalties, claims and demands
that may have occurred thereunder prior to such expiration.
   Nothing in this section shall prohibit any bona fide owner from personally
installing plumbing in his or her own residence, provided that such owner:
      (1)   Applies for and secures a permit in accordance with subsection (a)
hereof;
      (2)   Pays the required fees;
      (3)   Does the work himself or herself in accordance with this chapter;
      (4)   Applies for an inspection; and
      (5)   Receives the approval of the City inspector.
   (b)   There shall be two classes of building sewer permits: one for
residential and commercial service and one for service to establishments
producing industrial waste. In either case, the owner or his or her agent shall
make application on a form furnished by the City Clerk. The permit application
shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications or other information
considered pertinent in the judgment of the inspector. A permit and inspection
fee as determined by Council shall be paid to the City Treasurer at the time
the application is filed.
   (c)   All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and connection
of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner or the person
installing the building sewer for such owner shall indemnify the City from any
loss or damage that may be directly occasioned by the installation.
   (d)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building. However, where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the building sewer
from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole
considered as one building sewer. Other exceptions will be allowed only by
special permission granted by the Superintendent of Public Works.
   (e)   Old building sewers or portions thereof may be used in connection with
new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test by the
inspector, to meet all requirements of this chapter.
   (f)   The building sewer shall be constructed from vitrified clay sewer pipe
and fittings, extra heavy cast iron soil pipe or ABS or PVC plastic pipe. All
of such materials shall meet current A.S.T.M. specifications. If installed in
filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe,
except that vitrified clay pipe or plastic pipe may be accepted if laid on a
suitable improved bed or cradle as approved by the inspector.
   (g)   All joints and connections shall be made gas and watertight and shall
conform to the manufacturers' recommendations. If no clean out opening is
installed inside the dwelling where the sewer line goes outside, then a riser
and clean out opening shall be installed outside the dwelling as near the
entrance of the sewer line to the building as practical.
   (h)   The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the
approval of the inspector, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four
inches. The slope of such four-inch pipe shall be not less than one-eighth inch
per foot. A slope of one-fourth inch per foot shall be used wherever practical.
   (i)   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be
made at the "Y" branch designated for that property. Any connection not made at
the designated "Y" branch in the main sewer shall be made only as directed by
the inspector.
   (j)   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid
parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall which might be weakened
thereby. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. All
excavations required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open
trench work unless otherwise approved by the inspector. Pipe laying and
backfill shall be performed in accordance with current A.S.T.M. specifications,
except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been approved by the
inspector or his or her representative.
   (k)   In all buildings in which a building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall
be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer.
   (l)   The applicant for the building sewer shall notify the inspector when
the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer.
The connection shall be made under the supervision of the inspector or his or
her representative.
   (m)   All excavations for building sewer installations shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazards.
Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course
of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the inspector.
   (n)   Prior to the demolition of any building or facility containing a
building sewer connection to a public sewer, the building sewer connection
shall be abandoned and plugged in accordance with procedures and specifications
set forth by the Superintendent of Public Works.
   (c)   Abandoned building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings
only when they are found, on examination and test by the Superintendent of
Public Works, to meet all requirements of the City Codes and upon payment of
all current connection charges and benefit charges existing at the time of
reconnection.
   (d)   In regard to any property wherein the sewer connection is abandoned at
the owner’s request, City charges will be suspended only upon compliance with
subsection (n) above.

1042.05   PROHIBITED DISCHARGES; GREASE, OIL AND SAND INTERCEPTORS;
PRETREATMENT; MANHOLES.
   (a)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any storm water,
surface water, ground water, roof run-off, subsurface drainage or unpolluted
industrial process water to any sanitary sewer.
   (b)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged to any public
sewer any harmful waters or wastes, whether liquid, solid or gas, capable of
causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, damage or hazard to structures,
equipment and personnel of the sewage works or other interference with the
proper operation of the sewage works.
   (c)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the inspector, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid
wastes containing grease in excessive amounts or any flammable wastes, sand and
other harmful ingredients. However, such interceptors shall not be required for
private living quarters or dwelling units. Where such interceptors are
installed, they shall be maintained by the owner, at his or her expense, in
continuously efficient operation at all times.
   (d)   The admission into the public sewers of any waters or wastes having
harmful or objectionable characteristics shall be subject to the review and
approval of the Superintendent of Public Works who may prescribe limits on the
strength and character of such waters or wastes. Where necessary, in the
opinion of the Superintendent, the owner shall provide, at his or her expense,
such preliminary treatment as may be necessary to treat such wastes prior to
discharge to the public sewer. Plans, specifications and other pertinent
information relating to proposed preliminary treatment facilities shall be
submitted for the approval of the Superintendent and the State Department of
Public Health, and no construction of such facilities shall be commenced until
approval is obtained in writing. Where preliminary treatment facilities are
provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his or her expense.
   (e)   When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property served
by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install and maintain, at
his or her expense, a suitable control manhole in the building sewer to
facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. All
measurements and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes shall be
determined in accordance with Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Wastewater and shall be determined at the control manhole or upon suitable
samples taken at such control manhole. If no special manhole has been required,
the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in
the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected.

a change of address has been filed in writing at the business office of the
City. The City shall not otherwise be responsible for delivery of any bill or
notice, nor will the customer be excused from nonpayment of a bill or from any
performance required in such notice.
   (d)   Bills for sewerage service are due and payable at the business office
of the City or to any designated agent on the date of issuance. The past due
date shall be the fifteenth day of the month after the period of service. Bills

General Provisions and Penalty
   EDITOR'S NOTE:  By an unnumbered Motion dated November 21, 1995, Council
adopted a document entitled "Municipal Standards for the City of Perry,

with the City's Subdivision Regulations. Copies of such document may be

1240.01   INTENT.
   A lot in a well developed subdivision, with essential improvements already
installed, is a better investment for a prospective purchaser than one which
does not have the necessary facilities. Such improvements contribute directly
to the health, safety and general welfare of such purchaser and to the health,
safety and general welfare of the City as a whole. Therefore, in the best
interests of the purchaser, the subdivider and the City at large, certain
standards to be required of future subdivisions are hereby established. The
intent of these Subdivision Regulations is not to discourage subdividing, but
rather to encourage development and subdividing which will make for an orderly
and well developed community and which will preserve land values within the
community.
(Ord. 101. Passed 4-19-66.)
1240.02   SEPARABILITY.
   These Subdivision Regulations and the several sections, clauses and parts
hereof are hereby declared to be severable. If any part or clause hereof is
