be vested in and exercised by Council.
   (b)   Number and election of Council. Council shall consist of seven members
elected at large.
   (c)   Meetings of Council.
      (1)   Regular meetings of Council shall be held every other Thursday
throughout the year and shall begin at 7:00 p.m. prevailing time unless
otherwise noted. All meetings will be held in City Council Chambers/Trade &
Transit II, and/or remote. Meetings may occasionally be held at other locations
with the approval of the majority of Council. As with all meetings, they must
be properly advertised. The meetings may be scheduled for the coming year by
resolution and then properly advertised. Meetings may be held telephonically
and/or during circumstances such as a state of emergency or adverse weather
conditions at the discretion of the President of Council, or in his or her
absence the Vice President of Council. Special meetings may be called by the
President of Council, or in his or her absence by the Vice President of
Council, or as otherwise provided by law.
The notice shall specify whether it is for general or special business. If
called for special business, no other business shall be considered unless so
stated. Each member shall have notice of special meetings required by law. At
all meetings, a quorum of City Council must be present, either in person or
remotely to legally transact business. A quorum is a majority of City Council
members.
      (2)   All regular and special meetings of Council shall be open to the
public, and public notice of such meetings shall be given as required by the
Act of 6-21-1957, P.L. 392.
      (3)   The proceedings of Council shall be governed by rules and
regulations as fixed by resolution of Council.
      (4)   All meetings of City Council and all of its committees shall
operate under the Sunshine Act which was enacted by the State Legislature in
October 1998 and became effective on 12-14-1998 (See 65 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 701 et
seq.). The Act requires that all public agencies take official actions and
conduct all deliberations leading up to official actions at public meetings.
The Act provides for three exceptions to the open meeting requirement: (a)
executive sessions; (b) conferences; and (c) working sessions. The Act sets
forth five reasons for holding executive sessions:
         (A)   To discuss personnel matters, including hiring, promoting,
disciplinary or dismissing specific employees or officers, but not including
filling vacancies in any elective office;
         (B)   To hold information, strategy and negotiation sessions related
to collective bargaining agreements or arbitrations;
         (C)   To consider the purchase or lease of real estate;
         (D)   To consult with an attorney regarding litigation on issues where
identifiable complaints are expected to be filed; and
         (E)   To discuss agency business that would lead to disclosure of
information recognized as confidential or privileged under law, including
initiations and conduct of investigations of possible violations of the law and
quasi-judicial deliberations.
      (5)   In an executive session, under no circumstances should the
deliberations ever lead to a vote by the members.
      (6)   The holding of executive session by City Council or any of its
committees should be announced by the presiding officer stating the reason for
the meeting. If circumstances do not permit this, then announcement that an
executive session was held should be made at the next public meeting of City
Council.
      (7)   Closed work sessions by City Council or any of its committees may
be held to gather information only and shall conform strictly to the Sunshine
Act. There should never be any deliberations on any issue that may or may not
lead to a decision, either at that meeting or in the future. The Solicitor’s
office should be informed of all contemplated work sessions to be sure that
they are in compliance with the law.

§ 127.02 OPEN RECORDS POLICY.
   (a)   Policy. Effective 1-1-2009, this policy is to provide legal residents
of the United States the right to request, inspect and obtain copies of public
records per Pennsylvania’s Right-to-Know Law. With respect to the policy, the
following requests shall be routed immediately to the City of Williamsport’s
Open Record’s Officer:
      (1)   A “right to know request” or an “open records request”;
      (2)   A request for any document(s) that would not be distributed in the
course of normal, everyday operations;
      (3)   A request for an item or items that may potentially be of a
confidential, proprietary or legal nature;
      (4)   All right-to-know requests shall be forwarded to the City of
Williamsport’s Open Records Officer by 4:30 p.m. on the date the request is
received by any department. Any questions arising from requests for records
must be directed immediately to the Open Records Officer; and
      (5)   In the event a provision of this policy conflicts with the Open
Records Act or any other state or federal law, that portion of the provisions
of this policy shall not apply.
   (b)   General rule.
      (1)   Unless otherwise provided by law, a public record of the city is
accessible for inspection and duplication by a requester in accordance with
this policy. A public record will be provided to a requester in the medium
requested if the public record exists in that medium; otherwise, it will be
provided in the medium in which it exists. Public records will be available for
access during regular business hours. Nothing in this policy will provide for
access to a record which is not a public record.
      (2)   The city will make its public records and copies thereof related to
City Council meeting agendas and city council meeting agenda items available
for inspection in accordance with established guidelines as noted in §
111.02, Rule 5, of the codified ordinances of the City of Williamsport with the
exception of those records exempt from such inspection and copying by law and
city policy.
   (c)   Procedure for access to public records.
      (1)   Requests for access to records may be made verbally or in written
form. If the requester wishes to initiate his or her appeal rights or pursue
the relief and remedies provided for in Right to Know Law, 53 P.S. §§ 67.101 et
seq., the request for access to records must be a written request. The city
will honor all written requests on the form provided by the city [Exhibit A] or
by the State Office of Open Records [Exhibit B] for access to city public
records. Such requests may be submitted in person, by mail, facsimile or email.
The request must be addressed to and received by the Open Records Officer and
must contain the name and address to which the city shall address its response
and a description of the records sought with sufficient specificity to allow
the Open Records Officer to determine which records are being requested. A
written request shall not include any explanation of the requester’s reasons
for the request and shall not include any explanation of the requesters
intended use of the records.
      (2)   When responding to a request for access, the city is not required
to create a public record which does not currently exist or to compile,
maintain, format or organize a public record in a manner in which it does not
currently compile, maintain, format or organize the public record.
      (3)   If a public record is only maintained electronically or in other
non-paper media, the city will, upon request, duplicate the public record on
paper when responding to a request for access in accordance with this policy.
   (d)   Redactions. If the city determines that a public record contains
information which is subject to access, as well as information which is not
subject to access, the city’s response will grant access to the information
which is subject to access and deny access to the information which is not
subject to access. The city will redact from the public record information
which is not subject to access and the response will grant access to the
information which is subject to access.
   (e)   Response to written requests for access.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a written request for access to public records, the
city will make a good faith effort to determine if the record requested is a
public record and will respond as promptly as possible under the circumstances
existing at the time of the request, but no later than five business days from
the date the written request is received by the city. Upon receipt of a
request, the Open Records Officer will:
         (A)   Stamp the date of receipt on the written request;
         (B)   Compute the day on which the five-day period will expire and
make a notation of that date on the written request form;
         (C)   Maintain an electronic or paper copy of the written request
including all documents submitted with the request until the request has been
fulfilled and all potential appeal time frames have expired;
         (D)   If an appeal is filed, keep the records until a final
determination is issued or the appeal is deemed denied; and
         (E)   Create a file and keep all of the following:
            1.   The original request;
            2.   A copy of the response;
            3.   A record of written communications with the requester;
            4.   Appeal made by requester if applicable; and
            5.   Final appeal determination from the State Office of Open
Records if applicable.
      (2)   If the city fails to send the response within five business days of
receipt of the written request for access, the written request for access shall
be deemed denied. The five-day time clock begins the day following receipt by
the city, excluding exceptions as listed below:
         (A)   The request for access requires redaction of a public record;
         (B)   The request for access requires the retrieval of a record stored
in a remote location;
         (C)   A timely response to the request for access cannot be
accomplished due to bona fide and specified staffing limitations;
         (D)   A legal review is necessary to determine whether the record is a
public record subject to access under this policy;
         (E)   The requester has not complied with city policies regarding
access to public records; and
         (F)   The requester refuses to pay applicable fees.
      (3)   If the request falls under any of the above exceptions, the Open
Records Officer will send written notice to the requester within five business
days notifying them that the request for access is being reviewed and requires
the 30-day extension along with the extension ending date. The response shall
include the exception(s) applicable.
   (f)   Denial/partial denial.
      (1)   If the city’s response is a denial or partial denial of a written
request for access, whether in whole or in part, a written response will be
issued and will include:
         (A)   A description of the record requested;
         (B)   The specific reason(s) for the denial, including a citation of
supporting legal authority;
         (C)   The typed or printed name, title, business address, business
telephone number and signature of the Open Records Officer on whose authority
the denial is issued;
         (D)   Date of the response; and
         (E)   The procedure to appeal the denial of access.
      (2)   It is not the intent of this policy to make a document a public
record that is not a public record by law.
   (g)   Open records office appeal.

Council or its delegate, the plan administrator, subject to the direction of
the donor and not inconsistent with applicable laws and the terms of the plan.
   (e)   No reversion to the employer. At no time shall it be possible for the
plan assets to be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the
exclusive benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries, except that
contributions made by the employer may be returned to the employer if the

within one year of the discovery of the mistaken payment of the contribution or
the plan is terminated, as provided in §
151.12.
(Ord. 6176, passed 11-23-2010)

form as provided in §
151.07(a) hereof. The monthly amount of the normal retirement benefit shall be
equal to 2.5% of the participant’s average monthly compensation multiplied by
the participant’s years of service up to a maximum benefit of 50% of average
monthly compensation.
   (c)   Early retirement. Each participant whose employment is terminated
prior to his normal retirement date other than by death or disability but after
attainment of early retirement age shall be entitled to an early retirement
benefit.
   (d)   Early retirement benefit. Each participant who shall become entitled
to a benefit pursuant to subsection (c) shall receive a benefit commencing on
the early retirement date paid monthly in an amount equal to the participant’s
accrued benefit, reduced by 4% for each year by which the early retirement date
precedes the normal retirement date (prorate for partial years; 0.33% per
month).
   (e)   Late retirement. A participant may continue in employment beyond the
attainment of normal retirement age subject to the employer’s rules and
regulations regarding retirement age. If a participant who has met the
requirements of subsection (a) continues in employment beyond the participant’s
normal retirement date, there shall be no retirement benefits paid until
employment has ceased and the participant’s retirement actually commences. The
retirement benefit of a participant described in this subsection and who has
not elected to become a DROP participant pursuant to the provisions of §
151.09 shall be calculated in accordance with subsection (b) on the basis of
average monthly compensation as of the participant’s actual retirement and
shall commence on the participant’s late retirement date.
   (f)   Application for benefit. A participant must complete and execute an
application for benefit on a form and in the manner prescribed by the plan
administrator and deliver the said application to the plan administrator at
least 30 days prior to the date on which benefit payments are to commence.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no retirement
benefit payments or any other benefit payments shall be due or payable on or
before the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date
that is 30 days after the date the plan administrator receives the application
for benefit.
   (g)   Limitation of liability. Nothing contained herein shall obligate the
employer, the plan administrator, any fiduciary or any agent or representative
of any of the foregoing, to provide any retirement or other benefit to any
participant or beneficiary which cannot be provided from the assets available
in the Pension Fund, whether such benefits are in pay status or otherwise
payable under the terms of the plan. The Council retains the right to amend or
terminate this plan at any time, consistent with applicable law and any
obligation under applicable collective bargaining agreements, with or without
cause and whether or not such action directly or indirectly results in the
suspension, reduction or termination of any benefit payable under the plan or
in pay status, and without liability to any person for any such action.
   (h)   Special provision for restated plans. The benefit amount of any
participant who may have retired prior to the restatement date shall not be in
any way altered by the provisions of this plan, except where otherwise
expressly indicated herein, and shall continue to be determined on the basis of
the terms of the plan in effect on the day preceding the restatement date.
   (i)   Maximum benefit limitations. Notwithstanding any provision of this
plan to the contrary, no benefit provided under this plan attributable to
contributions of the employer shall exceed, as an annual amount, the amount
specified in Code § 415(b)(1)(A) as adjusted pursuant to Code § 415(d),
assuming the form of benefit shall be a straight life annuity (with no
ancillary benefits). The limitations described in this subsection shall be
governed by the following conditions and definitions:
      (1)   Benefits paid or payable in a form other than a straight life
annuity (with no ancillary benefits) or where the employee contributes to the
plan or makes rollover contributions shall be adjusted on an actuarially
equivalent basis in accordance with applicable regulations to determine the
limitation contained herein;
      (2)   In the case of a benefit which commences prior to the attainment of
age 62 by the participant, the limitation herein shall be adjusted on an
actuarially equivalent basis to the amount determined pursuant to this
subsection commencing at age 62; however, in the case of a qualified
participant (a participant with respect to whom a period of at least 15 years
of service, including applicable military service, as a full-time employee of a
police or fire department is taken into account in determining the amount of
benefit), the limitation contained herein shall not apply;
      (3)   In the case of a benefit which commences after attainment of age 65
by the participant, the limitation herein shall be adjusted on an actuarially
equivalent basis in accordance with applicable regulations to the amount
determined commencing at age 65;
      (4)   Benefits paid to a participant which total less than $10,000 from
all defined benefit plans maintained by the employer expressed as an annual
benefit shall be deemed not to exceed the limitation of this subsection;
provided that, the employer has not at any time maintained a defined
contribution plan in which the participant has participated; however, in the
case of a participant who is not receiving a disability retirement benefit
pursuant to §
151.05(b), with fewer than ten years of participation the limitation expressed
in this paragraph (4) shall be reduced by one-tenth for each year of
participation less than 10 but in no event shall this limitation be less than
$1,000;
      (5)   The limitations expressed herein shall be based upon plan years for
calculation purposes, shall be applied to all defined benefit plans maintained
by the employer as one defined benefit plan and to all defined contribution
plans maintained by the employer as one defined contribution plan, and shall be
applied and interpreted consistent with Code § 415 and regulations thereunder
as applicable to government plans in general and this plan in particular; and
      (6)   In the case of a disability retirement benefit under §
151.05(b), the adjustment under paragraph (2) hereof shall not apply and the
applicable limitation shall be the limitation contained herein without regard
to the age of the benefit recipient.
(Ord. 6176, passed 11-23-2010)
§ 151.05 DISABILITY RETIREMENT.
   (a)   Disability retirement. A participant who has completed at least 15
years of service and who incurs a total and permanent disability before
attaining normal retirement age shall be entitled to a disability retirement
benefit determined as of the disability retirement date.
   (b)   Disability retirement benefit. A participant who shall be entitled to
a disability retirement benefit under subsection (a) shall receive a benefit
equal to the participant’s normal retirement benefit calculated in accordance
with §
151.04(b) as of the participant’s disability retirement date, assuming the
participant had completed 20 years of service.
   (c)   Payment of disability benefit. Payment of a disability retirement
benefit shall be made monthly commencing on the participant’s disability
retirement date and continuing until the earliest of the death of the
participant, cessation of total and permanent disability, or attainment of
normal retirement age (such a participant who attains normal retirement age
shall thereafter receive a normal retirement benefit pursuant to §
151.04(b)). If the participant’s total and permanent disability shall cease
prior to the attainment of the participant’s normal retirement age, the
participant shall be deemed to have terminated employment as of the disability
retirement date for purposes of this plan unless the participant shall resume
active employment within three months following the date on which such total
and permanent disability ceased. A participant who fails to resume active
employment after total and permanent disability ceases shall not be entitled to
a distribution of accumulated contributions pursuant to §
151.08(b) to the extent that the total amount of disability retirement benefits
paid exceeds the value of the participant’s accumulated contributions as of the
disability retirement date, and shall not be entitled to any other benefits
under the plan as a result of the accumulation of any years of service as of
the disability retirement date.
   (d)   Verification of disability. The plan administrator shall determine
whether a participant shall have incurred a total and permanent disability.
Proof of total and permanent disability shall consist of the sworn statement of
three practicing physicians designated by the Board that the participant has
incurred a total and permanent disability. If the plan administrator shall
determine that a participant who is totally and permanently disabled has
recovered sufficiently to resume active employment or if a participant refuses
to undergo a medical examination as directed by the plan administrator (such a
medical examination may not be required more frequently than once in any given
12-month period), the payment of disability retirement benefits shall cease.
   (e)   Cessation of disability. A participant who is receiving payment of
disability retirement benefits under this plan must notify the plan
administrator of any change in condition which may cause the participant’s
entitlement to receipt of such benefits to cease. If a participant fails to
provide immediate notice to the plan administrator of any such change in status
and thereby continues to receive payment of benefits hereunder to which the
participant is not entitled, the plan administrator may take whatever action is
necessary and permitted under applicable law to recover any amount of improper
payments, including offsetting such amounts against any future payment of
retirement or other benefits under the plan or legal action. The plan
administrator may also recover the costs of any such action.
(Ord. 6176, passed 11-23-2010)
§ 151.06 DEATH BENEFITS.
   (a)   Death of participant. Upon the occurrence of the death of a
participant who is not a DROP participant, there shall be benefits payable in
accordance with the following subsections of this section. Death benefits that
may apply in the case of a DROP participant are provided for in §
151.09.
   (b)   Death prior to retirement. If a participant shall die prior to the
commencement of the payment of any retirement or other benefits under this
plan, the beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a distribution of the
participant’s accumulated contributions as of the date of death of the
participant.
   (c)   Death after retirement. In the event that a participant shall die
after the receipt of any benefit payments under the plan, the beneficiary shall
be entitled to a benefit only to the extent and in the manner consistent with
the provisions of the form of payment of benefits selected by the participant
pursuant to the provisions of this plan.
(Ord. 6176, passed 11-23-2010)
§ 151.07 PAYMENT OF BENEFITS.
   (a)   Normal form. The normal form for payment of retirement benefits shall
be an annuity for the life of the participant paid in equal monthly
installments.
   (b)   Optional form of benefit payment. The automatic form of payment of
retirement benefits shall be the normal form under subsection (a) unless the
participant elects to receive payment of benefits in an optional form as
provided herein. A participant who retires under §
151.04(a), (c) or (e), may elect an optional form by giving written notice to
the plan administrator at least 30 days prior to the date that benefit payments
are to commence hereunder. Such optional form shall be the actuarial equivalent
of the normal form.
      (1)   Life annuity with period certain option.
         (A)   In lieu of receiving a retirement benefit under the normal form,
a participant may elect to convert the benefit to this option which provides
for a retirement benefit payable monthly to the participant until the death of
the participant occurs or for a period certain whichever is longer. If the
participant shall die before receiving payment of benefits (including payments
credited to a DROP participant’s DROP account) at least equal to the period
certain, then the remainder of the period certain payments shall be paid as
they become due to a designated beneficiary. The total number of payments made
to the participant (including payments credited to a DROP participant’s DROP
account) and beneficiary shall equal the number of period certain payments
selected. The participant may elect a period certain of 60 months, 120 months
or 180 months.
         (B)   If the participant shall die after receiving monthly payments
equal to or greater than the period certain, there shall be no additional
payments made after the death of the participant shall occur.
         (C)   When multiple beneficiaries are designated, it shall be assumed
that the payments will be divided equally, unless specified otherwise. A
designated beneficiary under this option may be changed during the period
certain pursuant to §
151.02(c).
      (2)   Contingent annuitant option.
         (A)   In lieu of receiving the retirement benefit under the normal
form, a participant may elect to convert the benefit to a contingent annuitant
option which provides for a retirement benefit payable to the retired
participant until death and for the continuation of benefit payments in an
amount equal to 50%, 66% or 100% of the participant’s reduced pension benefit
to the previously designated contingent annuitant, if living, after the retired
participant’s death.
         (B)   If the contingent annuitant is the spouse of the retired
participant, the benefit payable under this option is payable without
restriction. If, however, the contingent annuitant is any person other than the
spouse of the retired participant, the benefit payable under this option shall
be limited to the extent that the present value of the payments to be made to
the participant until death shall be more than 50% of the present value of the
total payments to be made to the participant and the contingent annuitant.
         (C)   If the death of the contingent annuitant occurs before the
participant’s actual retirement date, or in the case of a DROP participant,
before the DROP participation date, any election of this option shall be deemed
null and void and the retirement benefit shall be payable in the normal form,
as if the contingent annuitant option had not been elected. If the contingent
annuitant predeceases the retired participant after actual retirement, or in
the case of a DROP participant, after the DROP participation date, retirement
benefit payments shall terminate with the monthly payment due immediately
preceding the retired participant’s death. Participants may not change the
designated contingent annuitant after benefit payments commence or in the case
of a DROP participant, after the DROP participation date.
      (3)   A married participant may only designate a contingent annuitant or
beneficiary pursuant to §
151.07(b) other than the participant’s spouse if written consent from the
spouse is obtained.
   (c)   Commencement of benefits. A participant may make an election to
commence receiving distribution of retirement benefits as of the participant’s
early, normal or late retirement date or other such date as provided for and
elected by the participant pursuant to §
151.08(c), whichever is applicable, or may defer such payments to a date not
later than the required date for commencement of benefits determined under
subsection (d). A participant whose last day of employment is a day other than
the last day of the calendar month, shall receive a prorated monthly payment
for the month of termination based on the number of days remaining in that
month.
   (d)   Required distributions.
      (1)   (A)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the entire
benefit of any participant who becomes entitled to benefits prior to death
shall be distributed either:
            1.   Not later than the required beginning date; and
            2.   Over a period beginning not later than the required beginning
date and extending over the life of such participant or over the lives of such
participant and a designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond
the life expectancy of such participant, or the joint life expectancies of such
participant and a designated beneficiary).
         (B)   If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan
dies prior to the date when the entire interest has been distributed after
distribution of benefits has begun in accordance with subsection (d)(1)(A)2.
above, the remaining portion of such benefit shall be distributed at least as
rapidly as under the method of distribution being used under subsection (d)(1)
(A)2. above as of the date of death.
      (2)   If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies
before distribution of the benefit has begun, the entire interest of such
employee shall be distributed within five years of the death of such employee,
unless the following sentence is applicable. If any portion of the employee’s
interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) a designated beneficiary, such
portion shall be distributed over the life of such designated beneficiary (or
over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary),
and such distributions begin not later than one year after the date of the
employee’s death or such later date as provided by regulations issued by the
Secretary of the Treasury, then for purposes of the five-year rule set forth in
the preceding sentence, the benefit payable to the beneficiary shall be treated
as distributed on the date on which such distributions begin; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the designated
beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the participant, then the date on which
distributions are required to begin shall not be earlier than the date upon
which the employee would have attained age (70-1/2); and, further provided, if
the surviving spouse dies before the distributions to such spouse begin, this
subparagraph shall be applied as if the surviving spouse were the employee.
      (3)   For purposes of this subsection, the following definitions and
procedures shall apply.
         (A)   “Required Beginning Date” shall mean April 1 of the calendar
year following the later of the calendar year in which the employee attains age
70-1/2, or the calendar year in which the employee retires.
         (B)   The phrase “designated beneficiary” shall mean any individual
designated by the employee under this plan according to its rules.
         (C)   Any amount paid to a child shall be treated as if it had been
paid to the surviving spouse if such amount will become payable to the
surviving spouse upon such child’s reaching majority (or other designated event
permitted under regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury).
         (D)   For purposes of this subsection, the life expectancy of an
employee and/or the employee’s spouse (other than in the case of a life
annuity) may be redetermined but not more frequently than annually.
   (e)   Direct rollovers.
      (1)   A distributee who receives a distribution from the plan which is an
eligible rollover distribution may elect to transfer said distribution to an
eligible rollover plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this subsection (except
as otherwise required by Code § 401(a)(31)):
         (A)   A direct rollover can be elected for part of an eligible
rollover distribution only if the amount so elected is at least $500.

§ 151.08 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
   (a)   Rights of terminated employees. A participant who shall cease to be an
employee, except as otherwise hereinbefore provided shall have all interest and
rights under this plan limited to those contained in the following subsections
of this section.
   (b)   Distribution of accumulated contributions. A participant whose
employment with the employer shall terminate for any reason other than death or
total and permanent disability prior to attainment of normal retirement age
shall be entitled to receive a distribution of accumulated contributions. Upon
receipt of such accumulated contributions, said participant and beneficiary
shall not be entitled to any further payments from the plan.
      (1)   Any member of City Council as of January 1, 2026 whose
participation in the plan ceased due to the amendment to exclude members of
City Council as employees eligible for participation shall be entitled to a
refund of their accumulated contributions. Upon payment of the accumulated
contributions to the member of City Council, no further benefits shall be
payable. A member of City Council who is vested pursuant to §
151.08(c) or has reached early or normal retirement age as of January 1, 2026
may elect to vest their accrued benefit or apply for retirement, as applicable,
in lieu of receiving a distribution of their accumulated contributions.
   (c)   Deferred retirement benefit.

and whose employment shall terminate for any reason other than due to death,
retirement or total and permanent disability prior to early retirement age
shall be entitled to a monthly deferred vested benefit equal to his or her
accrued benefit determined as of the date when his or her employment terminates
in lieu of a distribution of accumulated contributions pursuant to subsection
(b). Such a deferred vested benefit shall commence after application pursuant
to §
151.04(f) and not earlier than the date that would be the participant’s normal
retirement date or early retirement date under the plan if the participant
remained in employment until such date. In the case of a participant who elects
to commence payment of the deferred vested benefit on an early retirement date,
the amount of such benefit shall be subject to applicable early retirement
reductions pursuant to §
151.04(d).
      (2)   A participant who shall have completed 20 years of service and

lieu of the deferred vested benefit outlined in the preceding paragraph. Such
involuntary termination retirement benefit shall be equal to the benefit
determined pursuant to §
151.04(b) hereof and shall commence on or after the date on which the
participant attains 55 years of age (or immediately if already beyond age 55)

(Ord. 6176, passed 11-23-2010; Ord. 6470, passed 12-14-2023)
§ 151.09 DROP BENEFITS.
   (a)   Deferred Retirement Option Provision (DROP) overview. The plan shall
provide for a deferred retirement option provision, hereafter referred to as
“DROP” for participants who qualify for and apply for such option pursuant to
this section. In general, the DROP provides participants who are eligible for
normal retirement the opportunity to continue working and still being entitled
to their pension benefit. Such a participant would “retire” from the plan on
the date of their choosing, which would become the DROP participation date and
agrees to finally separate from active service at a date no more than five
years later. A calculation is made of the monthly normal retirement benefit as
of the DROP participation date. The DROP participant is then considered retired
for all pension plan purposes. The amount of each monthly benefit is credited
to the participant’s DROP account, along with interest, while the participant
is still actively employed. When the participant finally leaves employment, the
value of the DROP account is distributed to the participant (either a lump-sum
or rollover) and the monthly benefits are paid directly to the participant in
the form of payment previously selected at DROP participation date.
   (b)   DROP eligibility. An employee who is eligible for a normal retirement
benefit under §
151.04(a) or will be eligible for a normal retirement benefit prior to
participation in the DROP, and who is not an elected official of the employer,
is eligible to participate in the DROP by filing a written application with the
plan administrator at least 30 days before the employee’s effective date of
DROP participation.
   (c)   Election to participate in DROP. An eligible participant may elect to
participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed five years. Upon deciding to
participate in a DROP, a participant must submit, on forms provided by the plan
administrator, a binding and irrevocable written election which discloses the
participant’s intent to retire, specifies the effective date of DROP
participation, specifies the participant’s final retirement date (no later than
five years after the effective date of DROP participation), which shall be the
DROP termination date, and designates a beneficiary or beneficiaries. Such
election must detail a DROP participant’s rights and obligations under the DROP
and include an agreement to forgo:
      (1)   Active membership in the plan;
      (2)   Any growth in the salary base used for calculating the regular
retirement benefit; and
      (3)   Any additional benefit accrual for retirement purposes. The DROP
participant shall be required to provide any other information required by the
Board.
   (d)   Calculation of DROP retirement benefit. Upon receipt of a
participant’s election forms to participant in DROP, the employer shall
calculate the normal retirement benefit pursuant to §
151.04(b) based on the employee’s years of service and average monthly
compensation as of the employee’s DROP participation date. Optional forms of
payment shall be calculated pursuant to §
151.07(b) as of the DROP participation date based on the beneficiary or
contingent annuitant designated on the DROP election. Once the participant
chooses a form of payment for receiving benefits, the monthly amount associated
with that form shall be then considered the DROP retirement benefit.
   (e)   Credits to DROP account. A DROP account shall be established in the
name of the DROP participant for purposes of accumulating DROP retirement
benefits during DROP participation. Starting with the calendar month following
the DROP participation date, the amount of the DROP retirement benefit shall be
credited to the DROP participant’s DROP account each month during DROP
participation. Interest shall be credited to the DROP account. The rate of
interest shall be the actual rate of return on the fund, but no less than 0%
and no more than 4.5% per year (prorated for partial years). The actual rate of
return shall be calculated by the plan’s investment manager or consultant, on a
plan year basis, and communicated to the plan administrator. In the case of the
last partial plan year of a DROP participant’s DROP participation, the actual
rate of return for the prior plan year shall be used to determine the interest
credited to the DROP account for that period. A separate accounting of the DROP
participant’s accumulated DROP account shall be calculated annually and
provided to the participant after the end of each plan year.
   (f)   DROP participation termination. A DROP participant may change the DROP
termination date to an earlier date and no penalty shall be imposed for early
termination of DROP participation. Notice should be provided to the employer at
least 60 days prior to any such early termination, unless the reason for the
early termination is due to a total and permanent disability. Upon either early
or regular termination of DROP participation the DROP participant shall be
separated from employment with the employer and the retirement plan shall pay
the balance in the DROP participant’s DROP account to the terminating
participant as provided in subsection (g) and the DROP participant shall be
ineligible to re-enroll in the DROP thereafter even if the former DROP
participant is re-employed by the employer with renewed active membership in
the plan.
   (g)   Payment of DROP benefits. On the effective date of a DROP
participant’s termination of employment with the employer, participation in the
DROP shall cease; and the plan shall pay to the participant total accumulated
value of the participant’s DROP account. Such distribution shall be considered
an eligible rollover distribution pursuant to §
151.07(e). The terminating DROP participant shall commence receipt of the
monthly DROP retirement benefit directly, starting with the calendar month
following termination of employment with the employer.
   (h)   Death of a DROP participant. If a DROP participant dies, the DROP
participant’s designated beneficiary shall be entitled to receive the benefits
accumulated in the participant’s DROP account. In addition, a monthly benefit
shall be paid to the beneficiary or contingent annuitant if the participant
previously elected a form of benefit payment for the participant’s DROP
retirement benefit pursuant to §
151.07(b) that would provide for payments after death to a beneficiary or
contingent annuitant. Such monthly benefit payments shall commence the calendar
month following the death of the DROP participant.
   (i)   DROP legislation. DROP benefits pursuant to this Section shall at all
times comply with Act 205 of 1984, as amended by Act 44 of 2009 and any
subsequent amendments.
(Ord. 6176, passed 11-23-2010)

   (c)   Authority and duties of the Plan Administrator.
      (1)   The plan administrator shall have full power and authority to do
whatever shall, in its judgment, be reasonably necessary for the proper
administration and operation of the plan. The interpretation or construction
placed upon any term or provision of the plan by the plan administrator or any
action of the plan administrator taken in good faith shall be final and

      (2)   The plan administrator in its capacity as plan administrator shall
have no power to add to, subtract from or modify the terms of the plan or
change or add to any benefits provided by the plan, or to waive or fail to
apply any requirements of eligibility for benefits under the plan. Further, the

or to determine or require any contributions to the plan, said powers being
exclusively reserved to the Council in its capacity as the governing body of
the employer.
   (d)   Plan administration expense. All reasonable expenses incident to the
functioning of the plan administrator, including, but not limited to, fees of
accountants, counsel, actuaries and other specialists and other costs of

the employer.
   (e)   Hold harmless. No member of the Council, nor the plan administrator,
nor the actuary, nor any other person involved in the administration of the

a party by reason of being or having been the plan administrator or a delegate
or appointee of the plan administrator, except in matters involving criminal
liability, intentional or willful misconduct. If the employer purchases

insured amount.
   (f)   Approval of benefits. The plan administrator shall review and approve
or deny any application for retirement benefits within 30 days following
receipt thereof or within such longer time as may be necessary under the
circumstances. Any denial of an application for retirement benefits shall be in
writing and shall specify the reason for such denial.
   (g)   Appeal procedure. Any person whose application for retirement benefits
is denied, who questions the amount of benefit paid, who believes a benefit

the claimant. Such 90-day period may be extended by the plan administrator if
special circumstances so require for up to 90 additional days by the plan
administrator’s delivering notice of such extension to the claimant within the
first 90-day period. Any notice hereunder shall be written in a manner
calculated to be understood by the claimant and, if a notice of denial, shall
set forth (A) the specific plan provisions on which the denial is based, (B) an
explanation of additional material or information, if any necessary to perfect

claimant or a duly authorized representative shall have the right to review any
pertinent documents and to submit any issues or comments in writing. The
Council shall, within 60 days after receipt of the notice requesting such
review, (or in special circumstances, such as where the Council in its sole
discretion holds a hearing, within 120 days of receipt of such notice), submit
its decision in writing to the person or persons whose claim has been denied.
The decision shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties, shall be
written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall
contain specific references to the pertinent plan provisions on which the
decision is based.

status shall be filed within 90 days following the date of the first payment
which would be adjusted if the claim is granted unless the plan administrator
allows a later filing for good cause shown.
      (5)   A claimant who does not submit a notice of a claim or a notice
requesting a review of a denial of a claim within the time limitations
specified above shall be deemed to have waived such claim or right to review.
      (6)   Nothing contained herein is intended to abridge any right of a
claimant to appeal any final decision hereunder to a court of competent
jurisdiction under 2 Pa.C.S.A. § 752. No decision hereunder is a final decision
from which such an appeal may be taken until the entire appeal procedure of
this subsection of the plan has been exhausted.

applicable law, is hereby adopted as part of the plan, to the extent of the
participation in such collective or commingled trust fund by the plan;

otherwise act to secure specialized advice or assistance, as it deems necessary
or desirable in connection with the management of the fund; to the extent not
prohibited by applicable law, the employer shall be entitled to rely
conclusively upon and shall be fully protected in any action or omission taken
by it in good faith reliance upon, the advice or opinion of such persons or
firms, provided such persons or firms were prudently chosen by the employer,
taking into account the interests of the participants and beneficiaries and
with due regard to the ability of the persons or firms to perform their
assigned functions; and
      (16)   To retain the services of one or more persons or firms for the
management of (including the power to acquire and dispose of) all or any part

as an investment advisor under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, is a bank
(as defined in that act), or is an insurance company qualified to manage,
acquire or dispose of pension trust assets under the laws of more than one
state; in such event, the employer shall follow the directions of such
Investment Manager or Managers with respect to the acquisition and disposition
of fund assets, but shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of such
investment manager or managers, nor shall it be under any obligation to review
or otherwise manage any fund assets which are subject to the management of such
investment manager or managers. If the employer appoints a trustee, the trustee
shall not be permitted to retain such an investment manager, except with the
express written consent of the employer.
   (c)   Common investments. The employer shall not be required to make
separate investments for individual participants or to maintain separate

appointed, the trustee shall be entitled to such reasonable compensation as
shall from time to time be agreed upon by the employer and the trustee, unless
such compensation is prohibited by law. Such compensation, and all expenses
reasonably incurred by the trustee in carrying out his functions, shall
constitute a charge upon the employer or the Pension Fund, which may be
executed at any time after 30 days written notice to the employer. The employer
shall be under no obligation to pay such costs and expenses, and, in the event
of its failure to do so, the trustee shall be entitled to pay the same, or to
reimburse themselves for the payment thereof, from the Pension Fund.
   (e)   Periodic accounting. If a trustee is appointed, the Pension Fund shall
be evaluated annually, or at more frequent intervals, by the trustee and a
written accounting rendered as of each fiscal year end of the fund, and as of
the effective date of any removal or resignation of the trustee, and such
additional dates as requested by the employer, showing the condition of the
fund and all receipts, disbursements and other transactions effected by the
trustee during the period covered by the accounting, based on fair market
values prevailing as of such date.
   (f)   Value of the Pension Fund. All determinations as to the value of the
assets of the Pension Fund, and as to the amount of the liabilities thereof,
shall be made by the employer or its appointed trustee, whose decisions shall
be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto, the participants and
Beneficiaries and their estates. In making any such determination, the employer
or trustee shall be entitled to seek and rely upon the opinion of or any
information furnished by brokers, appraisers and other experts, and shall also
be entitled to rely upon reports as to sales and quotations, both on security
exchanges and otherwise as contained in newspapers and in financial
publications.
(Ord. 6176, passed 11-23-2010)
§ 151.12 AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.
   (a)   Amendment of the plan. The employer may amend this plan at any time or
from time to time by an instrument in writing executed in the name of the
employer under its municipal seal by officers duly authorized to execute such
instrument and delivered to the Council; provided, however:
      (1)   That no amendment shall deprive any participant or any beneficiary
of a deceased participant of any of the benefits to which each is entitled
under this plan with respect to contributions previously made;
      (2)   That no amendment shall provide for the use of funds or assets held
under this plan other than for the benefit of employees and no funds
contributed to this plan or assets of this plan shall, except as provided in
subsection (e), ever revert to or be used or enjoyed by the employer; and
      (3)   That no amendment to the plan which provides for a benefit
modification shall be made unless the cost estimate described in §
151.13(c) has been prepared and presented to the Council in accordance with the
Act.
   (b)   Termination of the plan. The employer shall have the power to
terminate this plan in its entirety at any time by an instrument in writing
executed in the name of the employer.
   (c)   Automatic termination of contributions. Subject to the provisions of
the Act governing financially distressed municipalities, the liability of the
employer to make contributions to the Pension Fund shall automatically
terminate upon liquidation or dissolution of the employer, upon its
adjudication as a bankrupt or upon the making of a general assignment for the
benefit of its creditors.
   (d)   Distribution upon termination.
      (1)   In the event of the termination of the plan, all amounts of vested
benefits accrued by the affected participants as of the date of such
termination, to the extent funded on such date, shall be non-forfeitable
hereunder. In the event of termination of the plan, the employer shall direct
either:
         (A)   That the plan administrator continue to hold the vested accrued
benefits of participants in the Pension Fund in accordance with the provisions
of the plan (other than those provisions related to forfeitures) without regard
to such termination until all funds have been distributed in accordance with
the provisions; or
         (B)   That the plan administrator immediately distribute to each
participant an amount equal to the vested accrued benefit to the date.
      (2)   If there are insufficient assets in the Pension Fund to provide for
all vested accrued benefits as of the date of plan termination, priority shall
first be given to the distribution of any amounts attributable to mandatory or
voluntary employee contributions before assets are applied to the distribution
of any vested benefits attributable to other sources hereunder.
      (3)   All other assets attributable to the terminated plan shall be
distributed and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of applicable law
and the terms of any instrument adopted by the employer which effects such
termination.
   (e)   Residual assets. If all liabilities to vested participants and any
others entitled to receive a benefit under the terms of the plan have been
satisfied and there remain any residual assets in the Pension Fund, such
residual assets remaining shall be returned to the employer insofar as such
return does not contravene any provision of law, and any remaining balance, in
excess of employer contributions, shall be returned to the commonwealth.
   (f)   Exclusive benefit rule. In the event of the discontinuance and
termination of the plan as provided herein, the employer shall dispose of the
Pension Fund in accordance with the terms of the plan and applicable law; at no
time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan shall any part
of the corpus or income of the Pension Fund, after deducting any administrative
or other expenses properly chargeable to the Pension Fund, be used for or
diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of the participants
in the plan, their beneficiaries or their estates.

beginning of each plan year occurring in an odd-numbered calendar year,
beginning with the year 1985. Such actuarial valuation shall be prepared and
certified by an approved actuary, as such term is defined in the Act.
      (2)   The expenses attributable to the preparation of any actuarial
valuation report or experience investigation required by the Act or any other
expense which is permissible under the terms of the Act and which are directly

their fiduciary role, shall monitor the services provided to the plan to ensure
that the expenses are necessary, reasonable and benefit the pension plan and,
further provided, that the plan administrator shall document all such expenses
item by item, and where necessary, hour by hour.
   (b)   Duties of Chief Administrative Officer.
      (1)   Such actuarial reports shall be prepared and filed under the
supervision of the Chief Administrative Officer.
      (2)   The Chief Administrative Officer of the plan shall determine the
financial requirements of the plan on the basis of the most recent actuarial

Administrative Officer shall submit the financial requirements of the plan and
the minimum municipal obligation of the employer to the Council annually and

modification. Such estimate shall be prepared by an approved actuary, which
estimate shall disclose to the Council the impact of the proposed benefit plan

§ 151.14 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Employment rights. Participation in this plan shall not give any right
to any employee to be retained in the employ of the employer nor shall it
interfere with the right of the employer to discharge any employee and to deal
with such employee without regard to the effect that such treatment might have
upon participation in this plan.
   (b)   Meaning of certain words. As used herein the masculine gender shall
include the feminine gender and the singular shall include the plural in all
cases where such meaning would be appropriate. Headings of articles and
sections are inserted only for convenience of reference and are not to be
considered in the construction of the plan.
   (c)   Information to be furnished by the employer. The employer shall
furnish to the plan administrator (and where applicable, the trustee)
information in the employer’s possession as the plan administrator and the
trustee shall require from time to time to perform their duties under the plan.
   (d)   Severability of provisions. Should any provisions of this plan be held
illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not
affect the remaining parts of this plan, and the plan shall be construed and
enforced as if said illegal and invalid provisions had never been inserted
herein.

§ 153.01 CREATION OF FUND; CONFLICT OF LAW.
   There is hereby created a police retirement fund in the city to be known as
the Police Retirement Fund which is to be administered in accordance with the
laws of third class cities that relate to police officers’ pension funds and in
accordance with the provisions of
Art. 153. Where the provisions of
Art. 153 are inconsistent with the police pension laws of third class cities
the provisions of third class city law shall prevail.
(Ord. 5843, approved 2-15-2001)
§ 153.02 REGULATION BY COUNCIL.
   (a)   The Police Retirement Fund shall be under the direction of Council and
applied under regulations as Council, by this article or subsequent ordinances,
may prescribe for the benefit of such members of the Police Bureau as received
honorable discharge by reason of age or disability and the families of such as
may be injured or killed in the service. Such age shall be in conformity with a
uniform scale.
   (b)   In addition to the members of Council serving as the Police Pension
Board, one member of the Police Bureau, to be chosen by the members of the
Police Bureau shall serve on the Board.
(Ord. 5843, approved 2-15-2001)
§ 153.03 ELIGIBILITY.
   The fund shall be used for the relief and pensioning of the members of the
Police Bureau, including the Chief of Police, captains of police, lieutenants
of police, captain of detectives and police detectives, sergeants, inspectors
of police, police woman or police women and all other ranks now or in the
future to be attached to the Police Bureau or their respective dependents, to
wit: for the benefit of such members of the Police Bureau as received honorable
discharge from the Police Bureau by reason of age or disability and the
families of such as may be injured or killed in the service. Allowance shall be
made to those who are retired by reason of the disabilities of age in
conformity with a uniform scale. No person shall be eligible for any allowance
from the fund, except those regularly in the service of the Police Bureau and
who give their time exclusively to the work of the Police Bureau or their
dependents.
(Ord. 5843, approved 2-15-2001)
§ 153.04 SERVICE AND AGE REQUIREMENTS.
   Every member of the Police Bureau may retire at the age of 50 years after 20

the Chief of Police, who have attained the age of 60 years. Any police officer
after attaining 20 years of service may leave the force and his or her pension
rights are vested at that time and shall begin collecting retirement benefits
at the age of 50. Should an officer die after attaining 20 years of service,
but before attaining the age of 50 years, his or her widow and dependent
children would collect retirement benefits in the same manner as if he or she
were on pension at the time of his or her death. Members so retired shall be
subject to service from time to time as a police reserve until unfitted for
such service when he may be fully discharged by reason of age or disability.

Treasurer. The Treasurer shall cause the same to be paid into the Police
Retirement Fund and shall report the payment to the Director of Finance and
Personnel and the City Controller. No member of the Police Bureau shall be
entitled to any benefits of any retirement allowance who has not made the
monthly payments provided by this article or any past pension or retirement
ordinance.

shall pay into the retirement fund a monthly service increment sum in addition
to his or her retirement contribution, which shall be equal to 0.5% of his or
her salary. However, such payment shall not exceed the sum of $1 per month, and
such service increment contribution shall not be paid after a contributor has
reached the age of 65 years.

honorable discharge or retirement and shall not in any case exceed in any year
one-half of the annual pay of each member computed at such monthly rate.
   (b)   In addition to the retirement allowance which is authorized to be paid

limitations placed upon such retirement allowances and upon contributions,
every contributor who becomes entitled to the retirement allowance shall also
be entitled to the payment of a service increment in accordance with and
subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth.
   (c)   Service increment shall be the sum obtained by computing the number of
whole years after having served the minimum required by this article during
which a contributor has been employed by the city and paid out of the City
Treasury and multiplying the number of years so computed by an amount equal to
one-fortieth of the retirement allowance which has become payable to such
contributor in accordance with the provisions of this article. In computing the
service increment, no employment after the contributor has reached the age of
65 years shall be included, and no service increment shall be paid in excess of
$100 per month.

the member as of the date of death, honorable discharge or retirement, or one-
half of the highest average annual salary which the member received during any
five years of service preceding injury, death, honorable discharge or
retirement, whichever is the higher, but shall not, in any case, exceed in any
year one-half the annual pay for such member computed at such last 365 days or

pass the required mental and physical examinations. Where more than one person
takes examinations for any of such positions at the same time, the names of all
those successfully passing such examination shall be entered upon the list of
eligible names in the order of their respective percentages, the highest coming
first. The Board shall furnish to Council a certified copy of all lists so
prepared and kept. Such lists shall be maintained for a period of two years.
      (2)   Whenever any vacancy shall occur in any civil service position, the
Mayor shall make written application to the Chair of the Board, who shall
forthwith certify to the Mayor, in writing, the three names on the lists of
applicants for such position having the highest percentage, where there are
three or more eligible names on the list, but if there are less than three

Director of the department in which such appointment is to be made shall
nominate to the Mayor a person from the list submitted to fill such vacancy. If
the Mayor and City Council approves such nomination, the person nominated shall

stricken from the list of the Board, and the names of the rejected persons

   (a)   (1)   The payment for the assessments made pursuant to § 304.04 shall
be due and payable within 60 days of notice of the assessment, unless
application for installment payments as hereinafter provided is made. If any
owner of property against which an assessment has been made and who has not

within 60 days after service of the notice of assessment has been made in the
manner provided by law and within the time permitted by law, the City Solicitor
shall file a municipal claim or lien therefor, together with interest at the
rate of 6% per year from date of completion of the work.
      (2)   The Treasurer of the city shall certify to the Solicitor all unpaid
assessments and the Solicitor shall file municipal claims or liens therefor in
the proper office of Lycoming County, as provided by law against the property
or properties with respect to which such assessment or assessments have been
charged. The Solicitor, thereupon, shall proceed to collect all such

annual installments. The first installment thereof shall be due and payable 10-
30-1977, and each subsequent installment shall be due the same date each
calendar year thereafter, together with interest on the balance due at the rate
of 6% per year. However, the granting of such privilege of paying any
assessment in installments shall not prevent the city from or relieve the city

improvements.
   (c)   Notwithstanding the filing of such claims, all assessments which are
made payable in installments shall constitute liens and encumbrances upon the
respective benefitted properties at the beginning of each calendar year in an
amount equal to the sum of the annual installment becoming payable in such
year, with interest and penalties, if any, thereon, and the total of all
installments, with interest and penalties thereon, which became due during
prior years and which remain due and unpaid at the beginning of the current
year.
   (d)   In the event any installment payment of principal or interest payable
under the installment basis is not paid when due, and such installment payment
remains unpaid 60 days after it first became due, the Treasurer shall, when
such default has occurred, notify the Solicitor of such fact promptly, and the
Solicitor shall proceed to collect the same under the general laws relating to
collection of municipal claims, including, if so directed by the city, the
filing of suit or suits in assumpsit only as to the overdue installment with
interest and penalties. However, if any installment or portion thereof remains
due and unpaid for one year after it has become due and payable, then the
entire assessment with accrued interest and penalties shall become due and
become a lien from the due date of the installment.
   (e)   No action taken to enforce a claim for any installment or installments
shall affect the status of any subsequent installment of the same assessment,
each of which shall continue to become a lien upon the property annually
pursuant to subsection (d) hereof.
   (f)   Any owner of property, against whom an assessment has been made, may
pay the same in full, at any time, with accrued interest and costs thereon, and
such payment shall discharge the lien of assessment or installments then
constituting a lien, and also release the claim to any later installments.

§ 327.03 GRANT OF AUTHORITY.
   (a)   Grant of franchise. Effective 1-1-2006 (effective date), the city may
award a new exclusive franchise to a grantee to construct, erect, operate and
maintain for a period of 15 years a cable television system for the reception,
origination, amplification, distribution and sale of audio, video, digital and
other forms of electronic signals in, upon, along, across, above, over or under
the streets and rights-of-way in the city, consisting of all poles, wires,
cable, underground conduits, manholes and other conduits and fixtures necessary
for the maintenance and operation in the city of a cable television system with
all of the necessary and desirable appliances and appurtenances pertaining
thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this franchise and
grant shall and does hereby include the right in, over, under and upon the
streets and rights-of-way in the city to install, erect, operate all lines and
equipment necessary to a cable television system and the right to make
connections to subscribers and the right to repair, replace, enlarge and extend
said lines, equipment and connections. The rights herein granted for the
purposes herein set forth shall not be exclusive, and the city reserves the
right to grant a similar use of said streets and rights-of-way to any person at
any time during the period of this franchise. While this article does not grant
grantee the authority to provide cable modem service over its cable television
system in the city, the city acknowledges that under current law city has no
power to authorize or restrict such service. Nonetheless, city recognizes that
a grantee may provide cable modem service and will do so throughout the term of
this franchise and city acknowledges that throughout the term of this franchise
and city acknowledges that it has no right or intention to regulate this
service unless granted or allowed by a final unappealable order of a court of
competent jurisdiction or legislative action.
   (b)   Extension of service. The grantee shall provide service in accordance
with the following guidelines.
      (1)   In areas where aerial construction is permitted, the grantee shall
construct all sections which are contiguous to the existing system and which
shall have a least 30 homes per mile, but densely populated areas shall be
addressed so that population centers are served. In areas where underground
construction is required, the grantee shall construct all sections which are
contiguous to the existing system and have at least 40 homes per mile. In the
event that a given extension would be less than one mile, the grantee shall
construct the extension if the number of homes passed in the proposed extension
is in the same proportion in relation to the length of said extension as the
standard set forth above for a one-mile extension (and for the same type of
construction).
      (2)   In all areas where the grantee has constructed its cable television
system, the grantee shall provide service at the normal installation costs
(being those costs as normally published and charged) to a potential subscriber
whose home can be reached by an aerial drop line of 150 feet or less. AERIAL
DROP LINE shall mean a line that runs aboveground from the cable feeder lines
on the poles to the individual subscriber’s residence.
      (3)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the grantee shall have
the right to deny service if the above-mentioned conditions are not met unless
the subscriber or subscribers in question agree to reimburse the grantee for
any extraordinary costs. In the case of subsection (b)(1) above, EXTRAORDINARY
COSTS shall be costs in excess of the amount required to build one cable
subscriber connection assuming aerial construction density of 30 homes per mile
and the then current construction costs and penetration levels. In the case of
subsection (b)(2), EXTRAORDINARY COSTS shall be costs in excess of the amount
required to provide one aerial cable drop of 150 feet at the then current cost.
   (c)   Exercise of police powers. All rights and privileges granted hereby
are subject to the police powers of city to adopt and enforce local laws and
ordinances, rules and regulations necessary to the health, safety and general
welfare of the public.

sidewalk or other improvement of any street, avenue, alley, highway or other
public place, the same shall be replaced and the surface restored in as good
condition as before entry as soon as practicable without unnecessary delay.
      (4)   The location of any poles, anchors, wires, cables, conduit, vaults,
laterals and other fixtures, or the erection, laying or removal of same, shall
not interfere unreasonably with ordinary travel and/or the use of the streets,
alleys, bridges, public ways or electrical installations of the city.
   (c)   Relocation of cable television system.
      (1)   The rights and privileges granted herein to grantee shall not be in
hindrance to the right of the city or other governmental agency having
jurisdiction to perform or carry on any public works or public improvement.

the city of public works or improvements, the grantee shall, at its own
expense, protect or relocate its cable television system, or part thereof, as
directed by city.
      (2)   The grantee shall, at the expense of any person other than the city
requesting said temporary relocation, temporarily raise, lower or remove its
wires to permit the improvement of property. In such event, the grantee shall
be given not less than 14 days’ advance written notice to arrange for the
temporary wire changes.

wires or other equipment underground where local or state law requires
underground placement and where all other like facilities are underground.
      (2)   For new developments meeting the density requirements set forth in
§
327.03(b) of this article, the grantee will use its best efforts to extend its
cable to such developments at the time that the developer has open trenches for
utilities and cable service regardless of whether the construction of homes has
commenced at such time.
   (e)   Clear access ways. The grantee may trim trees or other vegetation
within the streets and rights-of-way of the city to prevent their branches or
leaves from touching or otherwise interfering with its wires, cables or other
structures. The grantee shall obtain permission of the owner of any private
land, tree or other vegetation before it trims or prunes the same, unless
otherwise permitted by the Right-of-Way Ordinance.

construction), of maintaining upon the poles of the grantee within the city
limits such wire and pole fixtures as are necessary for a police and fire alarm
system, such wires and fixtures to be erected and maintained to the
satisfaction of the grantee. The city, in its use and maintenance of such wires
and fixtures, shall at all times comply with the rules and regulations of the
grantee so that there may be a minimum danger of contact or conflict between

§ 327.05 INSURANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION.
   (a)   Company insurance. The grantee shall maintain during the term of the
franchise insurance as will protect it and the city from any claims which may
arise from grantee’s ownership, construction, repair, maintenance or operation

injury, personal injury, death and property damage in an amount of at least
$2,000,000 per occurrence (which may be supplied by a combination of primary
and excess policy limits), and grantee’s liability insurance shall include
contractual liability, including so much of the indemnity specified herein as
is reasonably insurable.
   (b)   Additional insured. The liability insurance policy shall name city as
an additional insured.
   (c)   Evidence of insurance. Not later than 30 days after the effective date
of a franchise agreement and annually thereafter, grantee shall furnish to city
current certificates of insurance demonstrating compliance with the insurance
coverage requirements of this section.
   (d)   Authorized carrier. All insurance coverage shall be with a grantee
authorized to do business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
   (e)   Change in limits. The city shall have the right, effective at the end
of the fifth and tenth year of the term hereof, to require an increase in the
amounts of insurance specified in subsection (a) above; provided that, the city
gives grantee at least 90 days’ notice of any such increase and provided
further that the increase bears some reasonable relation to increases in the
cost of living since the grant of this franchise.
   (f)   Indemnification. The grantee shall indemnify and hold the city
harmless with respect to the grantee’s construction; maintenance or operation
of the cable television system from and against any and all expenses, losses

acts. In the event of the commencement of any action against city, the city
will give notice thereof to the grantee within ten days after the city is
formally served in any such action, and grantee shall have the right to select
counsel for the defense of such action at no cost to the city. The city’s
failure to give timely notice shall relieve the grantee of its obligation under

made by the grantee or its counsel without the approval of the city unless the
city has an affirmative obligation as part of the settlement; and, provided
further that, the grantee shall use reasonable efforts to advise the city of
any settlement. Further, the city’s approval is not required when the grantee’s

§ 327.06 FRANCHISE FEE.
   (a)   General. As consideration of the franchise granted herein, the grantee
shall pay to the city an annual fee equal to 5% of the annual gross subscriber
revenues attributable to cable services received from the operation of the
cable television system in the city by the grantee, until the current franchise
term expires.
   (b)   Allocation of revenues. The city’s annual franchise fee shall be
determined by adding the sums obtained in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) below:
      (1)   Five percent of the annual gross subscriber revenues received by
grantee from subscribers for cable services derived from the operation of the
cable television system within the city;
      (2)   Five percent of the non-subscriber revenues attributable to the
city where revenues received by the grantee are not directly related to the
number of subscribers using a service of the cable system within the city
(i.e., commissions from advertising, home shopping channels or similar
commission based programs). For purposes of this subsection (b)(2), non-
subscriber revenues attributable to the city shall be determined by dividing
the number of city subscribers by the total of the city, plus all other
subscribers served by the cable television system and multiplying the quotient
obtained by the total revenues received by the grantee which were not directly
related to the number of subscribers using a service of the cable system in the
city;
      (3)   Upon 90 days’ written notice prior to the beginning of any calendar
year, the city may increase the percentage charged as a franchise fee to the
maximum amount permitted by law if the percentage charged is not already at the
permitted maximum; and
      (4)   The grantee shall notify the city of any change in the laws
concerning any change in the percentage that may be charged as a franchise fee
or any change in the services upon which a franchise fee may be levied. For
purposes of this section, a change of law requiring notification to the city
will include a change enacted by a legislature or any decision by the FCC or a
court decision by a court of competent jurisdiction which decision is a final
order not subject to further appeal, reconsideration or review of any kind and
for which no request for a stay is pending.
   (c)   Payment of franchise fees. Payment of the aforesaid franchise fee
shall be made on a quarterly basis within 30 days after the end of March, June,
September or December. Failure to pay after ten days’ notice of default shall
result in the addition of a 10% penalty charge.
   (d)   Certification. The grantee shall provide the city within 90 days after
the close of each annual or fiscal period a statement of a grantee officer
certifying the correctness and accuracy of the franchise fee payments made
during the year. In addition, grantee, at city’s expense, shall permit the city
to have a certified public accountant or its designee conduct an audit of the
grantee records (including addresses) and of the accounting procedures followed
each year to assure that there is proper payment of the correct sums to the
city. The audit of addresses shall be at grantee’s expense; provided, the city
shall not have the right to request such addresses more frequently than once
per year.

least amount of inconvenience to its subscribers and, unless such interruption
is unforeseen and immediately necessary, it shall give reasonable notice
thereof to its subscribers.
   (d)   Repair service.
      (1)   The grantee shall maintain a repair department comprised of
qualified technicians to provide prompt and efficient repair service.
      (2)   The grantee shall maintain a toll free, locally listed telephone
number operated so that requests for service and questions concerning billing
issues can be received at any time. The grantee shall respond to requests for
service on a 24/7 basis for outages affecting a minimum of three customers a
single node or for billing inquiries and regular service calls within 48 hours
of grantee’s receipt of such a request.
   (e)   Subscriber-owned equipment excluded. The requirements for maintenance
and repair shall not apply to television sets or other equipment owned by
subscribers.
   (f)   Installation of service. Service to any subscriber served by a
standard aerial drop shall commence by not later than seven business days after
service is requested; service to any subscriber served by a standard
underground drop shall commence by not later than 45 days after service is
requested unless additional time is required by severe weather or other
circumstances outside of the grantee’s control. The grantee shall exert every
reasonable effort to commence service to a subscriber served by a non-standard
drop as expeditiously as possible. A standard drop, for which the subscriber
shall be charged grantee’s standard installation fee, is an aerial drop running
not more than 150 feet from feeder cable to the subscriber’s structure;
provided that, any installation which requires grantee to place a drop
underground or cross a street underground shall be considered a non-standard
installation. An aerial drop in excess of 150 feet in length shall be
considered a non-standard installation.

(designee). The PEG channel shall be available for PEG access programming on a
24-hour basis, seven days a week. In the event a PEG channel cannot be supplied
by a second or subsequent grantees of a franchise or additional PEG channels
are not required by the participating municipalities, the second or subsequent
grantees of a franchise shall contribute on a pro rata basis (based upon
subscribers of each system) toward the cost of the operating PEG channels.
   (b)   Use of PEG channel. The city or participating municipalities or
designee shall have the exclusive use of the PEG access channel and shall have
the right to administer and operate the PEG access channel. The city and
participating municipalities will use their best efforts to accommodate
requests for programming time for other municipalities and citizens of the
community. Use of the PEG access channel shall be subject to such rules as they
may adopt. PEG access channels shall not be used to provide commercial
services. There shall be no charge by grantee for the use of the PEG access
channel.
   (c)   Additional PEG channel.
      (1)   The grantee may be required to make available on the expanded basic
tier an additional analog video channel for the local communities’ PEG access
programming whenever cable casts of the non-duplicated, locally produced
programming on the initial PEG channel exceeds 75% of the total time available
on such channel between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. for at least 60
days in a 75-day period, as verified by programming logs. Such additional
channel shall be provided by the grantee within 90 days after a request from
the city and participating municipalities.
      (2)   A third analog channel may also be required which will also be on
the expanded basic tier at such time as the first two channels exceed the use
requirements set forth in the preceding paragraph.
   (d)   Indemnification of PEG access programming producers and users.
      (1)   All local producers and users of any of the PEG access facilities
or channels shall agree in writing to hold harmless grantee and city from any
and all liability or other injury (including the reasonable costs of defending
claims or litigation) arising from or in connection with claims for failure to
comply with applicable federal laws, rules, regulations or other requirements
of local, state or federal authorities; for claims of libel, slander, invasion
of privacy or the infringement of common law or statutory copyright; for
unauthorized use of any trademark, trade name or service mark; for breach of
contractual or other obligations owing to third parties by the grantee or city;
and for any other injury or damage in law or equity, which claims result from
the use of a PEG access facility or channel.
      (2)   Should the liability protection outlined in subsection (e)(1) above
prove to discourage PEG use, as evidenced, for example, by numerous refusals to
sign the release on the part of would-be users, grantee and city agree to work
together to modify the safeguards without putting themselves or citizens at
risk.

of a franchise whether by forced or voluntary sale, lease, mortgage,
assignment, encumbrance, transfer of stock or any other form of disposition
shall require approval of city which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to preclude the grantee from entering
into any pledge, mortgage or collateralization of any assets of the cable
television system in conjunction with any financing or refinancing in the
normal course of business. The consent of the city to any transfer or
assignment shall not be effective until the transferee or assignee shall have

Secondhand Dealer Ordinance”.
(Ord. 6200, approved 9-1-2011)
§ 330.02 LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   The City of Williamsport recognizes that stolen items often are sold or
pawned to pawnshops and secondhand dealers by individuals who utilize
pawnshops/secondhand dealers both to generate an immediate source of income for
stolen goods and to dispose of stolen property to prevent law enforcement from
finding stolen goods and property. Because of the lack of uniform record
keeping requirements for pawnshop/secondhand dealers in the city, the tracking
of both stolen property and the individuals disposing of it through such
merchants is very difficult. Moreover, because there are no restrictions on the
length of time that pawnshops/secondhand dealers must hold pawned or purchased
property before resale, law enforcement is hampered in retrieving the property
and returning it to the rightful owners and victims in theft and burglary
cases.

methods of allocation and evaluation so that only that part of such receipt

owned and situated in the city to the total property or assets of the taxpayer

her tax becomes due for such tax year, he or she shall be permitted to
apportion his or her tax for such tax year and shall pay an amount to be
computed by multiplying his or her gross receipts for the preceding full

person was in business during the tax year and whose denominator shall be 12.

§ 344.03 LEVY OF TAX.
   Pursuant to the Local Tax Enabling Act, 11 P.S. 6924.101 et seq., as
amended, and for specific revenue purposes, an annual tax is hereby levied and
assessed, commencing 1-1-2008, upon the privilege of engaging in an occupation

pro rata basis, in accordance with the provisions of this article. This tax may
be used solely for the following purposes as the same may be allocated by the

construction and/or maintenance; reduction of property taxes; or property tax

accordance with 53 Pa.C.S.A. Ch. 85, Subch. F (relating to homestead property
exclusion). The city shall use no less than 25% of the funds derived from the
tax for emergency services. This tax is in addition to all other taxes of any
kind or nature heretofore levied by the city. The tax shall be no more than $52
on each person for each calendar year, irrespective of the number of political
subdivisions within which a person may be employed.
(Ord. 5978, approved 12-23-2004; Ord. 6089, approved 12-13-2007)
§ 344.04 EXEMPTION AND REFUNDS.
   (a)   Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the city is less than $12,000 for any calendar year in which
the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of the tax for that calendar year.
In addition, the following persons are exempt from payment of the tax:
      (1)   Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which the
United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or released under
honorable circumstances from active service if, as a result of military
service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double or quadruple amputee or
has a service-connected disability declared by the United States Veterans’
Administration or its successor to be a total 100% disability; and
      (2)   Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the
armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the taxable year.
For the purposes of this subsection, RESERVE COMPONENT OF THE ARMED FORCES
shall mean the United States Army Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United
States Marine Corps Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States
Air Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the Pennsylvania Air
National Guard.
   (b)   Procedure to claim exemption.
      (1)   A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the city and with the person’s
employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to receive earned income
and net profits from all sources within the city of less than $12,000 in the
calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed. In the event the
city utilizes a tax collection officer, it shall provide a copy of the
exemption certificate to that officer. The exemption certificate shall have
attached to it a copy of all the employee’s last pay stubs or W-2 forms from
employment within the city for the year prior to the fiscal year for which the
employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax. Upon receipt of the
exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by the city or except as
required by subsection (b)(2) below, the employer shall not withhold the tax
from the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar year
for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall ensure that the
exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees at all times and
shall furnish each new employee with a form at the time of hiring. The
exemption certificate form shall be the uniform form provided to the city by
DCED.
      (2)   With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or
by the city that the person has received earned income and net profits from all
sources within the city equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year
or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer’s payment to the person of earned income
within the city in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar
year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax from the person under
subsection (b)(3) below.
      (3)   If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from
the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under subsection (b)
(2) above, the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that
calendar year. The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first
payroll period after receipt of the notification under section (b)(2) above, a
lump sum equal to the amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due
to the exemption claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per
payroll amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year
shall be the same amount withheld for other employees. In the event the
employment of a person subject to withholding of the tax under this subsection
is subsequently severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for
any outstanding balance of tax due, and the city may pursue collection under
this article.
      (4)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) above, it is the intent of
this subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any
employee from a local services tax.
   (c)   Refunds. The City Treasurer, in consultation with the Collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any
tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be
in accord with provisions of the general municipal law relating to refunds of
overpayments and interest on overpayments. (Note: with respect to refunds, see
53 Pa.C.S. § 8425; with respect to interest, see 53 Pa.C.S. § 8426.) Refunds
made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the last day the
employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of the calendar
year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No refunds shall be
made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do not exceed $1. The City
Treasurer or Collector shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide
refunds to exempt persons.
(Ord. 5978, approved 12-23-2004; Ord. 6089, approved 12-13-2007)
§ 344.05 DUTY OF EMPLOYERS TO COLLECT.
   (a)   Each employer within the city, as well as those employers situated
outside the city, but who engage in business within the city, is hereby charged
with the duty of collecting the tax from each of his or her employees engaged
by him or her or performing for him or her within the city and making a return
and payment thereof to the Treasurer or Collector. Further, each employer is
hereby authorized to deduct this tax from each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether or not
all such services are performed within the city.
   (b)   A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a
payroll period shall be determined by dividing the combined rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by
the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata
share, an employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each
payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be
made on a payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the person is
engaging in an occupation, except as provided in subsection (d) of this
section. For purposes of this subsection, COMBINED RATE shall mean the
aggregate annual rate of the tax levied by the school district and the city.
   (c)   No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
   (d)   In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a
principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the
payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from the
employee that the pay statement is from the employee’s principal employer and
the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place of
employment within two weeks of its occurrence. The employee’s statement shall
be provided on the form approved by DCED.
   (e)   The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The city shall provide a taxpayer a receipt of payment
upon request by the taxpayer.
   (f)   (1)   No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax
or for the payment of the withheld tax money to the city if the failure to
withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as
to the employee’s place or places of employment, the employee’s principal
office or where the employee is principally employed.
      (2)   Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the local
services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the
employer complies with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section and
this section and remits the amount so withheld in accordance with this article.
   (g)   Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
   (h)   In the event the employment of an individual subject to withholding of
the tax is subsequently severed or is otherwise not receiving pay in that
calendar year, the individual shall be liable for any outstanding balance of
tax due.
(Ord. 5978, approved 12-23-2004; Ord. 6089, approved 12-13-2007)
§ 344.06 RETURNS.
   (a)   Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of
the tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Treasurer or Collector.
   (b)   If an employer fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or
not the employer makes collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions
paid by him or her to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this
article, the employer shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full
as though the tax had been originally levied against the employer.
(Ord. 5978, approved 12-23-2004; Ord. 6089, approved 12-13-2007)
§ 344.07 DATES FOR DETERMINING TAX LIABILITY AND PAYMENT.
   In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid
over to the Treasurer or Collector on or before the thirtieth day following the
end of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
(Ord. 5978, approved 12-23-2004; Ord. 6089, approved 12-13-2007)
§ 344.08 SELF-EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS.
   Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind or
engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of employment
within the city shall be required to comply with this article and pay the pro
rata portion of the tax due to the Treasurer or Collector on or before the
thirtieth day following the end of each quarter.
§ 344.09 INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE OCCUPATION OR EMPLOYED IN MORE
THAN ONE POLITICAL SUBDIVISION.
   (a)   The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day
the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the event
a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent
employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more than one
political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect
the local services tax shall be in the following order:
      (1)   First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
      (2)   Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision; and
      (3)   Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person’s home.
   (b)   In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that
calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
(Ord. 5978, approved 12-23-2004; Ord. 6089, approved 12-13-2007)
§ 344.10 NON-RESIDENTS SUBJECT TO TAX.
   All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the city but who perform services of any type or kind or
engage in any occupation or profession within the city do, by virtue thereof,
agree to be bound by and subject themselves to the provisions, penalties and
regulations promulgated under this article with the same force and effect as
though they were residents of the city. Further, any individual engaged in an
occupation within the city and an employee of a non-residential employer may,
for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed person, and in
the event his or her tax is not paid, the city shall have the option of
proceeding against either the employer or employee for the collection of this
tax as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 5978, approved 12-23-2004; Ord. 6089, approved 12-13-2007)
§ 344.11 ADMINISTRATION OF TAX.
   (a)   It shall be the duty of the Treasurer or Collector to accept and
receive payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount
received by him or her from each employer or self-employed person, together
with the date the tax was received.
   (b)   The Treasurer or Collector is hereby charged with the administration
and enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to
City Council approval, to prescribe, adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
relating to any matter pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this
article, including provisions for the examination of payroll records of any
employer subject to this article, the examination and correction of any return
made in compliance with this article and any payment alleged or found to be
incorrect or as to which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any
person aggrieved by any decision of the Treasurer or Collector shall have the
right to appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming County as in other
cases provided.
   (c)   The Treasurer or Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books
and payroll records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any
return made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due.
Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the Treasurer or
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
(Ord. 5978, approved 12-23-2004; Ord. 6089, approved 12-13-2007)
§ 344.12 SUITS FOR COLLECTION.
   (a)   In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Treasurer or Collector may sue
for the recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together
with interest and penalty.
   (b)   If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate
of 6% on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due date
of the tax, and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of such tax for
non-payment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of this tax or
other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable therefor shall, in
addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of collection.

article, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts in his
or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees subject to
this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or refuses to file
any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation and, upon
conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $600 and
costs of prosecution and, in default of payment of such fine and costs, to
imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to enforce the penalty

division of the receipt according to the number of jurisdictions in which it

or she was not in business during the license year. In the event that a person
who discontinues business during any tax year does so before payment of his or
her tax becomes due for such tax year, he or she shall be permitted to
apportion his or her tax for such tax year and shall pay an amount to be
computed by multiplying his or her gross receipts for the preceding full
calendar year by a fraction whose numerator shall be the number of months such
person was in business during the tax year and whose denominator shall be 12.
   (f)   Every person subject to the tax hereby imposed who engages in a
business temporary, seasonal or itinerant in nature shall determine his or her
gross receipts for the license year from his or her actual gross receipts for
the license year.

§ 753.02 LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   The City of Williamsport recognizes that there is a health, safety and
welfare concern relating to crimes committed by and committed against minors
during nighttime hours; and believes that this problem can be dealt with more
effectively by regulating the hours during which minors may remain in public
places and certain establishments without adult supervision; and by defining
more clearly certain duties and responsibilities upon those who have the
custody and responsibility for care of such minors. Therefore, the City of
Williamsport hereby enacts this article to enhance the health, safety and
welfare of minors within the City of Williamsport, whose youth and inexperience
renders them particularly vulnerable to becoming participants in criminal
activity and in being victimized by perpetrators of crime, to foster and
strengthen parental responsibility for such minors, and to protect and promote
the welfare of the general public through reduction of juvenile crime and
violence within the City of Williamsport.

(Ord. 6093, approved 12-20-2007)
§ 755.02 PURPOSE.
   White-tailed deer (Odocoileus Virginianus) are entering the City of
Williamsport, causing danger to pedestrians, bicycle and street traffic as well
as damaging hillside and neighborhood vegetation in private and public areas.
The provision of supplemental food for the deer in private yards attracts the
deer and causes their overfeeding. Attracting deer in this manner is seen as a
health and safety hazard for the environment and affects storm water runoff.
(Ord. 6093, approved 12-20-2007)
§ 755.03 APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   Persons or businesses who purposely or knowingly feed or supply salt,
corn or other food to white-tailed deer on land either publicly or privately
owned or who otherwise cause deer to congregate or habituate an area shall be
subject to the penalty this article provides.
   (b)   Nothing in this article shall affect state, county or regional deer
management plans or anyone possessing a special deer management permit that has
been issued by any governmental agency.
(Ord. 6093, approved 12-20-2007)
§ 755.04 ENFORCEMENT.
   The Williamsport Bureau of Codes will be responsible for enforcing this
article.
(Ord. 6093, approved 12-20-2007)
§ 755.05 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
   If otherwise lawful feeding is attracting deer to congregate or habituate,
the Bureau of Codes may provide written notice to the property owner
prohibiting such activity. After said written notice, any person who violates
any of the provisions of this article shall, upon first summary conviction
thereof, be punishable by a minimum fine of up to $100. Each violation of any
of the provisions of this article shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct
offense. When a second and or subsequent violations are committed by the same
person or entity within any 12-month period, the fine shall be double the
amount of the previous fine up to a maximum of $1,000 for each separate and
distinct offense.

FUNCTIONS
§ 1319.11 APPEALS.
   (a)   Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Zoning Officer shall have
the right to appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board within 30 days by filing with
the Zoning Officer, specifying the grounds thereof and including the following:
      (1)   The name and address of the applicant or appellant;
      (2)   The name and address of the owner of the zoning lot to be affected
by such proposed change or appeal;
      (3)   A brief description and location of the zoning lot to be affected
by such proposed change or appeal;
      (4)   A statement of the present zoning classification of the zoning lot
in question, the improvements thereon and the present use thereof;
      (5)   A statement of the section of this Zoning Ordinance under which the
appeal is made and reasons why it should be granted or a statement of the
section of this Zoning Ordinance governing the situation in which the alleged
erroneous ruling is being appealed and the reasons for this appeal; and
      (6)   A reasonably accurate description of the present improvements and
the additions or changes intended to be made under this application, indicating
the size, material and general construction thereof. In addition, there shall
be attached a plot plan of the real property to be affected, indicating the
location and size of the lot and size of improvements existing thereon and
proposed to be erected thereon.
   (b)   The Zoning Officer shall forthwith transmit to the Board all papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. The
Zoning Officer may recommend to the Board a modification or reversal of his or
her action in cases where he or she believes substantial justice requires the
same but where he or she has not himself or herself sufficient authority to
grant the relief sought.
   (c)   Notice shall be provided as required by state law. See the definition
of “public notice” in
Art. 1311. Any party may appear in person or be represented by an agent or
attorney.
   (d)   The Board shall decide each appeal within 45 days, after hearing, and
notice thereof shall forthwith be given to all parties in interest. The Board’s
decision shall be immediately filed in its office and be a public record. In
the exercise of its functions upon such appeals, the Board may, in conformance
with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or
partly, or modify the order, requirement, decision or determination as, in its
opinion, ought to be made.

§ 1319.12 CHALLENGE TO VALIDITY.
   The Zoning Hearing Board shall have the authority to hear challenges to this
ordinance within the provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, as amended.
(Ord. 5745, approved 4-16-1998)
§ 1319.13 VARIANCES.
   (a)   Upon appeal from a decision by the Zoning Officer, the Zoning Hearing
Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that the provisions
of the Zoning Ordinance inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The
Board shall prescribe the form of application and require preliminary
application to the Zoning Officer. The Board may grant a variance; provided,
the following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
      (1)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions
and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of
the Zoning Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located;
      (2)   That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there
is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with
the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;
      (3)   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant;
      (4)   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and
      (5)   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance which will afford relief and represent the least modification possible
of the regulation in issue.
   (b)   In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of
this Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 5745, approved 4-16-1998)
§ 1319.131 PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES.
   (a)   After having received a complete written application, the Zoning
Hearing Board may grant a variance allowing modifications to specific
requirements of this ordinance if the applicant proves to the satisfaction of
the Zoning Hearing Board that:
      (1)   Such modifications are necessary to provide a “reasonable
accommodation” required under the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Federal
Fair Housing Act and/or applicable state law; and
      (2)   Such modifications are necessary to serve persons who the applicant
clearly proves have “disabilities” that are defined in and protected by such
laws.
   (b)   In the case of an application for a use listed in this Zoning
Ordinance as a conditional use, the City Council may grant a modification under
this section, as a condition of a conditional use approval, in place of the
Zoning Hearing Board.
(Ord. 5745, approved 4-16-1998)
§ 1319.14 SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   In this Zoning Ordinance, special exceptions may be granted or denied
by the Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to express standards and criteria. The
Board shall hear and decide requests for such special exceptions in accordance
with such standards and criteria. In granting a special exception, the Board
may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those
expressed in the Zoning Ordinance, as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this Zoning Ordinance. The Board shall pursue the following
procedure.
      (1)   The Board’s decision to grant a permit for special exception use
shall be made only after public notice and hearing. Such permit shall apply
specifically to the application and plans submitted and presented at the public
hearing. Any subsequent amendments or additions shall be subject to review and
public hearing by the Board as a special exception use.
      (2)   No application for a permit shall be granted by the Board for any
special exception use until the Board has first received and considered an
advisory report thereon from the Planning Commission with respect to the
location of such use in relation to the needs and growth pattern of the city
and, where appropriate, with reference to the adequacy of the site area and the
arrangement of buildings, driveways, parking areas, off-street truck loading
spaces and other pertinent features of the site plan. The Planning Commission
shall have 30 days from the date of its receipt of the application within which
to file its report thereon. In the event that the Commission shall fail to file
its report within such 30 days, the application shall be deemed to have been
approved by the Planning Commission.
   (b)   The Commission may have representation at the public hearing held by
the Zoning Hearing Board on such application. After receipt of the report, the
Board shall hear the application in the same manner and under the same
procedure as it is empowered by law and ordinance to hear cases and make
exceptions to the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. The Board may thereafter
direct the Zoning Officer to issue such permit if, in its judgment, the use
meets all specific provisions and criteria contained in this Zoning Ordinance
and the following general provisions:
      (1)   In accordance with the Comprehensive Plan and consistent with the
spirit, purposes and intent of this Zoning Ordinance;
      (2)   In the best interests of the city, the convenience of the
community, the public welfare and a substantial improvement to the property in
the immediate vicinity;
      (3)   Suitable for the property in question and designed, constructed,
operated and maintained so as to be in harmony with and appropriate in
appearance to the existing or intended character of the general vicinity;
      (4)   In conformance with all applicable requirements of this Zoning
Ordinance;
      (5)   Suitable in terms of effects on highway traffic and safety, with
adequate access arrangements to protect streets from undue congestion and
hazard; and
      (6)   In accordance with sound standards of subdivision practice, where
applicable. The Zoning Hearing Board may impose whatever conditions regarding
layout, circulation and performance it deems necessary to ensure that any
proposed development will secure substantially the objectives of this Zoning
Ordinance.

PROCEEDINGS
§ 1319.21 PARTIES APPELLANT BEFORE BOARD.
   Appeals from a decision of the Zoning Officer and proceedings to challenge
the validity of the ordinance may be filed with the Zoning Hearing Board, in
writing, by any officer or agency of the city or any person aggrieved. Requests
for a variance or special exception, however, must be filed with the Board by
any land owner or any tenant with the permission of such landowner.
(Ord. 5745, approved 4-16-1998)
§ 1319.22 TIME LIMITATIONS.
   The time limitations for raising certain issues and filing certain
proceedings with the Zoning Hearing Board shall be the following.
   (a)   No issue of alleged defect in the process of enactment of any
ordinance or map or any amendment thereto shall be raised in any proceeding
filed with the Board later than 30 days from the time such ordinance, map or
amendment takes effect, unless the person raising such issue alleges and proves
that he or she failed to receive adequate notice of the enactment of the
ordinances, adequate notice to his or her predecessor in interest shall be
deemed adequate notice to him or her.
   (b)   No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Board later
than 30 days after any application for development, preliminary or final, has
been approved by an appropriate city officer, agency or body if such proceeding
is designed to secure reversal or limit the approval in any manner, unless such
person alleges and proves that he or she failed to receive adequate notice of
such approval. If such person has succeeded to his or her interest after such
approval, adequate notice to his or her predecessor in interest shall be deemed
adequate notice to him or her.
(Ord. 5745, approved 4-16-1998)
§ 1319.23 STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
   Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in this article and during its
pendency before the Zoning Hearing Board, all land development pursuant to any
challenge ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or any agency or
body and all official action thereunder shall be stayed, unless the Zoning
Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board fact
indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property; in
which case, the development or official action shall not be stayed otherwise
than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or the court
having jurisdiction of zoning appeals on petition after notice to the Zoning
Officer or other appropriate agency or body. When an application for
development, preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings
designed to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Board by persons
other than the applicant, the applicant may petition the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a
condition to continuing the proceedings before the Board. The question of
whether or not such petition should be granted and the amount of the bond shall
be within the sound discretion of the court.
(Ord. 5745, approved 4-16-1998)
§ 1319.24 ZONING APPEALS TO COURT.
   Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Zoning Hearing Board or any
taxpayer or Council may, within 30 days after such decision of the Board,
appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming County, by petition duly
verified, setting forth that such decision is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse
of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law and specify the grounds
upon which he or she relies. Such appeals shall be made in accordance with Art.
X-A of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Act 247).

Commission Chairperson at least seven days prior to the Planning Commission’s
next regularly scheduled meeting. The Planning Commission will review the
application and submit its recommendations to Council for approval or denial.
The recommendations of the Planning Commission and the decision of Council

   (a)   Compatibility. The proposed use will be reviewed as to its
relationship to and effect upon surrounding land uses and existing
environmental conditions regarding the pollution of air, land and water; noise;
potential of hazards and congestion; illumination and glare; restrictions to
natural light and circulation of air.
   (b)   Purpose. Review the intended purpose of proposed use as it relates to
the city’s development objectives established in the Comprehensive Plan.
   (c)   Suitability. The nature of activity and population served, numbers of
participating population, frequency of use, adequacy of space and spatial
requirements, potential generation and impact of congestion will be reviewed as
suitably related to the proposed location of potential use.
   (d)   Accessibility. Ingress and egress to the site of the proposed use,
circulation and movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, parking
requirements and accessibility to the existing and proposed city highway system
will be reviewed.
   (e)   Serviceability. Reviews will be made as to the adequacy and
availability of utility services and facilities such as sanitary and storm
sewers, water, trash and garbage collection and disposal and the ability of the
city to supply such services.
   (f)   Applicability. The proposed use will be reviewed as to its application
to and coordination with the planning policies of the city and its
Comprehensive Plan and plans for land use, highways, schools, parks, sewers,
water distribution and population growth.
   (g)   Health, safety and welfare. The proposed design, location and
operation shall be reviewed as to whether the public health, safety, welfare
and convenience shall be protected. Applications for conditional use permits
which will subsequently require review under Title Nine - Subdivision and Land
Development Regulations shall comply with the review procedures outlined in
Art. 1375. Application forms will be required for each land use proposed, to be
submitted at the time of preliminary review. Approval of conditional use
applications may be granted by Council only at the time of final plan approval.

ARTICLE 1323: NON-CONFORMING USES AND BUILDINGS
Section
   
1323.01   Non-conforming uses, buildings, structures and lots.
   
1323.02   Existing non-conforming uses, buildings, structures or lots.
   
1323.03   Replacing/restoring non-conforming use, building or structure.
   
1323.04   Termination and abandonment of non-conforming uses, buildings or
structures.
§ 1323.01 NON-CONFORMING USES, BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND LOTS.
   (a)   Within the districts established by this article or by amendments
thereto, there exists, may exist or will exist: uses of land, structures and
lots which were lawful before this article was passed or amended but which
would be prohibited, to be newly established under the terms of this article or
future amendment. Inasmuch as these non-conformities are, by definition, alien
to the character of a district created under this article, it is desirable to
control these non-conformities. Over time, these non-conformities are intended
to be reduced in number by obsolescence, destruction, abandonment or similar
factors. Because non-conformities, so long as they exist, may conflict with the
objectives of this article such uses are limited in their expansion and
changes.
   (b)   A lawful existing use, building, structure or lot that is made non-
conforming at the time of passage of this article or any applicable amendment
thereto, may be continued, except as otherwise set forth in this article.
   (c)   The Zoning Administrator may identify and register non-conforming
uses, buildings and structures. The owner of the premises of a non-conforming
structure or owner of a lawful non-conforming use may, upon providing
sufficient evidence, secure a certificate of non-conformance from the Zoning
Administrator. Other sections of this article may require a certificate of non-
conformance for certain uses. The certificate of non-conformance, for the
purpose of this article shall be considered the zoning permit. Such certificate
shall be authorized by the Zoning Administrator and shall be for the purpose of
ensuring to the owner the right to continue such non-conforming use or
structure.
(Ord. 6192, approved 7-21-2011)
§ 1323.02 EXISTING NON-CONFORMING USES, BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES OR LOTS.
   Existing non-conforming uses, buildings, structures or lots shall not be
enlarged, reconstructed, substituted, moved so as to extend or increase the
non-conformity other than as specified herein nor shall they be extended or
enlarged after passage of this article by attachment to a building or premises
or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited
generally in the district involved. Non-conforming uses are further subject to
the following.
   (a)   Upon review by the Zoning Administrator, a non-conforming use may be
enlarged up to but not more than 20% of its floor and land area, whichever is
more restrictive as such existed at the time the use first became non-
conforming; provided that such enlargement shall conform to all other
regulations of the district in which it is situated. Such 20% shall be a
cumulative maximum over the lifetime of the use. Access for persons with
disabilities or fire egress may be added without being restricted by the 20%
maximum expansion. A non-conforming building or structure may be expanded,
provided the expansion conforms to this article.
   (b)   Normal maintenance, repairs and incidental alterations of a building
or other structure containing a non-conforming use are permitted provided they
do not extend the area or volume of space occupied by the non-conforming use
unless subsection (a) above is met.
   (c)   Residential non-conforming uses may be altered in any way to improve
interior livability; provided that, no structural alterations shall be made
which would increase the number of dwelling units on the lot.
   (d)   A non-conforming use shall not displace or replace a conforming use.
   (e)   A non-conforming use may be changed into a conforming use at any time.
If the conforming use is equal to or less intensive than the prior non-
conforming use, off-street parking requirements will not change. A substantial
increase in use intensity for any conforming use necessitates provision of the
net number of required off-street parking space.
   (f)   A non-conforming use may be replaced by a non-conforming use that is
equally intense or less intense. The Zoning Administrator shall have the
authority to approve a change within the same type of non-conforming use, such
as from one personal service use to another personal service use; provided, the
applicant agrees to comply with all of the same conditions that applied to the
previous use. This Zoning Administrator approval may be permitted by right. If
the Zoning Administrator has doubts about the comparative intensity of the new
use versus the prior use, special exception approval shall be required. All
other proposed changes in a non-conforming use shall need special exception
approval by the Zoning Hearing Board.
   (g)   A determination regarding the intensity of the replacement non-
conforming use shall consider the following:
      (1)   Traffic generation and congestion including truck, passenger car
traffic;
      (2)   Nuisance characteristics such as emission of noise, odor, dust,
smoke, fumes, fire hazards, glare and vibration;
      (3)   Hours and manner of operation;
      (4)   Waste disposal and storage;
      (5)   Parking demand, considering the proposed hours of the use; and
      (6)   Buildings or structures, regardless of conformity or ownership,
shall not be combined for the purpose of extending an existing non-conforming
use or for creating a different non-conforming use.
(Ord. 6192, approved 7-21-2011)
§ 1323.03 REPLACING/RESTORING NON-CONFORMING USE, BUILDING OR STRUCTURE.
   (a)   In the event that 50% or more of the existing floor area or use of
land occupied by a non-conforming use is voluntarily razed, legally condemned
or destroyed by fire, explosion or flood, it may not be restored, reconstructed
or used as before, except in strict compliance with the zoning regulations of
the zoning district in which it is situated, unless special exception approval
is granted for such use or activity.
   (b)   In the event that less than 50% of the existing floor area or use of
land occupied by a non-conforming use is voluntarily razed, legally condemned
or destroyed by fire, explosion, flood or other phenomenon, it may not be
restored, reconstructed or used as before unless such restoration,
reconstruction or use commences within one year from the date of the damage.
   (c)   In any case, an existing lawful single-family dwelling (such as a
single-family attached dwelling) may be reconstructed or replaced with a new
single-family dwelling as a permitted by right use; provided, the new dwelling
is not more non-conforming in any measure than the existing dwelling. In such
case, the construction shall be started within 12 months after the existing
dwelling was damaged, destroyed or demolished.

§ 1323.04 TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT OF NON-CONFORMING USES, BUILDINGS OR
STRUCTURES.
   Termination and abandonment of non-conforming uses, buildings or structures
shall be subject to the following.
   (a)   Any non-conforming use, building or structure that is replaced by a
conforming use, building or structure shall be deemed immediately abandoned and
cannot thereafter be revived.
   (b)   A non-conforming use, building or structure discontinued for a period
of 12 consecutive months shall be presumed abandoned and shall not thereafter
be revived without proof, satisfactory to the Zoning Administrator, that the
owner did not intend its abandonment through disuse. In making its
determination, the Zoning Administrator shall take into account the owner’s
compliance (or non-compliance) with the provisions of subsection (c) and shall
consider the impact the use will have on the character of the neighborhood.
   (c)   One or more of the following shall be deemed evidence of intent to
discontinue and abandon a non-conforming use, building or structure:
      (1)   Failure to properly secure windows, walls/or doors of the property;
      (2)   Use of the property for a conforming use;
      (3)   Demolition of the structure;

§ 1331.01 DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.
   In order to implement the purpose of this Zoning Ordinance, the city is
hereby divided into 14 classes of districts, with the designations and general
purposes listed below and the specifically permitted and prohibited uses
tabulated in
Art. 1333:
   (a)   Industrial MH District. Primarily for manufacturing, assembling and
fabrication activities, including large-scale or specialized industrial
operations requiring good access by road and/or railroad and perhaps requiring
special sites or services;
   (b)   Industrial ML District. Primarily for light industrial and warehousing
activities which do not require a central location;
   (c)   Commercial CC District. Essentially the same as the Commercial CBD
District, but with off-street automobile parking required;
   (d)   Commercial CBD District. Primarily for the conduct of retail trade,
administrative and professional offices and service to the general public in
the Central Business District, with emphasis on large-scale stores and
specialized shops serving a regional trading area;
   (e)   Commercial CS District. Primarily for wholesale, warehouse and service
activities which require a central location;
   (f)   INST Institutional District. Residential in character but primarily
for institutional and office uses and including commercial activities having
only limited contact with the general public, not involving the sale of
merchandise at retail except incidentally and which may be carried on with no
objectionable conditions in structures surrounded with ample open spaces;
   (g)   Residential R1A District. Exclusively a one-family detached dwelling
district with adequate lot areas required and including the customary accessory
uses;
   (h)   Residential RIB District. Primarily a one-family detached dwelling
district with adequate lot areas required and the customary accessory uses;
   (i)   Residential R2 District. Primarily a one-family attached dwelling
district with small lot areas per family but including occasional one-family
detached dwellings on larger lots and the customary accessory uses;
   (j)   Residential R3 District. Primarily a multi-family dwelling district
with small lot areas per family but including one-family detached, one-family
attached and two-family dwellings, certain residential related uses and the
customary accessory uses;
   (k)   Residential RU District. Provides a means for encouraging the
development and redevelopment of portions of the city into viable urban areas
where a mix of single and multi-family dwellings as well as residentially-
related institutional, recreational and commercial activities are provided as a
unified project and where development on a parcel by parcel basis is not
possible. Because this district has been created largely as a tool and because
its application will only be occasional, its similarity to a “floating zone” or
“spot zone” is recognized; but, at the same time, any intent to create such
zones is specifically rejected; and
   (l)   Open Space OS District. Primarily for the preservation of open space
for recreation and scenic purposes and to protect steep slopes and watercourses
through public and quasi-public ownership but including certain compatible
private uses.

of this Zoning Ordinance, together with all future notations, references and
amendments.
   (b)   The authenticity of the Zoning Map shall be indicated by the signature
of the Mayor, attested by the City Clerk, and bearing the seal of the city
under the following words: “This is to certify that this Zoning Map is the
Official Zoning Map of the City of Williamsport, Pennsylvania.”
   (c)   If, in accordance with the provisions of
Art. 1321 and the Third Class City Code, changes are made in district
boundaries or other matter portrayed on the Zoning Map, such changes shall be
made on the Zoning Map promptly after the amendment has been approved by
Council, together with the date of amendment, a reference to the amending
ordinance number and the signatures of the Mayor and City Clerk.
   (d)   No change of any nature shall be made in the matter portrayed on the
Zoning Map, except in conformance with procedures set forth in
Art. 1321, except for updating and corrections to base map information. Any
unauthorized change by any person shall be considered a violation of this
Zoning Ordinance.
   (e)   Regardless of the existence of copies of the Zoning Map which may from
time to time be made or published, the official Zoning Map, which shall be
located in the office of the Zoning Officer, shall be the final authority as to
the current status of zoning districts in the city.

§ 1332.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the loss of property and life,
the creation of health and safety hazards, the disruption of commerce and
government services, the extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of public
funds for flood protection and relief and the impairment of the tax base by:
   (a)   Regulating uses, activities and development which, acting along or in
combination with other existing or future uses, activities and development,
will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights, velocities and frequencies;
   (b)   Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities and development
from locating within areas subject to flooding;
   (c)   Requiring all those uses, activities and developments that do occur in
flood-prone areas to be protected and/or flood-proofed against flooding and
flood damage; and
   (d)   Protecting individuals from buying lands and structures which are
unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards.
(Ord. 5745, approved 4-16-1998)
§ 1332.02 APPLICABILITY.
   These provisions shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the
City of Williamsport and shown on the Official Zoning Map as being located
within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe and General Floodplain
Districts.
(Ord. 5745, approved 4-16-1998)
§ 1332.03 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where interpretation is needed as concerning the exact location of any
boundary of any floodplain district, the Zoning Hearing Board shall make the
necessary determination. The person questioning or contesting the location of
the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his or
her case to the Board and to submit his own technical evidence if he or she so
desires.
(Ord. 5745, approved 4-16-1998)
§ 1332.04 COMPLIANCE.
   No structure, development or land shall hereafter be used and no structure
or development shall be located, relocated, constructed, reconstructed,
enlarged or structurally altered, except in full compliance with the terms and
provisions of this article and any other applicable ordinances and regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this article.
(Ord. 5745, approved 4-16-1998; Ord. 5946, approved 3-11-2004)
§ 1332.05 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   (a)   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
article is considered reasonable for the regulatory purposes and is based on
acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur. Flood heights
may be increased by human-made or natural causes, such as ice-jams and bridge
opening restricted by debris. This article does not imply that areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages.
   (b)   This article shall not create liability on the part of the City of
Williamsport or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereof.
(Ord. 5745, approved 4-16-1998; Ord. 6253, approved 2-6-2014)
§ 1332.06 ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS.
   (a)   (1)   The identified floodplain districts shall be those areas of the
City of Williamsport classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRMs) dated 2-5-2014, and issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all digital data
developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study.
      (2)   The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs and any subsequent revisions are
hereby adopted by the City of Williamsport and made part of this article.
   (b)   The identified floodplain area shall be overlays to the existing
underlying district as shown on the official Zoning Ordinance Map. As such, the
provisions of the Floodplain District shall serve as a supplement to the
underlying district provisions. Where this happens to be a conflict between the
provisions or requirements for the floodplain districts and those of any
overlying district, the most restrictive provisions pertaining to the
floodplain shall apply. The basis for this district shall be as follows.
      (1)   The floodway district identified as a FW Zone on the FIRM included
in the FIS prepared by FEMA represents the channel of a watercourse and the
adjacent land area that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation by more than 1 foot
at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas that have been
identified in other available studies or sources of information for those
Special Flood Hazard Areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS.
      (2)   The AE District without floodway shall be those areas identified as
an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which base
flood elevations have been provided in the FIS, but no flood way has been
delineated.
      (3)   The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no 1% annual chance
flood elevations have been provided. The city shall for these areas, elevation
and floodway information accept the sources from federal, state or other
acceptable sources available. Where other acceptable information is not
available, the base flood elevations shall be determined by using the elevation
point on the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
site in question.
(Ord. 5745, approved 4-16-1998; Ord. 5946, approved 3-11-2004; Ord. 6253,
approved 2-6-2014)
§ 1332.07 ZONING MAP.
   The boundaries of these floodplain districts are established as shown on the
FEMA flood study for Lycoming County and flood maps dated 3-16-2004, or most
revision thereof, which is declared to be a part of this article and which
shall be kept on file at the city offices.
(Ord. 5745, approved 4-16-1998; Ord. 5946, approved 3-11-2004)
§ 1332.08 DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGES.
   The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person documents
the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change to the special
flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon
as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special
flood hazard area by submitting technical or scientific data. See §
1332.11(b)(8) for situations where FEMA notification is required.
(Ord. 5745, approved 4-16-1998; Ord. 5946, approved 3-11-2004; Ord. 6253,
approved 2-6-2014)
§ 1332.09 DISTRICT PROVISIONS.
   (a)   All uses, activities and development occurring within any floodplain
district shall be undertaken only in strict compliance with the provisions of
this article and with all other applicable city codes and ordinances such as
the Building and Housing Codes, and the Planning and Zoning Code.
   (b)   No encroachment, alteration or improvements of any kind shall be made
to any water course unless it can be shown that the activity will not reduce or
impede the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse in any way.
   (c)   With any FW (Floodway Area), the following provisions apply.
      (1)   Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   No new construction or development shall be allowed unless a permit
is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection’s regional office.
      (3)   In no case shall mobile homes be permitted in the floodway
district.
(Ord. 5745, approved 4-16-1998; Ord. 5946, approved 3-11-2004; Ord. 6253,
approved 2-6-2014)
§ 1332.10 FLOOD-FRINGE DISTRICT (FF) AND GENERAL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT (FF).
   In the flood-fringe district and the general floodplain district, the
development and/or use of land shall be permitted in accordance with the
regulations of the underlying district; provided that, all such uses,
activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the
flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and in all other
applicable codes and ordinances.
(Ord. 5745, approved 4-16-1998)
§ 1332.11 SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Special exception factors to be considered. In passing upon
applications for special exceptions within the floodplain districts, the Zoning
Hearing Board shall consider all relevant factors specified in other sections
of the Zoning Ordinance and:
      (1)   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments;
      (2)   The danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or
downstream to the injury of others;
      (3)   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions;
      (4)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owners;
      (5)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the city;
      (6)   The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location;
      (7)   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use;
      (8)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future;
      (9)   The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and
floodplain management program for the area;
      (10)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood by ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (11)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
      (12)   Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this
article.
   (b)   Variance factors to be considered. In passing upon application for a
variance within any floodplain districts, the Zoning Hearing Board shall
consider all factors specified in other sections of this article, state law
relative to variances, and the following.
      (1)   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Registrar of Historic Places
or State Inventory of Historic Places; provided that, the proposed replace or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an
historic structure and that variance is the minimum necessary to preserve
historic character and design of the structure.
      (2)   No variance shall be granted for any construction, development, use
or activity within any floodway area/district that would cause any increase in
base flood elevation (BFE).
      (3)   No variance shall be granted for any construction, development, use
or activity within an AE Zone without floodway that would, together with all
other existing and anticipated developments, increase the BFE more than one
foot at any point.
      (4)   If granted, a variance shall involve only the least modification
necessary to provide relief.
      (5)   In granting a variance the city’s Zoning Hearing Board may attach
whatever reasonable conditions and safeguards it considers necessary to protect
the public health, safety and welfare, and to achieve the objectives of this
article.
      (6)   Whenever a variance is granted, the city’s Zoning Hearing Board
shall notify the applicant in writing that:
         (A)   The granting of a variance may result in the increased premium
rates for flood insurance; and
         (B)   Such variance may increase the risk to life and property.
      (7)   In reviewing any request for a variance, the city’s Zoning Hearing
Board shall consider, at a minimum, the following:
         (A)   That there is good and sufficient cause;
         (B)   That failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship for the applicant; and
         (C)   That granting of the variance will:
            1.   Neither result in unacceptable or prohibited increase in flood
heights, additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense;
nor
            2.   To create nuisances, cause fraud on, victimize the public, or
conflict with any other applicable state or local ordinances and regulations.
      (8)   A complete record of all variances and related actions shall be
maintained by the city. In addition, a report of all variances granted during
the year shall be included in the annual report to FEMA.

   A structure, or use of a structure or premises, which lawfully existed
before the enactment of these provisions may be continued subject to the
following conditions.
   (a)   Existing structures and/or uses located in the floodway district shall
not be expanded, but may be modified, altered or repaired to incorporate flood-
proofing measures; provided that, such measures do not raise the level of the
100-year flood.
   (b)   If any structure or use located in any floodplain district is
destroyed by any means including floods, to an extent of 50% or more of its
value, it shall not be reconstructed or continued, except in conformity with
the provisions of this article.
   (c)   Uses or adjuncts thereof which are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue.

providing the advantages of such a waiver are clearly demonstrated with a site
plan to be recommended by the Planning Commission and approved by Council. All
other provisions of the Zoning Ordinance applying to RU Districts shall remain
in full force and effect.
   (b)   Site area. Each site to be developed in an RU District shall be in one
ownership or composed of two or more contiguous parcels in separate ownership;
provided, any application involving separate ownership shall be the joint
application of all landowners involved. Each site shall comprise a land area of
not less than five acres.

usage, whether such unit is intended for sale or not. The minimum lot area for
each single-family detached dwelling unit shall be 6,000 square feet. The
minimum lot area for each single-family attached dwelling unit shall be 1,350
square feet.
   (f)   Open space. Upon any proposed site, that portion of the site devoted
to open space shall be an area equal in size to 1.1 times the total residential
floor area. If any portion of such open space is proposed for dedication or for
common ownership or management, the provisions of §
1381.03 shall be met. OPEN SPACE is defined as the total horizontal area of all
portions of the site not covered by buildings, parking areas, streets or access
drives and lot areas devoted to private single-family usage or commercial
usage.
   (g)   Recreation space. Upon any proposed site, a portion of the site shall
be developed for recreational purposes. The portion of the site area so
developed shall be an area or areas equal in size to 0.13 times the total floor

street lines, yards equal to the front yard requirements of the adjacent
district shall be provided.

shall not have non-conforming lot area. Where different dimensional
requirements apply to different uses, the most restrictive requirement shall
apply.
   (b)   Special exception approval shall be required. The applicant shall show
that there is adequate access for emergency vehicles and equipment.
   (c)   Any new construction shall meet all applicable yard requirements. The
total development of the lot shall meet all lot coverage requirements.

§ 1345.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Location of parking areas. Required parking shall be located on the
same lot as the use that the parking serves, except as follows.
      (1)   Required parking may be located on a different lot from the use
that the parking serves if the parking is within:
         (A)   Four hundred feet from the dwellings it serves; and
         (B)   One thousand feet from non-residential uses it serves.
      (2)   Parking to serve any use may be placed within a CBD, CC, CS, ML or
MH District.
         (A)   Parking within the INST District shall only be permitted to
serve uses allowed within the INST District and dwellings.
         (B)   Parking within each residential district shall only be permitted
to serve uses allowed within that district and dwellings.
         (C)   Parking within the open space district shall only be permitted
to serve uses allowed within the open space district and dwellings.
         (D)   Such parking areas shall meet all other requirements of this
Ordinance.
   (b)   Assignment of parking space in grouped lots. The required parking
spaces for any number of separate uses may be combined in one lot; but the
required spaces assigned to one use may not be assigned to another use at the
same time; except that, one-half of the parking spaces required for places of
worship, theaters or assembly halls whose peak attendance will be at night,
Saturdays or Sundays may be assigned to a use which will be closed at night, on
Saturdays and on Sundays.
   (c)   Remote parking lots encumbered. Where provision of required parking
for a building or use established or enlarged subsequent to the adoption of
this Zoning Ordinance involves one or more parcels of land that are not a part
of the lot on which the principal use is situated, the applicant for a permit
for the principal use shall submit, with his or her application for a building
permit, an instrument duly executed and acknowledged subjecting such parcels of
land to parking uses in connection with the principal use to which it is
accessory. The applicant shall deposit the necessary registration fee; and,
upon the issuance of a building permit, the Bureau of Codes shall cause such
instrument to be registered in the office of the Register of Deeds.
   (d)   Setback of parking and loading areas. All parking and loading areas
shall be set back from the street line in conformance with pertinent yard
requirements; except that, permitted parking areas, but not loading areas, may
be located in required yards adjoining streets; provided, they are separated
from the street by a substantial wall or fence not more than 33% open or a
dense hedge in accordance with §
1383.04.
   (e)   Landscaping.
      (1)   Lots less than or equal to 20 stalls require a landscaped area of a
minimum of 3% of the total area of the parking lot.
      (2)   Lots over 20 stalls require a landscaped island at least five feet
by 18 feet for every 18 spaces in a single row or five feet by 36 feet for 36
spaces in a double row, together with a minimum canopy of 10% of the total
vehicle area. Equivalent areas may be used in corners of lots keeping in mind
that a tree needs a minimum of 20 square feet.
      (3)   All landscaping must be in accordance with
Art. 1383.
      (4)   A minimum of one deciduous shade tree meeting city requirements
shall be planted for every 10 new off-street parking spaces that are added to a
lot, other than spaces within an underground or multi-story parking structure.
These trees may be planted within the lot, such as within and/or around parking
areas. The Zoning Officer may allow existing healthy trees to be preserved to
meet some or all of this requirement. These trees shall be planted in addition
to any existing or required street trees.
   (f)   Demolition. When a structure is demolished and demolition is for the
purpose of providing parking, then the provisions of this Ordinance and
Art. 1383 apply.
   (g)   Surfacing. Every parking area, loading area and driveway shall be
paved with a durable dustless material approved by the Bureau of Codes, graded
to dispose of all surface water and maintained in good condition.

shall be provided with area drains connected to a storm sewer to eliminate
surface drainage over sidewalks in the public right-of-way.
   (i)   Required screening when vehicular use areas abut public rights-of-way.
On the site of a building or structure or lot providing off-street parking
areas or other vehicular use area, there shall be provided landscaping between
such area and such right-of-way, as follows: a strip of land at least four feet
in depth located between the abutting right-of-way and the off-street parking
area or other vehicular use area which is exposed to an abutting right-of-way
shall be landscaped. Such landscaping shall include one small or medium tree
for each 35 lineal feet or 45 feet for a large tree or fraction thereof within
the four-foot strip or within the right-of-way areas reserved for the planting
of street trees. In addition, a hedge, wall or other landscaping shall be
planted within the landscaped strip in accordance with § 1383.04, except as
provided in §
1341.17. The landscape strips along the public rights-of-way shall be
presentations which will be varied through color, shape and texture of
landscape material. The remainder of the required landscaped areas shall be
landscaped with grass, ground cover or other landscape treatment.
   (j)   Required screening between vehicular use areas and abutting
residential or institutional use. All buildings or structures or lots providing
an off-street parking area or vehicular use area of five spaces or more, shall
be provided with a wall or hedge or other landscape screen not greater than six
feet in height, nor less than four feet in height and a minimum width of four
feet, to form a continuous screen between the off-street parking area or
vehicular use area and any abutting or any residential or institutional use.
Such landscape screen shall be located between the common lot line and the off-
street parking area or other vehicular use area exposed to the abutting
property. If the screen consists all or in part of plant materials, such plant
materials shall be planted in a planting strip of not less than four feet in
width. Fence material may be substituted for the above which meets the range of
height limits and may consist of up to 50% gaps in the material. Chain link and
plastic construction fencing material is not acceptable.

§ 1345.04 OBLIGATION.
   (a)   Existing parking. Structures and uses in existence at the original
date of the adoption of this Zoning Ordinance (9-9-1971) shall not be subject
to the requirements of this article so long as the kind or extent of use is not
changed; provided that, any parking facility now serving such structures or
uses shall not, in the future, be reduced below such requirements.
   (b)   Continuing obligation. All required parking facilities shall be
provided and maintained so long as the use exists which the facilities were
designed to serve. Off-street parking facilities shall not be reduced in total
extent after their provision, nor be used for any purpose that interferes with
its availability for the parking need it is required to serve; except that,
such reduction or change in use may be made upon approval by the Zoning Hearing
Board, but only after proof that, by reason of diminution in floor area,
seating area, the number of employees or change in other factors controlling
the regulation of the number of parking spaces, such reduction is in conformity
with the requirements of this article.
   (c)   Change in requirements. Whenever there is an alteration of a structure
or a change or extension of a use which increases the parking requirements
according to the standards of §
1345.01, the total additional parking required for the alteration, change or
extension shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of that
section.

      (1)   (A)   As part of any application for a sign permit under this
section, the applicant shall submit to the Zoning Officer:
            1.   A sketch of the proposed sign;
            2.   A description of the proposed types of materials and colors;
            3.   A sketch or description of the proposed location and height of
the sign; and
            4.   A description of any proposed lighting.
         (B)   Such information shall be submitted and comments of the Planning

for a review in advance of being permitted, erected, posted or otherwise
placed.
      (3)   The Zoning Officer shall not approve the final issuance of a sign
permit until after the Planning Commission has had an opportunity to provide a
review, or until 30 or more days have passed from the date the application was
forwarded to the Chairperson of the Planning Commission.
      (4)   The Planning Commission shall provide advice to the applicant
concerning how a sign could be attractively designed to be compatible with the
exterior of the building and with adjacent buildings. Specifically, an emphasis

district features.
      (5)   CBD Sign Guidelines. The following guidelines should be followed in
the design of any signs within the CBD Zoning District.
         (A)   All signs should contribute to the overall traditional and
historic nature of the Central Business District.
         (B)   Signs should be primarily oriented to pedestrians, as opposed to
motor vehicles.
         (C)   All signs should be permanently attached to a building.
         (D)   Signs should not dominate the facade of a building, but should
relate in placement and size to the other architectural elements of the
exterior of the building.
         (E)   Signs should not cover windows, cornices and other decorative
features.
         (F)   Older lettering styles should be considered for signs on older
buildings.
         (G)   Signs should be limited in number, such as one primary and one
secondary sign, to avoid clutter.
         (H)   Signs should avoid excessive numbers of words. Simpler messages
are the easiest to read.
         (I)   The colors of signs should complement the colors of the
building. Light letters on a darker background are often easiest to read, such
as a relief-cut wood sign.
         (J)   The following types of signs are specifically encouraged within
the CBD District.
            1.   Long horizontal signs or individual carved lettering mounted
flat against the building are encouraged, in a manner that does not obstruct
architectural features. Such signs in most cases should be placed between the
first and second floor windows.
            2.   Signs may be mounted flat against the building next to a door
way. These signs should not exceed 12 square feet, although a six square foot
maximum size is preferable.
            3.   Signs may project from the building; provided, they meet the
standards for “projecting signs” in §
1346.06.
            4.   Signs are encouraged to be integrated with awnings and
canopies.
            5.   Lettering is encouraged on clear doors or windows. The image
should not obscure more than 20% of the total area of a window or door.
            6.   Wood signs with relief-cut lettering are encouraged.
            7.   Wood signs are encouraged with painted lettering or carved
lettering attached to the sign.
            8.   Signs are encouraged to be constructed from wood, metal or
materials with an appearance very similar to wood.
            9.   Any lighting of signs should be external to the sign face, and
be carefully directed to avoid nuisances to motorists, pedestrians and
neighbors.
         (K)   The following types of signs are strongly discouraged within the
CBD District:
            1.   Plastic signs, particularly with internal lighting;
            2.   Signs extending above the roof of a building;
            3.   Signs covering the second or third stories;
            4.   Flashing signs;
            5.   Neon signs; and
            6.   Signs with garish or day glow colors.
         (L)   The following types of signs shall not require review under this
section:
            1.   A sign meeting the requirements of §
1346.04, such as, but not limited to, temporary political signs and real estate
for sale signs;
            2.   An official sign placed by a government agency; and
            3.   A non-illuminated window sign of less than four square feet
that is posted for a maximum total period of 60 days in any calendar year.

be greater than 12 square feet in area per side and shall not be more than six
feet in height above the ground. All portable signs shall be anchored,
weighted, spring-loaded or otherwise designed to resist wind action.
(Ord. 5745, approved 4-16-1998)
§ 1346.08 TEMPORARY SIGNS.
   Flags, pennants, special promotional devices or displays or similar type
signs shall be permitted in Commercial and Industrial Districts only; provided
that:
   (a)   Such signs or displays shall not endanger the public or be located in
the right-of- way of any State or City street without the prior approval of the
city;
   (b)   General regulations specified in §
1346.03 shall apply;
   (c)   An individual business shall be limited to one temporary sign at any
one time per street the business fronts on;

feet;
   (e)   Temporary signs shall be permitted for a period not exceeding 30 days

§ 1375.03 FILING FEES (SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT).
   The following filing fees, in addition to all other fees required by any
statute of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or ordinance of the city, shall be
submitted at the time of application or resubmission of subdivision or land
development plan. No application shall be accepted or acted upon unless payment
is made according to the fee schedule as specified in
Art. 117 of the codified ordinances.
(Ord. 5458, approved 12-14-1989)
§ 1375.04 SKETCH PLAN.
   The purpose of the sketch plan is to afford the developer an opportunity to
consult early and informally with the Planning Commission regarding the overall
concept and appropriateness of the prospective development and thus avoid
potential conflict at the preliminary or final plan stages. The following is a
list of procedures to be used in review of the sketch plan.
   (a)   Developer submits four copies of the sketch plan to the Administrative
Officer at least 15 days prior to the meeting of the Planning Commission at
which the plan is to be considered.
   (b)   The Administrative Officer checks the submission for completeness. If
incomplete, returns the submission to the developer indicating deficiencies; or
if complete, accepts submission and immediately distributes two copies of the
plan to the City Planning Commission and one copy of the plan to the Lycoming
County Planning Commission, retaining one file copy.
   (c)   At its first regular meeting following receipt of the complete
submission by the Administrative Officer and following the 15-day waiting
period, the City Planning Commission shall receive and review the developer’s
submission, discuss the plan with the developer, evaluate the plan and,
together with appropriate comments, direct whether the developer may proceed to
the preliminary or final plan stages.
(Ord. 4486, approved 10-14-1971)
§ 1375.05 PRELIMINARY PLAN.
   The purpose of the preliminary plan is to require formal conditional
approval of plans in order to minimize changes and revisions at the final plan
stage. The following are procedures to be used in the review of preliminary
plans.
   (a)   Developer submits six copies of the preliminary plan and data, three
copies of the application and the required fee and deposit to the
Administrative Officer.
   (b)   The Administrative Officer checks the submission for completeness. If
incomplete, returns the submission to the developer indicating deficiencies;
or, if complete, accepts the submission and immediately distributes two copies
of the plan to the City Planning Commission and one copy each of the plan to
Council, the Director of the Department of Community and Economic Development
and the Lycoming County Planning Commission, retaining one file copy.
   (c)   The County Planning Commission and the Director of the Department of
Community and Economic Development review the preliminary plan and submit
reports to the City Planning Commission within 30 days of submission by the
Administrative Officer.
   (d)   At its second regular meeting following receipt of the complete
preliminary plan submission by the Administrative Officer, the City Planning
Commission shall review the developer’s submission, discuss the plan with the
developer and consider the reports of the County Planning Commission and the
Director of the Department of Community and Economic Development.
   (e)   Following the review of the preliminary plan with the developer, the
City Planning Commission shall evaluate the plan in regard to the general
purposes and specific provisions of these Regulations and act thereon as
submitted or modified. If approved, the Commission shall express its approval
and state the conditions of such approval, if any, or, if disapproved, shall
express its disapproval and its reasons therefor. The action of the Commission
shall be noted on two copies of the preliminary plan, and the Commission’s
recommended conditions shall be attached thereto. The Commission shall
immediately forward both copies to Council for action.
   (f)   Within ten days of the City Planning Commission’s meeting at which
action is taken on a plan, Council shall:
      (1)   Review the developer’s submission, together with the reports of the
City Planning Commission, Director of the Department of Community and Economic
Development and County Planning Commission;
      (2)   Express its conditional approval, stating the conditions of such
approval, or its disapproval, stating the reasons therefor; and
      (3)   Within five days following the decision, inform the developer in
writing. The action of Council shall be noted on two copies of the plan,
together with its conditions, if any, or its reasons for disapproval. One copy
of the notated plan shall be forwarded to the developer and the remaining copy
returned to the City Planning Commission.
   (g)   Conditional approval of a preliminary plan of lots shall not
constitute approval of the final plan of lots. Rather, it shall be deemed an
expression of approval to the layout submitted on the preliminary plan of lots
as a guide to the preparation of the final plan of lots which will be submitted
for approval of the City Planning Commission and Council, and for recording
upon fulfillment of the requirements of these regulations and the conditions of
the conditional approval, if any.
(Ord. 4486, approved 10-14-1971; Ord. 5021, approved 1-31-1980)
§ 1375.06 FINAL PLAN.
   (a)   The purpose of the final plan is to obtain formal approval by Council
for completed plans and to enter into necessary performance bonds or contracts
prior to recording and commencement of work. The final plan shall conform
substantially to the preliminary plan as approved; but, if desired by the
developer, it may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plan
of lots which he or she proposes to record and develop at the time.
   (b)   The following are procedures to be used in the review of final plans.
      (1)   Developer submits two copies, original drawing and a sepia
duplicate of the final plan and one copy of other exhibits, including
performance agreements, and the written application to the Administrative
Officer. Such submission shall be made within six months after approval of the
preliminary plan and at least 15 days prior to the meeting of the City Planning
Commission.
      (2)   The Administrative Officer checks the submission for completeness.
If incomplete, returns the submission to the developer indicating deficiencies;
or, if complete, accepts the submission and immediately prepares and
distributes one copy to the Director of the Department of Community and
Economic Development, plus additional copies as may be required.
      (3)   Upon receipt of a copy of the final plan from the Administrative
Officer, the Director of the Department of Community and Economic Development
shall review the engineering considerations and guarantees of the submission
and prepare a report of adequacy for the Commission and Council.
      (4)   The Commission shall, at that regular meeting scheduled for final
plan review, approve the final plan providing that all conditions made at the
time of preliminary plan approval are adequately provided for. If not so
provided, the plan shall be disapproved, indicating to the developer the
reasons for such disapproval.
      (5)   Within 40 days of the Commission’s meeting at which action was
taken upon a final plan, Council shall approve such plan, stating any
additional conditions of such approval or, if disapproved, state the reasons
therefor and within five days following the decision inform the developer of
such decision in writing.
      (6)   Every final plan shall carry the signature of:
         (A)   Owner of the land;
         (B)   Signature and seal of the registered engineer or surveyor;
         (C)   Director of the Department of Community and Economic
Development;
         (D)   Chairperson of the City Planning Commission; and

§ 1375.07 RECORDING OF PLANS.
   (a)   Upon the approval of a final plan, the developer shall, within 90 days
of such final approval, record such plan in the office of the Recorder of Deeds
of Lycoming County. The Recorder of Deeds shall not accept any plan for
recording unless such plan officially notes the approval of Council.
   (b)   The recording of the plan shall not constitute grounds for assessment
increases until such time as lots are sold or improvements installed on the
land included within the subject plan.
(Ord. 4486, approved 10-14-1971)
§ 1375.08 VARIANCES.
   There will be no variances granted in whole or in part of these regulations,
except in the following instances.
   (a)   Hardship. Upon application and allegations in writing that extra-
ordinary hardship may result from strict compliance with these regulations, the
case may be referred to the Planning Commission for the purpose of hearing the
cause and determining substitute regulations to accommodate the specific
hardships. If by adopting the substitute regulations substantial justice may be
done and the public interest served, the Commission may adopt the substitute
regulations in lieu of the regulations causing hardship, providing that such
variance will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the
Comprehensive Plan or the spirit of these regulations.
   (b)   Mixed residential development. The standards and requirements of these
regulations may be modified in the case of a plan for a mixed residential
development which, in the judgment of the Commission, provides adequate public
spaces and improvements for the circulation, recreation, light, air and service
needs of the tract when fully developed and populated and which also provides
the convenants or other legal provisions as will assure conformity to and
achievement of the Comprehensive Plan.
(Ord. 4486, approved 10-14-1971)
§ 1375.09 APPEALS.
   (a)   Challenges to the validity of these Regulations and appeals from any
action of the Administrative Officer thereunder shall be heard by the Zoning
Hearing Board under §§
1319.11 and
1319.12 of the Zoning Ordinance. But when Council or the Planning Commission
has held a hearing upon an application for subdivision or development, such
hearing shall be deemed in lieu of a hearing by the Board; and appeal from any
decision of Council shall be directly to court.
   (b)   The decisions of Council or the Commission with respect to the
approval or disapproval of plans may be appealed within the same time
limitations as provided for in zoning appeals in §§
1319.21 through
1319.23.

§ 1377.05 FLOOD DAMAGE CONTROL INFORMATION.
   (a)   Purpose. The specific purpose of these special provisions is:
      (1)   To regulate the subdivision and development of flood-prone areas in
order to promote the general health, welfare and safety of the city;
      (2)   To require that each subdivision lot in a flood-prone area be
provided with a safe building site with adequate access; and that public
facilities which serve such uses be designed and installed to preclude flood
damage at the time of initial construction; and
      (3)   To protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuitable for
use because of flood hazards by prohibiting the subdivision or development of
unprotected flood-prone lands.
   (b)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This section supersedes any
ordinances currently in effect in flood-prone areas. However, any underlying
ordinance shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive.
   (c)   Municipal liability. The grant of a permit or approval of a
subdivision or land development plan in the identified flood-prone area(s)
shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind by the
city or by any official or employee thereof of the practicability or safety of
the proposed use, and shall create no liability upon the city, its officials or
employees.
   (d)   Pre-application procedures.
      (1)   Prior to the preparation of any plans, it is suggested that
prospective developers consult with the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources concerning soil suitability when on-site sewage
disposal facilities are proposed.
      (2)   Prospective developers shall consult the County Conservation
District representative concerning erosion and sediment control and the effect
of geologic conditions on the proposed development. At the same time a
determination should be made as to whether or not any flood and/or mudslide
hazards either exist or will be created as a result of the subdivision or
development.
   (e)   Preliminary plan requirements.
      (1)   The following information shall be required as part of the
preliminary plan and shall be prepared by a registered engineer or surveyor:
         (A)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision or land
development with respect to the city’s flood-prone areas including information
on, but not limited to, the regulatory flood elevations, boundaries of flood-
prone areas, proposed lots and sites, fills, flood or erosion protective
facilities, and areas subject to special deed restrictions. Within general
floodplain area the regulatory flood elevations shall be established as a point
on the boundary of general floodplain area which is closest to construction
site in question (as delineated in §
1332.06 of the Planning and Zoning Code).
         (B)   Where the subdivision or land development lies partially or
completely in the flood-prone area or where the subdivision or land development
borders on the flood-prone area, the preliminary plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
public utilities and building sites.
      (2)   All such maps shall also show contours at intervals of two or five
feet depending upon the slope of the land and identify accurately the
boundaries of the flood-prone area.
   (f)   Final plan requirements. The following information shall be required
as part of the final plan and shall be prepared by a registered engineer or
surveyor:
      (1)   All information required for the submission of the preliminary plan
incorporating any changes requested by the city; and
      (2)   A map showing the exact location and elevation of all proposed
buildings, structures, roads and public utilities to be constructed in flood
prone area. All such maps shall show contours at intervals of two feet and
identify accurately the boundaries of the flood-prone area.

§ 1379.02 STREETS.
   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets
shall conform to the Comprehensive Plan and shall be considered in their
relation to existing and planned streets, topographical conditions, public
convenience and safety and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses
of the land to be served by such streets. In all cases, streets shall be
designed to meet the needs of all users, including not only motor vehicles but
also pedestrians, bicyclists and transit users of all ages and abilities. This
shall apply to all new streets and to the reconstruction, rehabilitation,
repair and maintenance of existing streets.
   (a)   Where such is not shown in the Comprehensive Plan, the arrangement of
streets in a subdivision shall either:
      (1)   Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing
streets and surrounding areas;
      (2)   Conform to a plan for the neighborhood or planning district
prepared by the Planning Commission where topographical or other conditions
exist that make continuance of or conformation to existing streets impractical;
or
      (3)   Conform, in the case of multi-family housing projects, industrial
developments, commercial districts, unit group projects and the like to a plan
approved by the Planning Commission.
   (b)   No residential street shall be laid out in such a way as to permit or
encourage its use by through traffic.
   (c)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an arterial street shown on the
Comprehensive Plan, the Commission may require a non-access reservation or
“buffer strip” containing screen planting along the rear property line, deep
lots with rear service ways or such other treatment as may be necessary for
adequate protection of residential properties and will afford separation of
thru and local traffic.
   (d)   Where a subdivision borders along or contains a controlled access
highway right-of-way as shown on the general street plan for the location of
streets (Ord. 2888, 8-24-1961, and all future locations), the Commission may
require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-
way at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land.
Portions of such width shall be greater where approach grades and future grade
separations require additional width.
   (e)   Reserve strips controlling the access to streets shall be prohibited
except where their control is definitely placed under the jurisdiction of the
city with conditions approved by the Commission.
   (f)   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided; residential streets shall intersect collector streets at “T” street
intersections if possible.
   (g)   A tangent at least 50 feet long shall be introduced between reverse
curves on residential streets.
   (h)   When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point,
they shall be connected by radial curves adequate to ensure a sight distance of
not less than 100 feet for collector streets, 50 feet for residential streets
and of such greater radii as the Commission determines for special cases.
   (i)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles, and no street shall intersect any other street at less than 60
degrees. Not more than two streets shall converge at one intersection.
   (j)   Street intersections shall be rounded with radii of:
 
Street Type     Radii (Feet)
Arterial        50
Collector       35
Lane or alley   10
Local           15

(Ord. 4486, approved 10-14-1971)
§ 1379.09 NON-RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS.
   (a)   Lotting of individual lots for commercial purposes shall be avoided in
favor of a comprehensive design of the land to be used for such purposes.
   (b)   In the arrangement of buildings and facilities all of the elements of
the site plan shall be harmoniously and efficiently organized in relation to
topography, the size and shape of the plot, the character of the adjoining
property and the type and size of the buildings in order to produce a livable
and economical land use pattern.
   (c)   Additional width of streets adjacent to areas proposed for non-
residential use may be required as deemed necessary by Council to assure the
free flow of through traffic from vehicles entering or leaving parking areas.
   (d)   When adjacent lots proposed for non-residential uses front on a
collector or arterial street, the owner may be required to provide a service
road for ingress and egress; or, in lieu thereof, the owner may be required to
provide an area adjacent to the proposed lots for off-street parking purposes.
   (e)   (1)   Alleys shall be required in commercial and industrial districts,
except where other adequate provision is made for off-street loading and
parking consistent with the use proposed.

   (i)   All area, design and parking requirements shall conform to the Zoning
Ordinance.
(Ord. 4486, approved 10-14-1971)
§ 1379.10 FLOOD DAMAGE CONTROL MEASURES.
   (a)   Design standards and improvements generally.
      (1)   Where not prohibited by this or any other laws or ordinances, land
located in flood-prone area(s) may be platted for development with the
provision that the developer construct all buildings and structures to preclude
flood damage in accordance with this and any other laws and ordinances
regulating such development.
      (2)   Building sites for residences or any other type of dwelling or
accommodation shall not be permitted in any floodway area. Sites for these uses
may be permitted outside the floodway area if the sites or dwelling units are
elevated to a height at least one and one-half feet above the elevation of the
100-year flood. If fill is used to raise the elevation of a site, the fill area
shall extend out laterally for a distance of at least 15 feet beyond the limits
of the proposed structures.
      (3)   Building sites for structures or buildings other than for
residential uses shall also not be permitted in any floodway area. Also such
sites for structures or buildings outside the floodway shall be protected as
provided for in subsection (a)(2) hereof. However, Council may allow the
subdivision or development of areas or sites for commercial and industrual uses
at an elevation less than one and one-half feet above the one hundred year
flood if the developer otherwise protects the area to that height or assures
that the buildings or structures will be flood-proofed at least up to that
height.
      (4)   If the city determines that only a part of a proposed plat can be
safely developed, it shall limit development to that part and shall require
that development proceed consistent with this determination.
      (5)   When a developer does not intend to develop the plat himself and
the city determines that additional controls are required to ensure safe
development, it may require the developer to impose appropriate deed
restrictions on the land. Such restrictions shall be inserted in every deed and
noted on every recorded plat.
      (6)   The plan shall show the boundary of the 100-year floodplain
utilizing the Type 15 Flood Insurance Study.
   (b)   Excavation and grading. Where any excavation or grading is proposed or
where any existing trees, shrubs or other vegetative cover will be removed, the
developer shall consult the County Conservation District representative
concerning plans for erosion and sediment control and to also obtain a report
on the soil characteristics of the site so that a determination can be made as
to the type and degree of development the site may accommodate.
   (c)   Alteration of streams or watercourses. No alteration or relocation of
a stream or watercourse can take place without obtaining the required permit
from the Department of Environmental Resources. Prior to such alteration or
relocation, adjacent communities, the State Department of Community Affairs and
Federal Insurance Administration shall be notified. Under no circumstance shall
any alteration or relocation take place which will lower the flood carrying
capacity.
   (d)   Streets. The finished elevation of proposed streets shall be not more
than two feet below the 100-year flood elevation. The city may require, where
necessary, profiles and elevations of streets to determine compliance with this
requirement. Drainage openings shall be sufficient to discharge flood flows
without unduly increasing flood heights.
   (e)   Sewer facilities. All sanitary sewer systems located in flood-prone
areas, whether public or private, shall be flood-proofed up to a point one and
one-half feet above the 100-year flood.
      (1)   The city may prohibit installation of sewage disposal facilities
requiring soil absorption systems where such systems will not function due to
high ground water, flooding or unsuitable soil characteristics. The city may
require that the developer note on the face of the plat and in any deed of
conveyance that soil absorption fields are prohibited in designated areas.
      (2)   The city may prescribe adequate methods for waste disposal. If a
sanitary sewer system is located on or near the proposed subdivision and/or
land development, the city shall require the developer to provide sewage
facilities to connect to this system where practical, and shall prescribe the
procedures to be followed by the developer in connecting to the system.
   (f)   Water facilities. All water systems located in flood prone areas,
whether public or private, shall be flood-proofed to a point one and one-half
feet above the 100-year flood elevation. If there is an existing public water
supply system on or near the subdivision, the city shall require the developer
to connect to this system where practical, and shall prescribe the procedures
to be followed by the developer in connecting to the system.
   (g)   Other public utilities and facilities. All other public and/or private
utilities and facilities shall be elevated or flood-proofed to a point one and
one-half feet above the 100-year flood elevation.
   (h)   Drainage facilities.
      (1)   Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to convey the flow of
surface waters without damage to persons or property. The system shall ensure
drainage at all points along streets, and provide positive drainage away from
buildings and on-site waste disposal sites.
      (2)   Plans shall be subject to the approval of city. The city may
require a primarily underground system to accommodate frequent floods and a
secondary surface system to accommodate larger, less frequent floods. Drainage
plans shall be consistent with local and regional drainage plans. The
facilities shall be designed to prevent the discharge of excess runoff onto
adjacent properties.
(Ord. 4866, approved 11-18-1977)
§ 1379.11 DESIGN STANDARDS FOR CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT.
   (a)   General.
      (1)   The purpose of these design standards is to guide the design of
buildings constructed in the CBD Zoning District to ensure that, through
appropriate use of facades, windows, building orientation and architectural
details, new structures and alterations of existing structures are physically
and visually compatible with other buildings within the downtown business
district. Existing buildings in the downtown area reflect a distinctive but
varied set of Nineteenth and Twentieth Century architectural styles. It is the
desire of the city to have buildings that are sensitive to the existing
architectural styles.
      (2)   These standards are intended to encourage quality design in new
building construction, enhance street safety and provide a comfortable street
environment by providing features of interest to pedestrians. Good design
results in buildings that are in visual harmony with nearby buildings, leading
to a central downtown district that is attractive, interesting, active and
safe. These qualities, in turn, contribute to the creation of a downtown core
that facilitates easy pedestrian movement and establishment of a rich mixture
of uses.
   (b)   Dimensional standards.
      (1)   Lot area, lot width, and lot depth: as specified in the CBD zoning
district.
      (2)   Setbacks: new construction and infill buildings must maintain the
alignment of facades within 18 inches along the sidewalk edge. Exceptions may
be granted if the setback is pedestrian-oriented and contributes to the quality
and character of the streetscape. An example would be for outdoor dining.
      (3)   Building height: the minimum height of a structure at the sidewalk
edge shall be 18 feet or the average height of the buildings on that block,
whichever is higher.
   (c)   Pedestrian accessibility.
      (1)   Buildings shall maintain and enhance the pedestrian scale and
orientation of the downtown core.
      (2)   Special attention shall be given to designing a primary building
entrance, which is both attractive and functional.
      (3)   Buildings located at the intersection of two streets shall consider
the use of a corner entrance to the building.
      (4)   Pedestrian environment may be enhanced by street furniture,
landscaping, awnings and movable planters of seasonal flowers.
   (d)   Compatibility with existing downtown businesses. The size and shape of
proposed construction shall be comparable with the size and shape of
surrounding buildings. Where building sizes will not be equivalent or
comparable, larger building facades shall be broken down into units that
resemble the size of existing storefront facades. Likewise, the form of new
construction shall complement the general shape of existing, nearby storefront
buildings and their features.
   (e)   Building materials and colors.
      (1)   Facades shall be varied and articulated to provide visual interest
to pedestrians. Within larger projects, variations in facades, floor levels,
architectural features and exterior finishes shall create the appearance of
several smaller buildings.
      (2)   Exterior building materials shall convey an impression of
durability. Materials such as masonry, stone, stucco and wood are encouraged.
Metal siding is not permitted as the primary exterior building material, but
metal may be used for accents including awnings. Other materials not permitted
as primary wall surfaces are: vinyl siding; cast block; glass block; faux
stone; plywood sheathing; chipboard or wood composite sheathing; plastic
composite sheathing; fiberglass panels; board-and-batten; or rough wood
surfaces. Cast block, glass block and other materials and treatments may be
used on a minority of the surfaces within the facade for the purpose of
providing decorative elements or visual breaks.
      (3)   Where masonry is used for exterior finish, decorative patterns
should be incorporated. Examples of these decorative patterns include
multicolored masonry units such as brick, stone or cast stone, in layered or
geometric patterns or split-faced concrete block to simulate a rusticated
stone-type construction.
      (4)   Wood siding must be bevel, shingle siding or channel siding and
must not be applied in a diagonal or herringbone pattern. T-111 style siding is
not permitted.
      (5)   Preferred colors for exterior building finishes are earth tones,
creams and pastels of earth tones. High-intensity primary colors and metallic
colors may be utilized as trim and detail colors but shall not be used as
primary wall colors.
   (f)   Roof materials, parapets and roof pitch.
      (1)   Pitched roof structures shall have a minimum roof pitch of 6:12.
      (2)   Flat roofs are permitted with detailed parapets or detailed brick
coursing.
      (3)   Visible sloped roofs must be a “non-color”: gray; black; or dark

a judgement of not more than $500, plus all court costs, including reasonable
attorney fees incurred by the city as a result thereof. No judgement shall
commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination
of a violation by the district justice. If the defendant neither pays nor
timely appeals the judgement, the city may enforce the judgement pursuant to
the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues
that shall constitute a separate violation, unless the district justice
determining that there has been a violation further determines that there was a
good faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating the
article to have believed that there was no such violation, in which event there
shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day
following the date of the determination of a violation by the district justice
and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation.
      (2)   The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of
stay, upon cause shown, tolling the per diem judgement pending a final
adjudication of the violation and judgement.

§ 1383.12 PROCEDURE FOR ADJUSTMENT OF STANDARDS.
   Modifications to the landscape requirements must be requested in writing and
with design drawings.
   (a)   The requested modification(s) shall be approved only if it is
determined that the modification(s) would not be contrary to the public
interest and that it would be in keeping with and would preserve the intent of
this article, and that literal enforcement of the standards would be
impractical or unreasonable. A committee comprised of the Codes Administrator,
the Director of Streets and Parks, the City Engineer shall review, modify,
approve or deny all such requests with the advice of the Shade Tree Commission
and a member of the Planning Commission (where appropriate).
   (b)   Hardship standards shall include physical impossibility caused by
irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or slope; exceptional
topographical circumstances; or other conditions where applicant has not
created such conditions. Hardship may also accrue if environmental factors
mitigated against a literal interpretation of the standards of this article.

Storm Water Management Ordinance”.
(Ord. 6211, approved 4-15-2012; Ord. 6481, approved 3-14-2024)
§ 1391.02 STATEMENT OF FINDINGS.
   The City of Williamsport finds that:
   (a)   Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of storm water resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes, flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying
capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public
facilities to carry and control storm water, undermines floodplain management
and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety and increases non-point source
pollution of water resources;
   (b)   A comprehensive program of storm water management (SWM), including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff,
is fundamental to the public health, safety and welfare and the protection of
people of the Commonwealth, their resources and the environment;
   (c)   Storm water is an important water resource that provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and supports the base flow of streams;
   (d)   The use of green infrastructure and low impact development (LID) are
intended to address the root cause of water quality impairment by using systems
and practices which use or mimic natural processes to: 1) infiltrate and
recharge, 2) evapotranspire, and/or 3) harvest and use precipitation near where
it falls to earth. Green infrastructure practices and LID contribute to the
restoration or maintenance of predevelopment hydrology;
   (e)   Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of storm water controls. These municipalities are required
to obtain a permit for storm water discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
program.
(Ord. 6211, approved 4-15-2012; Ord. 6481, approved 3-14-2024)
§ 1391.03 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this title is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the City of Williamsport and its watershed by minimizing the harms and
maximizing the benefits described in § 1391.02 of this title, through
provisions designed to:
   (a)   Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa.Code, 93, to protect, maintain, reclaim and restore the
existing and designated uses of the waters of this Commonwealth;
   (b)   Preserve natural drainage svstems;
   (c)   Manage storm water runoff close to the source, reduce runoff volumes
and mimic predevelopment hydrology;
   (d)   Provide procedures and performance standards for storm water planning
and management;
   (e)   Maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources;
   (f)   Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds;
   (g)   Provide proper operations and maintenance of all Storm Water best
management practices (BMPs) that are implemented within the City of
Williamsport;
   (h)   Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements; and
   (i)   Encourage the provision or upgrade of storm water BMPs for existing
development.(Ord. 6211, approved 4-15-2012; Ord. 6481, approved 3-14-2024)

DEP Technical Manual for Sewage Enforcement Officers (as amended or replaced
from time to time by DEP).
   FLOODWAY. The channel of the watercourse and those portions of the adjoining
floodplains that are reasonably required to carry and discharge the 100-year
flood. Unless otherwise specified, the boundary of the floodway is as indicated
on maps and flood insurance, studies provided by FEMA. In an area where no FEMA
maps or studies have defined the boundary of the 100-year floodway, it is
assumed, absent evidence to the contrary, that the floodway extends from the
stream to 50 feet from the top of the bank of the stream.
   FOREST MANAGEMENT/TIMBER OPERATIONS. Planning and activities necessary for

operations; and
      (7)   The storage, deposition or extraction of materials, public or
private sewage disposal systems or water supply facilities; for which
permission may be required pursuant to a municipal land development ordinance.
   LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT. Site design approaches and small-scale stormwater
management practices that promote the use of natural systems for infiltration,
evapotranspiration, and reuse of rainwater. LID can be applied to new
development, urban retrofits, and revitalization projects. LID utilizes design
techniques that infiltrate, filter, evaporate, and store runoff close to its
source. Rather than rely on costly large-scale conveyance and treatment
systems, LID addresses stormwater through a variety of small, cost-effective
landscape features located on-site.

§ 1393.03 VOLUME CONTROLS.
   The green infrastructure and low impact development practices provided in
the BMP Manual shall be utilized for all regulated activities wherever
possible. Water volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm
Method in subsection (a) or the Simplified Method in subsection (b) below. For
regulated activity areas equal or less than one acre that do not require
hydrologic routing to design the storm water facilities, this title establishes
no preference for either methodology; therefore, the applicant may select
either methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic
limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures associated with each
methodology and other factors.
   (a)   The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable to any
size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on
site conditions.
      (1)   Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year 24-hour duration precipitation; and
      (2)   For modeling purposes:
         (A)   Existing (pre-development) non-forested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition; and
         (B)   Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present, shall
be considered meadow in good condition in the model for existing conditions.
   (b)   The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) provided below is
independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is
not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities that
disturb greater than one acre, or for projects that require design of storm
water storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
      (1)   Storm water facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from all new impervious surfaces;
      (2)   At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces
shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow (i.e., it shall not be
released into the surface waters of this commonwealth). Removal options include
reuse, evaporation, transpiration and infiltration;
      (3)   Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in
all cases at least the first one-half inch of the permanently removed runoff
should be infiltrated; and
      (4)   This method is exempt from the requirements of §
1393.04.
(Ord. 6211, approved 4-15-2012; Ord. 6481, approved 3-14-2024)
§ 1393.04 RATE CONTROLS.
   (a)   For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167,
Storm Water Management Plan: post-development discharge rates shall not exceed
the predevelopment discharge rates for the one-, two-, five-, ten-, 25-, 50-
and 100-year, 24-hour, storm events. If it is shown that the peak rates of
discharge indicated by the post-development analysis are less than or equal to
the peak rates of discharge indicated by the pre-development analysis for one-,
two-, five-, ten-, 25-, 50- and 100-year, 24-hour storms, then the requirements
of this section have been met. Otherwise, the applicant shall provide
additional controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of discharge
requirement.
   (b)   For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167 Storm
water Management Plan: for the one-, two-, five-, ten-, 25-, 50- and 100-year,
24-hour storm events, the post-development peak discharge rates will follow the
applicable approved release rate maps. For any areas not shown on the release
rate maps, the post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates.
(Ord. 6211, approved 4-15-2012; Ord. 6481, approved 3-14-2024)
§ 1393.05 TECHNICAL DESIGN STANDARDS.
   All regulated activities shall be conducted in conformance with the
following standards.
   (a)   (1)   After installation of impervious cover, peak discharges for the
two-, five-, ten-, 25-, 50- and 100-year frequency storms from the site shall
not exceed the respective peak discharge performance standards in this title.
      (2)   Storm water runoff shall be managed so that no downstream increases
in flood damages or impairment of streets and other public facilities occur.
The City of Williamsport may require that downstream impacts be evaluated at
critical locations such as dams, tributaries, existing developments, undersized
culverts and flood-prone areas. The City of Williamsport shall make the final
determination with respect to the degree of management required for any site.
The applicant shall evaluate the effects of the proposed plan on such critical
locations by providing computed water surface elevations (WSEL) for the ten-
and 100-year storms. Methods of computation shall have prior approval of the
City of Williamsport. At such downstream critical locations, storm water
management may be exercised by:
         (A)   Providing off-site improvements to downstream conveyances in
order to contain flow increases; and
         (B)   Providing downstream drainage easements with sufficient widths
to contain the flood limits.
   (b)   The City of Williamsport may impose storm water quality measures in
accordance with this title to protect against ground or surface water pollution
where the type of business or the nature of the storm water runoff and soils
underlying storm water management facilities would constitute a substantial
risk of contamination.
   (c)   In establishing the site conditions for calculating storm water runoff
prior to development, the following assumptions shall apply:
      (1)   Woodland or meadow in good condition shall be used for all
undeveloped areas;
      (2)   Average antecedent moisture conditions as defined by the Natural
Resource Conservation Service (NRCS); and
      (3)   When determining pre-development peak discharges from karst
geologic areas, apply either:
         (A)   Peak adjustment factors in accordance with the U.S.G.S. Water
Resources Investigations Report 00-4189, Techniques for Estimating Magnitude
and Frequency of Peak Flows for Pennsylvania Streams; or
         (B)   Drainage area reductions equal to the area of undrained
depressions or pond factor adjustments in accordance with the Urban Hydrology
for Small Watersheds, Technical Release No. 55 (TR-55, USDA, NRCS).
   (d)   All plans and designs for storm water management facilities shall be
reviewed by the City of Williamsport. Plans for facilities other than storm
sewers should determine storm water peak discharge and storm water runoff by
the use of the PennDOT Drainage Manual, Publication Number 13, DM-2, Ch. 10, as
amended. The City of Williamsport may permit the use of the modified rational
method or other methods for calculation of the storage capacity of a storm
water management facility from drainage areas of 20 acres or less.
      (1)   Coefficients:
         (A)   Acceptable runoff coefficient values for use in the rational
method equation are identified in Appendix D of this title. When applying the
rational method coefficients in Table A-3, “open space” coefficients shall be
used for undeveloped, densely vegetated (non-forest) areas instead of “meadow”
coefficients. Refer to PennDOT Drainage Manual, Publication Number 13, DM-2,
Ch. 10, as amended, for permissible curve numbers; and
         (B)   The Rational Formula may be used in lieu of the Soil Cover
Complex method to compute design flows for the sizing of storm sewers, inlets
and swales.
      (2)   Rainfall amounts for the return periods specified shall be
determined using the Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of the United States, Atlas
14, Volume 2 (as amended), U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service,
Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, Silver Spring, Maryland, 20910.
Rainfall duration for hydrograph generation shall be selected for the specified
recurrence intervals on the basis of twice the computed time of concentration
for the given watershed and subwatersheds. In no case shall the duration be
less than 24 hours.
      (3)   Time of concentration shall be determined in accordance with the
methods presented in PennDOT Drainage Manual, Publication Number 13, DM-2 Ch.
10, as amended.
      (4)   In order to reduce storm water runoff volumes from developed areas
and encourage groundwater recharge, underground basin drains, infiltration
trenches and cisterns are permitted to which roof leaders may be connected.
These drains consist of stone-filled basins which temporarily store and release
water below ground surface. Plans for such facilities shall be submitted to the
City of Williamsport for approval, and the basins shall be used only in those
areas where soils, geologic, and water table conditions permit.
   (e)   Storm water management facilities and related installations shall be
provided:
      (1)   To permit unimpeded flow of natural watercourses. Such flow may be
redirected as required, subject to the approval of the Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Protection;
      (2)   To ensure adequate drainage of all low points along the curb line
of streets;
      (3)   To intercept storm water runoff along streets at intervals
reasonably related to the extent and grade of the area drained, and to prevent
substantial flow of water across intersections or flooded intersections during
storms, in accordance with the procedures in the PennDOT Drainage Manual,
Publication Number 13, DM-2, Ch. 10, as amended;
      (4)   To ensure adequate and unimpeded flow of storm water under
driveways and in, near, or across natural watercourses or drainage swales.
Suitable pipes or other waterways shall be provided as necessary; and
      (5)   To properly drain storm water runoff from all land development
projects. All lot and open areas shall be designed to drain to the nearest
practical street or drainage system, existing or proposed, as defined by the
City of Williamsport, with no impact on adjoining properties, unless an area
specifically designed for storm water detention is provided.
   (f)   Storm sewers and related installations:
      (1)   Storm sewers, where required by zoning and land use densities,
shall be placed under or immediately adjacent to the roadway side of the curb,
or as directed by the City of Williamsport, when parallel to the street within
the right-of-way.
      (2)   When located on undedicated land, they shall be placed within a
drainage easement not less than 20 feet wide as approved by the City of
Williamsport.
      (3)   The use of properly designed, graded, and turfed drainage swales is
encouraged in lieu of storm sewers in commercial and industrial areas and,
where approved by the City of Williamsport, in residential areas. Such swales
shall be designed not only to carry the required discharge without excessive
erosion, but also to increase the time of concentration, reduce the peak
discharge and velocity, and permit the water to percolate into the soil, where
appropriate. Criteria and guidelines related to the use and design of drainage
swales are as follows:
         (A)   Where vegetated drainage swales are used in lieu of or in
addition to storm sewers, they shall be designed to carry the ten-year
discharge without erosion, and also to increase the time of concentration,
reduce the peak discharge and velocity and permit the water to percolate into
the soil.
         (B)   The maximum encroachment of water on the roadway pavement along
roadside swales in cut areas shall not exceed half of a through traffic lane
during a ten-year frequency storm of five-minute duration. Frequent and/or
sustained flooding of the sub-base shall be avoided.
         (C)   Swales shall be designed in accordance with the PennDOT Drainage
Manual, Publication Number 13, DM-2, Ch. 10, as amended. Inlets shall be
provided to limit the shoulder encroachment and water velocity.
         (D)   The side slope for any vegetated drainage channel requiring
mowing of the vegetation shall have a maximum grade of three horizontal to one
vertical on those areas to be mowed.
         (E)   Erosion prevention. All drainage swales shall be designed to
prevent the erosion of the bed and bank areas. Suitable temporary and/or
permanent stabilization during vegetative cover establishment shall be provided
to prevent erosion.
         (F)   Storm sewers or drainage swales shall discharge to a detention
or retention basin to attenuate the peak rate and volume, respectively of storm
water runoff, except as provided in the plan.
         (G)   Because of the critical nature of vegetated drainage channels,
the design of all vegetated channels shall, as a minimum, conform to the design
procedures outlined in the PennDOT Drainage Manual, Publication Number 13, DM-
2, Ch. 10, as amended.
            1.   Deed restrictions may be required on property(ies) containing
drain age swales and/or perennial streams. When required, these deed
restrictions shall specify that no property owner shall obstruct or alter any
drainage swale or perennial stream identified in the Stormwater Management
Plan.
            2.   The design capacity of storm sewers shall be in accordance
with the PennDOT Drainage Manual, Publication Number 13, DM-2, Ch. 10, as
amended. Storm drainage systems shall be designed without surcharging inlets to
provide conveyance of storm water runoff into a detention basin or similar
facility utilized to manage the rate of storm water runoff. To avoid
surcharging inlets, and to ensure that inlets will receive storm water runoff,
the hydraulic grade line at the inlet should be at least six inches below the
elevation of the inlet grate. Where site grading will direct storm water runoff
from the 100-year design storm to a detention basin or similar facility
utilized to manage the rate of storm water runoff, then the storm sewer may be
designed for the ten-year design storm. Where site grading will not direct
storm water runoff from the 100-year design storm to a detention basin or
similar facility utilized to manage the rate of storm water runoff, then the
storm sewer shall be designed for the 100-year design storm. Conveyance of
storms to the detention basin, up to and including the 100-year frequency,
shall be provided so as not to endanger life or seriously damage property.
            3.   Storm inlet types and inlet assemblies shall conform to the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Standards for Roadway Construction,
as approved by the City of Williamsport.
      (4)   Inlets shall, at a minimum, be located at the lowest point of
street intersections to intercept the storm water before it reaches pedestrian
crossings; or at sag points of vertical curves in the street alignment which
provide a natural point of ponding of surface storm water.
      (5)   Where the City of Williamsport deems it necessary because of
special land requirements, special inlets may be approved.
      (6)   The interval between inlets collecting storm water runoff shall be
determined in accordance with the PennDOT Drainage Manual, Publication Number
13, DM-2, Ch. 10, as amended.
      (7)   In curbed sections, the maximum encroachment of water on the
roadway pavement shall not exceed half of a through traffic lane or one inch
less than the depth of curb during the ten-year design storm of five-minute
duration. Inlets shall be provided to limit the encroachment of water on the
pavement. When inlets are used in a storm system within the right-of-way limits
of a street in lieu of manholes, the spacing of such inlets shall not exceed
the maximum distance of 450 feet.
      (8)   The design of storm inlets shall be in accordance with the Penn DOT
Drainage Manual, Publication Number 13, DM-2, Ch. 10, as amended.
      (9)   Accessible drainage structures shall be located on a continuous
storm sewer system at all vertical dislocations, at all locations where a
transition in storm sewer pipe sizing is required, at all vertical and
horizontal angle points exceeding 5 degrees, and at all points of convergence
of two or more influent storm sewer mains. The construction locations of
accessible drainage structures shall be as indicated on the subdivision
drainage plan or area drainage plan approved by the City of Williamsport.
      (10)   When evidence available to the City of Williamsport indicates that
existing storm sewers have sufficient capacity as determined by hydrograph
summation and are accessible, proposed storm water facilities may connect to
the existing storm sewers so long as the peak rate of discharge does not exceed
the amount permitted by this article.
   (g)   Bridges and culverts shall have ample waterway opening to carry
expected flows, based on the PennDOT Drainage Manual, Publication Number 13,
DM-2, Ch. 10, as amended, or as required by the City of Williamsport.
   (h)   Detention or retention basins for the management of storm water peak
discharges shall meet the following requirements.
      (1)   Basins shall be installed prior to or concurrent with any
earthmoving or land disturbances which they will serve. The phasing of their
construction shall be noted in the narrative and on the plan.
      (2)   The design of all facilities over limestone formations shall
include measures to prevent groundwater contamination and, where required,
sinkhole formation. Soils used for the construction of basins shall have
moderate to low erodibility factors (i.e.,”K” factors of 0.32 or less).
      (3)   Energy dissipaters and/or level spreaders shall be installed at
points where pipes or drainageways discharge to or from basins.
      (4)   (A)   Outlet structures within detention/retention basins shall
incorporate child proof, non-clogging trash racks or grates over all
horizontally oriented openings. All vertically oriented openings over 12 inches
or larger in any dimension where entry by a child could cause injury or death
shall be covered with childproof, non-clogging trash racks, except where such
openings carry perennial stream flows. Design openings less than six inches in
any dimension shall be covered with a pipe screen (e.g., Neenah R-7512 or
equivalent). Measures to completely drain detention/retention basins in the
event of clogging of the primary design opening(s) shall be incorporated into
the design of basin outlet structures. Basin outlet pipes shall have a minimum
inside diameter of 15 inches or a cross-sectional area of 176 square inches;
except that, pipes under a 25-foot or greater fill shall not be less than 24
inches or a cross-sectional area of 453 square inches, and shall consist of
reinforced concrete.
         (B)   Outlet aprons shall be designed and shall extend at a minimum to
the toe of the basin slope. Where spillways will be used to manage peak
discharges in excess of the ten-year storm, such spillways shall be constructed
to withstand the pressures of impounded waters and convey flows at computed
outlet velocities without erosion.
      (5)   When the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
requires facilities to be permitted, the designer shall submit all information
to the PA DEP Regional Office, and obtain all necessary approvals and permits
pursuant to Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code, Ch. 105, Dam Safety and
Encroachment Act.
      (6)   Downstream analysis.
         (A)   Where deemed necessary by the City of Williamsport, the
applicant shall submit an analysis of the impacts of detained storm water flows
on downstream areas within the watershed, established with the concurrence of
the City of Williamsport. The analysis shall include hydrologic and hydraulic
calculations necessary to determine the impact of peak discharge modifications
of the proposed development on critical locations such as dams, tributaries,
existing developments, undersized culverts, and flood-prone areas.
         (B)   Review and comment of the downstream analysis by the City of
Williamsport shall be obtained as deemed necessary.
      (7)   Detention basins may be waived by the City of Williamsport at sites
in close proximity to larger receiving streams, depending on the hydrology of
the watershed. This is to facilitate drainage prior to mainstream flooding. It
shall be incumbent upon the applicant to demonstrate that no downstream
increase in stream flooding or channel erosion will result in accordance with
this article, and that no increases in peak discharge within the receiving
stream will occur as outlined in this article.
      (8)   Multiple use basins. The design and construction of multiple use
storm water detention facilities are strongly encouraged. In addition to storm
water management; where appropriate, facilities allow for recreational uses
including: ball fields; play areas; picnic grounds; and the like. Provision for
parking facilities within basins and permanent wet ponds with storm water
management capabilities may also be appropriate. Prior approval and
consultation with the City of Williamsport are required before design. Multiple
use basins should be constructed so that potentially dangerous conditions are
not created.
      (9)   Multiple development basins. Storm water management facilities
designed to serve more than one property or development in the same watershed
are encouraged. Staged construction of existing or proposed multiple-use
detention facilities by several developers in conjunction with watershed
development is encouraged. Each applicant shall be responsible for the
incremental increase in storm water runoff generated by the respective
development and incremental construction improvements necessary for the overall
detention facility. Prior approval and consultation with the City of
Williamsport is required before designing such facilities.
      (10)   Alternative detention facilities. Alternative storm water
detention facilities including roof top, subsurface basins or tanks and in-pipe
detention storage, or other approved alternative designs are permitted as
determined by the City of Williamsport.
   (i)   (1)   All calculations shall be submitted to the City of Williamsport
on computation sheets acceptable to the reviewer for approval. If the City of
Williamsport deter mines through review and independent computation that the
size(s) of storm pipes or detention basins is insufficient, the City of
Williamsport may require the applicant to increase the size(s) of said storm
pipes or detention basins.
      (2)   If the storm drainage system design is completed on a computer
installation, sufficient supporting data shall be provided to allow
comprehensive review by city officials.
   (j)   When the elevation of any existing or proposed entrance to a
structure, including windows, is lower than the elevation of the public cartway
serving that site, a drainage plan shall be submitted, reviewed and approved as
part of the zoning permit process for the proposed structure.
   (k)   The City of Williamsport may require that storm water management
facilities located outside of existing or proposed right-of-ways shall be
located within and accessible by easements as follows.
      (1)   Drainage easements.
         (A)   Where a tract is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way,
channel or stream, there shall be provided a drainage easement, paralleling the
line of such watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream. The width of the
drainage casement will be adequate to preserve the unimpeded flow of natural
drainage in the 100-year floodplain.
         (B)   Drainage easements shall provide for maintenance, and for the
purpose of widening, deepening, improving or protecting such drainage
facilities.
      (2)   Access easements. Where proposed storm water management facilities
are not adjacent to proposed or existing public right-of-ways or are not
accessible due to physical constraints, as determined by the City of
Williamsport, a 20-foot wide passable access easement specifying rights of
entry shall be provided. Access easements shall provide for vehicle ingress and
egress on grades of less than 10% for carrying out inspection or maintenance
activities.
      (3)   Maintenance easements. A maintenance easement shall be provided
which encompasses the storm water facility and appurtenances and provides for
access for maintenance purposes. The maintenance easement must be located at
least 20 feet outside of the 100-year surface elevation and the storm water
facility and appurtenances.
      (4)   Easements shall stipulate that no trees, shrubs, structures,
excavation or fill be placed, and no regrading is to be performed within the
area of the easement without written approval from the City of Williamsport.
Upon approval, such landscaping may be placed in maintenance easements,
provided it does not impede access.
      (5)   Whenever practicable, easements shall be parallel to width and
linked to property lines of the subdivision.
      (6)   All easement agreements shall be recorded with a reference to the
recorded easement indicated on the site plan. The format and content of the
easement agreement shall be reviewed and approved by the City of Williamsport.
   (l)   Sinkhole protection.
      (1)   Storm water from roadways, parking lots, storm sewers, roof drains
or other concentrated storm water runoff paths shall not be discharged directly
into sinkholes.
      (2)   To protect sensitive karst areas, the City of Williamsport may
require basins to contain an impervious liner. The liner may be of the
impervious membrane type, placed in accordance with the manufacturer’s
recommendations, or an approved alternative as approved by the City of
Williamsport.
   (m)   Erosion and sedimentation control.
      (1)   All plans for erosion and sediment pollution control (E&SPC) shall
meet the requirements of the Clean Streams Law, Act of 6-22-1937, P.L. 1987, as
amended, 35 P.S. §§ 691.1 et seq. and 25 Pa.Code §§ 102.1 et seq., Erosion
Control.
      (2)   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to submit the E&SPC
plan, application and other necessary material to the Conservation District or
DEP Office, as appropriate. A copy of the transmittal letter shall be provided
to the City of Williamsport. Comments shall be received and E&SPC plan approval
obtained from the Conservation District prior to storm water plan approval.
   (n)   Minor SWM Plan. A minor SWM plan is required per § 1393.02(d) and as
outlined in Appendix C. Minor SWM plans shall consist of the following, and are
not subject to §§ 1393.03 and 1393.04 of this Title. Minor plan preparation
steps are as follows:
      (1)   Prepare a scaled drawing showing key features of the site. The plan
can be developed from a tax map, site survey or other accurate drawing of the
site. The property and boundaries should be accurate in scale. The plan should
include:
         (A)   A line showing the limit and location of area(s) that will be
cleared for regulated activities such as buildings, driveways and lawns;
         (B)   The location of all structures, existing and proposed (house,
shed, garage and the like). Include driveways, parking areas, any other
impervious surfaces, well and septic system locations;
         (C)   The location of property boundaries, any streams or wetlands,
and separation distances of structure(s) to any water body or stream; and
         (D)   The angle/slope of the property in relation to any water body or
stream.
      (2)   Calculate the volume of storm water runoff created by the project.
Identify the newly created impervious areas. Note on the plan the area of each
proposed structure and impervious surface (paved, walkways and the like) and
calculate the sum of the areas. For example:
         (A)   Twenty feet by 20 feet shed = 400 sf;
         (B)   Six feet by 60 feet sidewalk = 360 sf; and
         (C)   Total impervious area = 760 sf.
      (3)   Calculate the volume of storm water runoff. For minor projects,
multiply the total square footage of newly created total impervious area by
(2.85 in/12 in/ft). For example:
760 sf x (0.2375 ft.) = 180.5 cubic feet
(2.85 in is the two-year, 24-hour rainfall for Williamsport, PA, taken from
NOAA’s Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center Precipitation Frequency Data
Server for Point Precipitation Frequency Estimates from NOAA Atlas 14).
      (4)   Identify/choose the appropriate storm water control measures. Size
and place the measures on the project site and add the measures to the SWM
plan.
         (A)   The volume of storm water runoff calculated in Step #3 is now
used to size the storm water control storage devices. Vegetative controls and
structural measures can be used individually or in combination to provide the
required storage volume. The BMP Manual identifies structural and non-
structural control measures that may be used, as well as instructions to
calculate the volume provided by each.
         (B)   Please note that all minor Stormwater Management Plans should
provide appropriate erosion control measures. Refer to subsection (m) above.
The DEP Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual is available for
guidance. Please contact the Lycoming County Conservation District for
additional information.
         (C)   A sample minor storm water management plan can be found in
Appendix C.
   (o)   All regulated activities that do not fall under the exemption criteria
referenced herein shall submit a drainage plan to the City of Williamsport for
review. These criteria shall apply to the total proposed development even if
development is to take place in stages. Impervious cover shall include, but not
be limited to, any roof, parking or driveway areas and any new streets and
sidewalks. Any areas designed to initially be gravel or crushed stone shall be
considered to be impervious for the purposes of comparison to the waiver
criteria, unless they are installed and maintained as provided for in the BMP
Manual.
      (1)   Storm water drainage systems shall be provided to permit unimpeded
flow along natural watercourses, except as modified by storm water management
facilities or open channels consistent with this title.
      (2)   Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to
any applicable discharge criteria in the general direction of existing
discharge, whether proposed to be concentrated or maintained as diffused
drainage areas, except as otherwise provided by this title. If diffused flow is
proposed to be concentrated and discharged onto adjacent property, the
applicant must document that adequate downstream conveyance facilities exist to
safely transport the concentrated discharge, or otherwise prove that no
erosion, sedimentation, flooding or other harm will result from the
concentrated discharge.
      (3)   Where a development site is traversed by watercourses, drainage
easements shall be provided conforming to the line of such watercourses. The
terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation, the placing of fill or
structures and any alterations that may adversely affect the flow of storm
water within any portion of the easement. Also, maintenance, including mowing
of vegetation within the easement shall be required, except as approved by the
appropriate governing authority.
      (4)   When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainage ways on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open channels
may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and grade of such
natural drainageways. Work within natural drainageways shall be subject to
approval by PA DEP through the joint permit application process or, where
deemed appropriate by PA DEP, through the general permit process.
      (5)   Any storm water management facilities regulated by this title that
would be located in or adjacent to waters of the Commonwealth or wetlands shall
be subject to approval by PA DEP through the joint permit application process,
or where deemed appropriate by PA DEP, the general permit process. When there
is a question whether wetlands may be involved, it is the responsibility of the
applicant or his or her agent to show that the land in question cannot be
classified as wetlands, otherwise approval to work in the area must be obtained
from PA DEP.
      (6)   Any storm water management facilities regulated by this title that
would be located on State highway rights-of-way shall be subject to approval by
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (Penn DOT).
      (7)   Minimization of impervious surfaces and infiltration of storm water
runoff through seepage beds, infiltration trenches and the like are encouraged,
where soil conditions permit, to reduce the size or eliminate the need for
detention facilities.
      (8)   In order to promote overland flow and infiltration, roof drains
should not discharge directly to streets or storm sewers. Roof drains may
discharge directly to streets or storm sewers when deemed necessary by the City
of Williamsport. Under no circumstances shall roof drains discharge directly to
sanitary sewer systems.

   (a)   In order to protect and improve water quality, a Riparian Buffer
Easement may be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or land
development that encompasses a Riparian Buffer.
   (b)   Except as required by Chapter 102, the Riparian Buffer Easement shall
be measured to be the greater of the limit of the 100-year floodplain or a
minimum of 35 feet from the top of the streambank (on each side).
   (c)   Minimum Management Requirements for Riparian Buffers.
      (1)   Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within
the Riparian Buffer Easement.
      (2)   Whenever practicable, invasive vegetation shall be actively removed
and the Riparian Buffer Easement shall be planted with native trees, shrubs and
other vegetation to create a diverse native plant community appropriate to the
intended ecological context of the site.
   (d)   The Riparian Buffer Easement shall be enforceable by the municipality
and shall be recorded in the appropriate County Recorder of Deeds Office, so
that it shall run with the land and shall limit the use of the property located
therein. The easement shall allow for the continued private ownership and shall
count toward the minimum lot area required by Zoning, unless otherwise
specified in the municipal Zoning Ordinance.
   (e)   Any permitted use within the Riparian Buffer Easement shall be
conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent of the existing 100-year
floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability and preserve and protect
the ecological function of the floodplain.
   (f)   The following conditions shall apply when public and/or private
recreation trails are permitted within Riparian Buffers:
      (1)   Trails shall be for non-motorized use only.
      (2)   Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native plant
species and other sensitive environmental features.
   (g)   Septic drainfields and sewage disposal systems shall not be permitted
within the Riparian Buffer Easement and shall comply with setback requirements
established under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 73.

   (a)   The Treasurer or such official’s designee is hereby appointed as the
designated officer who is authorized to carry out all responsibilities and
duties of the city stated herein.
   (b)   A FIRE LOSS or CLAIM FOR FIRE DAMAGE is defined as any loss occurring
after the effective date of this section and covered under a policy of fire
insurance, including any endorsements or riders to the policy.
(Ord. 6202, approved 12-8-2011)
§ 1523.02 CITY CERTIFICATE AND COMPLIANCE REQUIRED PRIOR TO CLAIMS PAYMENT.
   (a)   No insurance company, association or exchange (hereinafter the
“insurer”) doing business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall pay a claim
of a named insured for fire damage to a structure located within the city where
the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all policies
exceeds $7,500, unless the insurer is furnished by the City Treasurer with a
municipal certificate pursuant to 40 P.S. § 638(b) and unless there is
compliance with 40 P.S. 638(c) and (d) and the provisions of this article and
the ordinance for payment of delinquent taxes from fire insurance proceeds and
the delinquent tax ordinance.
   (b)   After full compliance with the requirements of 40 P.S. § 638(b) the
insurer shall pay the claim of the named insured; provided, however, that, if
the loss is agreed upon by the named insured and the insurer equals or exceeds
60% of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the
building structure, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   The insurer shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the City
Treasurer the aggregate of $2,000 for each $15,000 of a claim and for each
fraction of the amount of a claim; provided:
         (A)   That this section is to be applied such that if the claim is
$15,000 or less, the amount transferred to the city shall be $2,000; and
         (B)   That, if at that time of a loss report the named insured has
submitted a contractor’s signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or
securing the building or other structure in an amount less than the amount
calculated under the foregoing transfer formula, the insurer shall transfer to
the city from the insurance proceeds the amount based upon the estimate.
      (2)   The transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
companies, associations or exchanges insuring the building or other structure.
Policy proceeds remaining after the transfer to the city shall be disbursed in
accordance with the policy terms.
   (c)   After the transfer, the named insured may submit a contractor’s signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure, and the designated officer shall return the amount of the funds
transferred to the city in excess of the estimate to the named insured, if the
city has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other
structure.
   (d)   Upon receipt of proceeds under this section, the city shall do the
following.
      (1)   The City Treasurer shall place the proceeds in the separate fund to
be used solely as security against the total costs of removing, repairing or
securing the building or structure which are incurred by the city. Such costs
shall include, without limitation, any engineering, legal or administrative
costs incurred by the city in connection with such removal, repair or securing
of the building or any proceedings related thereto; and it is the obligation of
the insurer when transferring the proceeds to provide the city with the name
and address of the named insured. Upon receipt of the transferred funds and the
name and address of the named insured, the city officer shall contact the named
insured, certify that the proceeds have been received by the city and notify
the named insured that the procedures under this subsection shall be followed;
and, when repairs, removal or securing of the building or other structure have
been completed in accordance with all applicable regulations and order of the
city and the required proof of such completion received by the Treasurer, the
city has not incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing, the fund
shall be returned to the named insured. If the city incurred costs for repairs,
removal or securing of the building or other structure, the costs shall be paid
from the fund and, if excess funds remain, the city shall transfer the
remaining funds to the named insured.
      (2)   To the extent that interest is earned on proceeds held by the city
pursuant to this section, and retained by it, such interest shall belong to the
city. To the extent that proceeds are returned to the named insured, interest
earned on such proceeds shall be distributed to the named insured at the time
that the proceeds are returned.
   (e)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of the
city to recover any deficiency. Furthermore, nothing in this article shall be
construed to prohibit the city and the named insured from entering into an
agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured if some other
reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated.

such dwellings are unfit for human habitation, in accordance with the criteria
established by the Director of Public Safety. In the case of multiple dwelling
buildings a determination shall be made whether each tenement is unfit, taking
into account the condition of the common facilities of the building. Upon
making a determination that the dwelling is unfit for human habitation for rent
withholding purposes, the Inspector shall immediately prepare a written report
substantiating the findings and submit such report to the Director of Public
Safety. Upon making the determination that the dwelling is unfit for human
habitation for rent withholding purposes, the Inspector shall also determine
whether the tenant who leases the dwelling is current in his or her payment of
rent to the landlord. The Inspector shall include in the written report to the
Director of Public Safety, a statement as to whether the rent is current and
shall also indicate in the report what evidence of current payment was
exhibited by the tenant to the Inspector, for example, the Inspector was shown
a rent receipt or the Inspector was shown a cancelled check. In the event the
payment of rent is not current, the tenant may bring such payments to a current
status by paying the necessary sums to the landlord.
(Ord. 4831, approved 5-12-1977)
§ 1743.09 CERTIFICATION PROCEDURE AND NOTICE.
   (a)   Upon receipt of the Director of Public Safety of reports from the
Inspectors relating to the unfitness of a dwelling for human habitation, and
whether or not the tenant of such dwelling is current in his or her payment of
rent to the landlord, the Director of Public Safety shall promptly consider the
reports, and based on the contents thereof and any additional information
obtained by the Director of Public Safety, determine whether such dwelling
should be certified as unfit for human habitation and further whether a
certification should be issued that the tenant of the dwelling is current in
the payment of rent to the landlord.
   (b)   In the event that a certification is issued signifying that a dwelling
is unfit for human habitation, the Director of Public Safety shall immediately
send to both landlord and tenant copies of the report submitted by the
Inspector together with the Inspector’s recommendation, along with a
notification which shall advise both landlord and tenant that the tenant is
entitled to withhold his or her rent and put it into escrow until the premises
are certified as fit for human habitation by the Director of Public Safety. The
tenant shall be advised of the procedure for paying rent into escrow and that
person desiring to avail themselves of rent withholding should immediately
contact the Department of Public Safety for such purpose. Until such time as
the property is certified as being fit for human habitation by the Director of
Public Safety, the right of the landlord to collect rent shall be suspended,
and until further notice, all rental payments shall be directed to the bank or
trust company approved by the city for the purpose of holding such rental
payments in an escrow account.
   (c)   If the building is determined to be fit for human habitation, the
Director of Public Safety shall immediately notify the tenant in writing of
this determination.
   (d)   The landlord shall have ten days from the date of the mailing of a
notification that a dwelling has been certified as unfit for human habitation,
to file a written response to the certification and the Inspector’s report and
request a hearing before the Board of Health for the purpose of contesting the
certification based upon an erroneous inspection report or based upon the
allegation that some of the defective conditions noted in the Inspector’s
report were the result of tenant-caused damage, or to contest whether the
tenant is current in his payment of rent to the landlord.
   (e)   Any reports, certifications, or written determinations required under
this article shall be directed to the landlord and the tenant, or the
respective legal representatives, at their last known addresses by ordinary
mail.
(Ord. 4831, approved 5-12-1977)
§ 1743.10 APPEAL PROCEDURE BEFORE BOARD OF HEALTH.
   (a)   Upon receipt of written request for a hearing before the Board of
Health, the Director of Public Safety shall transmit the copy of the written
request for a hearing, together with any written response to the Secretary of
the Board of Health, who shall place the matter on the agenda for the next
regularly scheduled meeting of the Board. Both the landlord and the tenant
shall be sent notification by the Secretary of the date, time and place of the
appeal hearing, and the tenant shall be provided with a copy of the landlord’s
written response, if any. The notifications to be sent by the Secretary shall
be directed to the landlord and tenant, or their respective legal
representatives, at their last known addresses by ordinary mail.
   (b)   The Chairperson or acting chairperson of the Board shall preside over
the appeal and shall have the power to administer oaths, issue subpoenas, to
compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents and papers,
if requested to issue such subpoenas by either party.
   (c)   Both the landlord and the tenant shall have the right to be
represented by counsel and shall be afforded the opportunity to respond and
present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
   (d)   Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but irrelevant, immaterial
and repetitious evidence may be excluded.
   (e)   Within 15 days after any such hearing, the Board shall issue a written
order affirming or revoking the certification of the Director of Public Safety
and the Secretary shall immediately direct a copy of its order to both the
landlord and tenant, or their legal representatives, at their last known
addresses by ordinary mail.
   (f)   Where the Director of Public Safety has certified that a dwelling is
unfit for human habitation, and that the tenant is current in his or her
payment of rent to the landlord, the duty to pay rent by the tenant to the
landlord shall remain suspended during the pendency of any proceedings before
the Board of Health, as well as during the pendency of any appeal from an order
of the Board, but in no event longer than six months from the date of such
certification. The suspension of the duty of the tenant to pay rent shall
terminate upon the revocation of a certification of the Director of Public
Safety, and the tenant’s duty to pay rent to the landlord shall be reinstated
as of the date of the Board’s order. Any rent which was paid to an escrow agent
during the pendency of an appeal, shall be paid to the landlord less any amount
used to pay the cost of making the premises fit for human habitation, or any
amount used for the payment of utility services for which the landlord was
obligated but refused or was unable to pay, and less any administrative costs
incurred by the escrow agent as a result of setting up, administering and
terminating the escrow account.
   (g)   If the Director of Public Safety has determined that a dwelling is fit
for human habitation or certifies that a dwelling is unfit for human
habitation, but determines that a tenant is not current in the payment of his
or her rent to the landlord, the duty to pay rent shall continue during the
pendency of any proceeding before the Board of Health, as well as during the
pendency of any appeal from an order of the Board thereon. However, the duty to
pay rent shall terminate upon the revocation of the certification of the
Director of Public Safety, which revocation is final in nature and such
suspension of the duty to pay shall continue for a period of six months from
the date of any such revocation.
   (h)   Any party aggrieved by the decision by the Board of Health shall have
the right of appeal from such decision in accordance with the Local Agency Law,
2 Pa.C.S. §§ 551, 751 et seq..
(Ord. 4831, approved 5-12-1977)
§ 1743.11 USE OF FUNDS IN ESCROW ACCOUNT.
   (a)   The escrow agent shall have the right to make monthly deductions from
the individual escrow accounts for the costs of administration of the
individual escrow account as set forth in the agreement drawn up between the
city and the escrow agent. Such monthly administrative costs shall be made
known to the landlord and tenant as part of the notification sent to the
respective parties when a dwelling has been certified as unfit for human
habitation for rent withholding purposes.
   (b)   Any funds deposited in escrow may be used for the purpose of making a
dwelling fit for human habitation, and for the payment of utility services for

§ 1753.01 TITLE AND PURPOSE.
   This article shall be known as the “Neighborhood Preservation and Nuisance
Assessment”. It is the intent of the City of Williamsport to promote the
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Williamsport. This
responsibility includes protecting neighborhoods from blight and deteriorating
conditions that have a negative impact on property values and encourage
disorder, disease, and health and safety risks. This is achieved through
ordinances and by establishing a policy to guide enforcement of the ordinances
contained within the Codified Ordinances of the City of Williamsport,
Pennsylvania. It is the further intent of the city to assess against property
owners who continually cost the taxpayers undue funds with respect to the
enforcement of other ordinances to pay those costs to the city in the interests
of fairness.
(Ord. 6243, approved 10-24-2013)
§ 1753.02 INTRODUCTION.
   The city finds that public nuisances exist in the City of Williamsport in
the operation of certain buildings, structures and dwellings, and in the use
and occupation of certain properties whose owners or responsible parties are in
repeated violation of state and local laws or ordinances. Such nuisances
substantially and seriously interfere with the interest of the public in
enhancing the quality of life in the city, in fostering and facilitating
commerce, in maintaining and improving property values, and in preserving and
protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Such properties create undue
expense and burden on the resources of the city with respect to codes
enforcement. The city further finds that repeated activities and violations are
detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the people of the City of
Williamsport, its visitors and businesses thereof. The city further finds that
it is an unfair burden to the taxpayers generally, that the costs of repeated
violations of ordinances with respect to property are caused by a limited
number of property owners, and it is the intent to shift the burden of
enforcement costs, to the extent reflected in this article, to those offending
property owners.
