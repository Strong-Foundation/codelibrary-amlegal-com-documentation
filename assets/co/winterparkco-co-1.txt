CHARTER
SYNOPSIS
In conformity with Article XX of the Colorado Constitution and applicable
Colorado Statutes, the Charter Commission has drafted this Home Rule Charter
for approval by the Citizens of the Town of Winter Park, Colorado.
Recognizing this Charter is the Town of Winter Park's counterpart to the
Colorado Constitution and the United States Constitution, the Commission has
chosen not to be unduly restricted in its Charter provisions, but rather, to
provide broad general powers which guarantee the rights of its citizens to
fully participate in their own municipal government without undue influence by
the state and federal governments. The underlying philosophy is one of the true
local government with full control vested in the citizens of Winter Park.
A Council-Manager form of government has been chosen by the commission with an
elected council deciding policy questions by adoption of appropriate
legislation and administration of municipal functions to be accomplished by a
professional Town Manager who is appointed by the Council and serves at their
pleasure. The Commission has allowed for continuity of government and
responsiveness to the voters by providing that a majority of the seven member
council be elected every two years. The Council shall elected from their
membership a Mayor who, during his two year term, shall preside at council
meetings and be the political leader of the Town.
The Commission has drafted a charter which is intended to provide an enduring
framework for implementation of a progressive municipal government, responsive
to the needs and desires of its citizens.
ARTICLE I - GENERAL PROVISIONS

this charter shall not be deemed to deny the town any other power conferred by
article XX of the state constitution, including the power to supercede by
charter or ordinance any law of this state now or hereafter in force insofar as
it applies to local or municipal affairs. (4-12-1983)

a clear, general summary of its contents and shall be so arranged as to show
comparative figures for income and expenditures of the preceding fiscal year.
Section 9.4 Capital Program
   (a)   Submission. Two (2) weeks prior to the submission of his recommended
budget, the manager, with such assistance as he may desire or the council may
direct, shall prepare and submit to the council a long range capital program

Section 9.5 Budget Hearing
A public hearing on the proposed budget and proposed capital program shall be
held by the council no later than forty-five (45) days prior to the close of
the fiscal year. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be
published one (1) time at least seven (7) days prior to the hearing. Copies of
the proposed budget shall be made available to the electors of the Town upon
request to the Town clerk prior to the public hearing.
Section 9.6 Council Amendments
After the public hearing, the council may adopt the budget with or without
amendment. In amending the budget, it may add or increase programs or amounts
and may delete or decrease any programs or amounts, except expenditures
required by law or for debt service or for estimated cash deficit. The total
proposed expenditures and provisions of contingencies in the budget shall not
exceed the total estimated revenues including surpluses from prior years.
Section 9.7 Council Adoption
The council shall adopt the budget by resolution on or before the final day of
the fiscal year. If it fails to adopt the budget by this date, the amounts
appropriated for the current operation for the current fiscal year shall be
deemed adopted for the ensuing fiscal year on a month-to-month basis, with all
items in it prorated accordingly, until such time as the council adopts the
budget for the ensuing fiscal year.
Section 9.8 Appropriations
Adoption of the budget by council shall constitute appropriations of the
amounts specified therein for expenditure from the funds indicated. The
proceeds of any municipal borrowing authorized by Article X of this Charter
shall not be subject to any requirement of prior budgeting or appropriation as
a condition to their expenditure. The amount necessary to repay any such
municipal borrowing (including interest thereon) need not be budgeted or
appropriated in full in the year in which the borrowing occurs; however,
amounts necessary to pay debt service shall (except to the extent they may be
payable from other legally available funds in the first year) be budgeted and
appropriated on an annual basis, provided that no failure to budget and
appropriate such annual debt service amounts shall affect the enforceability of
any covenant of the Town to make such payments.
Section 9.9 Property Tax Levy
Council shall cause the property tax to be certified to the county for
collection as required by law.
Section 9.10 Public Records
Copies of the budget and the capital program as adopted shall be public records
and shall be made available to the public in the municipal building.
Section 9.11 Contingencies
The budget may include an item for contingencies. Except in those cases where
there is no logical account to which an expenditure can be charged,
expenditures shall not be charged directly to contingencies; but instead, the
necessary part of the appropriation for contingencies shall be transferred to
the logical account, and the expenditure charged to such account. No such
transfer shall be made without the express approval of the council, and then
only for expenditures which could not readily be foreseen at the time the
budget was adopted.
Section 9.12 Amendments After Adoption
   (a)   Supplemental Appropriations. If, during the fiscal year, the manager
certifies that there are available for appropriation revenues in excess of
those estimated in the budget, the council by ordinance may make supplemental
appropriations for the year up to the amount of such excess.
   (b)   Emergency Appropriations. To meet a public emergency affecting life,
health, property or the public peace, the council may make emergency
appropriations. Such appropriations may be made by emergency ordinance in
accordance with provisions of section
4.11. To the extent that there are no available unappropriated revenues to meet
such appropriations, the council may by emergency ordinance authorize the
issuance of emergency notes as provided in Article X of this Charter.
   (c)   Reduction of Appropriations. If, at any time during the fiscal year,
it appears probable to the manager that the revenues available will be
insufficient to meet the amount appropriated, he shall report to the council
without delay, indicating the estimated amount of deficit, any remedial action
taken by him and his recommendation as to any other steps to be taken. The
council shall then take such further action as it deems necessary to prevent or
minimize any deficit and for that purpose it may by resolution reduce one or
more appropriations.
   (d)   Transfer of Appropriations. Any time during the fiscal year, the
manager may transfer part or all of any unencumbered appropriation balance
among programs within a department, office or agency and, upon written request
of the manager, the council may by resolution transfer part or all of any
unencumbered appropriation balance from one department, office, agency, or
object to another.
   (e)   Limitation - Effective Date. No appropriation for debt service may be
reduced or transferred. No appropriation may be reduced below any amount
required by law to be appropriated or by more than the amount of the
unencumbered balance thereof. The supplemental appropriations, emergency
appropriations and reduction or transfer of appropriations authorized by this
section may be made effective immediately upon adoption.
Section 9.13 Independent Audit
An independent audit shall be made of all Town accounts at least annually and
more frequently if deemed necessary by the council. Such audit shall be made by
certified public accountants selected by the council who shall complete the
audit within four (4) months time of the close of the fiscal year. Copies of
such audit shall be made available for public inspection at the municipal
building.

   (j)   Other obligations authorized to cities and towns by Colorado Statute.
Each type of obligation shall be issued by council in the name of the Town
pursuant to an ordinance and may be issued without an election except as
otherwise provided in this Article X. The council may in its discretion adopt
an ordinance not inconsistent with the provisions of this Article X specifying
the terms, conditions and other details upon which any such type of obligation
may be issued.
Section 10.2 Short-Term Notes
Short-term notes may be secured in any manner determined by council, including
by a pledge of the full faith and credit and the general taxing power of the
Town. Short- term notes shall mature and become payable within twelve (12)
months of their date of issue.
Section 10.3 Emergency Notes
Emergency notes may be issued upon the circumstances specified in section
9.12(b) of this Charter and may be secured in any manner determined by council,
including by a pledge of the full faith and credit and the general taxing power
of the Town. Emergency notes may be renewed from time to time as the needs of
the Town require; however, emergency notes and any renewed notes shall mature
and be paid no later than the last day of the fiscal year next succeeding the
year in which the emergency appropriation was made.
Section 10.4 Anticipation Warrants
Anticipation warrants shall be issued in anticipation of and shall assign taxes
or revenues which have been levied or imposed by the Town. Taxes which may be
assigned to pay anticipation warrants include, but shall not be limited to, ad
valorem taxes constructively received by the Town and excise taxes.
Anticipation warrants shall mature within twelve (12) months of their date of
issue.
Section 10.5 General Obligation Bonds
Except for obligations authorized in sections
10.2,
10.3,
10.4 and
10.10 of this Charter, or as provided in this section below, no bonds or other
obligations to which the full faith and credit of the Town is pledged or which
are payable in whole or in part from the proceeds of general property taxes
shall be issued until the question of their issuance shall be submitted to a
vote of the qualified electors of the Town at a regular or special election and
approved by a majority of those voting thereon. Such election shall be called
pursuant to a resolution or ordinance.
General obligation bonds of the Town issued for the purpose of constructing,
improving or extending any municipal utility system (as defined in section
13.13 of this Charter) or for acquiring water and the rights thereto may be
issued under this section without an election.
Section 10.6 Revenue Bonds
Revenue bonds issued for the purpose of purchasing, equipping, constructing,
condemning or otherwise acquiring, extending or improving any municipal utility
system or other income-producing project may be made payable solely from the
net revenues derived from the operation of such system or project. Any two or
more of such systems or projects may be combined, operated and maintained
jointly, in which case such revenue bonds shall be made payable out of the net
revenue derived from the operation of the joint enterprise. Neither a failure
of the Town historically to have maintained a special fund for any such
existing municipal utility system or other income-producing project nor a
previous commingling of revenues derived from the operation thereof with the
general fund of the Town shall prevent a pledge of such revenues for the
payment of revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section, provided that such a
special fund is created prior to or contemporaneously with the issuance of such
revenue bonds and thereafter maintained separate and apart from the general
fund.
Revenue bonds issued for any public purpose of the Town (including those
specified in the preceding paragraph) may be made payable solely from the
proceeds of any tax, other than a general ad valorem tax, imposed by the Town
or the State of Colorado or any agency or political subdivision thereof.
Neither a failure of the Town historically to have maintained special funds
into which the proceeds of such existing taxes are deposited nor a previous
commingling of such tax proceeds with the general fund of the Town shall
prevent a pledge of such revenues for the payment of revenue bonds issued
pursuant to this section, provided that such special funds are created prior to
or contemporaneously with the issuance of such revenue bonds and thereafter
maintained separate and apart from the general fund.
Nothing herein shall be construed so as to prevent the issuance of revenue
bonds pursuant to this section for any of the purposes specified in the first
paragraph of this section which are payable from both system or project
revenues and the proceeds of the taxes herein specified. Revenue bonds issued
pursuant to this section may also be secured by a pledge of the full faith and
credit of the Town or of general property taxes; however, except for such bonds
issued for the purpose of constructing, extending or improving any municipal
utility system (as defined in section
13.13 of this Charter), no such bonds shall be issued until the question of
their issuance shall be approved at an election held as required by section
10.5 of this Charter. Revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section may also be
secured by a pledge of governmental grants or other revenues received or to be
received from the United States of America or any agency thereof or from the
State of Colorado or any agency thereof or by a pledge of such grant receipts
or other revenues together with any other revenues or taxes as herein provided.
Section 10.7 Industrial Development Revenue Bonds
Industrial development revenue bonds may be issued as provided by Colorado
statute or as otherwise provided by ordinance.
Section 10.8 Improvement Districts and Special Assessment Bonds
The Town shall have the power to create special or local improvement districts
within designated areas in the Town, to contract for, construct or install
special or local improvements of every character within such districts, to
assess the cost thereof, wholly or in part upon the property benefited in such
districts, and to issue special assessment bonds therefor. The council shall,
by ordinance, prescribe the method and manner of creating such improvements, or
letting contracts therefor, issuing and paying bonds for construction or
installation of such improvements, including the cost incidental thereto, for
assessing the costs thereof and for all things in relation to the authority
herein created. Except as otherwise provided by Charter or by ordinance, the
statutes of the State of Colorado shall govern the creation and organization of
special or local improvement districts, the assessment of costs, the issuance
of bonds therefor and all things in relation thereto.
Special or local improvement districts may be created by:
   (a)   Ordinance adopted by the council; provided, that if the owners of a
majority of the property in the proposed district and a majority of those
owners scheduled to bear the assessment burden under the method of apportioning
assessments proposed by the council file written objection prior to adoption of
such ordinance, the council shall not create such district.
   (b)   A petition by the owners of not less than fifty (50) percent of the
area to be assessed in the proposed district.
In either event, a public hearing shall be held at which all interested parties
may appear and be heard. Right to protest and notice of public hearing shall be
given as provided by council by ordinance. Such improvements shall confer
special benefits to the real property within said district and may confer
general benefits to the Town at large.
Where all outstanding bonds of a local improvement district have been paid and
any monies remain to the credit of the district, they shall be transferred to a
special surplus and deficiency fund. Whenever there is a deficiency in any
local improvement district fund to meet the payment of outstanding bonds and
interest due thereon, the deficiency shall be paid out of said surplus and
deficiency fund. Whenever a local improvement district has paid and cancelled
three-fourths of its bonds issued, and for any reason the remaining assessments
are not paid in time to pay the remaining bonds of the district and the
interest due thereon, and there are not sufficient monies in the special
surplus and deficiency fund, then the Town shall pay said bonds when due and
the interest due thereon, and reimburse itself by collecting the unpaid
assessments due said district.
In consideration of general benefits conferred on the Town at large from the
construction or installation of improvements in local improvement districts,
the council may levy annual taxes on all taxable property within the Town at a
rate to be determined by council, to be disbursed as determined by the council
for the purpose of paying for such benefits, for the payment of any assessment
levied against the Town itself in connection with bonds issued for local
improvement districts, or for the purpose of advancing monies to maintain
current payments of interest and principal of bonds issued for any local
improvement district hereinafter created. The proceeds of such taxes shall be
placed in a special fund and shall be disbursed only for the purposes specified
herein, provided that in lieu of such tax levies, the council may annually
transfer to such special fund any available monies of the Town, but in no event
shall the amount transferred in any one year exceed the amount which would
result from a tax levied in such year as herein limited. No assessment by the
Town of its own property pursuant to this section shall be considered or held
to create an indebtedness of the Town or to require an election; however, if
the council elects to issue limited tax bonds secured by a pledge of the tax
levy authorized in this section for the purpose of providing funds to pay any
such assessment or the costs of any improvement conferring general benefits on
the Town at large, it shall do so only after the question of the issuance of
such limited tax bonds has been approved at an election held in accordance with
section
10.5 of this Charter.
No action or proceeding, at law or in equity, to review any acts or proceedings
or to question the validity of, or enjoin the performance of the issue or
collection of any bonds, or the levy or collection of any assessments
authorized by this section
10.8; or for any other relief against any acts or proceedings of the Town done
or under this section
10.8, shall be maintained against the Town, unless commenced within thirty (30)
days after the performance of the act or the effective date of the resolution
or ordinance complained of, or else be thereafter perpetually barred.
Section 10.9 Refunding Bonds
General obligation refunding bonds and refunding revenue bonds may be issued as
provided by Colorado statute or by ordinance. (4-12-83)
Section 10.10 Lease-Purchase and Installment-Purchase Agreement.
The Council may enter into lease-purchase and installment-purchase agreements
as a means of acquiring any real or personal property for public purposes. The
Council may pledge the full faith and credit and the general taxing power of
the Town to the payment of its obligations under any such agreement and may
enter into such covenants regarding the rights of the lessor-vendor in the
property upon default as the Council may deem necessary or appropriate.
Provided, however, in the event the Council determines to enter into a lease-
purchase or installment purchase agreement for purchase of real property having
a purchase price in excess of five percent (5%) of the total valuation for
assessment of the taxable property within the Town as shown by the last
assessment thereof, no bonds or other obligations to which the full faith and
credit of the Town is pledged or which are payable in whole or in part from the
proceeds of general property taxes shall be issued until the question of their
issuance shall be submitted to a vote of the qualified electors of the Town at
a regular or special election and approved by a majority of those voting
thereon. This limitation shall only apply to transactions occurring after the
effective date hereof and shall not affect those agreements in effect prior to
the date hereof or the refinancing, refunding or other restructuring or
amendment to agreements in existence as of the effective date of this
ordinance. (Ord. 138, Series of 1986)
Section 10.11 Limitations; Sale and Redemption of Obligations
There shall be no limitation on the amount of bonds or other securities the
Town may issue, except as may be stated in the documents pertaining thereto,
provided that the notice of any election or any ordinance to authorize the
creation of any debt pledging Town tax revenues shall contain the following
information:
   (a)   The amount of the total valuation for assessment of the taxable
property within the Town as shown by the last assessment thereof;
   (b)   The amount of the Town's total bonds outstanding and unrefunded as of
the date of the resolution calling an election or ordinance authorizing the
bonds and the amount thereof assuming the issuance of the proposed bonds;
   (c)   With regard to the general obligation bonds, the percentage of debt to
assessed valuation, and with regard to bonds pledging tax revenues other than
from ad valorem taxes, the percentage of debt to the previous year's revenue
from the particular tax source pledged;
   (d)   Bond rating information, if any;
   (e)   A statement of purpose for incurring the particular indebtedness.
   (f)   All obligations issued pursuant to the provisions of this Charter
shall be sold at public or private sale to the best advantage of the Town at,
above or below par. Bonds may contain provisions for redemption prior to
maturity with or without the payment of a premium. The maximum premium payable
on prior redemption of any general obligation bonds may, but need not be
specified in the bond question approved by the qualified electors.

Notes
1 1. See charter section 3.8 for compensation of council members; and articles
  III and IV of the home rule charter regarding the council.
1-5-2: CONFLICT OF INTEREST:
   A.   Pursuant to, and in accordance with, the provisions of sections 3.7 and
4.7 of the home rule charter of the town of Winter Park, Colorado, the
following protocol shall be in effect as to and binding upon each member of the
town council in the event of an actual or perceived conflict of interest, as
defined in said charter sections:
      1.   Any member of the town council shall declare a conflict of interest
in the event he/she, or a member of his/her family, has a material or
significant financial interest, direct or indirect, other than the common
public interest in any matter which appears on a town council agenda for
decision by the town council.
      2.   Upon declaration of such a conflict of interest, the member of the
town council declaring such conflict of interest shall refrain from voting on
the matter upon which the conflict of interest has been declared; provided,
however, that if the provisions of section 4.7 of the home rule charter require
the council member to vote in order to attain a quorum on the matter, the
member of council shall vote on the issue notwithstanding the declared conflict
of interest.
      3.   Upon declaration of a conflict of interest by a member of the town
council as above described, the member of council may continue to take part in
the discussion of the matter under consideration and upon which a conflict of
interest has been declared unless the remaining members of the town council by
majority vote determine that the member of council who has declared the
conflict of interest has such a direct and material conflict of interest that
further participation in council deliberations by that member of council is
inappropriate. In case of such determination, the member of council with the
declared conflict of interest shall cease taking any further part in discussion
of the matter under consideration, and shall leave his/her seat and take a seat
in the audience or, at the discretion of the member of council with the
declared conflict of interest, leave the council chambers during discussion of
the matter.
   B.   Members of the town council hereby determine that appearances by them,
as elected officials of the town of Winter Park, before the appointed members
of the planning and zoning commission and the board of adjustment should be
limited so as to preserve the integrity of decisions reached by the town in the
quasi-judicial process, and so as to avoid the appearance of influence over
decisions of such bodies. However, the members of the town council also
understand and determine that they retain the rights of citizens to appear
before such bodies in their personal capacity. Therefore, the members of the
town council hereby find and determine that, when appearing before either the
town's planning and zoning commission or the town's board of adjustment, such
member of council shall declare that his/her appearance is in a personal
capacity as a private citizen, and not as a member of the town council. (Ord.
303, Series of 2000)

complaint. Within ten (10) business days of receiving a complaint, the Town
Clerk shall take one or more of the following actions:

filed, has not specifically identified one or more violations of Article XXVIII
of the Colorado Constitution, the Fair Campaign Practices Act, C.R.S. 1-45-101,
et seq., or the Secretary of State’s rules concerning campaign and political
finance, or does not assert facts sufficient to support a factual or legal
basis for an alleged violation, the Town Clerk shall notify the complainant and

unavailable. The Town Clerk’s determination hereunder is a final action subject
only to judicial review pursuant to C.R.C.P. 106(a)(4).
      2.   If the Town Clerk determines that the complaint alleges one or more
curable violations, the Town Clerk shall notify the respondent and provide the
respondent an opportunity to cure the violations. The process for curing shall

      3.   If the Town Clerk determines that the complaint has specifically
identified one or more violations of Article XXVIII of the Colorado
Constitution, the Fair Campaign Practices Act, C.R.S. § 1-45-101, et seq., or
the Secretary of State’s rules concerning campaign and political finance, and
has alleged facts sufficient to support a factual or legal basis for each
alleged violation, and that either a factual finding or a legal interpretation
is required, the Town Clerk shall forward the complaint to a hearing officer
appointed by the Board of Trustees.
   D.   Upon the Town Clerk’s determination that a complaint alleges a failure
to file or otherwise disclose required information, or alleges another curable
violation, the Town Clerk shall notify the respondent by e-mail or by regular
mail if e-mail is unavailable of the curable deficiencies alleged in the
complaint. The process for curing shall be as set forth in C.R.S. § 1-45-111.7
(4), as amended.
   E.   The hearing officer shall schedule a hearing on a complaint referred by
the Town Clerk within thirty (30) days of the filing of the complaint. The

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the WINTER PARK REAL ESTATE
TRANSFER TAX ORDINANCE. (Ord. 101, Series of 1983)
1-10-2: DEFINITIONS:
CONSIDERATION: The gross consideration paid for the real property affected by
the "transfer" and shall include actual cash paid, the money equivalent of real
and personal property delivered or conveyed in exchange for the transfer, or
contracted to be paid or delivered or conveyed, in return for the transfer of
ownership or interests in real property, and shall include the amount of any
lien, mortgage, contract indebtedness, or other encumbrance or debt, either
given to secure the purchase price, or any part thereof, or remaining unpaid on
the property at the time of the transfer. The term does not include as an
addition to gross consideration the amount of any outstanding lien or
encumbrance in favor of the United States, the state of Colorado, or of a
municipal or quasi-municipal corporation or district for taxes, special
benefits or improvements. In the event the transaction or transfer is by lease
agreement not specifically exempted in Section
1-10-6, the consideration shall be deemed to be the capitalized value of the
average annual rental unit of the lease, computed as follows: the average
annual rental over the entire term of the lease, including any renewal term,
plus the actual consideration, other than rent, paid or to be paid shall be
computed and the average annual rental shall be ten percent (10%) of the
capitalized value. The payment of ad valorem real property taxes, insurance and
the assumption of maintenance obligations shall not be included in the annual
rent-capitalization computation; however, capital improvements required to be
made shall be part of the actual consideration. When the average annual rental
cannot be determined, or at the election of the Town Manager, the tax shall be
based upon the appraised total value of the property covered by the lease as
determined by an independent appraisal obtained by the Town Manager and paid
for by the purchaser, or the capitalized value of the consideration in terms of
the present worth of the stream of consideration under the lease and any other
economic considerations to reflect the capitalized value of the transferred or
leased property. (Ord. 101, Series of 1983)
DEED IN LIEU OF FORECLOSURE: A conveyance by a property owner to a secured
party of property which is the subject of a mortgage, deed of trust or other
security instrument in consideration of the cancellation of all or part of the

provided lessee has possession or the right to possession on payment of rents.
"Taxable lease" also means any lease of real property for less than twenty nine
(29) years of term or initial term and all renewal terms aggregated if lessee
has a clause which would permit lessee at its discretion to extend the lease
beyond twenty nine (29) years or if lessee has an option to purchase some or
all of the real property leased. If lessee has a lease with such an option to
purchase which option may be exercised only within three (3) years after the
date of the lease and option is entered into, then the land transfer tax shall
not be due and payable unless and until the exercise and consummation of such
option. If any other lease with such an option to purchase is entered into, the
real estate transfer tax shall be due and payable at the time of such transfer
as transfer is defined herein.
TRANSFER: Transfer, whether or not the same is in writing or is recorded, means
and includes (a) any sale, grant, assignment, transfer, exchange, or conveyance
of any ownership or title to real property situated in the Town, (b) the sale,
leasing, letting, conveyance, assignment or transfer of a possessory interest
in real property, subject to the exemptions provided in this Chapter.

instruments, writings, leases or any other documents or otherwise by which any
lands, tenements or other interests in real property located in the Town are
sold, granted, let, assigned, transferred, exchanged or otherwise conveyed to
or vested in a purchaser, or purchasers thereof, or any other person or
persons, except as may be specifically exempted by Section

purchaser or person to whom a transfer is made shall remit the tax to the Town.
1-10-5: AMOUNT OF TAX:

organization is owned by the persons by whom such transfer was made if such
owners have the same relative interests in said association or organization as
they had in the real property immediately prior to said transfer and there is

provisions of this chapter and the imposition of the tax hereunder, then such
transfer will nevertheless be subject to the real estate transfer tax.
"Artifice or device" includes, but is not limited to: 1) a transfer to a
corporation, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, business trust,
or other association or organization followed within three (3) years by an
assignment of the controlling interest in such association or organization, 2)

liens and special improvement district assessment liens. Except as aforesaid,

lien superior to all other liens or claims of whatsoever kind or nature. Said
lien shall continue until the amount thereof is paid or until its discharge of
record by foreclosure or otherwise.
   B.   The recording of this chapter in the office of the clerk and recorder
of the county of Grand, state of Colorado, shall constitute notice to all

town manager shall commence foreclosure of the lien for said tax in the same
manner as the foreclosure of a mortgage in accordance with Colorado law 1 .
   D.   The amount of the tax, penalty and interest imposed under the
provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt to the town. Any person owing
money to the town under the provision of this chapter shall be liable to an
action brought in the name of the town for the recovery of such amount. (Ord.

plus
      3.   The grantor's proportionate share of the unpaid balance of any debt

satisfied in connection with such transfer. For purposes of this subsection A3,
the "grantor's proportionate share of any unpaid debt which is owed against the
property at the time of the transfer" shall be determined by multiplying the
grantor's fractional or percentage ownership interest in the property prior to
the transfer, times the unpaid balance of such debt existing as of the time of
the transfer.

the amount of any outstanding lien or encumbrance in favor of any government or
quasi-government corporation or district for taxes, special benefits or

the town manager may deem sufficient to show whether or not such person is
liable under this chapter for payment or collection of the tax imposed herein.
In addition, when in the opinion of the manager if it is necessary for the
efficient administration of this section to treat any salesman, representative,
peddler, or canvasser as the agent of the vendor, distributor, supervisor, or
employer under whom he operates or from whom he obtains tangible personal
property sold by him or for whom he solicits business, the manager may treat
such agent as the vendor jointly responsible with his principal, distributor,
supervisor, or employer for the collection and payment of the tax.
   C.   Vendor Responsibility For Collection Of Tax: Every retailer or vendor
engaged in business and selling at retail as the same are defined in this
chapter shall be liable and responsible for the payment of an amount equivalent
to five percent (5%) of all sales made by him of commodities or services as
specified in section
3-2-6 of this chapter. (See also section
3-2-3 of this chapter, concerning the imposition of taxes.)
   D.   Vendor Responsibility For Remittance Of Tax: Every retailer or vendor
engaged in business and selling at retail as the same are defined in this
chapter shall file a return as prescribed herein with the town manager on or
before the twentieth day of the month for the preceding month or months under

      1.   Acquisition Of Business: The Winter Park tax shall be remitted on
the price paid for tangible personal property which is acquired with the
purchase of a business, and for use in the operation of such business. The tax
shall be based on the price paid for such chattels as recorded in the bill of
sale or agreement and constituting a part of the total transaction at the time
of the sale or transfer, provided the valuation is as great or greater than the
fair market value of such merchandise or chattels. Where the transfer of
ownership is a package deal made by a lump sum transaction, the tax shall be
paid on the book value set up by the purchaser for income tax depreciation
purposes, or fair market value if no determination has been made. When a
business is taken over in return for the assumption of outstanding indebtedness
owed by former owners, the tax shall be paid on the fair market value of all
taxable tangible personal property acquired by the purchaser. (See also
subsection 3-2-17B, sale of business, of this chapter.)
      2.   Purchasers Liable For Prior Owner's Unpaid Tax: Purchasers of a

personal property to secure all or part of the purchase price, the total tax
based on the total selling price shall become immediately due and payable. The
tax shall be charged, or collected and remitted by the vendor. No refund or
credit shall be allowed to either party to the transaction in case of
repossession.
   G.   Excess Collections; Failure To Remit Collections: If any vendor shall,
during any reporting period, collect as a tax an amount in excess of five
percent (5%) of his total taxable sales, he shall remit to the town the full
net amount of the tax herein imposed and also such excess. If record of town
and state sales tax collections are kept separately, the vendor will remit
excess of town tax collected over and above five percent (5%) town net taxable
sales and service; if there is no separate record kept of town and state tax
collections and it is not possible to determine the excess to be remitted to
each, the vendor shall remit fifty seven percent (57%) of such excess to the
town of Winter Park. The retention by the vendor of any excess of tax
collections over five percent (5%) of the total taxable sales of such vendor,
or the intentional failure to remit punctually to the town the full amount
required to be remitted by the provisions of this chapter, is hereby declared
to be a violation of this chapter.

taxpayer or vendor to advertise or hold out or state to the public or to any

will not be added to the selling price of the property sold, or, if added, that
it or any part thereof will be refunded. Any person violating this provision of

town clerk.
   B.   Exempt Institutions: No exempt institution, including quasi-

places or locations, whether in or without the town, and collecting taxes
hereunder, may file one return covering all such places and locations, when
accompanied by a supplemental report showing the gross sales and service and
net taxable sales and service and taxes collected thereon for each such place
or location. Under collections and over collections may not be offset between
locations.
      3.   Reporting Periods: If the accounting methods regularly employed by
the vendor or licensed consumer in the transaction of his business, or other
conditions, are such that the returns aforesaid made on a calendar month basis,
will impose unnecessary hardship, the town manager may, upon request of the
vendor, or licensed consumer, accept returns at such intervals as will, in his
opinion, better suit the convenience of the taxpayer and will not jeopardize
the collection of the tax.
   B.   Timely Payment; Computation Of Dates:

date if mailed; otherwise timely payment shall be evidenced by the town's

vendor conducting a business in which the transaction between the vendor and
the consumer or purchaser consists of the supply of tangible personal property

required to pay the tax levied under this chapter upon the full contract price,
unless application is made to the town manager for permission to use a
percentage basis or reporting the tangible personal property sold and the
services supplied under such contract. The town manager is hereby authorized to
determine the percentage based upon the ratio of the tangible personal property
included in the consideration as it bears to the total of the consideration
paid under said combination contract or sale which shall be subject to the tax
levied pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. This section shall not be
construed to include terms upon which the tax is imposed on the full purchase
price as defined in section
3-2-5 of this chapter, nor shall it be construed as an allowance for the vendor
to fail to itemize to the customer the taxable, and nontaxable portions of the

services shall be retained and expended by the qualifying organization to
provide charitable services; and
      3.   The activity at which taxable tangible property or service is being
sold is an occasional business activity specifically held for fundraising; and
      4.   The organization applies to the town manager on an annual basis for

enforcing obedience to the requirements of said subpoena, power to make such
order as, in his discretion, he deems consistent with the law for punishment of
contempt.
      4.   Subpoena To Secure Evidences: If the town manager is unable to
secure from the taxpayer information relating to the correctness of the
taxpayer's return or the amount of the income of the taxpayer, the town manager
may apply to any judge of the district of the state of Colorado for the
issuance of subpoenas to such other persons as the town manager believes may
have knowledge in the premises, and upon making a showing satisfactory to the
court, that the taxpayer cannot be found, or evades service of subpoena, or
fails or refuses to produce his records or give testimony, or is unable to
furnish such records or testimony, the judge shall have power, to cause the
issuance of subpoenas under the seal of the court to the persons sought to be
so summoned requiring them or any of them to appear before said town manager
and give testimony relating to said taxpayer's return or income; and in case

statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular reports
or returns and the items thereof, or the inspection of returns by the town
attorney or other legal representative of the town.

forms prescribed by the town manager and shall be verified by him or his duly
qualified representative whose duties are the collection of such tax, and may
be filed in the office of the clerk and recorder of any county in the state in
which the taxpayer owns real or tangible personal property, and the filing of
such notice shall create such lien on such property in the county and

stenographer, bookkeeper, or chief clerk, or if the taxpayer is a corporation,
shall be left with any officer, manager, general agent, or agent for process,
with a note of the sum demanded and the time and place of sale; and shall

within the county wherein distraint is made, or, in lieu thereof and in the
discretion of the town manager the agent or sheriff shall cause such notice to
be publicly posted at the courthouse of the county wherein such distraint is
made, and copies thereof to be posted in at least two (2) other public places
within said county. The time fixed for the sale shall not be less than ten (10)
days nor more than sixty (60) days from the date of such notification to the
owner or possessor of the property and the publication or posting of such
notices. Said sale may be adjourned from time to time by said agent or sheriff
if he deems it advisable, but not for a time to exceed in all ninety (90) days
from the date first fixed for the sale. When any personal property is
advertised for sale under distraint as aforesaid, the agent or sheriff making
the seizure shall proceed to sell such property at public auction, offering the
same at not less than a fair minimum price, including the expenses of making
the seizure and advertising the sale, and if the amount bid for the property at
the sale is not equal to the fair minimum price so fixed, the agent or sheriff
conducting the sale may declare the same to be purchased by him for the town.
The property so purchased may be sold by the agent or sheriff under such
regulations as may be prescribed by the town manager. In any case of distraint
for the payment of taxes, the goods, chattels, or effects so distrained shall

holding a chattel mortgage or other evidence of right of possession.
      3.   Certificate Of Sale; Evidence Of Purchase: In all cases of sale, the
agent or sheriff making the sale shall issue a certificate of sale to each
purchaser, and such certificate shall be prima facie evidence of the right of
the agent or sheriff to make such sale, and the conclusive evidence of the
regularity of his proceedings in making the sale; and shall transfer to the
purchaser all right, title, and interest of such delinquency in and to the
property sold; and where such property consists of certificates of stock in the
possession of the agent or sheriff, the certificate of sale shall be notice,
when received, to any corporation, company, or association of said transfer,
and said certificate of such sale shall be authority for such corporation,
company, or association to record the transfer on its books and records; and
where the subject of sale is securities or other evidences of debt, in the
possession of the agent or sheriff, the certificate of sale shall be good and
valid evidence of title in the person holding the same, as against any other
person. Any surplus remaining above the taxes, penalties, interest, costs, and
expenses of making the seizure and of advertising the sale, shall be returned
to the owner, or such other person having a legal right thereto, and on demand,
the town manager shall render an account in writing of the sale.

of any personal property or right to property belonging to the taxpayer, and if
not previously recorded, the filing of such notice of lien shall operate from
the date of such filing. The town manager may release said lien as to any part
or all of the property or rights to property covered by any such lien upon such
terms as he may deem proper.
      5.   Lien Released: Any lien for taxes as shown on the records of the
county clerk and recorder as herein provided, upon payment of all taxes,

in the same manner as mortgages and judgments are released.
   I.   Recovery Of Unpaid Tax By Action At Law:
      1.   Action At Law: The town manager may also treat any such taxes,
penalties, interest, or collection costs due and unpaid as a debt due the town
from the taxpayer. In case of failure to pay the tax, or any portion thereof,
or any penalty or interest thereon when due, the town manager may receive at
law the amount of such taxes, penalties, interest, and collection costs in such
county or district court of the county wherein the taxpayer resides or has his
principal place of business having jurisdiction of the amounts sought to be
collected. The return of the taxpayer or the assessment made by the town
manager as herein provided, shall be prima facie proof of the amount due.
      2.   Writs Of Attachment: Such actions may be actions in attachment, and
writs of attachment may be issued to the sheriff, and in any such proceedings,
no bond shall be required of the town manager nor shall any sheriff require of
the town manager an indemnifying bond for executing the writ of attachment, or
writ of execution upon any judgment entered in such proceedings; and the town
manager may prosecute appeals or writs of error, in such cases without the
necessity of providing bond therefor. It shall be the duty of the town
attorney, when requested by the town manager to commence action for the
recovery of taxes due under this chapter, and this remedy shall be in addition
to all other existing remedies or remedies provided in this chapter.
      3.   Civil Action To Enforce Lien: In any case where there has been a
refusal or neglect to pay any tax due the town of Winter Park and statement or
notice shall have been filed, which under law, creates a lien upon any real
property for such tax, the town manager may cause a civil action to be filed in
the district court of the county in which is situated any real property which
is subject to said lien, to enforce the lien of the town of Winter Park for
such tax upon the real property situated in the county or in any other county
in the state which may be subject to such lien or to subject any real property
or any right, title, or interest in real property to the payment of such tax.
The court shall decree a sale of such real property and distribute the proceeds
of such sale, according to the findings of such court in respect to the
interest of the parties and of the town of Winter Park the proceedings in such
action and the manner of sale, the period for and manner of redemption from
such sale and the execution of deed of conveyance shall be in accordance with
the law and practice relating to foreclosures of mortgages upon real property.
In any such action, the court may appoint a receiver of the real property
involved in such action if equity so requires.
   J.   Party Defendant: In any action affecting the title to real estate or
the ownership or rights to possession of personal property, the town of Winter
Park may be made a party defendant for the purpose of obtaining an adjudication
of determination of its lien upon the property involved therein, and in any
such action service of summons upon the town manager or any other person
permitted by law, shall be sufficient service and binding upon the town of
Winter Park.
   K.   Certificate Of Discharge; Partial; Values Determined:
      1.   Certificate Of Discharge Subject To Lien: If any property, real or
personal, under the law, shall be subject to a lien for the payment of any tax

audit by any municipality that administers its own sales tax collection, the
taxpayer may provide to the finance director of this town, by certified mail,
return receipt requested, a written request for a coordinated audit indicating
the municipality from which the notice of intended audit was received and the
name of the official who issued such notice. Such request shall include a list
of those Colorado municipalities utilizing local collection of their sales tax
in which the taxpayer holds a current sales tax license and a declaration that
the taxpayer will sign a waiver of any passage of time based limitation upon
this town's right to recover tax owed by the vendor for the audit period.

any taxpayer that submits a complete request for a coordinated audit and
promptly signs a waiver of subsection 3-2-19A1 of this chapter may be audited
by this town during the twelve (12) months after such request is submitted only
through a coordinated audit involving all municipalities electing to
participate in such an audit.
   D.   Notice To Other Municipalities: If this town desires to participate in
the audit of a taxpayer that submits a complete request for a coordinated audit
pursuant to subsection C of this section, the town manager shall so notify the
finance director of the municipality whose notice of audit prompted the
taxpayer's request for a coordinated audit. The town manager shall then
cooperate with other participating municipalities in the development of
arrangements for the coordinated audit, including arrangement of the time
during which the coordinated audit will be conducted, the period of time to be
covered by the audit, and a coordinated notice to the taxpayer of those records
most likely to be required for completion of the coordinated audit.
   E.   Audit Coordinator: If the taxpayer's request for a coordinated audit
was in response to a notice of audit issued by this town, this town's manager
shall facilitate arrangements between this town and other municipalities
participating in the coordinated audit unless and until an official from some
other participating municipality agrees to assume this responsibility. The town
manager shall cooperate with other participating municipalities to, whenever
practicable, minimize the number of auditors that will be present on the
taxpayer's premises to conduct the coordinated audit on behalf of the
participating municipalities. Information obtained by or on behalf of those
municipalities participating in the coordinated audit may be shared only among
such participating municipalities.
   F.   Taxpayer Notice: If the taxpayer's request for a coordinated audit was
in response to a notice of audit issued by this town, this town's manager
shall, once arrangements for the coordinated audit between the town and other
participating municipalities are completed, provide written notice to the
taxpayer of which municipalities will be participating, the period to be
audited and the records most likely to be required by participating
municipalities for completion of the coordinated audit. The town manager shall

coordinated audit as provided in subsection B of this section. (Ord. 225,
Series of 1994)
3-2-21: INTERTOWN CLAIMS FOR RECOVERY:
The intent of this section is to streamline and standardize procedures related
to situations where tax has been remitted to the incorrect municipality. It is
not intended to reduce or eliminate the responsibilities of the taxpayer or
vendor to correctly pay, collect, and remit sales and lodging taxes to the
town.
   A.   Definition: As used here, "claim for recovery" means a claim for
reimbursement of sales and use taxes paid to the wrong taxing jurisdiction.
   B.   Notification Of Improper Tax Collections And/Or Remittances: When it is
determined by the town manager of the town that sales tax owed to the town has
been reported and paid to another municipality, the town shall promptly notify
the vendor that taxes are being improperly collected and remitted, and that as
of the date of the notice the vendor must cease improper tax collections and
remittances.
   C.   Claim For Recovery: The town may make a written claim for recovery
directly to the municipality that received tax and/or penalty and interest owed
to the town, or, in the alternative, may institute procedures for collection of
the tax from the taxpayer or vendor. The decision to make a claim for recovery
shall include a properly executed release of claim from the taxpayer and/or
vendor releasing its claim to the taxes paid to the wrong municipality,
evidence to substantiate the claim, and a request that the municipality approve
or deny in whole or part, the claim within ninety (90) days of its receipt. The
municipality to which the town submits a claim for recovery may, for good
cause, request an extension of time to investigate the claim, and approval of
such extension by the town shall not be reasonably withheld.
   D.   Response To Claim: Within ninety (90) days after receipt of a claim for
recovery, the town shall verify to its satisfaction whether or not all or a
portion of the tax claimed was improperly received, and shall notify the
municipality submitting the claim in writing that the claim is either approved
or denied in whole or in part, including the reasons for the decision. If the
claim is approved in whole or in part, the town shall remit the undisputed
amount to the municipality submitting the claim within thirty (30) days of
approval. If a claim is submitted jointly by a municipality and a vendor or
taxpayer, the check shall be made to the parties jointly. Denial of a claim for
recovery may only be made for good cause.
   E.   Denial Of Claim: The town may deny a claim on the grounds that it has
previously paid a claim for recovery arising out of an audit of the same
taxpayer.
   F.   Limitation: The period subject to a claim for recovery shall be limited
to the thirty six (36) month period prior to the date the municipality that was
wrongly paid the tax receives the claim for recovery. (Ord. 225, Series of
1994)

of 1994)

approved at the special election of November 5, 1991, shall be submitted to the
town's qualified electors. Should the majority of those voting vote against the
continuation of such sales tax increase and lodging tax, such taxes shall, to
the extent not needed to meet debt service obligations on any then outstanding
revenue bonds issued by the town, be repealed effective July 1 of the year next
succeeding such election.

this code or subsections thereof, as provided in this chapter, shall not affect

priority in or to the town's sales tax revenue superior to or on parity with
the rights, claims or liens of the holders as any sales tax revenue bonds,
notes, certificates, or debentures payable from or secured by any sales taxes,
existing or hereafter issued by the town; and that all rights of the successful
applicant are, and at all times shall be, subordinate and inferior to the
rights, claims, and liens of the holders of any and all such sales tax revenue
bonds, notes, certificates, or debentures, payable from or secured by any sales
taxes issued by the town.
   G.   Approval: Approval by the town of an agreement implementing the ESTIP
shall entitle the successful applicant to share in enhanced sales tax derived
from the applicant's property or business in an amount which shall not in any
event exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the enhanced sales taxes. The time
period in which said enhanced sales taxes may be shared shall not commence
until all public or public related improvements are completed, and shall be
limited by the town, in its discretion, to a specified time, or until a

parties, and approval by the town, and which increments shall be reasonably
related to the average monthly performance of the business or property in

month, no increment shall be shared until that deficit, and any other
cumulative deficit, has been met, so that at the end of any twelve (12) month
cycle, funds in excess of those enhanced sales tax funds agreed to be shared
shall not have been shared.

consideration and determination of the town that existing sources of town sales
tax revenues shall not be used, impaired or otherwise affected by the ESTIP.

application shall be subject to division under the ESTIP. It shall be the
affirmative duty of the finance director to collect and segregate all such
enhanced sales taxes apart from the sales taxes generated by and collected from
the town.
   K.   No Joint Venture: Notwithstanding any provision hereof, the town shall
never be a joint venturer in any private entity or activity which participates
in the ESTIP, and the town shall never be liable or responsible for any debt or
obligation of any participant in the ESTIP. (Ord. 496, Series of 2016)

not to exceed the actual additional cost incurred by the Town to process the
transaction. Any such convenience fee shall be imposed in accordance with the
rules of the credit card provider. In the event of declined payment or

Colorado Municipal Court Rules of Procedure shall apply to proceedings in which
the defendant is charged with such a noncriminal traffic infraction, except
that no warrant for arrest shall be issued for the defendant’s failure to
appear when the only violation charged would constitute a noncriminal traffic
infraction. Instead, the court may enter a judgment of liability by default
against the defendant for any such failure to appear, assess any penalty and
costs established by law, and report the judgment to the state motor vehicle
division which may assess points against the defendant’s driving privileges and
may deny an application for or renewal of the defendant’s driver’s license
until the judgment and all other lawful costs are satisfied. Further, no writ
of mittimus shall issue where the only basis for the fine and costs imposed was
the finding of guilty or liability for a noncriminal traffic infraction.

subsection A, may demand a trial by jury upon compliance with the provisions of
state law and the Colorado Municipal Court Rules of Procedure. No defendant
shall have a right to a trial by jury for any noncriminal traffic infraction.
If a defendant is charged with more than one traffic violation arising out of
the same incident and at least one of the charged violations is listed in
subsection (1), the defendant shall have the right to demand a trial by jury as
to all offenses, which shall be consolidated for purposes of trial.

noncriminal traffic infraction shall be punished as provided in Section
1-4-1(B). No defendant found to be guilty of any noncriminal traffic infraction
shall be punished by imprisonment for such infraction. (Ord. 534, Series of
2020)

acting under his direction shall be liable for any damage to such motor vehicle
occasioned by such removal or towing and impoundment. (Ord. 158, Series of

4-4-3: REPORT; OPPORTUNITY TO REQUEST HEARING; PUBLIC TOW:
   A.   1. Upon having a motor vehicle towed pursuant to this chapter, the
Winter Park police department shall ascertain, if possible, whether or not the
motor vehicle has been reported stolen, and, if so reported, the police
department shall recover and secure the motor vehicle and notify its rightful
owner and terminate the proceedings under this chapter. The Winter Park police
department shall have the right to recover from the owner its reasonable costs
to recover and secure the motor vehicle.
      2.   As soon as possible, but in no event later than three (3) working
days after having a motor vehicle towed, the Winter Park police department
shall report the same to the department by first class or certified mail or
personal delivery, which report shall be on a form prescribed and supplied by
the department.
      3.   The Winter Park police department upon receiving the department's
report required by Colorado Revised Statutes 42-4-1604(2), shall determine,
from all available information and after reasonable inquiry, whether or not the
motor vehicle has been reported stolen, and, if so reported, shall recover and
secure the motor vehicle and notify its rightful owner and terminate the
proceedings under this chapter. The Winter Park police department shall have
the right to recover from the owner its reasonable costs to recover and secure
the motor vehicle.
      4.   The Winter Park police department, within five (5) working days of
the receipt of the report from the department required by Colorado Revised
Statutes 42-4-1604(2), shall notify by certified mail the owner of record, if
ascertained, and any lienholder, if ascertained, of the fact of such report and
the claim, if any, of a lien under Colorado Revised Statutes 42-4-1607, and
shall send a copy of such notice to the operator. The notice shall contain
information that the identified motor vehicle has been towed or reported
abandoned to the department, the location of the motor vehicle, and the
location from which it was towed, and that, unless claimed within thirty (30)
calendar days from the date the notice was sent as determined from the postmark
on the notice, the motor vehicle is subject to sale. Such notice shall also
inform the owner of record of his opportunity to request a hearing concerning
the legality of the towing of his motor vehicle, and the fact that said owner
must contact the Winter Park police department to request a hearing. Such
request shall be made in writing to the Winter Park police department within
ten (10) days of the postmarked date of sending such notice.
   B.   1. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the owner of a motor vehicle
that has been towed by the Winter Park police department, or said owner's
agent, from appearing at the Winter Park police department to reclaim his motor
vehicle. If the owner or his agent can show proof of ownership, or if the
Winter Park police department confirms the ownership of the vehicle, and the
owner does not contest the legality of the tow, the vehicle may be reclaimed by
payment of the towing fee, any accrued storage fees, and a reasonable
administrative fee assessed by the town.
      2.   If the owner or his agent can show proof of ownership, or if the
Winter Park police department confirms the ownership of the vehicle, and the
owner wishes to contest the legality of the tow, the owner may request a
hearing, in writing, on forms to be supplied by the Winter Park police
department. Prior to a scheduled hearing, the owner of the towed vehicle may
obtain said vehicle by posting a bond in the amount of the towing fee, the
accrued storage fees to date, plus storage fees for each day up to and
including the date of the hearing, and a reasonable administrative fee assessed
by the town. If the person requesting the hearing fails to appear at said
hearing, or if the hearing officer, pursuant to section
4-4-4 of this chapter, finds that there was probable cause to tow the vehicle,
the amount of the bond will be forfeited. (Ord. 158, Series of 1987)
4-4-4: CONDUCT OF HEARING:
   A.   Any requested hearing shall be conducted before a hearing officer
appointed by the town manager within seventy two (72) hours (excluding
Saturdays, Sundays and city holidays) of receipt of a written demand for such
hearing, unless the person requesting the hearing waives the right to a speedy
hearing. The sole issue before the hearing officer shall be whether there was
probable cause to impound the vehicle in question. "Probable cause to impound"
shall mean such a state of facts as would lead a person of ordinary care and
prudence to believe that there was a sufficient breach of municipal, state or
federal law to grant legal authority for the removal of the vehicle.
   B.   The hearing shall be conducted in an informal manner and shall not be
governed by technical rules of evidence. The person demanding the hearing shall
carry the burden of establishing that such person has the right to possession
of the vehicle. The Winter Park police department shall carry the burden of
establishing that there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in question.
The hearing officer shall only determine that, as to the vehicle in question,
either: 1) there was probable cause to impound the vehicle, or 2) there was not
such probable cause to impound the vehicle. The decision of the hearing officer
is final.
   C.   Upon a finding of no probable cause, towing and storage fees shall be
paid by the town in accordance with arrangements made between the town and the
operator; if a bond was posted pursuant to subsection 4-4-3B2 of this chapter,
said bond shall be returned. If the owner of the vehicle or his agent fails to
claim the vehicle from the operator within six (6) hours of a finding of no
probable cause, excluding such days when the operator is not open for business,
the possessor shall assume liability for all subsequent storage charges. It
shall be the responsibility of the Winter Park police department to notify the
operator in writing of a finding of no probable cause immediately after such
finding is made.
   D.   If probable cause is found, the owner of the vehicle may have the
vehicle returned to him upon payment of the towing fees, accrued storage fees,
and a reasonable administrative fee assessed by the town.
   E.   Failure of the owner of the vehicle in question to request a hearing or
attend a scheduled postseizure hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to
such hearing. (Ord. 158, Series of 1987)
4-4-5: ABANDONMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES; PRIVATE TOW:
   A.   No person shall abandon any motor vehicle upon private property other
than his own. Any owner or lessee, or his agent authorized in writing, may have
an abandoned motor vehicle removed from his property by having it towed and
impounded by an operator.
   B.   Any operator having in his possession any abandoned motor vehicle from
a private tow shall immediately notify the Winter Park police department as to
the name of the operator and the location of the impound lot where the vehicle
is located and a description of the abandoned motor vehicle, including the
make, model, color and year, the number, issuing state and expiration date of
the license plate, and the vehicle identification number. Upon such
notification, the Winter Park police department shall ascertain, if possible,
whether or not the vehicle has been reported stolen and, if so reported shall
recover and secure the motor vehicle and notify its rightful owner and
terminate the abandonment proceedings under this chapter. The Winter Park
police department shall have the right to recover from the owner its reasonable
costs to recover and secure the vehicle.
   C.   The owner or lessee of real property or an agent authorized by the
owner or lessee may cause any vehicle, parked on such property without the
permission of the owner, lessee or occupant of the property, to be removed or
impounded by an operator, but, except on property used as a single-family
residence, only if the requirements of subsection B of this section have been
met. It is not necessary that a citation be issued for violation of parking on
private property contrary to section
4-3-4 of this title, for a vehicle to be removed or impounded pursuant to this
section.
   D.   Except on property used as a single-family residence, the owner, lessee
or occupant of real property or an agent thereof, prior to causing the removal
and impoundment of a vehicle from such person's property, shall provide clear
notice on signs or pavement markings meeting the requirements of section
4-3-3 of this title, that unauthorized vehicles will be towed away at the
owner's expense. (Ord. 158, Series of 1987)
4-4-6: INOPERABLE VEHICLES:
   A.   Any inoperable vehicle parked, stored or left or permitted to be
parked, stored or left upon any private property within the town for a period
longer than thirty (30) days constitutes a public nuisance. But nothing in this
section applies to an antique vehicle, a vehicle in an enclosed building, a
vehicle on the premises of a business enterprise that services and repairs such
vehicles, a vehicle in an appropriate storage place or depository maintained
for impounded vehicles, or a vehicle deemed inoperable solely because it lacks
a current license plate or validation sticker.
   B.   Whenever the town manager has probable cause to believe that an
inoperable vehicle is on private property in violation of subsection A of this
section, the manager shall follow the abatement procedures outlined in chapter
12 of this title. (Ord. 455, Series of 2012)
4-4-7: APPRAISAL; SALE:
   A.   Public tow motor vehicles or motor vehicles abandoned in an impound lot
subsequent to a public tow shall be appraised and sold by the Winter Park
police department or its designated representative at a public or private sale
held not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days after the date the
notice required by section
4-4-3 of this chapter was mailed.
   B.   If the appraised value of an abandoned motor vehicle sold pursuant to
this section is two hundred dollars ($200.00) or less, the sale shall be made
only for the purpose of junking, scrapping or dismantling such motor vehicle,
and the purchaser thereof shall not, under any circumstances, be entitled to a
Colorado certificate of title. The Winter Park police department shall cause to
be executed and delivered a bill of sale, together with a copy of the report
described in Colorado Revised Statutes 42-4-1604, to the person purchasing such
motor vehicle. The bill of sale shall state that the purchaser acquires no
right to a certificate of title for such vehicle. The Winter Park police
department shall promptly submit a report of sale, with a copy of the bill of
sale, to the department and shall deliver a copy of such report of sale to the
purchaser of the motor vehicle.
   C.   If the appraised value of a motor vehicle sold pursuant to this section
is more than two hundred dollars ($200.00), the sale may be made for any
intended use by the purchaser thereof. The Winter Park police department shall
cause to be executed and delivered a bill of sale, together with a copy of the
report described in Colorado Revised Statutes 42-4-1604 and an application for
a Colorado certificate of title signed by the Winter Park police department.
(Ord. 158, Series of 1987)
4-4-8: PROCEEDS OF SALE:
   A.   If the sale of any motor vehicle and its attached accessories or
equipment under the provisions of this chapter produces an amount less than or
equal to the sum of all charges of the operator who has perfected a lien
pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes 4-4-1607, then the operator shall have a
valid claim against the owner of record for the full amount of such charges,
less the amount received upon the sale of such motor vehicle. Such charges
shall be assessed in the manner provided for in subsection B1 of this section.
   B.   If the sale of any motor vehicle and its attached accessories or
equipment under the provision of this chapter produces an amount greater than
the sum of all charges of the operator who has perfected his lien pursuant to

      1.   The proceeds shall first satisfy the operator's charges as follows:
The cost of towing the motor vehicle with a maximum charge of fifty dollars
($50.00); the mileage for tows of greater than twenty five (25) miles one way,
to be computed at the rate of one dollar ($1.00) per mile for each mile in
excess of twenty five (25) miles one way; and the storage of the motor vehicle
to be charged at the rate of four dollars ($4.00) per day for a maximum of
sixty (60) days. In the case of a motor vehicle weighing in excess of ten
thousand (10,000) pounds, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply and
the operator's charges shall be determined by negotiated agreement between the
operator and the Winter Park police department.
      2.   Any balance then remaining shall be paid to the Winter Park police
department to satisfy the cost of mailing notices, having an appraisal made,
advertising and selling the motor vehicle and any other costs, taxes, fines,
and penalties due.
      3.   Any balance then remaining shall be forwarded to the department for
disbursal pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes 42-4-1610(2)(c) and (d).

if the town has entered a towing contract which provides for different charges
by the operator. (Ord. 158, Series of 1987)

4-12-8: INSPECTIONS; RIGHT OF ENTRY; EMERGENCIES:
   A.   When necessary to make an inspection to enforce this chapter, or when
an authorized representative of the town has reasonable cause to believe that
there exists upon any premises any condition which constitutes a nuisance under
this chapter, the town manager or designee may enter such building or premises
at all reasonable times to inspect the same or to perform any duty imposed on
any of them. If such building or premises is occupied, such person shall first
present proper credentials and request entry; and if such building or premises
is unoccupied, such person shall first locate the owner, occupant or other
person in control of the premises and, upon locating said owner, occupant or
person in control, shall present proper credentials and request entry.
If entry is refused, such person shall give the owner, occupant or person in
control (or, if said owner or occupant cannot be located after a reasonable
effort, leave at the building or premises) a twenty four (24) hour written
notice of intention to inspect. The notice given shall state that the property
owner, occupant or person in control has the right to refuse entry, and that in
the event that such entry is refused, inspection may be made only upon issuance
of a search warrant by a judge of a court having jurisdiction. When any of the
persons enumerated in this subsection has reasonable cause to believe that a
motor vehicle is an inoperable vehicle, such person may, upon the presentation
of proper credentials, lawfully request the owner or person having control of
such vehicle to demonstrate if the vehicle is capable of moving under its own
power. The owner or person having control of such vehicle may lawfully refuse
the request. If the request is refused, the person making the request shall
give the owner or person having control of the vehicle twenty four (24) hours
notice of intention to inspect in accordance with this subsection.
   B.   After the expiration of said twenty four (24) hour period from the
giving or leaving of the notice, the town manager or designee may appear before
the municipal judge and, upon a showing of probable cause, obtain a search
warrant entitling such person to enter the premises or motor vehicle. Upon
presentation of the search warrant and proper credentials, or possession of the
same in the case of an unoccupied building or premises, said person may enter
said premises or motor vehicle using such reasonable force as may be necessary
to gain entry. If the search warrant authorizes the entry into a motor vehicle
for the purpose of determining whether it is an inoperable vehicle, the person
executing such warrant may lawfully inspect the vehicle to determine if it is
capable of being operated under its own power.
   C.   For purposes of subsection B of this section, a determination of
probable cause shall be based upon reasonableness, and if a valid public
interest justifies the intrusion contemplated, then there is probable cause to
issue a search warrant. The person applying for such warrant shall not be
required to demonstrate specific knowledge of the condition of the particular
structure or premises in issue in order to obtain a search warrant.
   D.   When an emergency exists, the town manager or designee upon
presentation of proper credentials in the case of an occupied building or
premises, or possession of said credentials in the case of an unoccupied
building or premises, may enter into any building or go upon any premises
within the jurisdiction of the town. In an emergency, such persons may use such
reasonable force as may be necessary to gain entry into said premises.
   E.   It is unlawful for any owner, occupant or person in charge or control
of said building or premises to resist reasonable force used by the town
manager or designee.
   F.   An owner or occupant whose property may have located on it one or more
dangerous trees shall grant permission to the town manager to enter such
property for the purpose of immediate inspection of the trees located on such
property when at least one of the following events has occurred, provided that
if the owner or occupant refuses to grant such permission, the town manager
shall not enter the property without a valid warrant, except in emergencies as
set forth in subsection D of this section.
      1.   The owner or occupant has requested the inspection;
      2.   A neighboring landowner or occupant has reported a suspected
dangerous tree(s) and requested an inspection; or
      3.   The town manager has made a visual observation from other property
or a public right of way and has reason to believe that a dangerous tree(s)
exists on the property. (Ord. 467, Series of 2013)
4-12-9: ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES; FAILURE TO COMPLY:
   A.   The chief of police or designee is hereby authorized, in his or her
discretion, to cause any nuisance which is found to exist on private property
within the town to be abated in accordance with this chapter.
   B.   Any nuisance which presents such an imminent danger to life, limb,
property or health as to require immediate abatement, may be summarily abated
by action of the chief of police or designee. (Ord. 455, Series of 2012)
   C.   In the case of any nuisance not requiring summary abatement, the town
manager or designee may cause a notice to be served upon the person responsible
under this chapter for any nuisance.
      1.   The notice shall be in writing, signed by the town official issuing
the same, and shall be personally served upon the owner, occupant or person in
charge or control of the premises upon which said nuisance exists or, if not
occupied, then by posting the same prominently at some place on the premises
upon which said nuisance exists. If service is by posting, the property upon
which the nuisance exists shall be posted for a minimum of fourteen (14) days,
and a copy of the notice shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the owner of such property as shown upon the tax rolls of Grand
County, Colorado, at the address of such owner as therein shown. The notice
shall specifically describe the property where the nuisance is alleged to exist
and shall state that if the nuisance is not abated within the time stated in
the notice, the costs of abatement may be assessed as a lien against the
property, with an additional fifteen percent (15%) assessment for
administrative costs and the reasonable attorney fees incurred by the town in
abating the nuisance, and that such sums may be collected in the same manner as
property taxes. If the owner of the property is not personally served with a
copy of such notice, then a true copy of such notice shall be mailed by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner of such
property as shown upon the tax rolls of Grand County, Colorado, at the address
of such owner as therein shown.
      2.   The reasonable time for abatement shall not exceed fourteen (14)
days, unless: a) it appears from the facts and circumstances that compliance
could not reasonably be made within fourteen (14) days; or b) the nuisance
involves an inoperable vehicle which is dismantled or partially dismantled for
maintenance or repairs; or c) the nuisance involves a dangerous tree(s).
      3.   In the case of a nuisance involving an inoperable vehicle which is
dismantled or partially dismantled for maintenance or repairs, the reasonable
time for abatement shall not exceed thirty (30) days.
      4.   In the case of a nuisance involving a dangerous tree(s), the
reasonable time for abatement shall be extended to September 15 of the year in
which the notice is given, or if the notice is issued after August 15, to
September 15 of the following year. The notice for the abatement of dangerous
trees shall include town approved methods for the removal and destruction of
the dangerous trees. If the owner disputes that the property contains one or
more dangerous trees, the landowner shall notify the town manager of such
dispute within ten (10) days of receipt of the town manager's notice. If a
timely notice of dispute is given, the town shall not proceed with the
procedures in subsection D of this section until the town manager has met with
the owner in an effort to resolve the dispute. If the dispute cannot be
resolved at such meeting, or if the owner fails to appear at such meeting, the
town may proceed with the procedures in subsection D of this section. (Ord.
467, Series of 2013)
   D.   If, after notification as provided above, a nuisance is not voluntarily
abated, the following procedures shall apply:
      1.   When an owner fails to abate the nuisance within the time provided
in the notice, the town may institute proceedings in a court of competent
jurisdiction to obtain a judicial determination that such nuisance exists, to
abate such nuisance, to enjoin the nuisance and for such other and further
relief as necessary or proper, including, but not limited to, recovery of the
costs and expenses of abatement, including reasonable attorney fees.
      2.   Upon a judicial determination that a nuisance exists, the town
manager or designee is authorized to abate said nuisance, or cause the same to
be abated, employing such force as necessary to abate the nuisance.
      3.   The town shall have authority to engage the necessary assistance and
incur the necessary expenses for abatement of any nuisance, and to charge such
expenses to the person responsible for the nuisance. (Ord. 455, Series of 2012)
4-12-10: RESPONSIBILITY FOR COSTS OF ABATEMENT; COLLECTION; FAILURE TO PAY:
   A.   The person responsible for a nuisance shall be liable for all costs of
the abatement of such nuisance. Such costs may be collected by the town in any
action at law, in connection with any criminal proceeding, in connection with
any civil action to abate the nuisance, or they may be assessed against the
property.
   B.   If, after the expiration of the period of time provided for in said
notice, or as extended, costs or expenses are incurred by or on behalf of the
town in connection with the abatement of the nuisance, and such costs are not
otherwise collected, the finance director may thereafter certify to the town
clerk the legal description of the property upon which such work was done,
together with the name of the owner thereof as shown by the tax rolls of Grand
County, Colorado, and a statement of the work performed, the date of
performance and the costs thereof.
   C.   The town clerk shall mail a notice to the owner of said premises, at
the last known address of the owner, by first class mail, postage prepaid,
notifying such owner that work has been performed pursuant to this chapter,
stating the date of performance of the work, the nature of the work, and
demanding payment of the costs thereof (as certified by the finance director),
together with fifteen percent (15%) assessment for administrative expenses, and
the reasonable attorney fees incurred by the town in abating the nuisance. Such
notice shall state that if the total amount is not paid within thirty (30) days
after mailing the notice, it shall become an assessment on and lien against the
property, together with ten percent (10%) for costs of collection, and that the
whole amount will be collected in the same manner as property taxes.
   D.   If the clerk does not receive payment within thirty (30) days after
mailing the notice, the clerk shall inform the town council of such fact, and
the council shall thereupon assess the whole cost of such work, including a
charge of fifteen percent (15%) of said whole cost for administrative expenses
and the town's reasonable attorney fees incurred in the abatement of the
nuisance, upon the property, together with ten percent (10%) for costs of
collection.
   E.   Following such assessment, the clerk shall certify the same to the
county treasurer, who shall collect the assessment in the same manner as other
taxes are collected.
   F.   Each assessment shall be a lien against the property described in such
assessment until paid and shall have priority over other liens and assessments,
except general taxes and prior special assessments. (Ord. 455, Series of 2012)
4-12-11: REMEDIES CUMULATIVE AND NONEXCLUSIVE:
No remedy provided herein shall be exclusive, but the same shall be cumulative,
and the taking of any action hereunder, including charge or conviction of
violation of this chapter in the municipal court, shall not preclude or prevent
the taking of other action hereunder to abate or enjoin any nuisance found to
exist. (Ord. 455, Series of 2012)
4-12-12: VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES:
Each person shall be guilty of a separate offense for each and every day during
any violation of this chapter is committed, continued or permitted by such
person, and such person shall be punished as provided in title 1, chapter 4 of
this code. (Ord. 455, Series of 2012)

         d.   The insurance provided by the permittee shall be primary to
insurance carried by the Town and all other additional insureds, and the
principal defense of any claims resulting from the permittee's obligations
under the chapter shall rest with the permittee's insurer.
      2.   Certificate of Insurance:
         a.   The certificate of insurance provided by the permittee shall be
completed by the permittee's insurance agent as evidence that policies
providing the required coverages, conditions and minimum limits are in full
force and effect, and shall be reviewed and approved by the Town prior to the
issuance of a permit under this chapter. No other form of certificate shall be
used. The certificate shall identify the permit issued by the Town under this
chapter and the coverages afforded under the policies. The completed
certificate of insurance shall be sent to:
         Town of Winter Park
         Attn: Public Works Director
         P.O. Box 3327
         50 Vasquez Road
         Winter Park, Colorado 80482
         b.   It is the affirmative obligation of the permittee to notify the
Public Work's Director, within two (2) business days of the cancellation or
substantive change to any insurance policy required under this chapter, and
failure to do so shall constitute a violation of this chapter. Failure on the
part of the permittee to procure or maintain policies providing the required
coverages, conditions and minimum limits shall constitute a violation of this
chapter upon which the Town may immediately revoke the permit issued under this
chapter. The Town reserves the right to request and receive a certified copy of
any policy and any endorsement thereto.
   B.   Indemnification. Prior to the issuance of a permit under this chapter,
every permittee shall, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Town, its
officers, employees, agents and their insurers from and against all liability,
claims, costs, and demands on account of injury, loss or damage, including,
without limitation, claims arising from bodily injury, personal injury,
sickness, disease, death, property loss or damage, or any other loss of any
kind whatsoever, which arise out of or are in any manner connected with the
permit issued under this chapter, to the extent such injury, loss or damage is
attributable to the act, omission, error, professional error, mistake,
negligence or other fault of the permittee, the permittee's employees,
subcontractors or anyone else employed directly or indirectly by any one (1) of
them or by anyone for those acts any of them may be liable. The acceptance of a
permit shall constitute such an agreement by the permittee. This requirement
shall not extend or expand the liability of any quasi-municipal corporation
beyond the liability limitations established by Colorado law.
   C.   The permittee shall defend, investigate, handle, respond to and provide
defense for and defend against any such liability, claims or demands at the
sole expense of the permittee or, at the option of the Town, agree to pay the
Town or reimburse the Town for defense costs incurred by the Town in connection
with any such liability, claims or demands. The permittee shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, defend and bear all other costs and expenses related
thereto, including court costs and attorney fees, whether or not any such
liability, claims or demands alleged are groundless, false or fraudulent.
   D.   This indemnification provision is intended to comply with Section 13-
21-111.5(6), C.R.S. as amended, and shall be read as broadly as permitted to
satisfy that intent. (Ord, 629, Series of 2025)
5-2-4: GUARANTEE:
   A.   Each permittee, before being issued a permit, shall provide the Town,
at the permittee's expense, a guarantee. This guarantee shall be in the form of
cash or an irrevocable letter of credit from a financial institution and in a
form acceptable to the Town; provided, however, that no letter of credit shall
be required for projects where the Town's estimated cost of restoration is less
than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00).
   B.   This guarantee shall be in an amount equal to one hundred ten percent
(110%) of the Town's estimate of the cost of restoration. The cost of
restoration shall include, without limitation, the removal of defective work,
material, recompaction of subgrade and base material and construction of
surface improvements, as well as related traffic control, testing and
management. The irrevocable letter of credit shall run for a period of time of
at least two (2) years beyond the anticipated initial acceptance date of the
work identified in the permit. Such guarantees shall be extended if requested
by the Town.
   C.   The Town may waive the guarantee requirements for any owner of a
single-family residence desiring to repair his or her driveway or sidewalk,
provided that the owner performs the work personally and upon satisfactory
evidence to the Town that the permittee is competent to perform the work.
   D.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section,
any contractor performing work pursuant to a contract directly with the Town
shall adhere to the performance payment requirements set forth in the contract
documents. (Ord, 629, Series of 2025)
5-2-5: PURPOSE OF GUARANTEE:
   A.   The guarantee made hereunder shall serve as security for the
performance of work necessary to repair the public right-of-way if the
permittee fails to make the necessary repairs or to complete the work under the
permit.
   B.   The permittee, by receipt of the permit, expressly warrants and
guarantees complete performance of the work in a manner acceptable to the Town,
warrants and guarantees all work done by the permittee for a period of two (2)
years after the date of initial acceptance, and agrees to maintain upon demand
and to make all necessary repairs during the two (2)-year period. This
guarantee shall include, without limitation, all repairs and actions needed as
a result of:
      1.   Defects in the work, regardless of cause.
      2.   Defects in workmanship.
      3.   Settling of fills or excavations.
      4.   Any unauthorized deviations from the approved plans and
specifications.
      5.   Failure to barricade.
      6.   Failure to clean up during and after performance of the work.
      7.   Failure to complete the work within the time specified by the
permit.
      8.   Any other violation of this chapter or the ordinances of the Town.
   C.   The two (2)-year guarantee shall run from the date of the Town's
initial acceptance of the work. If repairs are required during the two (2)-year
period, those repairs need only be warranted until the end of the initial two
(2)-year period starting with the date of initial acceptance. It shall be the
responsibility of the permittee to obtain written notification from the Town of
final acceptance at the completion of the two (2)-year period.
   D.   The guarantee may be reduced to twenty percent (20%) of the Town's
estimate of the cost of restoration after the Town's initial acceptance of the
work.
   E.   At any time prior to completion of the two (2)-year guarantee period,
the Town may notify the permittee of any needed repairs. Such repairs shall be
completed within twenty-four (24) hours if the defects are determined by the
Town to be an imminent danger to the public health, safety and welfare.
Nonemergency repairs shall be completed within thirty (30) days after notice.
   F.   Letters of credit or cash deposited as a guarantee for individual
permits may be used by the Town to restore the right-of-way and adjacent
property. (Ord, 629, Series of 2025)
5-2-6: INSPECTIONS:
The permittee shall notify the Town prior to the commencement of the work. The
Town reserves the right to inspect the work at any time during construction and
excavation. In addition, after completion of work operations, the permittee
shall notify the Public Works Director, and an inspection shall occur. Initial
acceptance shall be made if all work meets Town and permit standards. Further,
approximately thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the two (2)-year
guarantee, the Town shall perform an additional inspection of the completed
work. The permittee shall be responsible for notifying the Town of the need for
the final inspection approximately thirty (30) days prior to the completion of
the two (2)-year period. If the work is still satisfactory, final acceptance
occurs, and the cash or letter of credit for individual permit holders shall be
returned, less any amounts needed to complete work not done by permittee. (Ord,
629, Series of 2025)
5-2-7: PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE:
A person who obtains a permit for construction, excavation or work in the
public right-of-way shall maintain a safe work area, free of nuisance
conditions. The Town may make any repair necessary to eliminate any hazards or
nuisances or work not performed as directed. Any such work performed by the
Town shall be completed and billed to the permittee at overtime rates. The
permittee shall pay all such charges within thirty (30) days of the statement
date. If the permittee fails to pay such charges within the prescribed time
period, the Town may, in addition to taking other collection remedies, seek
reimbursement through the guarantee. Furthermore, the permittee shall be barred
from performing any work in the public right-of-way, and under no circumstances
will the Town issue any further permits of any kind to said permittee, until
such time that all outstanding charges have been paid in full. (Ord, 629,
Series of 2025)
5-2-8: TIME OF COMPLETION:
All work covered by the permit shall be completed by the date stated on the
permit. A permit may be extended once for a period not longer than thirty (30)
days upon application submitted to the Public Works Director prior to the
deadline for completion stated on the permit. After the deadline for completion
and any approved period of extension the permit is void, and a new permit
application, including a new fee, must be filed and approved before completing
any remaining work. (Ord, 629, Series of 2025)
5-2-9: RELOCATION OF FACILITIES:
If at any time the Town requests the permittee to relocate its facilities in
order to allow the Town to make any public use of streets or rights-of-way, or
if at any time it shall become necessary because of a change in the grade or
for any other purpose by reason of the improving, repairing, constructing or
maintaining of any street or right-of-way, or by reason of traffic conditions,
public safety or by reason of installation of any type of structure or public
improvement by the Town or other public agency or special district, and any
general program for the undergrounding of such facilities, to move or change
the permittee's facilities within or adjacent to streets or rights-of-way in
any manner, either temporarily or permanently, the Town shall notify the
permittee, at least ninety (90) days in advance, except in the case of
emergencies, of the Town's intention to perform or have such work performed.
The permittee shall thereupon, at its sole cost and expense, accomplish the
necessary relocation, removal or change within a reasonable time from the date
of the notification, but in no event later than three (3) working days prior to
the date the Town has notified the permittee that it intends to commence its
work or immediately in the case of emergencies. Upon the permittee's failure to
accomplish such work, the Town or other public agencies or special district may
perform such work at the permittee's expense, and the permittee shall reimburse
the Town or other agency within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written
invoice. Following relocation, all affected property shall be restored to, at a
minimum, the condition which existed prior to construction by the permittee at
the permittee's expense. (Ord, 629, Series of 2025)
5-2-10: ENFORCED WORK STOPPAGE FOR VIOLATION:
   A.   In the event that any of the provisions of the approved plans or other
applicable criteria of the Town are violated by the permittee or by any of its
contractors or subcontractors, the Town may serve written notice of the Town's
intention to stop work on the project and the reasons therefor to the
permittee, the contractor and any surety. Unless the violations cease and
satisfactory arrangements for correction are made, the work will be stopped
forty-eight (48) hours after serving written notice. In the event of any such
termination, the Town shall immediately serve notice to the permittee, the
contractor and any surety. The surety shall have the right to take over and
finish the project, provided that, if the surety does not begin work within
thirty (30) days from the mailing date of the notice, the Town may, at its sole
discretion, take over the work and finish it at the expense of the permittee
and contractor. The permittee, contractor and the surety shall be liable to the
Town for all the costs caused by the termination of the work.
   B.   It may become necessary for the Town to immediately stop work on a
project to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Town.
Such instances may include, without limitation, creation of a public safety
hazard, lack of required permits, inadequate traffic control or obstructing an
emergency access. The Public Works Director or other representative of the Town
has the authority to stop the work immediately after serving the permittee with
written notice. The permittee shall not resume work without written approval
from the Town. (Ord, 629, Series of 2025)
5-2-11: PERMIT; REVOCATION, NOTICE:

This chapter shall be known and cited as the WINTER PARK STREET AND UTILITY
IMPROVEMENTS ORDINANCE. (Ord. 354, Series of 2005)
5-3-2: LEGISLATIVE DECLARATIONS:
   A.   The town council of the town of Winter Park hereby finds and declares:
(Ord. 354, Series of 2005)
      1.   The health, safety and welfare of the people of the town of Winter
Park are, in part, dependent upon the construction and maintenance of adequate
streets, drainage, irrigation systems, sanitary sewer and water facilities
(utilities). (Ord. 354, Series of 2005; amd. Ord. 358, Series of 2005)
      2.   There are properties in the town with inadequate, substandard or
nonexistent street and/or utilities improvements.
      3.   Development of the properties without the construction of adequate
streets or utilities will negatively impact the general health and safety
within the town. (Ord. 354, Series of 2005)
      4.   The cost of constructing adequate streets, irrigation systems and
utilities to complete the street and utility networks, are properly borne by
the owners of the properties served and benefitted by such street, irrigation
systems and utilities. (Ord. 354, Series of 2005; amd. Ord. 358, Series of
2005)
   B.   It is therefore declared to be the policy of the town that no
development shall be allowed in town unless and until provision has been made
for the construction of adequate streets and utilities to serve the properties
in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 354, Series of 2005)
5-3-3: STREET AND UTILITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS:
The town council during a regularly scheduled council meeting can by motion
direct the town engineer to prepare construction documents and cost estimates
to implement a street and/or utility improvement project. A street and/or
utility improvement project defined by the council can include such items as
subgrade, alignment, right of way, paving, curb and gutters, sidewalks, street
lighting, drainage systems, irrigation systems including construction,
relocation and/or restoration and utility improvements. Other costs borne by
the town such as engineering, surveying, obtaining permits, soil and material
testing and construction management will be an integral part of the cost of
undertaking an improvement project. (Ord. 354, Series of 2005; amd. Ord. 358,
Series of 2005)
5-3-4: DESIGN STANDARDS, SPECIFICATIONS AND PERMITS:
   A.   All improvement design and construction shall meet the "town of Winter
Park standards and specifications for design and construction" or the
applicable water and sanitation district's standards and specifications for
design and construction. All street improvement work shall be approved by the
town engineer and/or water and sanitation district.
   B.   Colorado department of transportation access permits will be required
if the subdivision is to access U.S. Highway 40. (Ord. 354, Series of 2005)
5-3-5: IMPROVEMENT PROJECT FEES:
There is hereby created the Winter Park improvement project fee, which shall be
calculated in the manner set forth in section
5-3-6 of this chapter. The improvement project fee shall be estimated at such
time as the town receives construction bids and/or town engineer estimates of
an improvement project defined by the town council. (Ord. 354, Series of 2005)
5-3-6: AMOUNT OF ESTIMATED FEE:
The amount of the improvement project fee applicable to each lot or tract shall
be determined by the town manager and shall be calculated by dividing the
estimated cost to the town of installing and constructing the improvements pro
rata among the benefitted properties on a per lot, square footage or street
frontage basis, or any combination of such methods, which, in the discretion of
the town manager and town council, most fairly allocates the cost of the
improvements among the benefitted properties. (Ord. 354, Series of 2005)
5-3-7: NOTICE OF INTENT TO IMPOSE FEE:
Prior to the commencement of construction of any improvement project for which
the town will impose an improvement project fee, the town shall give written
notice to the owners of all properties upon which the improvement project fee
will be imposed of the town's intent to commence such construction and to
impose the improvement project fee. Such notice shall state the estimated
amount of the improvement project fee and the available methods of payment
thereof. (Ord. 354, Series of 2005)
5-3-8: PROTEST OF IMPROVEMENT PROJECT FEE:
   A.   Any owner of property to whom notice of intent to impose an improvement
project fee is given pursuant to section
5-3-7 of this chapter may, within fifteen (15) days after the mailing of such
notice, submit a protest in writing to the town council.
   B.   Any written protest shall state, with particularity, the reasons why
the property owner contends that the imposition of the improvement project fee,
or the amount of the fee, is improper or inequitable.
   C.   The town council shall consider the protest at a regularly scheduled
council meeting. The town council may grant, deny, or grant in part and deny in
part, any protest. The town council's decision on the protest shall be made in
writing and shall be mailed to the property owner. (Ord. 354, Series of 2005)
5-3-9: PAYMENT OF FEE BASED ON ACTUAL COSTS:
   A.   Upon completion of the construction of the improvements, the town
manager shall calculate the final improvement project fee for each benefitted
property in the manner prescribed by section
5-3-6 of this chapter and shall send to each owner of benefitted property, by
certified mail, an invoice for the improvement project fee.
   B.   The improvement project fee shall be due and payable thirty (30) days
from the date the invoice is mailed provided, however, that the owner of any
benefitted property may delay payment of the improvement project fee until: 1)
such time as a building permit is requested for the construction or enlargement
of a structure on such owner's benefitted property, or 2) the eighth
anniversary of the mailing of the invoice described above, whichever event
comes first, at which time the owner shall pay the full amount of the
improvement project fee. If the property owner does not pay the full principle
amount within thirty (30) days of receiving the invoice described above,
interest will start accruing at seven percent (7%) per annum (compound
interest). The town manager shall notify property owners annually of the status
of their account.
   C.   The town shall have a lien placed upon the benefitted property as
security for the collection of all improvement project fees. The lien shall
become effective upon the mailing of the invoice described above and shall be
discharged upon payment of the improvement project fee and any accrued
interest. The town may, but is under no obligation to, record notice of such
lien in the records of the Grand County clerk and recorder so as to provide
notice to subsequent purchasers of the pendency of the lien.
   D.   Improvement project fees not paid when due may be collected by
foreclosure of the lien in the manner provided by law for mechanic's liens or
by submitting same to the Grand County treasurer for collection pursuant to
Colorado Revised Statutes sections 31-20-105 and 106. (Ord. 354, Series of
2005)
5-3-10: NO BUILDING PERMIT WITHOUT ADEQUATE STREETS AND/OR UTILITIES:
In no event shall the town issue a building permit for the construction or
enlargement of a structure on any property within the town's limits until
arrangements have been made, either pursuant to this chapter or by contract
approved by the town council, for the construction of adequate improvements to
serve such property. (Ord. 354, Series of 2005)
5-3-11: OTHER TOWN REGULATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS APPLICABLE:
The completion of an improvement project does not waive other town zoning,
subdivision, design review, and building regulations. A property owner may be
required to install other infrastructure improvements within or outside of a
right of way related to the development of the property. (Ord. 354, Series of
2005)

6-2-1: TITLE, AUTHORITY, PURPOSE, PHILOSOPHY AND COMPLIANCE:
   A.   Title: This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the TOWN OF
WINTER PARK SIGN CODE.
   B.   Authority: The regulations herein are authorized by title 31, article
23 of the Colorado Revised Statutes and are hereby declared to be in accordance
with all provisions of these statutes.
   C.   Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to establish a set of standards
for the fabrication, erection and use of signs, symbols, markings or
advertising devices within the town of Winter Park. These standards are
designed to protect and promote the health and safety of persons within the
community and to promote commerce and community identity while improving the
quality of the visual environment.
   D.   Philosophy:
      1.   Small well designed signs can visually communicate as well as, or
better than large signs.
      2.   A large number of signs tend to detract from and be detrimental to
the area in which they occur. The continuity of well designed signs can
contribute to the promotion of an image for the town.
      3.   Signs can be desirable elements in the environment when designs are
guided by consideration for the human, be it a motorist or pedestrian.
      4.   Signs shall be of quality design, using quality materials and sound
construction methods.
   E.   Compliance: All signs shall conform to all regulations of this chapter
unless specifically exempted therefrom as part of the site plan approval or
special review approval procedure outlined in title 7, chapter 7 of this code
(planned developments). Said signs shall comply with the following
requirements:
      1.   Every sign shall have a good scale and proportion in its design and
visual relationship to buildings and surroundings.
      2.   Every sign shall be designed as an integral architectural element of
the building and site to which it principally relates.
      3.   The colors, materials and lighting of every sign shall be restrained
and harmonious with the building site to which it principally relates. Signs
and banners must have colored backgrounds, white or light colors that would
appear white from fifty feet (50') away are prohibited.
      4.   The number of graphic elements on a sign shall be held to the
minimum needed to convey the sign's major message and shall be composed in
proportion to the area of the sign face.
      5.   Each sign shall be compatible with signs on adjoining premises and
shall not compete for attention or advertise product pricing.
      6.   Identification signs of a prototype design and corporation logos
shall conform to criteria for all other signs. (Ord. 440, Series of 2010)
6-2-2: CONSTRUCTION OF LANGUAGE AND DEFINITIONS:
   A.   Construction Of Language: The following rules of construction shall
apply to the text of this chapter:
      1.   The particular shall control the general.
      2.   In case of any difference of meaning or implication between the text
of this chapter and any caption, illustration, summary table, or illustrative
table, the text shall control.
      3.   The word "shall" is always mandatory. The word "may" is permissive.
      4.   Words used in the present tense shall include the future; and words
used in the singular number shall include the plural, and the plural the
singular, unless the context clearly indicates the contrary.
      5.   A "building" or "structure" includes any part thereof.
      6.   The phrase "used for" includes "arranged for", "designed for",
"maintained for" or "occupied for".
      7.   The word "person" includes any person, firm, partnership,
association, corporation, company or organization of any kind.
      8.   Unless the context clearly indicates the contrary, where a
regulation involves two (2) or more items, conditions, provisions, or events
connected by the conjunction "and, or, or either...or", the conjunction shall
be interpreted as follows:
"And" indicates that all the connected items, conditions, provisions, or events
shall apply.
"Or" indicates that the connected items, conditions, provisions or events shall
apply.
"Either...or" indicates that the connected items, conditions, provisions, or
events shall apply singly but not in combination.
      9.   The word "includes" shall not limit a term to the specified
examples, but is intended to extend its meaning to all other instances or
circumstances of like kind or character.
      10.   The word "free", other language or numerals advertising product
pricing is prohibited on permanent commercial signage as well as banners.

or changeable copy signs to present menus, specials, etc., will be exempt from
this prohibition.

   A.   Intent: It is the intent of this section to recognize that the eventual
elimination, as expeditiously as possible, of existing signs that are not in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter, is as much a subject of health,
safety and welfare as is the prohibition of new signs that would violate these

6-2-9: VARIANCES:
   A.   Intent Of Variance Provision: Variance from the terms of this chapter
shall be granted only when, because of special circumstances applicable to the

strict application of this chapter deprives such property privileges enjoyed by
other property in the vicinity, and under identical zoning classification and
other restrictions.
   B.   Authority Of Board Of Adjustment: The board of adjustment shall have
the authority to grant variances from the strict application of the rules,
regulations, and provisions of this chapter as follows:
      1.   Jurisdiction: Before the board of adjustment shall have jurisdiction
to grant a variance, the applicant must show that due to the peculiar shape,
size, location or topography of the property, there are unusual conditions
involved which would make the literal enforcement of the regulations of this
chapter result in the practical difficulties which are unnecessary for the
purpose of this chapter and which would deprive the subject property of
privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity in the same zoning
district classification and under the same sign ordinance restriction.
      2.   Limitations: Any variances which if granted, shall be subject to
such conditions as will assure that the adjustment thereby authorized shall not
constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the provisions
herein, and with the limitations on other properties in the vicinity in the
same zoning district and under the same ordinance restrictions in which the
subject property is located.
      3.   Minimum Adjustment: In granting the variance under the provisions of
this section, the amount of adjustment granted shall be the minimum necessary
to equalize the property rights. Conditions and safeguards shall be prescribed
in this chapter therewith as are necessary to protect the purpose and intent of
this chapter, the master plan of the town, and the general welfare of the
community.
      4.   Public Welfare: The granting of any variance shall not be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property improvements in
the vicinity. The board of adjustment shall ensure that the granting of a
variance will be compatible with the purpose and intent of this chapter, and
the master plan of the town, and will not be injurious to the public health,
safety and general welfare. (Ord. 440, Series of 2010)

about the notice to the town council within ten (10) days of posting the

a debt owed to the town of Winter Park by the owner of the sign and the owner
of the property. This debt may be recovered in an appropriate court action by

   A.   Authority, Purpose, Intent, Philosophy: This chapter shall be known and
may be cited as THE VILLAGE AT WINTER PARK PARCELS 1-A, 1-B, AND 1-C, VILLAGE
CENTER NEIGHBORHOOD SIGNAGE CODE.
      1.   Authority:
         a.   The regulations herein are authorized by all or portions of the
town of Winter Park, Colorado, ordinances 521 Series of 1998, 530 Series of
1998, 534 Series of 1998, 266 Series of 1998, 267 Series of 1998, 268 Series of
1998, and 304 Series of 2000 which are on file in the town offices.
         b.   The village at Winter Park architectural review committee
(hereinafter "the committee") shall be the governing body for the conditional
interpretation and administration of this chapter.
         c.   The Winter Park Village Master Association (hereinafter "the
Master Association") shall be the first agency of appeal of rulings by the
committee.
         d.   The town of Winter Park planning and zoning commission
(hereinafter "P&Z") shall grant final approval and permits conditional upon the
recommendations of the committee.
      2.   Purpose And Intent:
         a.   The purpose of this chapter is to establish a set of standards
for the fabrication, erection, and use of signs, symbols, markings, or
advertising devices on or adjacent to the buildings comprising the village at
Winter Park (hereinafter "village"; see definition of "village", in subsection
D of this section) parcels 1-A, 1-B, and 1-C, village center neighborhood that
are required by the buildings constructed therein (their owners, tenants,
occupants, patrons, etc.). These standards are designed to protect and promote
the health and safety of persons within the community and to promote commerce
and community identity while maintaining or improving the quality of the visual
environment.
         b.   This chapter shall not govern signage by and for Winter Park
recreational association (hereinafter "WPRA") or its parts, including all ski
area operations, except as it governs retail signage in the village.
         c.   This chapter shall not govern signage for traffic control and
other purposes such as are normally installed and maintained by municipal
authorities. Such signage shall be governed by existing municipal codes and
regulations.
         d.   Signage outside parcels 1-A, 1-B, and 1-C, village center
neighborhood shall be governed by the provisions of the sign code of the town
of Winter Park until such time as the village at Winter Park comprehensive sign
plan is submitted, approved, and adopted by the town of Winter Park.
         e.   The owner or the duly authorized agent of the village at Winter
Park shall provide a plan that identifies the general sign theme for the
village and shall make this information available to all tenants in the
village.
         f.   All signs related to the village at Winter Park shall provide a
continuity of design to the aggregate, shall be proportioned to the building
space allowed, and shall be compatible in design with each other. Such
continuity and proportion shall be subject to review by the committee. This
subsection A2f should not be construed as requiring all retail signs to be the
same. The individuality of business styles and objectives as expressed through
signage is encouraged by the committee.
      3.   Philosophy:
         a.   Signage is an integral part of creating a consistent visual
character for the village. The village is primarily a pedestrian environment,
intended to be experienced from a pedestrian point of view. Vehicles are used
only for service and for access to the village from elsewhere. It is integral
to the intent of this chapter to encourage signage to be designed with this in
mind.
         b.   The design of signage can make a positive contribution to the
resort atmosphere and can help tie the contemporary village to historical
precedents at the resort, in the valley, and throughout the Rocky Mountain
West.
         c.   Because the village is used by many new visitors as well as by
residents and employees, it is important that signs address the needs of
persons who are new to the village. In addition, signage must address the
changing conditions of use throughout the year, especially wintertime
conditions with inclement weather and a substantial buildup of snow.
         d.   Each type and piece of signage must be designed in recognition of
how it will be viewed and by whom. Signs for pedestrian recognition have
different requirements than those viewed from vehicles. In general, primary
complex and primary building identification signage will be viewed from
vehicles as well as by pedestrians, while individual retail identification
signage will be viewed by pedestrians and skiers.
         e.   Some signage has a decorative or marketing function, and some is
strictly functional and must meet specific code requirements. Despite these
differences, it is desirable to have visual continuity throughout the village.
Retail identification signs, however, add vitality if, within certain limits,
their design reflects the individual character of each business.
         f.   As a general rule, signage is most effective if it is simple and
direct, without excessive verbiage. Effective graphic design will promote
recognition and understanding of the purpose and content of each sign.
         g.   In order to fulfill these objectives, it is necessary to set
general guidelines for size, materials, and styles of all signage. This will
provide sufficient control for those types of signage (such as complex,
building, and retail identification signs) where individuality of design
character is desired.
         h.   Signs shall be of quality design using quality materials and
construction. They shall be designed to stand up to exposure in the mountain
environment.
   B.   Construction Of Language: The following rules of construction shall
apply to the text of this chapter:
      1.   The particular shall control the general.
      2.   In case of any difference of meaning or implication between the text
of this chapter and any caption, illustration, summary table, or illustrative
table, the text shall control.
      3.   The word "shall" is always mandatory. The word "may" is permissive.
      4.   Words used in the present tense shall include the future; and words
used in the singular number shall include the plural and the plural the
singular, unless the context clearly indicates the contrary.
      5.   A "building" or "structure" includes any part thereof.
      6.   The phrase "used for" includes "arranged for", "designed for",
"maintained for", or "occupied for".
      7.   The word "person" includes an individual, a corporation, a
partnership, an incorporated association, or any other similar entity.
      8.   Unless the context clearly indicates the contrary, where a
regulation involves two (2) or more items, conditions, provisions, or events
connected by the conjunctions "and, or, or either...or", the conjunction shall
be interpreted as follows:

   A.   Inspections And Maintenance Of Existing Signs:
      1.   Inspections:
         a.   All signs shall be subject to inspections by the committee.
      2.   Maintenance:
         a.   Every sign and sign structure, including those signs and sign
structures for which no permit or permit fees are required, shall be maintained
in good structural condition at all times. All such signs and sign structures
shall be kept neatly painted, including all metal parts and supports that are
not galvanized, or of rust resistant materials, or designated to be intended to
rust on the material submitted for approval of permit.
         b.   The committee shall inspect and have the authority to order
painting, repair, alteration, or removal of a sign or sign structure that shall
constitute a nuisance or hazard to safety, health, or public welfare by reason
of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence or abandonment, or which
shall constitute a hazard for any other reason.
   B.   Nonconforming Signs:
      1.   Intent: It is the intent of this section to recognize that the
eventual elimination, as expeditiously as possible, of existing signs that are
not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, is as much a subject of
health, safety, and welfare as is the prohibition of new signs that would
violate these regulations. It is also the intent of this section that any
elimination of nonconforming signs shall be effected so as to avoid any
unreasonable invasion of established property rights.
      2.   General Provisions:
         a.   A nonconforming sign may not be:
            (1)   Changed to another nonconforming sign.
            (2)   Structurally altered so as to extend its useful life.
            (3)   Expanded.
            (4)   Reestablished after discontinuance for ninety (90) days or
more.
            (5)   Reestablished after damage or destruction of more than fifty
percent (50%) of its present replacement value.
         b.   An owner of an existing nonconforming sign may, with approval by
the committee, maintain said sign as required by this chapter and may bring the
sign more into compliance with the ordinance with the understanding that the
sign is still nonconforming and subject to removal as defined in subsection D
of this section.
      3.   Amortization Requirements:
         a.   Amortization Schedule: All nonconforming signs shall conform to
provisions of this chapter by October 1, 2000.
         b.   Extensions: Extensions to the amortization schedule may be
granted by the committee for a maximum period of one year provided the
applicant for the extension shall demonstrate to the committee a genuine and
substantial attempt to comply with the provisions of this chapter, and there
are unusual conditions involved which would make the literal enforcement of the
regulations of the amortization schedule hereinabove result in practical
difficulties which are unnecessary for the purpose of this chapter. The
applicant for an extension shall submit the following information to accompany
the application for extension:
            (1)   Conformance: Information demonstrating bona fide attempt by
the applicant to bring the sign into conformance.
            (2)   Cost Estimates; Inability To Conform: If the applicant is
requesting a stay on economic hardship grounds, a thorough cost estimate
delineating the costs to conform and a statement of finances showing
applicant's inability to correct the sign.
            (3)   Process Of Conformance: A statement of what the applicant
intends to do during the period of stay to bring signs into conformance. The
committee recommends reasonable interpretation of the provisions.
            (4)   Appeals: Appeals shall be in accordance with the provisions
of subsection F of this section.
   C.   Variances:
      1.   Intent Of Variance Provision: Variance from the terms of this
chapter shall be granted only when, because of special circumstances applicable
to the property, including size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings,
the strict application of this chapter deprives such property of privileges
enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under identical zoning
classification and other restrictions by P&Z upon recommendation by the
committee.
      2.   Authority Of The Committee:
         a.   The committee shall have the authority to recommend variance
requests to P&Z for approval from the strict application of the rules,
regulations, and provisions of this chapter as follows:
            (1)   Jurisdiction: Before the committee shall have jurisdiction to
recommend variances to P&Z, the applicant must show that due to the peculiar
shape, size, location, or topography of the property, there are unusual
conditions involved which would make the literal enforcement of the regulations
of this chapter result in practical difficulties which are unnecessary for the
purpose of this chapter and which would deprive the subject property of
privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity in the same zoning
district classification and under the same sign code restriction.
            (2)   Limitations: Any variance which is granted shall be subject
to such conditions as will assure that the adjustment thereby authorized shall
not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the provisions
herein, and with the limitations on other properties in the vicinity in the
same zoning district and under the same ordinance restrictions in which the
subject property is located.
            (3)   Minimum Adjustment: In granting the variance under the
provisions of this section, the amount of adjustment granted shall be the
minimum necessary to equalize the property rights. Such conditions and
safeguards shall be prescribed in this variance as are necessary to protect the
purpose and intent of this chapter, the visual character of the village at
Winter Park and the general welfare of the community.
            (4)   Public Welfare: The granting of any variances shall not be
materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property
improvements in the vicinity. The committee shall ensure that the granting of a
variance will be compatible with the purpose and intent of this chapter and
will not be injurious to the public health, safety and general welfare.
   D.   Abatement And Removal Of Illegal Signs:
      1.   Abatement Of Signs Relating To Inoperative Activities:
         a.   Signs pertaining to activities or occupants that are no longer
using a property shall be removed from the premises, or sign copy on such signs
shall be obliterated within thirty (30) days after the associated enterprise or
occupant has vacated the premises. Any such sign not removed within the
required period shall constitute a nuisance and shall be subject to abatement.
         b.   The expense of such abatement shall be a lien against the
property on which the sign was maintained and a personal obligation against the
property owner. Said property owner shall first be served with a notice (sent
by the Master Association, via registered mail, to the applicant and address
listed on the permit application for said sign) to abate the nuisance and shall
be given the opportunity for a hearing. If, after such opportunity for hearing,
the committee directs its agents to remove the nuisance, they shall have
authority to enter upon the private property to remove the sign constituting
the nuisance.
         c.   New signs for building or property upon which an abandoned sign
is located shall not be approved until the abandoned sign is removed.
         d.   The provisions of this subsection may be utilized separately
from, as an alternative to, or in conjunction with any other remedy provided by
law.
      2.   Confiscation Of Illegal Signs:
         a.   Illegal signs may be confiscated by the committee if the property
owner does not remove the sign accordingly to this subsection D. The property
owner may retrieve said signs from the committee following the completion of
all legal actions.
   E.   Enforcement And Administration Of Provisions:
      1.   The Village At Winter Park Architectural Review Committee And The
Winter Park Village Master Association: The committee by itself or through the
Master Association shall adopt procedures for enforcement and administration of
this chapter and shall employ those persons necessary for such administration
and enforcement.
   F.   Appeals:
      1.   Appeals To The Master Association: Any person aggrieved by any
decision of the committee may take appeals to the Master Association. The
Master Association shall be the final arbiter of such appeals.
   G.   Violations And Penalties:
      1.   Violations: It shall be unlawful for any person(s) to erect,
construct, alter, move, use, or maintain any sign or structure or cause or
allow the same to be done contrary to, or in violation of, the provisions of
this chapter. (Ord. 304, Series of 2000)
      2.   Penalties: For each and every violation of the provisions of this
chapter, and for each and every day that such violation continues, said
violation shall be punishable as set forth in subsection 1-4-1C of this code.
Persons charged with a violation may include:
         a.   The owner, lessee, tenant, contractor, or any other persons using
the land, building, or premises where such violation has been committed or
exists.
         b.   Any person who knowingly commits, takes part, or assists in such
violation.
         c.   Any person who maintains any land, building, or premises in which
such violation exists. (Ord. 473, Series of 2013)

AFFORDABLE HOUSING
SECTION:
6-5-1: Affordable Housing Fees
6-5-2: Waiver Of Gross Square Foot Fee
6-5-3: Construction Of Affordable Housing In Lieu Of Fees
6-5-4: Individual Studies
6-5-1: AFFORDABLE HOUSING FEES:
The town shall collect the sum of three dollars ($3.00) for every gross square
foot of new construction (including applicable additions to existing
structures) that occurs within the town boundaries with the following
exceptions:
   A.   Parking garages and unenclosed decks/patios serving residential uses in
single-family, duplex, multi-family developments.
   B.   Parking garages and unenclosed decks/patios serving commercial uses.
These exempt areas are to be used to park vehicles and shall not be used for
storage, retail use or any other use.
All housing fees shall be paid in full with the application for a building
permit for new construction. All affordable housing fees collected by the Town
shall be maintained in a separate account and shall be used for the purpose of
providing affordable housing. (Ord. 333, Series of 2003; amd. Ord. 535, Series
of 2020)
6-5-2: WAIVER OF GROSS SQUARE FOOT FEE:
Certain individuals and/or families earning a low to moderate annual income may
not be subject to the three dollar ($3.00) per gross square foot fee.
Applicants seeking waiver of fees shall submit an application to the town
manager for the town of Winter Park or his designee for review and
recommendation to the Winter Park town council. The Winter Park town council
will make the final determination regarding the waiver of any or all of the
affordable housing fees. (Ord. 498, Series of 2016)
6-5-3: CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN LIEU OF FEES:
The affordable housing mitigation/incentive agreement form (attached as exhibit
B to ordinance 379, series of 2006) is hereby adopted by the town council of
the town of Winter Park as the standard form of agreement to be entered into by
the town with each and every property owner/developer within the town who
chooses to participate in the affordable housing incentive program approved by
the town. The town's incentive program will allow the deduction of the gross
square footage of the affordable housing unit from the gross square footage of
the entire structure prior to calculating the three dollar ($3.00) per square
foot affordable housing fee, and in addition shall provide an incentive of up
to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per unit to any owner/developer who
constructs and leases an affordable housing unit within his project. However,
should the use of the affordable housing unit ever change, the incentive must
be repaid to the town as well as the affordable housing fees for the affordable
housing unit gross square footage which were waived as part of the affordable
housing mitigation/incentive agreement. (Ord. 498, Series of 2016)
6-5-4: INDIVIDUAL STUDIES:
   A.   Request Of Study Or Report: An owner/developer may request that an
individualized study or report be made relating solely to his property or
project in order to determine whether or not affordable housing dedications or
exactions shall be required, and, if so, to determine the extent or amount
thereof. Such study or report shall be individualized to the owner's/
developer's property or project, shall fairly and accurately delineate the
needs for affordable housing which will be generated by the owner's/developer's
proposed project or improvement, and shall include consideration of the
following criteria:
      1.   Whether additional affordable housing would be required but for the
owner's/developer's proposed project or improvement;
      2.   Whether existing affordable housing can adequately serve the
proposed project without the additional expense to construct, expand or improve
affordable housing; and
      3.   Whether the town has historically required, or will require by
ordinance, other owners/developers to dedicate similar property or pay an
exaction of a similar type or in a similar amount.
The conclusion of such study or report shall contain a recommendation as to the
number and location of affordable housing units to be required. In determining
any such affordable housing to be required of owner/developer, a proportion
shall be established between the total cost of providing or expanding
affordable housing, on the one hand, and the amount or extent of such total
cost which is attributable to, or is caused or generated by, the proposed
development or improvement, on the other hand. The extent of dedication or
amount of exaction due from owner/developer must bear roughly the same
proportion to the total cost of providing affordable housing as the need for
such housing generated by the owner/developer's proposed project or improvement
bears to the general population's need for affordable housing.
   B.   Deposit: Any owner/developer may prepare or cause to be prepared, at
his sole cost and expense, the study or report described in subsection A of
this section. Said report shall be in writing and, upon the submission of such
study or report, owner/developer shall make an initial two thousand dollar
($2,000.00) deposit with the town clerk. Such deposit shall be used by the town
to offset the hourly costs incurred by the town planner and town attorney to
review the study or report described in subsection A of this section. The
town's actual review costs shall be paid by the owner/developer and as a
result, the cost to the owner/developer may be more or less than the initial
two thousand dollar ($2,000.00) deposit.
The staff shall review said study or report, and shall comment thereon in
writing to the town council. Any disagreement by the staff with any of the
findings or conclusions of such study or report shall be delivered in writing
to the town council and shall be specific to the project in question. In the
event of disagreement between the staff and owner/developer as to what
affordable housing units are required, the town council shall, after public
hearing, decide the appropriate number of affordable housing units based upon
the owner/developer's and staff's separate studies or reports. The decision of
the town council shall be final, subject only to the right of owner/developer
to appeal the same to the Grand County district court.
   C.   Staff Report: Upon the express request of the owner/developer, which
request shall be made in writing, the Winter Park staff shall, upon the payment
of a fee to be determined by the town manager, undertake the study described in
subsection A of this section. The staff shall submit such written report to the
owner/developer as well as the town council.
The owner/developer may agree with the provisions thereof, in which case the
same shall be submitted to the town council as a joint finding and
recommendation. However, if the owner/developer disagrees with all or any part
of the staff's report, the owner/developer may, at his sole expense, submit a
written report detailing the owner/developer's findings with regard to the
criteria set forth in subsection A of this section, and shall submit the same
to the town council. The town council shall consider such reports at a public
hearing and shall ultimately decide whether an exaction or dedication is
required, and if so, the extent or amount of such exaction or dedication. The
decision of the town council shall be final, subject to the owner/developer's
right to appeal to the Grand County district court.
   D.   Criteria For Determination: In deciding whether to impose an affordable
housing dedication or exaction requirement, the town council shall consider
those questions and criteria identified in subsections A1, A2 and A3 of this
section, and shall be guided by the overriding principle that an exaction or
dedication requirement is unfair, disproportionate and unconstitutional if it
imposes a burden on an owner/developer which in equity and fairness should be
borne by the public in general. However, any exaction or dedication requirement
will be in compliance with all existing constitutional tests if the failure of
the owner/developer to provide the dedication or exaction would fail to remedy
a public problem created or exacerbated by the owner/developer's proposed
project to such an extent that the town council would be justified in denying
approval for the project altogether. (Ord. 297, Series of 2000)
   E.   Compliance With Ordinance A Condition Precedent To Rezoning Or Plat
Approval: No rezoning, subdivision approval, or planned unit development
approval shall be final unless and until the owner/developer has selected one
of the procedures outlined above and the report required has been provided to
the town council. No rezoning, subdivision approval, or planned unit
development approval shall be deemed final unless and until the town council
has made a determination as to whether or not an affordable housing dedication
or exaction requirement shall be imposed, and if so, the extent or amount
thereof. Any person, individual, or entity which commences development of a
property, or attempts to obtain a permit to develop property, prior to the
determination required in this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and
shall be punished as provided in subsection 1-4-1C of this code. In addition to
said remedy, the town may seek and obtain either a stop work order or an
injunction against the continuation or completion of any construction or
preconstruction activity on a project or improvement until the determinations
required herein have been made. (Ord. 473, Series of 2013)

   B.   Ensure that the impact fees established by this chapter are based on,
and do not exceed, the cost of providing additional capital improvements
necessitated by new development.
   C.   Regulate new development projects to ensure that they bear a rough
proportionate share of the cost of capital expenditures necessary to provide
adequate emergency services within the town.
   D.   Assure that the impact fees implemented in this chapter are linked to a
capital improvements program designed to provide the facilities and equipment
for which the impact fees are being imposed. (Ord. 316, Series of 2001)
6-6-2: DEFINITIONS:
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT: A. Includes:
      1.   Fire protection or emergency medical, rescue and ambulance service

personnel costs or operational expenses.
DEVELOPER: A person or entity that commences a development activity requiring
additional emergency services and development approval.
DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY REQUIRING ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY SERVICES: Any activity
requiring development approval that requires additional capital improvements as

shall be based upon the net increase in the impact fee for the new use as
compared to the previous use.
DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL: The approval of any building permit for a development
activity requiring additional emergency services, for which an impact fee has
not been previously paid following the effective date hereof.
EMERGENCY SERVICES PROVIDER: A governmental entity providing public fire

mathematically calculates the fiscal impact of future demand for services on
existing facilities of the applicable emergency service provider, as approved
by ordinance of the town council.
IMPACT FEE: A fee for fire protection or emergency medical, rescue and
ambulance service established by section
6-6-4 or
6-6-5 of this chapter. (Ord. 316, Series of 2001)

   A.   Payment Of Fee Required: Any developer who seeks a building permit for
a development activity requiring additional emergency services is required to
pay an impact fee in the manner and amount set forth in this chapter.
   B.   Exception: The town council, by resolution, may grant a waiver from all
or any part of the impact fee, upon a finding that such waiver is in the best
interest of the public by encouraging activities that provide significant
social, economic or cultural benefits. Such activities may include, but are not
limited to, affordable housing projects or other projects that are financially
assisted with town funds. (Ord. 316, Series of 2001)
6-6-4: FEE AMOUNT:
   A.   The amount of any impact fee to be charged shall be set and revised
from time to time by ordinance of the town council, based on a fiscal impact
fee study to be conducted by the applicable emergency services provider, or
through an individual study pursuant to section
6-6-5 of this chapter. (Ord. 353, Series of 2005)

(Ord. 488, Series of 2014)
6-6-5: INDIVIDUAL STUDY:
In lieu of computation of the impact fee established by ordinance of the town
council, based on a fiscal impact fee study, the developer may provide an
individualized study or report as provided herein.
   A.   Study Or Report: An owner/developer may prepare or cause to be
prepared, at his sole cost and expense, an individualized study or report
relating solely to his property or project, in order to determine whether or
not an emergency services impact fee shall be required, and, if so, to
determine the extent or amount thereof. Such study or report shall be
individualized to the owner/developer's property or project, shall fairly and
accurately delineate the needs for emergency services which will be generated
by the owner/developer's proposed project or improvement, and shall include
consideration of the following criteria:
      1.   Whether additional emergency services would be required but for the
owner/developer's proposed project or improvement;
      2.   Whether existing emergency services can adequately serve the
proposed project without the additional expense to construct, expand or improve
emergency services; and
      3.   Whether the town has historically required, or will require by
ordinance, other owners/developers to pay an exaction of a similar type or in a
similar amount;
The conclusion of such study or report shall contain a recommendation as to the
emergency services required. In determining any such level of emergency
services to be provided to owner/developer, a proportion shall be established
between the total cost of providing or expanding emergency services, on the one
hand, and the amount or extent of such total cost which is attributable to, or
is caused or generated by, the proposed development or improvement, on the
other hand. The extent or the amount of exaction due from owner/developer must
bear roughly the same proportion to the total cost of providing emergency
services as the need for such services generated by the owner/developer's
proposed project or improvement bears to the general population's need for
emergency services.
   B.   Provider Review: The emergency services provider shall review said
study or report, and shall comment thereon in writing to the owner/developer.
Any disagreement by the emergency service provider with any of the findings or
conclusions of such study or report shall be delivered in writing to the owner/
developer and shall be specific to the project in question.
   C.   Public Hearing: In the event of disagreement between the emergency
service provider and owner/developer as to what emergency services are
required, the Winter Park town staff shall review the study or report and
provide the town council with a finding and recommendation. The town council,
after public hearing and review, shall decide the appropriate level of
emergency services based upon the emergency service provider's and owner/
developer's separate studies or reports. The decision of the town council shall
be final, subject only to the right of owner/developer to appeal the same
through legal action. Any such review by the Winter Park town staff may be
subject to review costs paid by the owner/developer for actual staff review
time. (Ord. 316, Series of 2001)
6-6-6: TIME FOR PAYMENT OF IMPACT FEE:
A developer requesting approval of a development activity requiring additional
emergency services shall pay the impact fee to the emergency services provider
prior to any issuance of a building permit by the town. (Ord. 316, Series of
2001)
6-6-7: COMPLIANCE A CONDITION PRECEDENT TO APPROVAL:
No approval of a development activity requiring additional emergency services
shall be deemed final unless and until the emergency services provider has made
a determination as to whether or not an emergency services impact fee shall be
imposed, and if so, the extent or amount thereof.
No building permit for a development activity requiring additional emergency
services shall be approved or issued by the town until written verification is
provided to the town from the emergency services provider indicating that the
impact fee has been paid or satisfied.
Any person, individual, or entity which commences a development activity
requiring additional emergency services, or attempts to obtain a development
approval, prior to the determination required in this chapter shall be punished
as provided in subsection 1-4-1C of this code. In addition to said remedy, the
town may seek and obtain either a stop work order or an injunction against the
continuation or completion of any construction or preconstruction activity on a
project or improvement until the determinations required herein have been made.
(Ord. 473, Series of 2013)
6-6-8: UNPAID IMPACT FEES:
The town reserves the right to withhold or revoke any permits, certificates, or
other approvals for any land or building for which the payment of impact fees
is delinquent. (Ord. 316, Series of 2001)
6-6-9: CREDIT FOR IMPROVEMENTS:
Upon approval by the town council, the applicable emergency service provider
shall calculate the amount of any credit that shall be granted to any developer
for the amounts due or to become due for capital improvements installed,
purchased, and paid for by such developer when such capital improvements offset
the need or amount of the impact fee that would otherwise be required. (Ord.
316, Series of 2001)
6-6-10: USE OF IMPACT FEES:
   A.   All impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited
by the applicable emergency service provider, in an interest bearing account
which clearly identifies the category, account, or fund of capital expenditure
for which such charge was imposed. Each such category, account, or fund shall
be accounted for separately. The emergency service provider shall determine
whether the accounting requirement shall be by category, account, or fund and
by aggregate or individual land development. Any interest or other income
earned on monies deposited in said interest bearing account shall be credited
to the account.
   B.   Impact fees shall be used exclusively for capital improvements.
   C.   No impact fees shall be used for periodic or routine maintenance,
personnel costs, or operational expenses.
   D.   In the event bonds or similar debt instruments are used to fund capital
improvements prior to collecting the necessary impact fees, once collected,
impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt
instruments.
   E.   The town may enter into an intergovernmental agreement with the
applicable emergency service providers regarding the method of collection and
administration of the impact fee program. (Ord. 316, Series of 2001)
6-6-11: ADJUSTMENT AND REVIEW OF IMPACT FEES:
The amount of the impact fee set by ordinance of the town council based on a
fiscal impact fee study shall be reviewed and adjusted as follows:
   A.   The emergency service provider may, in conjunction with an updated
fiscal impact fee study and following consultation with the town, present any
further adjustments to the impact fee during the town's annual budget process
that occurs every fall.
   B.   No less frequently than every five (5) years, the applicable emergency
service provider shall provide an updated fiscal impact fee study and shall
forward a copy of said update to the town. (Ord. 316, Series of 2001)
6-6-12: LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION:
East Grand fire protection district shall indemnify, defend and hold the town
and its officers, agents and employees harmless from and against any and all
claims or liability arising from the town's enactment of this chapter pursuant
to requiring the payment of fire protection service impact fees, or the use by
East Grand fire protection district of any funds collected as fire protection
service impact fees pursuant to this chapter. This indemnification shall
include, but not limited to, any legal action by any party contesting this
chapter on the grounds of unconstitutionality, lack of authority, preemption by
state law, or an alleged violation of section 20 of article X of the Colorado
constitution.
East Grand fire protection district shall also indemnify, defend and hold the
town, and its officers, agents and employees, harmless from and against any and
all claims arising from any breach or default in the performance of the
obligations on East Grand fire protection district's part to be performed under
the provisions of this chapter, or arising from any intentional acts,
negligence or omissions of East Grand fire protection district or any of its
officers, agents, and employees. Such indemnification by East Grand fire
protection district, as provided in this section, shall include all costs,
attorney fees, expenses and liabilities incurred in the defense of any claim or
any action or proceeding brought on any such claim. Provided, however, nothing
contained herein waives or is intended to waive any protections that may be
applicable to East Grand fire protection district under the governmental
immunity act, section 24-10-101 et seq., Colorado Revised Statutes, or any
other rights, protections, immunities, defenses or limitations on liability
provided by law, and subject to any applicable provisions of the Colorado
constitution and applicable laws. In the event the town is named as a party in
any legal action, in consultation with the town, East Grand fire protection
district shall select legal counsel to represent the town in such action. (Ord.
316, Series of 2001)
CHAPTER 7
FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
SECTION:
6-7-1: Statutory Authorization, Findings Of Fact, Purpose And Methods
6-7-2: Definitions
6-7-3: General Provisions
6-7-4: Administration
6-7-5: Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction
6-7-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS:
   A.   Statutory Authorization: The legislature of the state of Colorado has
in Colorado Revised Statutes 31-23-201 et seq., delegated the responsibility of
local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood
losses. Therefore, the town council of the town of Winter Park, state of
Colorado, does ordain as follows.
   B.   Findings Of Fact:
      1.   The flood hazard areas of the town of Winter Park are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      2.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage.
   C.   Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      1.   Protect human health and life;
      2.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      3.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      4.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      5.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
      6.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
      7.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a
flood area.
   D.   Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses: In order to accomplish its purpose,
this chapter uses the following methods:
      1.   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
      2.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      3.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
      4.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
      5.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (Ord. 424, Series of 2009)
6-7-2: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted to give them the meanings they have in common usage and to give
this chapter its most reasonable application:
ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING: Flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or
similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high
velocity flows; active processes or erosion, sediment transport, and
deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) chance or greater
chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet (3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM).
After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of
the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30,
VE, or V.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of
equipment or materials.
ELEVATED BUILDING: For insurance purposes, a nonbasement building which has its
lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear
walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing
construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) was completed before the original
effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by the
community.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final grading or the pouring
of concrete pads).
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of a community on which the
federal emergency management agency has delineated both the areas of special
flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided by the federal emergency
management agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation
of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary-floodway map.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
   B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any
source.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas
within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal
barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying
works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventative measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to,
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, and floodplain management
regulations.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations,
building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as
floodplain ordinances, grading ordinances and erosion control ordinances), and
other applications of police power. This term describes such state or local
regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for flood
damage prevention and reduction.
FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by
water from any source (see definition of Flood Or Flooding).
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY (REGULATORY FLOODWAY): The channel of a river or other watercourse and
the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a
designated height.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to construction, immediately next to the proposed walls of the structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is:
   A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. department of interior) or preliminarily
determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the national register;
   B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district;
   C.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states
with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary
of the interior; or
   D.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
      1.   By an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the
interior; or
      2.   Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved
programs.
LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such
an enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirements of section 60.3 of the national
flood insurance program regulations.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the
national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures
for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date
of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management
purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle, which is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis;
   B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
   C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck; and
   D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: For other than new construction or substantial
improvement under the coastal barrier resources act (Pub. L. 97-348), includes
substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The "actual start" means either
the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as
the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the "actual start of construction"
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank, that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions; or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this chapter
when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance,
therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited
by this chapter. (For full requirements see section 60.6 of the national flood
insurance program regulations.)
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic
vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas. (Ord. 424, Series of 2009)
6-7-3: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Lands To Which This Chapter Applies: This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the town of Winter
Park.
   B.   Basis For Establishing The Areas Of Special Flood Hazard: The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the federal emergency management agency in a
scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study For The
Town Of Winter Park", dated January 2, 2008, with accompanying flood insurance
rate maps and flood boundary-floodway maps (FIRM and FBFM) and any revisions
thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
chapter.
   C.   Establishment Of Floodplain Development Permit: A development permit
shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
   D.   Compliance: No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered,
or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations.
   E.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   F.   Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      1.   Considered as minimum requirements;
      2.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   G.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions
greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade
or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the community or by any official or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 424, Series of 2009)
6-7-4: ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Designation Of Floodplain Administrator: The town engineer is hereby
appointed the floodplain administrator to administer and implement the
provisions of this chapter and other appropriate sections of 44 CFR (national
flood insurance program regulations) pertaining to floodplain management.
   B.   Duties And Responsibilities Of The Floodplain Administrator: Duties and
responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be
limited to, the following:
      1.   Floodplain administrator will supply the town planner with originals
of all records pertaining to this chapter. Town planner shall serve as official
custodian of all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter. Town
planner shall maintain and hold open for public inspection all records
pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.
      2.   Review permit applications to determine whether a proposed building
site, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe
from flooding.
      3.   Review, approve, or deny all applications for development permits
required by adoption of this chapter.

agencies (including section 404 of the federal water pollution control act
amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334) from which prior approval is required.
      5.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.
      6.   Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the state
coordinating agency which is Colorado water conservation board, prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the federal emergency management agency.
      7.   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained.
      8.   When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance
with subsection 6-7-3B of this chapter, the floodplain administrator shall
obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and
floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to
administer the provisions of section
6-7-5 of this chapter.
      9.   When regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain
administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and
AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the community.
      10.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12, of the
national flood insurance program regulations, a community may approve certain
development in zones A1-30, AE, AH, on the community's FIRM which increases the
water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot (1'), provided
that the community first applies for conditional FIRM revision through FEMA
(conditional letter of map revision).
   C.   Permit Procedures:
      1.   Application for a floodplain development permit shall be presented
to the floodplain administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may include,
but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location,
dimensions, and elevation of the proposed landscape alterations, existing and
proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the
location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard.
Additionally, the following information is required:
         a.   Elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures;
         b.   Elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which any
nonresidential structure shall be floodproofed;

architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure shall meet the
floodproofing criteria of subsection 6-7-5B2 of this chapter;
         d.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural
drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development;
         e.   Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with
subsection B1 of this section.
      2.   Approval or denial of a development permit by the floodplain
administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the
following relevant factors:
         a.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         b.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         c.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         d.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         e.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         f.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems;
         g.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site;
         h.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         i.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
         j.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
for that area.
   D.   Variance Procedures:
      1.   Appeal Board To Hear Requests: The appeal board as established by
the community shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
      2.   Appeal Board To Hear Appeals: The appeal board shall hear and render
judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any
requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in
the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
      3.   Aggrieved By Decision Of Appeal Board: Any person or persons
aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal such decision in the
courts of competent jurisdiction.
      4.   Records; Reports: The floodplain administrator shall maintain a
record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the
federal emergency management agency upon request.
      5.   Historic Structures: Variances may be issued for the reconstruction,
rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, or the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to
the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
      6.   Lot Size: Variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in
subsection C2 of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justifications required
for issuing the variance increase.
      7.   Conditions Of Variance: Upon consideration of the factors noted
above and the intent of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purpose and objectives of this chapter (subsection 6-7-1C of this chapter).
      8.   Within Designated Floodways: Variances shall not be issued within
any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
      9.   Repair Or Rehabilitation Of Historic Structure: Variances may be
issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
      10.   Prerequisites For Granting Variances:
         a.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         b.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            (1)   Showing good and sufficient cause;
            (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
            (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
         c.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      11.   Functionally Dependent Use: Variances may be issued by a community
for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development
necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
         a.   The criteria outlined in subsections D1 through D9 of this
section are met, and
         b.   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety. (Ord. 424, Series of 2009)
   E.   Penalties: No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed,
located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms
of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions
of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with
conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this
chapter shall upon conviction thereof be punished as provided in subsection 1-
4-1C of this code. Nothing herein shall prevent the town from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord. 473,
Series of 2013)
6-7-5: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
   A.   General Standards: In all areas of special flood hazard the following
provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements:
      1.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed
(or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
      2.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      3.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.
      4.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
      5.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
      6.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge
from the systems into floodwaters; and
      7.   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      8.   When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain
administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and
AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the community; and
      9.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12, of the
national flood insurance program regulations, a community may approve certain
development in zones A1-30, AE, AH, on the community's FIRM which increases the
water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot (1'), provided
that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA
(conditional letter of map revision).
   B.   Specific Standards: In all areas of special flood hazard where base
flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in: 1) subsection 6-7-3B of
this chapter, or 2) subsection 6-7-4B8 of this chapter, or 3) subsection C3 of
this section, the following provisions are required:
      1.   Residential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered
professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification
to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as
proposed in subsection 6-7-4C1a of this chapter is satisfied.
      2.   Nonresidential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base
flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect
shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for
the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction
are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this
subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator.
      3.   Enclosures: New construction and substantial improvements with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for the parking of
vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement and
which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
         a.   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1')
above grade.
         c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      4.   Manufactured Homes:
         a.   Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on
a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which
minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes
must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to: use of over
the top, or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
         b.   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: 1)
outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, 2) in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision, 3) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision, or 4) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a
flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
         c.   Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially
improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within
zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the
provisions of this subsection B4 be elevated so that either:
            (1)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the
base flood elevation, or
            (2)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced
piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no
less than thirty six inches (36") in height above grade and be securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement.
      5.   Recreational Vehicles: Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either:
         a.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days,
         b.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
         c.   Meet the permit requirements of subsection 6-7-4C1 of this
chapter, and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes"
in subsection B4 of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.
   C.   Standards For Subdivision Proposals:
      1.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured
home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with subsections 6-7-1B, C and
D of this chapter.
      2.   All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development
permit requirements of subsections 6-7-3C and 6-7-4C of this chapter and the
provisions of this section.
      3.   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development including the placement of
manufactured home parks and subdivisions which are greater than fifty (50) lots
or five (5) acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to
subsection 6-7-3B or 6-7-4B8 of this chapter.
      4.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured
home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce
exposure to flood hazards.
      5.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured
home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage.
   D.   Standards For Areas Of Shallow Flooding (AO/AH Zones): Located within
the areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 6-7-3B of this
chapter are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special
flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet (3') where
a clearly designed channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions
apply:
      1.   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified).
      2.   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures:
         a.   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified); or
         b.   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads or effects of buoyancy.
      3.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit
certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in subsection 6-7-4C1a of this chapter, are satisfied.
      4.   Require within zone AH or AO adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
   E.   Floodways: Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard
established in subsection 6-7-3B of this chapter are areas designated as
floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion
potential, the following provisions shall apply:
      1.   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      2.   If subsection E1 of this section is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this section.
      3.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12, of the
national flood insurance regulations, a community may permit encroachments
within the adopted regulatory floodways that would result in an increase in
base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a
conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA. (Ord. 424, Series of 2009)

8-1-2: COLLOCATION:
   A.   The intent of collocation is to have several providers of WCFs use the
same structure or site to keep the number of WCFs to a minimum as a means of
reducing the overall visual impacts throughout the community. If collocation is
a practical alternative to the construction of a new tower, then collocation is
required. Upon request by the Town, the owner or operator shall provide
evidence explaining why collocation is not possible.
   B.   If it is practical to attach WCFs to water towers, existing
transmission towers, or existing buildings, or light or utility poles, then
such locations shall be used instead of new towers. (Ord. 558, Series of 2021;
amd. Ord. 575, Series of 2022)
8-1-3: DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR WALL-MOUNTED AND ROOF-MOUNTED FACILITIES:
   A.   Wall-mounted WCFs shall be placed on or within a building or structure,
such as on the side of a building or parapet wall, architectural tower or
cupola, in an architecturally consistent manner. Wall-mounted WCFs that are not
concealed within a building or structure shall be of a neutral color that is
identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting building
or structure to which they are attached, so as to minimize their visual
impacts.
   B.   Where possible, wall-mounted, or roof-mounted WCF shall be disguised as
an architectural feature or design element of a building, provided that the
feature is compatible in terms of architectural style, height, mass, scale, and
color; and reasonably screens the facility from ground level view.
   C.   Wall-mounted WCFs may not extend above the parapet wall, or, in the
case of a pitched roof, above the fascia.
   D.   The maximum height of a roof-mounted WCF is the shorter of:
      1.   Twenty feet (20') taller than the building to which it is attached;
or
      2.   Ten feet (10') taller than the maximum height allowed in the
district for a principal building.
   E.   Rooftop antennas shall either be:
      1.   Mounted to a penthouse;
      2.   Set back such that they are not visible from ground level on
adjacent rights-of-way or residential uses or districts at a distance of one
hundred feet (100') or less; or
      3.   Reasonably screened from ground level view and designed in a manner
which is compatible with the materials, colors, and architectural details of
the existing building or structure.
   F.   Roof-mounted WCFs that extend more than ten feet (10') from the roof
location where they are mounted shall be set back from building walls no less
than one foot (1') per foot above the tenth foot that the facility extends
above the top of the building. This requirement may be waived only if the
applicant demonstrates that it materially impedes the function of the facility.
   G.   Equipment that does not depend upon an elevated location to operate
shall be located within a building, an underground enclosure, or an enclosure
at ground level that is screened from view from all abutting properties,
streets, and trails. (Ord. 558, Series of 2021; amd. Ord. 575, Series of 2022)
8-1-4: LOCATION AND DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW TOWERS:
   A.   Towers are not allowed:
      1.   Within, or closer than two hundred fifty feet (250') to residential
district boundaries; or
      2.   In the DC district.
   B.   The minimum setback of a tower from the property line shall be:
      1.   The setback applicable to principal structures in the district in
which the tower is located, plus one foot (1') per foot that a tower extends
above the maximum building height for the district; or
      2.   An alternative setback, approved by the Director for stealth
facilities where the facility replaces or proposes an accessory structure to an
established principal use, to include, without limitation, signs, light poles,
and flagpoles, where it is evidenced that the siting and location of the
stealth facility with the alternative setback substantially camouflages or
conceals the presence of the tower and antennas and has less visual impact than
would be achieved by applying the principal structure setback.
   C.   No tower shall be constructed within eight thousand feet (8,000') of
any pre-existing tower unless it is demonstrated that no additional
telecommunication providers can be accommodated on the existing tower or on any
other existing buildings or facilities. Tower separation shall be measured by
following a straight line from the base of the proposed tower, which is closest
to the base of any pre-existing tower. The Director may reduce the separation
requirements only if it is demonstrated that:
      1.   There are no available buildings, light or utility poles, or water
towers on which antennas may be located and still provide the approximate
coverage that the tower is intended to provide.
      2.   The pre-existing tower that is within eight thousand feet (8,000')
of the proposed tower cannot be modified to accommodate another provider; and
      3.   It is technologically impossible to locate the proposed tower on
available sites more than eight thousand feet (8,000') from a pre-existing
tower and still provide the approximate coverage the tower is intended to
provide.
   D.   All new towers shall be designed to accommodate the collocation of
additional providers and must comply with the following:
      1.   New towers of a height of eighty feet (80') or more shall be
designed to accommodate collocation of a minimum of two (2) additional
providers, either outright or through reasonable future modification to the
tower.

request for a modification of an existing tower or base station which
substantially changes the physical dimensions of such tower or base station if
it complies with this Section.
   B.   A substantial change in the height of an existing tower or base station
occurs where any of the following criteria are found:
      1.   For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, it
increases the height of the tower by more than ten percent (10%) or by the
height of one (1) additional antenna array with separation from the nearest
existing antenna not to exceed twenty feet (20'), whichever is greater; for
other eligible support structures, it increases the height of the structure by
more than ten percent (10%) or more than ten feet (10'), whichever is greater;
         a.   Changes in height should be measured from the original support
structure in cases where deployments are or will be separated horizontally,
such as on buildings' rooftops; in other circumstances, changes in height
should be measured from the dimensions of the tower or base station, inclusive
of originally approved appurtenances and any modifications that were approved
prior to the passage of the Spectrum Act.
      2.   For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, it
involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude
from the edge of the tower more than twenty feet (20'), or more than the width
of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater;
for other eligible support structures, it involves adding an appurtenance to
the body of the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by

but not to exceed four (4) cabinets; or, for towers in the public rights-of-way
and base stations, it involves installation of any new equipment cabinets on
the ground if there are no pre-existing ground cabinets associated with the
structure, or else involves installation of ground cabinets that are more than
ten percent (10%) larger in height or overall volume than any other ground
cabinets associated with the structure;
      4.   It entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site;
      5.   It would defeat the concealment elements of the eligible support
structure; or
      6.   It does not comply with conditions associated with the siting
approval of the construction or modification of the eligible support structure
or base station equipment, provided however, that this limitation does not
apply to any modification that is non-compliant only in a manner that would not
exceed the thresholds identified in subsection (1) through (4) of this
definition.

9-2-3: Allowable Recovery Costs
9-2-4: Method For Calculating Recoverable Costs
9-2-5: Documentation And Recording Of Recovery Obligations

9-2-9: Termination of Recoveries
9-2-10: Alternative Method
9-2-1: FINDINGS:
   A.   The town council hereby finds and determines that expansion of land use
and development within the town results in impacts upon public facilities and
improvements and necessitates the construction and expansion of new public
facilities, improvements, and services, including arterial and collector
streets and bridges; water and sewer facilities; schools; pedestrian areas and
community and neighborhood parks; police and fire services; drainageways;
parking facilities; and other town facilities, improvements, and services
(collectively, "public improvements").
   B.   The town council further finds and determines that it is appropriate
and fair to require new development, not current citizens, to bear such
proportionate share of the cost of the public improvements the town determines
are reasonably necessitated by and of reasonable benefit to new development.
   C.   The town council further finds and determines it is fair, reasonable,
and equitable for the town to plan for public improvements for the efficient
and logical development of land within the town and to recover at or prior to
development the cost of such public improvements from the properties benefitted
by such improvements.
   D.   The town council additionally finds that new public improvements
increase the value of and enhance the development potential of adjacent
properties. (Ord. 550, Series of 2021)
9-2-2: RECOVERY OF COSTS OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   The town shall have the authority to allocate and recover the costs of
construction of public improvements to property owners based on the benefit of
such improvement to said owners. Said recovery costs shall be paid to the town
by the benefitted property owner and forwarded to the party constructing the
improvement. Subject to the provisions of section
9-2-5(A)(5), below, where the construction of the improvement has been financed
in whole or in part by a property owner or owners, and the financed amounts
exceed the amount of benefits the owner or owners will realize from the
improvement so financed, the town shall assume or recover the amount of such
excess costs and reimburse the financing owner or owners to the extent the
amount financed exceeds the benefits received.
   B.   As part of a preliminary plat application for any land within the town,
the town may determine the public improvements that are reasonably necessitated
by and that are of reasonable benefit to the land being developed. The town
shall have the authority to establish and administer a program to recover from
benefitted property owners the costs incurred by the town or other party in
providing those public improvements, which may include:
      1.   The cost of right-of-way acquisition and construction of streets,
including traffic signals, street lights, and traffic signs.
      2.   Costs incurred for the acquisition, construction and servicing of
drainageways.
      3.   The cost of locating or relocating above-ground or underground
utilities.
      4.   Costs incurred for the acquisition, development, and furnishing of
neighborhood and community parks, public open spaces, trails, and other
recreational facilities in excess of normal development requirements.
      5.   Costs incurred for the acquisition, development, construction, and
furnishing of such other town facilities or services that the town determines
are reasonably necessary to serve, and of reasonable benefit to, new
development.
   C.   The town council shall provide by ordinance for the recovery of
appropriate costs for public improvements constructed or to be constructed by
the town. Said ordinance shall establish the nature and extent of the
recoveries due to the town. Such ordinances may include provisions for simple
interest payable to the town.
   D.   In the case of improvements financed by the town with the proceeds of
special assessment bonds, the town may forward any costs recovered under this
chapter to the owners or developers previously assessed for the costs of the
improvements. In the case of a property owner or developer who has elected to
pay an assessment in installments and who is also owed costs recovered, this
may be accomplished by an adjustment to the periodic payment owing, or in any
other manner that the town council deems just.
   E.   The town may require a developer to provide and install public
improvements sufficient to serve surrounding lands that the town determines are
necessary for sound service planning and future property development. The town
shall collect from the owners of those properties benefitted by such
improvements such amounts that the town by ordinance determines to be
reasonable and in proportion to the benefits to such properties. From such
collection, the town shall reimburse the party who installed the public
improvement. (Ord. 550, Series of 2021)
9-2-3: ALLOWABLE RECOVERY COSTS:
Costs that are recoverable pursuant to this chapter shall be limited to the
actual costs of materials, labor, equipment, acquisition of rights-of-way and
easements, including condemnation costs, engineering services, and other costs
directly related to the construction of the improvements. A developer's costs
for the administration of contracts, license fees, attorney fees, overhead, and
other administrative, indirect costs shall be considered as the cost of doing
business and shall not be included in recovery costs. (Ord. 550, Series of
2021)
9-2-4: METHOD FOR CALCULATING RECOVERABLE COSTS:
   A.   The town shall establish cost recovery for public improvements based
upon the benefit to the development. Such methods may include comparative area
or distance of a development benefited by a public improvement, comparative
population or housing density of the development benefited by the public
improvement, the trip generation rate, or other methodology for calculating
approximate use of the public improvements, and such other methods as the town
may establish from time to time that are based upon the reasonable benefit
conferred on a development by a public improvement. Cost recovery obligations
shall be based on the following:
      1.   Street Improvements. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2)
below, the owner or developer of property abutting a street constructed and
paid for by another party shall pay a proportionate share of the cost of said
street, determined as follows:
         a.   For streets up to forty-eight (48) feet in width, as measured
from flowline to flowline, exclusive of acceleration and deceleration lanes,
the owner or developer shall be required to pay fifty percent (50%) of the cost
of the improvements, including street pavement, subbase, storm sewer and other
appurtenances, right-of-way costs, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, and acceleration
and deceleration lanes adjacent to the development.
         b.   For streets that exceed forty-eight (48) feet in width, as
measured from flowline to flowline, exclusive of acceleration and deceleration
lanes, the owner shall pay for the cost of constructing twenty-four (24) feet
of street improvements, plus the cost of curb, gutter, sidewalk, and any hiker/
biker trails, plus the cost of any required acceleration and deceleration lanes
adjacent to the development. On designated arterial streets, the town shall
fund cost of construction of the remaining portion of the street.
         c.   All drainage and other conduit structures constructed as an
integral part of the street shall be considered to be street improvements, and
the cost of those improvements may be allocated using the same method as
allocating the cost of street improvements. The calculation of recovery costs
for other drainage facilities, including storm drainage facilities that are not
an integral part of the street construction, shall be established on a case-by-
case basis, using a method based upon reasonable benefit to the property.
         d.   The following minimum standards on storm drainage facilities must
be met in order for a project to receive consideration for recovery: closed
conduit; designed to be able to be used by other properties within the basin;
and designed to handle developed flows.
      2.   Bridges, Overpasses and Interchanges. The cost of any bridge,
overpass, interchange, or similar street improvement involving grade-separated
facilities may be assessed on an area or acreage basis, if council finds that
the benefits of a particular improvement are enjoyed by a larger group of
property owners than the abutting property owners.
   B.   In the event the town determines that a development is reasonably
benefitted more than under the minimum recovery methods above, the town may
calculate an alternate method to determine reasonable benefit and recovery
costs for a development, provided that there shall be recovered no more than
one hundred percent (100) of the costs of public improvements, plus applicable
interest.
   C.   All agreements or ordinances created in connection with the
construction of a public improvement for which costs have been allocated
pursuant to this chapter shall be recorded with the Grand County Clerk and
Recorder as a matter of public record. It is the responsibility of every
developer to identify those recovery agreements that pertain to their
developments. (Ord. 550, Series of 2021)
9-2-5: DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDING OF RECOVERY OBLIGATIONS:
   A.   Developer-Constructed Improvements.
      1.   An agreement between the town and a developer for cost recoveries
may be included within the development improvement agreement in accordance with
the provisions of this Title 9 or may be executed separately with approval by
town council resolution.
      2.   All such cost recovery agreements for developer-constructed
improvements shall include a listing of those properties to be charged with
cost recovery for the improvement(s). The developer shall also provide within
the same time period a cost estimate of the improvements. The town shall review
and approve for recording all such agreements that include provisions for cost
recovery for the benefit of private developers, provided, however, it shall be
the responsibility of the developer to record such agreements, and any effect
on the developer's ability to recover costs, pursuant to the developer's
failure to appropriately record such agreement or include a sufficient legal
description for the properties to be charged with cost recovery, shall be the
sole responsibility of the developer.
      3.   Any such agreement may include a provision for simple interest. The
town council shall, by resolution, establish the interest rate to be applied to
recovery costs. The interest shall be applied to the principal only, based on
one-year increments, or fractions thereof. The maximum amount of allowable
accrued interest for any recovery agreement is fifty percent (50%) of the
original cost of the public improvement
      4.   The town manager shall be empowered to execute such agreements on
behalf of the town.
      5.   In each such agreement, the town shall require that the developer or
his successors notify the town in the event that there is a change in the payee
of recovery fees collected for disbursement by the town. This notice shall be
provided no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of the change
in payee. This notification shall include the new payee, the payee's address, a
description of the event resulting in the change of the payee, and the
effective date of the change in payee. The notice shall be signed by someone
legally authorized to bind the transferor. The town shall send collected
recovery fees to the payee of record, as described in this paragraph. If, due
to lack of notice by the payee, the town is unable to ascertain the identity or
location of the payee within sixty (60) days after receipt of the recovery
fees, such fees shall revert to the town, and the town may declare the
agreement terminated and deposit the undisbursed recovery fees in the town 's
general fund for town use.
      6.   Prior to the town's acceptance of any public improvements
constructed by a developer, the developer shall furnish the town with one set
of reproducible, as-built drawings and a final statement of construction costs
for those improvements subject to recovery in a format acceptable to the town.
The town shall review the developer's final statement of construction costs
and, upon the town 's approval, said final statement of construction costs
shall be recorded by the developer, which thereafter shall be the schedule of
recovery costs that the town will follow in administering the cost recovery
agreement pursuant to section
9-2-8 below.
      7.   The developer benefitting from any cost recovery agreement approved
by the town pursuant to this section (the "developer-beneficiary") shall pay a
fee to the town for the preparation, recordation, and administration of the
agreement as specified in Section
1-8-2 of this code.
      8.   The town's duty and liability in connection with the administration
of a cost recovery agreement pursuant to this section shall be limited as
follows. In administering such agreements:
         a.   The town shall exercise reasonable care to collect such amounts
due the developer-beneficiary, but the town shall not be responsible or liable
for any amounts not actually paid to the town by the responsible party. The
developer-beneficiary shall have no cause of action against the town, other
than to recover any amounts actually collected and on deposit with the town.
         b.   The town shall not be deemed to be acting as an agent or
fiduciary of the developer-beneficiary or the responsible party. It shall be
the exclusive responsibility of the developer-beneficiary to monitor and
enforce the payment provisions of the agreement.
         c.   In the event of non-payment by a responsible party, the
developer-beneficiary, in its capacity as principal third-party beneficiary of
the agreement, shall have as its exclusive remedy the right to bring a cause of
action against the defaulting responsible party. Such action shall be brought
within one year from the date the developer-beneficiary knew, or should have
known in the exercise of due diligence, of the default.
         d.   The limitations set forth above shall be deemed as incorporated
into every cost recovery agreement to be administered by the town.
   B.   Cost Recovery for Town-Constructed Public Improvements. All cost
recovery obligations for town-constructed public improvements shall be
established by ordinance. The ordinance shall include a list of properties to
be charged with cost recovery for the town-constructed public improvement. The
ordinance establishing such cost recovery related to a town-constructed
improvement shall be recorded with the Grand County Clerk and Recorder. If
available, the ordinance shall include a final statement of construction costs
for the improvements subject to recovery. Otherwise, the ordinance may include
an estimate of construction costs for the improvements to be constructed, and a
final statement of construction costs for the improvements shall be recorded as
soon as practical following the completion of the improvements. After the final
statement of construction costs for town -constructed or town -paid public
improvements has been recorded, the town shall thereafter recover such costs
pursuant to the provisions of section
9-2-8 below. (Ord. 550, Series of 2021)
9-2-6: INCLUSION OF RECOVERY COSTS IN FINAL PLAT:
All final plats shall contain a section entitled "recovery costs," which shall
contain a list of the public improvements previously constructed on which the
proposed development will be required to pay recovery costs and the areas of
benefit, if applicable, and the town recording information for the ordinance
and agreement that established the recovery costs. Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing to the contrary, the development shall also be responsible for any
recovery costs established subsequent to the approval of the final plat.
However, no recovery cost obligation shall be invalid against a development if
it is undiscovered and/or inadvertently omitted from the final plat. (Ord. 550,
Series of 2021)
9-2-7: RECORDATION AND LIEN:
   A.   The agreement or ordinance that sets forth the public improvements, the
costs thereof, the areas of benefit, and the method of recovery of costs shall
be filed and recorded with the Grand County Clerk and Recorder.
   B.   From the date of recording of any cost recovery agreement for
developer-constructed public improvements, or a cost recovery ordinance for
town-constructed public improvements, each of the records shall create a first
and prior lien upon the properties benefited in the amount of the costs of the
public improvements determined by the town attributable to the property, as
provided by Title 3, Chapter 2, of this code. At its discretion, the town may
allow the lien to become junior to the lien of deed(s) of trust executed by the
landowners to secure loans to finance the construction of public improvements
on the property. (Ord. 550, Series of 2021)
9-2-8: PAYMENT OF RECOVERY COSTS:
All recovery costs shall be due and payable at the time of the recording of a
final plat for the applicable property, or at such time as application is made
for a building permit for the applicable property, whichever occurs first. The
town may withhold building permits on property within the area of benefit until
recovery costs are paid. In the event an owner desires to proceed with
development of a portion of his property based on a phased development plan,
the owner may proceed after paying that portion of the recovery costs and
making provision for payment of the remainder satisfactory to the town. (Ord.
550, Series of 2021)
9-2-9: TERMINATION OF RECOVERIES:
Upon receipt of an application by an owner previously entitled to receipt of
cost recoveries or on its own motion, the town may terminate a recovery for a
public improvement, if the costs of the public improvements have been
substantially recovered, if ten years have passed, if the project may be more
effectively financed by another method, or for such other good cause as the
town may determine. (Ord. 550, Series of 2021)
9-2-10: ALTERNATIVE METHOD:
This chapter is intended to establish an alternative method for the financing
of public improvements for lands that will be reasonably benefited thereby and
the provisions hereof shall not be construed to limit the power of the town to
utilize any other lawful method for accomplishing this purpose. (Ord. 550,
Series of 2021)
