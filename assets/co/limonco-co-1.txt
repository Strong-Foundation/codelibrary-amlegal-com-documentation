§ 10.002 ESTABLISHING GENERAL RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   Construction of words. Whenever any word in any section of this code
importing the plural number is used, in describing or referring to any matters,
parties or persons, any single matter, party or person shall be deemed to be
included, although distributive words may not have been used. When any subject
matter, party or person is referred to in this code by words importing the
singular number only, or the masculine gender, several matters, parties or
persons and females as well as males and bodies corporate shall be deemed to be
included.
   (B)   Officers and employees. Whenever reference is made in this code to a

mean the officer or employee of the town having the title mentioned or
performing the duties indicated.
   (C)   Liability. No provision of this code designating the duties of any
officer or employee shall be so construed as to make such officer or employee
liable for any fine or penalty provided in this code for a failure to perform
such duty, unless the intention of the Board of Trustees to impose such fine or
penalty on such officer or employee is specifically and clearly expressed in
the section creating the duty.
(Prior Code, § 111.2) (Ord. 411, passed 1-2-1997)
§ 10.003 REPEALING CLAUSE.
   (A)   Repeal of general ordinances. All general codes and ordinances of the

conduct, duties, service or rates of public utilities shall be repealed by
virtue of the passage of this code of ordinances or by virtue of the preceding
section, excepting as this code may contain provision for such matters, in
which case this code shall be considered as amending such ordinance or
ordinances in respect of such provisions only.
   (C)   Pending suits.
      (1)   (1)   No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a
former ordinance, whether such former ordinance is expressly repealed or not,
as to any offense committed against such former ordinance or as to any act
done, any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued
or claim arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect
any such offense or act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or
punishment so incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new
ordinance takes effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform
to the ordinance in force at the time of such proceeding, so far as
practicable.
         (b)   If any penalty, forfeiture or punishment be mitigated by any
provision of a new ordinance, such provision may be, by the consent of the
party affected, applied to any judgment announced after the new ordinance takes
effect.
      (2)   This section shall extend to all repeals, either by express words
or implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance making any new
provisions upon the same subject or in any other ordinance.
      (3)   Nothing contained herein shall be construed as abating any action
now pending under or by virtue of any general ordinance of the town herein
repealed; or as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any penalty
accrued or to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm or
corporation, or as waiving any right of the town under any ordinance or
provision thereof in force at the time of the passage of this code of
ordinances.

complaint shall be filed with the Town Clerk no later than 30 days after the
violation is discoverable.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a complaint, the Town Clerk must send notice to the
respondent. The respondent has 30 days from the date of the notice to cure the
allegations in the complaint or to respond to the complaint. In responding to
the complaint, the respondent may request that the hearing officer dismiss the
complaint for one or more of the reasons listed in this division (B). If the
respondent neither cures the allegations during the 30-day cure period, nor
requests that the complaint be dismissed, the Town Clerk must appoint an
independent hearing officer who is not an officer or employee of the town. The
hearing officer may dismiss, in his or her discretion, a complaint that does
not specifically identify the section of the FCPA that the respondent allegedly
violated or a complaint that does not assert facts sufficient to support the
alleged violations. The dismissal is final and subject to review by the
district court. If the hearing officer does not dismiss the complaint, the Town

request the submission of additional evidence and arguments.
   (E)   The hearing office must determine by a preponderance of the evidence
is a violation of this section has been committed. Upon a finding against a
respondent, the hearing officer must enter a decision and order any necessary
relief. In the case of a violation of C.R.S. § 1-45-117, appropriate relief
shall be an order from the hearing officer directing the person who made or
caused to be made the
contribution or expenditure in violation of that section to reimburse the fund
of the town from which the moneys were diverted for the amount of the
contribution or expenditure and any other such relief as may be appropriate.
The decision of the hearing officer is final and subject to review by the
District Court. The Town Clerk and the hearing officer are not necessary
parties to the review.
   (F)   Where necessary, the Town Clerk may promulgate any rules necessary for
the proper administration of campaign finance complaints, cures and hearings,
including, but not limited to, any rules to ensure the complaint, cure and
hearing process is simplified and a scalable process designed to enhance the
just, speedy and efficient determination of complaints.

      (3)   The proceeds of this use tax shall be paid to the town periodically

a deposit for payment of the tax levied by this section an amount equal to 2%
of 50% of the estimated cost of the improvement, or 2% of 50% of the total

supplies and equipment for which such tax may be due, subject to such rules and

at the time of the completion of the building, dwelling or other structure of
improvement from the invoices and statements reflecting the purchase therefor,
that the deposit made as herein required, together with the actual payments to
the town as a sales tax, is in excess of the actual tax due therefor, the
person making said deposit or paying said tax may make application to the Board
of Trustees or its designated agents for refund of any amount paid in excess of
the actual taxes due, in which event it shall be the duty of the person making
such application to furnish all necessary bills and invoices evidencing over-
payment of the tax and, if the Board or its designated agent, is satisfied that
there has been such overpayment, the sum shall be refunded to the taxpayer.

certificate of occupation as issued by the Building Department whichever event
first occurs. All other requests for refund which do not involve a construction

which the exemption is claimed. Such application must be supported by the
affidavit of the contractor, purchaser or user accompanied by the original paid
invoices or sales receipts and a certificate issued by the seller, together
with such further information as may be requested by the town or its designated
agents.
         (b)   An application for refund of sales or use tax paid under dispute

thereon.
      (3)   Hearing. An aggrieved applicant may, within ten days after such
decision is mailed to him or her, petition the town for a hearing on the claim
in which case the town, or its designated agents, shall, upon notice to the
applicant, hold a hearing upon such application, taking such information or
evidence as may be material, and shall, thereafter, render its final decision
upon such application. The decision of the town must be issued within 90 days
of the hearing. If the applicant remains aggrieved, he or she is entitled to
request or participate in the alternative dispute resolution procedure as set
forth below.
(Prior Code, § 723.15)
   (P)   Use tax - alternative dispute resolution procedure; deficiency notice
or claim for refund.
      (1)   The taxpayer may elect a state hearing on the town’s final decision
on a deficiency notice or claim for refund pursuant to the procedure set forth
in this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, the term STATE HEARING means a hearing
before the Executive Director of the Department of Revenue or delegate thereof
as provided in C.R.S. Title 29, Art. 2, § 106.1(3), as amended.
      (3)   When the town asserts that use taxes are due in an amount greater
than the amount paid by a taxpayer, the town shall mail a deficiency notice to
the taxpayer by certified mail. The deficiency notice shall state the
additional use taxes due. The deficiency notice shall contain notification, in
clear and conspicuous type, that the taxpayer has the right to elect a state
hearing on the deficiency pursuant to C.R.S. § 29-2-106.1(3), as amended. The
taxpayer shall also have the right to elect a state hearing on the town’s
denial of such taxpayer’s claim for a refund of use tax paid.
      (4)   The taxpayer shall request the state hearing within 30 days after
the taxpayer has exhausted all local remedies. The taxpayer shall have no right
to such hearing if he or she has not exhausted local remedies or if he or she
fails to request such hearing within the time period provided for in this
section. EXHAUSTION OF LOCAL REMEDIES shall mean:
         (a)   The taxpayer has timely requested in writing a hearing before
the town and such town has held such hearing and issued a final decision
thereon in accordance with division (O) above. Such hearing shall be informal
and no transcript, rules of evidence or filing of briefs shall be required; but
the taxpayer may elect to submit a brief, in which case the town may submit a
brief. The town shall hold such hearing and issue the final decision thereon
within 90 days after the town’s receipt of the taxpayer’s written request
therefor, except the town may extend such period if the delay in holding the
hearing or issuing the decision thereon was occasioned by the taxpayer, but, in
any such event, the town shall hold such hearing and issue the decision thereon
within 180 days of the taxpayer’s request in writing therefor; or
         (b)   The taxpayer has timely requested in writing a hearing before
the town and the town has failed to hold such hearing or has failed to issue a
final decision thereon within the time periods prescribed in division (P)(4)(a)
above.

the taxpayer may request a state hearing on such deficiency notice or claim for
refund, and such request shall be made and such hearing shall be conducted in
the same manner as set forth in C.R.S. § 29-2-106.1(3) through (7), as amended.
      (6)   If the deficiency notice or claim for refund involves only the
town, in lieu of requesting a state hearing, the taxpayer may appeal such
deficiency notice or denial of a claim for refund to the County District Court
as provided in C.R.S. § 29-2-106.1(8), as amended; provided that, the taxpayer
complies with the provisions set forth in division (P)(4) above.
      (7)   If the town reasonably finds that the collection of the use tax
will be jeopardized by delay, the town may utilize the procedures set forth in
C.R.S. § 39-21-111, as amended.

discretion, are necessary or desirable.
   (B)   Such resolution, when adopted, shall be of the same force and effect
as if incorporated in this section.
   (C)   The amount of charges for garbage, rubbish, waste material and ashes
collection service shall be assessed on the monthly utility bill. In case such
assessment is not paid within a reasonable time specified by ordinance, it may
be certified by the Town Clerk to the County Treasurer who shall collect the
assessment, together with a 10% penalty for cost of collection, in the same
manner as other taxes are collected. The laws of the state for assessment and
collection of general taxes, including the laws for the sale and redemption of
property for taxes, shall apply to the collection of such assessments.
   (D)   (1)   Ground level; within 20 feet; in containers. The rates for
collection and disposal of refuse placed for collection at ground level, not
more than 20 feet distant from the side of the street or alley from which
collection is made, and in approved refuse containers shall be as follows.
         (a)   Single dwelling units. For single dwelling unit, $17.88 per
month, which charge shall be added to the monthly utility bill.
         (b)   Multiple unit dwellings and mobile home parks. For dwellings of
two dwelling units or more or mobile home parks of two mobile home spaces or
more, $9.01 per occupied dwelling unit or mobile home space per month if
collection service is provided at one site at said multiple unit dwelling or
mobile home park. The owner of a multiple unit dwelling or such mobile home
park shall report said occupancy to the Town Clerk on or before the fifteenth
day of each month. Any dwelling unit or mobile home space occupied for ten or
more days during a month shall be reported as occupied for that particular
month. In the event the owner fails to file said report as herein required, the
monthly fee shall be based upon 100% occupancy of the multiple unit dwelling or
mobile home park for the month. In the event collection service is provided a
multiple unit dwelling or mobile home park at more than one site, the fee shall
be the same as that for single dwelling units for each occupied dwelling unit
or mobile home space. Said charges shall be added to the monthly water bill.
Any mobile home park consisting of only one mobile home space shall be deemed a
single dwelling unit for the purposes of this code.
         (c)   Commercial.
            1.   For each business location, other than mobile home parks and
multiple unit dwellings, $31.13 per month or $5.47 per each dumpster collected,
whichever amount is larger. An additional fee may be imposed by the Town
Manager in an amount deemed by the Manager to cover the cost of any extra
service rendered because of the lack of the use of a dumpster(s) at the
location. The Town Manager’s decision may be appealed to the Board of Trustees.
Upon 15 days’ notice, the fee determined by the Town Manager may be modified as
circumstances warrant. Said charges shall be added to the monthly utility bill.
            2.   Should the Town Manager determine that a commercial location
is not suitable for collection in a dumpster, the Town Manager may identify the
location as a special commercial location and allow collection by polycart. For
each special commercial location, $31.13 per month or $2.44 per polycart
emptied shall be collected, whichever amount is larger.
         (d)   Multiple business buildings. For multiple business buildings,
$21.99 per occupied business unit per month if collection service is provided
at one site at said multiple business building. The owner of the building shall
comply with the reporting requirements provided in division (D)(1)(c)1. above.
Said charge shall be added to the monthly utility bill.
         (e)   Self-contained compaction unit (SCU). For locations that use
this method of refuse collection, there is a minimum monthly fee, which is a
rate equivalent to two lifts per month at the established rate, for the
locations that are selected to participate with an SCU collection process. This
fee is based upon lifting of a SCU, transportation to and from the landfill,
the emptying of the SCU and the return of the SCU. All fees and charges
established within this section are subject to division (D)(3) below.
            1.   Town determination of location to use a SCU. The Town Manager
shall determine which businesses shall be required to use the SCU method of
refuse collection. This determination shall be made according to the volume of
generated refuse, the number of pickups required per week and the physical
characteristics of the location.
               a.   Appeal. The Town Manager’s decision may be appealed within
30 days to the Board of Trustees at its next available regularly scheduled
meeting. The Board shall reach a decision at this meeting and the date of the
meeting shall be considered the notification to such location to incorporate
the necessary accouterments for such service.
               b.   Business request to use SCU. If a location requests to use
the SCU service, they must submit a written and signed statement requesting
such desire to the Town Manager. The Town Manager may grant such a request as
long as the necessary equipment is available and the town can reasonably
accommodate the change.
               c.   Notification. When the determination is reached for a
location to use the SCU refuse collection method, such location shall have a
minimum of 60 days to initiate plans for the SCU method and implementation
shall not exceed 120 days after notification.
            2.   Scheduled lifting fee. For a regularly scheduled weekly, bi-
weekly or a mutually agreed upon routine pick up the lifting fee for a SCU with
the capacity of 15 cubic yards or less shall be $16.30. The fee for a larger
SCU container will be computed by using the above-established rate for a 15-
cubic-yard SCU and applying a proportional lift fee for the utilized SCU’s
capacity.
            3.   Non-scheduled lifting fee. For a special requested pick-up,
there will be an additional fee of $61.14.
         (f)   Roll-off service usage and rates. For locations that use this
method of refuse collection there is a minimum fee of $61.14. All fees and
charges established within this section are subject to division (D)(3) below.
            1.   Roll-off standard equipment fee. There is hereby established a
minimum roll-off equipment fee of $61.14, which provides for the use of any
roll-off container that is 15 cubic yards or less for three days. The weekly
fee will be $122.27 with a maximum of $305.68 per month for a roll-off
container. Any other larger roll-off container capacity will be computed on a
proportional basis.
            2.   Roll-off lifting fee. The established lift fee for a roll-off
container shall be $12.23 per yard for the full capacity of the container.
      (2)   Other than ground level; more than 20 feet and not in containers.
         (a)   Where the collection of refuse from other than ground level,
from more than 20 feet from the side of the street or alley, or not in approved
containers, is accepted by the Town Manager, the fee shall be that of division
(D)(1) above, plus a fee set by the Town Manager, subject to appeal to the
Board of Trustees, which shall be deemed to cover the cost of the extra service
rendered.
         (b)   Said charges shall be added to the monthly utility bill.
      (3)   On an annual basis. These rates shall be adjusted by the amount of
the previous year’s Denver-Boulder Consumer Price Index with no further action
of the Board of Trustees. The annual adjustment will take place in the January
billing beginning in 2016.
      (4)   Exemptions. The Board of Trustees of the town has determined that
exemptions should be made to the charges set forth in this division (D).
         (a)   The Board of Trustees of the town has determined that due to the
level of service to the community combined with the relative low volume of
trash produced that church buildings within the town shall be exempt from the
charges set forth in this division (D). This exemption does not, however, apply
to other church owned properties including parsonages.
         (b)   The Board of Trustees of the town has determined that due to
past and present cooperative efforts that the state’s Department of
Transportation shall be exempt from the charges set forth in this division (D).
         (c)   In circumstances where the occupant/owner is absent from the
premises for an extended period, but water and sewer service must remain
active, the refuse charge can be waived at the discretion of the Town Manager.

wastewater system of the town or to any wastewater system tributary thereto,
the Superintendent or the Town Manager may take any action necessary to:
      (1)   Prohibit the discharge of such wastewater;
      (2)   Require a discharger to demonstrate that in-plant modifications
will reduce or eliminate the discharge of such substances in conformity with
this code;
      (3)   Require treatment, including storage facilities or flow
equalization necessary to reduce or eliminate the objectionable characteristics
or substance so that the discharge will not violate this code;

any additional cost or expense incurred by the town for handling and treating
excess loads imposed on the wastewater treatment system; or
      (5)   Take such other or further remedial action as may be deemed to be
desirable or necessary to achieve the purposes of this code.
   (B)   Regulatory actions; general powers of Superintendent.
      (1)   Any actual or threatened discharge of wastewater containing
substances limited or prohibited by this code into the wastewater treatment
system of the town which, by the determination of the Superintendent, presents
an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or
to the environment or which causes interference with the normal operation of
the wastewater treatment system, may be immediately halted or eliminated by the
Superintendent or the Town Manager. The Superintendent may halt or eliminate
such discharges by means of any procedure or measure authorized by this code
for enforcement of discharge limitations and prohibitions, or by means of
physical disconnection from the wastewater treatment system or other
discontinuance of wastewater treatment service. Such discharges may be halted
or eliminated without regard to the compliance of the discharge with other
provisions of this code.
      (2)   If the town is fined by the state or federal governments for any
violation of its CDPS permit or violation of water quality standards as the
result of a spill, intentional sludge discharge of a toxic pollutant or
discharge of wastewater containing substances limited or prohibited by this
code into the wastewater treatment system of the town, then the fine, including
all of the town’s legal, sampling and analytical testing cost and any other
related costs shall be charged to the responsible user.
   (C)   Pretreatment facilities; submission of plans. Where pretreatment or
equalization of wastewater flows prior to discharge into any part of the
wastewater treatment system is required, plan, specifications and other
pertinent data or information relating to such pretreatment or flow-control
facilities shall first be submitted to the Superintendent for review and
approval. Such approval shall not exempt the discharge of such facilities from
compliance with any applicable code, ordinance, rule, regulation or order of
any governmental authority. Such approval shall not be constructed as or act as
a guaranty or assurance that any discharge is or will be in compliance with any
applicable code, ordinance, rule, regulations or order of any governmental
authority. Any subsequent alterations or additions to such pretreatment or
flow-control facilities shall not be made without due notice to and prior
approval of the Superintendent.
   (D)   Pretreatment facilities; operations. If pretreatment or control of
wastewater waste flow is required, such facilities shall be maintained in good

provide adequate protection as approved by the Superintendent from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials of other wastes regulated by this code.
Facilities and procedures to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provide and maintained at the owner or operator’s own cost
and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide this protection shall be submitted to the Superintendent for review,
and shall be approved by him or her before installation of the accidental
discharge protection. Review and approval of such plans and operating
procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to
modify this facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this code.
   (G)   Report required for accidental discharge.
      (1)   If a facility has an accidental sludge discharge, the owner or user
of the facility responsible for such discharge shall immediately notify the
Superintendent so that corrective action may be undertaken to protect the
wastewater treatment system.
      (2)   In addition, a written report addressed to the Superintendent
detailing the date, time and cause of the accidental discharge and corrective

§ 53.026 SERVICE LINES; SEPARATE FOR EACH BUILDING; EXCEPTIONS; MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   Separate for each building; exceptions. A separate and independent
service line shall be provided for every building. However, where one building
stands at the rear of another on an interior lot which cannot be subdivided,
and no service line is available nor can be constructed to the rear building
through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the service line of the
front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as
one service. Multi-family or commercial or industrial complexes having more
than one building on a single platted lot may have the individual buildings
connected to a single common service line, unless and until such lot is re-
subdivided or the buildings otherwise become separately owned in which case
independent connections shall be made. Waiver of this requirement for a
separate and independent service line, may be granted by the Town Manager upon
re-subdivision or creation of separate ownership of individual buildings on a
single lot with existing multi-family or commercial, but not industrial
complexes. Such a waiver shall be granted upon showing that the service lines
owned in common will be maintained by an entity of the owners of the separate
buildings. By regulation, the Town Manager may provide for additional
requirements to assure proper maintenance and repair of the common service
lines and, if necessary, monitoring of effluent quality or quantity. The town
does not assume any obligation nor acquire any liability for damage to the
connecting property or any portion thereof caused by or resulting from any such
connection to the wastewater system as aforementioned.

alignment and materials of constructing of a service line and the methods to be
used in excavating, placing the pipe, jointing, testing and backfilling the
trench shall all conform to the requirements of the Building and Plumbing Codes
and the town’s specifications and other applicable rules and regulations of the
town.
(Prior Code, § 137.5.8)
   (C)   Use of gravity flow. Whenever possible, the service line shall be
brought from the building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all
buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the
collection line, wastewater carried by such building drain shall be lifted by
means approved by the Superintendent and discharged to the wastewater system.
(Prior Code, § 137.5.9)
   (D)   Maintenance of.

line to the premises served. The owner shall keep such line in good condition
and shall replace, at his or her expense, any portions thereof which, in the
opinion of the Superintendent, have become so damaged or disintegrated as to be
unfit for further use. The owner must secure all required permits for
construction purposes and shall be responsible for returning the public right-
of-way and the street to acceptable town/county standards.
      (2)   In the event that more than one premises are connected to a single
service line, the owners of the respective premises shall be jointly and
severally responsible for the maintenance and repair requirements imposed by
this section.
      (3)   Prior to repair or alteration of the service line, a permit must be
obtained from the town. This inspection shall assure that codes, ordinances and
rules applying to the wastewater system are met. The town shall not be
subjected to any liability for any deficiency or defect in the repair or
alteration of such premises which is not discovered by inspection, nor shall
the owner of such premises be absolved from liability for such deficiency or
defect and any resulting damage or from responsibility to correct such
deficiency or defect.

charge. In the case of new users, users not using town water or changing
service conditions, the Town Manager may designate an alternative base
consumption period. The consumption established during any base period shall be
used for the determination of monthly wastewater user charges until a new base
consumption period occurs as provided herein.
   (B)   All other. All non-residential customers shall be billed based on
actual water consumption for each billing period. The actual water consumption
may be adjusted as determined by the Town Manager as follows.
      (1)   Non-residential users with 1,000 square feet or more of irrigated
property shall be given an irrigation allowance based on the number of 100
square feet increments of irrigated property. The user must make application to
the Town Manager for the credit.

S = BOD, surcharge amount
a = Normal domestic BOD rate per 1,000 gallons
b = % by which the classification average discharge BOD exceeds the normal
domestic
discharge BOD (280 mg/l)
c = Water volume used to calculate the wastewater user charge

§ 54.004 PRETREATMENT FACILITIES.
   (A)   Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with
this code and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits and the prohibitions set out in §
54.020 of this chapter within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state
or the Town Manager, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for
compliance shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user’s expense.
Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the Town Manager for review, and shall be acceptable to the Town
Manager before such facilities are constructed. The Town Manager may request
such additional information as is necessary for a full review of the plans.
      (1)   Within ten days of receiving all information requested by the Town
Manager, the Town Manager shall schedule a consultation meeting with the user
or the user’s representative at which time the Town Manager may request the
user to prepare a mitigation plan that modifies the facility operation or
design to ensure compliance with the town code and pretreatment standards.
      (2)   Within 20 days of the consultation meeting, the Town Manager may,
by written memorandum, approve the facility plan incorporating any alterations,
modifications or conditions deemed necessary to ensure that the facility will
comply with town code and pretreatment standards, or may deny the facility plan
if the constructed facility will not meet town code or pretreatment standards.
      (3)   In the event that the Town Manager determines that plans submitted
by the user require further technical expertise may authorize the use of
appropriate technical assistance in evaluating and/or modifying the plan and
shall further establish at that time a time table for the completion of the
study and construction or installation of the proposed facility.
      (4)   As to significant industrial users, the timetable for the
construction of pretreatment facilities may, at the discretion of the Town
Manager, be coordinated with the issuance of a wastewater discharge permit as
set forth in §§
54.035 through
54.042 of this chapter.
   (B)   (1)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Town Manager may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial waste
streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and
determine the user’s compliance with the requirements of this code.
      (2)   The Town Manager may require any person discharging into the POTW
to install and maintain, on his, her or their property and at their expense, a
suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A
wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
      (3)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Town Manager, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except
that, such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All
interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the Town Manager
and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned and repaired regularly, as
needed, by the user at his, her or their expense.

discharge described in division (A) above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
(Prior Code, § 155.6.6)
§ 54.061 REPORTS FROM UNPERMITTED USERS.
   All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the Town Manager, as the Town Manager may require.
(Prior Code, § 155.6.7)
§ 54.062 NOTICE OF VIOLATION; REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING.
   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
the Town Manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user
shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the Town Manager within 15 days after becoming aware of the
violation.
(Prior Code, § 155.6.8)
§ 54.063 NOTIFICATION OF DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   (1)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and State
Department of Public Health and Environment, Hazardous Materials and Waste
Division Director, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance
which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R.
part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set
forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that
calendar month and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream
expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications
must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any
notification under this division (A)(1) need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged.
      (2)   However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted
under §
54.059 of this chapter. The notification requirement in this section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
54.055,
54.057 and
54.058 of this chapter.

pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance
with procedures approved by EPA.
(Prior Code, § 155.6.10)
§ 54.065 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   Except as indicated in division (B) below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In
the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the Town Manager may
authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab
samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative
sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
(Prior Code, § 155.6.11)
§ 54.066 TIMING.
   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail

      (3)   The Town Manager shall, on an annual basis, complete a full
evaluation of each facility of any significant industrial user.
   (B)   Search warrants. If the Town Manager has been refused access to a
building, structure or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
code, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the town designed to verify compliance with
this code or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Town Manager may
seek issuance of a search warrant from the Municipal Court of the town or other
court of competent jurisdiction.
(Prior Code, § 155.7)
ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 54.080 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   (A)   When the Town Manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Town
Manager may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 20 days
of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for
the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Town Manager.
   (B)   Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for
any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Town Manager to take
any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a notice of violation.
(Prior Code, § 155.10.1)
§ 54.081 CONSENT ORDERS.
   The Town Manager may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for non-compliance. Such documents will include specific action to
be taken by the user to correct the non-compliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §§
54.083 and
54.084 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Prior Code, § 155.10.2)
§ 54.082 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   The Town Manager may order a user which has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this code, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear
before the Town Manager and show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and
place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such
action and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at
least 14 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized
representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Prior Code, § 155.10.3)
§ 54.083 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Town Manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Town
Manager may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing
that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does
not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may
contain other requirements to address the non-compliance, including additional
self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Prior Code, § 155.10.4)
§ 54.084 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   (A)   When the Town Manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this code, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that
the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the Town Manager may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   (B)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Prior Code, § 155.10.5)
§ 54.085 EMERGENCY SUSPENSION.
   (A)   The Town Manager may immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
Town Manager may also immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after notice and
opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the
POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Town
Manager may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance
of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its
receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals. The Town Manager may allow
the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Town Manager that the period of endangerment has passed,
unless the termination proceedings in §
54.086 of this chapter are initiated against the user.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Town Manager prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under §§
54.082 or
54.086 of this chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Prior Code, § 155.10.7)
§ 54.086 TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.
   (A)   In addition to the provisions in §
54.042(F) of this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
      (1)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§
54.020 through
54.024 of this chapter.
   (B)   (1)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under §
54.082 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken.
      (2)   Exercise of this option by the Town Manager shall not be a bar to,
or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Prior Code, § 155.10.8)
§ 54.087 PERFORMANCE BONDS.
   The Town Manager may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge
permit to any user who the Town Manager determines may result in required long-
term clean-up efforts beyond the term of the discharge unless such user first
files a satisfactory bond, payable to the town, in a sum not to exceed a value
determined by the Town Manager to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance.
(Prior Code, § 155.12.1)
§ 54.088 WATER SUPPLY SEVERANCE.
   (A)   Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of
this code, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be
severed upon a determination by the Town Manager that the user is unable or
unwilling to comply with this chapter.
   (B)   Service will only recommence, at the user’s expense, after it has
satisfactorily demonstrated its ability and willingness to comply.
(Prior Code, § 155.12.2)
§ 54.089 INFORMANT REWARDS.
   (A)   The Town Manager may pay up to $50 for information leading to the
discovery of non- compliance by a user. In the event that the information
provided results in a civil penalty or an administrative penalty levied against
the user, the Town Manager may disburse up to 5% of the collected line or
penalty to the informant.
   (B)   However, a single reward payment may not exceed $1,000.
(Prior Code, § 155.12.3)
§ 54.090 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Upset.
      (1)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary non-compliance with
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An UPSET does not include non-compliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper
operation.
      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for non-compliance with pretreatment standards if the requirements of §
54.090(C) of this chapter are met.
      (3)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or
other relevant evidence that:
         (a)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
         (c)   The user has submitted the following information to the Town
Manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is
provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days:
            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of non-
compliance;
            2.   The period of non-compliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the non-compliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the non-compliance.
         (d)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof;
         (e)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on
any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for non-compliance
with pretreatment standards; and
         (f)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction,
loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   (B)   Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for non-compliance with the
general prohibitions in §
54.020 of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in §
54.020(B)(3) through (B)(17) of this chapter if it can prove that it did not
know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through
or interference; or
      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when
the town was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   (C)   Bypass.
      (1)   For the purpose of this division (C), the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly requires a different meaning.
         BYPASS. The intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of
a user’s treatment facility.
         SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property,
damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      (2)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.
         (a)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Town Manager, at least ten days before the date of
the bypass, if possible. A user shall submit oral notice to the Town Manager of
an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission
shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of
the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass
and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times and,
if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Town Manager may waive the written report on a
case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
         (b)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Town Manager may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The user submitted notices as required under division (C)(2)
(a) above.
      (3)   The Town Manager may approve anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the Town Manager determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed in divisions (C)(2)(b)1. through (C)(2)(b)3. above.
(Prior Code, § 155.10.13)
§ 54.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Administrative penalties.
      (1)   When the Town Manager finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Town Manager may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $25,000. Such fines
shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or
other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day
during the period of violation.
      (2)   Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall be collected as provided
for in Chapter 50 of this code of ordinances.
      (3)   Users desiring to dispute such administrative penalties and costs
may request a review through the petition process described herein.
      (4)   The Town Manager may add the costs of preparing administrative
enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, as well as the cost of the
administrative review, if the user is unsuccessful, to the penalty.
      (5)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Prior Code, § 155.10.6)
   (B)   Judicial enforcement remedies.
      (1)   Injunctive relief. When the Town Manager finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this code, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Town Manager may petition the Municipal Court of the town
or any court of competent jurisdiction through the town’s attorney for the
issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which
restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge
permit, order or other requirement imposed by this ordinance on activities of
the user. The Town Manager may also seek such other action as is appropriate
for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to
conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not
be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a
user.
      (2)   Civil penalties.
         (a)   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision
of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the town for
a maximum civil penalty of $25,000 per violation, per day. In the case of a
monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for
each day during the period of the violation.
         (b)   The Town Manager may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court
costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the town.
         (c)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall
take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to,
the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as
justice requires.
         (d)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or
a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
      (3)   Criminal prosecution.
         (a)   A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of
this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of
a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $25,000 per violation, per
day.
         (b)   A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance
into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of not more
than $25,000. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action
for personal injury or property damage available under state law.
         (c)   A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations
or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other
documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter,
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies,
tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method
required under this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of
not more than $25,000 per violation, per day.
      (4)   Remedies non-exclusive.
         (a)   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The
Town Manager may take any, all or any combination of these actions against a
non-compliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with the town’s enforcement response plan. However, the Town Manager
may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant.
         (b)   Further, the Town Manager is empowered to take more than one
enforcement action against any non-compliant user.

§ 90.002 REGULATION OF DOGS WITHIN TOWN LIMITS.
   The Board of Trustees has found, determined and declared that those actions
of dogs, as set forth below herein, divisions (A) through (J) below are
detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the
town. Acknowledging the strict liability standard as to the provisions of this
subchapter, as set forth in §
90.025 of this chapter, any owner, possessor or keeper of any dog which
violates the provisions of this section, and the following divisions (A)
through (J), shall be subject to fines and penalties set forth in §
90.999 of this chapter, as well as any other remedy allowed by this subchapter:
   (A)   Run at large in the town unless said dog is under reasonable control
of the owner. For the purpose of this section, a dog shall be deemed under such
reasonable control when said dog is accompanied by its owner, or, some member
of the owner’s family or with some employee or agent of the owner, with the dog
attached to a leash. For the purposes of this section, a dog shall be deemed
not under reasonable control when:
      (1)   Said dog inflicts damage or injury (by biting, jumping upon,
pollution of vegetation or by any other means whatsoever) to the person or
property of anyone other than the owner, except in the defense of the owner,
his or her family or property; and
      (2)   In the case of any unspayed female dog not securely confined in the
owner’s yard, pen or other enclosure.

91.016 of this chapter and may be so declared by the town’s Board of Trustees,

vacant building to fail to replace any broken or missing window or door or fail
to secure any other means of entry into such building within 72 hours after

§ 91.019 CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.
   (A)   A Code Enforcement Officer shall be employed by the town to address
any complaints received from town residents of an alleged nuisance and to
address obvious investigation and inspection requirements. The Chief of Police
shall also be consulted if the complaint concerns possible criminal conduct
and/or if needed to maintain peace during the complaint, inspection or
abatement process. The Code Enforcement Officer, upon notification of an
apparent nuisance problem, shall first make informal contact with the owner and
occupant of the alleged offending property, either by letter or personal
contact, informing the owner/occupant of the complaint and the action needed to
remedy the problem. If the informal contact with the owner/occupant does not
remedy the problem, the Code Enforcement Officer shall serve upon the owner and
occupant a formal notice of violation and order for action to be taken. The
notice shall refer to the applicable portions of the town code, the action to
be taken by the owner/occupant and the possible penalties and abatement
procedures available to the town, including having the matter set before the
town’s Municipal Court. As indicated above, any notice given shall include the
requirements of C.R.S. §§ 31-15-401(1)(c) and 31-15-402 in those instances when
the alleged offending property is occupied by someone other than the owner.
   (B)   Nothing in division (A) above shall prevent the town, through its
designated officers and agents, from taking immediate abatement action,
including the use of force, when an emergency situation exists which in the
reasoned opinion of the town officers warrant immediate action. Such action may
be taken in instances which include, but are not limited to, blockage of public
roads and rights-of-way, danger to the town water supply, dangerous chemical
exposure and similar concerns. Further, abatement remedies do not necessarily
have to be brought through the town’s Municipal Court, but may be exercised at
the discretion of the Code Enforcement Officer after consultation with the
Police Chief.
(Prior Code, § 520.5) (Ord. 170, passed 7-28-1958; Ord. 411, passed 1-2-1994;
Ord. 584, passed 10-1-2015)
§ 91.020 ABATEMENT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Abatement by town. If any owner, tenant or agent in charge of real
property shall allow a nuisance to exist on any lot, block or parcel after
being notified to abate the nuisance through the written notice as submitted by
the Code Enforcement Officer, by a date certain, then the Town Manager, or the
Manager’s designee, may direct that the nuisance be abated or caused to be
abated by the town, and charge the cost thereof to the owner, tenant or agent
in charge, together with 5% additional fee of the total cost, for inspection
and other incidental costs. The total cost shall include the town’s legal fees
spent in the prosecution of the matter, if any. Further, the town may file a
lien against each lot or tract of land, which created the nuisance, until paid
and such lien shall have priority over all other liens, except general taxes
and prior special assessments or may use any other method available to the town
for collection at said time. Should the owner, tenant or agent in charge of the
real property not pay the total costs of abatement within 30 days of
assessment, the costs may be certified by the Town Clerk to the County
Treasurer who shall collect the assessment, together with a 10% penalty for
cost of collection, in the same manner as other taxes are collected.
   (B)   Abatement through Town Municipal Court. The Code Enforcement Officer
may, with the assistance of the Town Attorney, choose to seek the adjudication
and abatement of a nuisance through the town’s Municipal Court. In such case,
the abatement procedures set forth in division (A) above shall remain fully
enforceable though monitored by the town’s Municipal Court Judge.
   (C)   Abatement process applicable to weeds.
      (1)   Due to the fast growth of weeds and the need for timely abatement,
the following abatement process shall be applicable to owners of real property
allowing a weed nuisance to exist on the property.
      (2)   If any owner, tenant or agent in charge shall fail to cut the
weeds, within five days after being notified to do so by the Code Enforcement
Officer, or Town Manager (or Manager’s designee), by registered or certified
mail, hand delivery, or by posting notice on the property in a prominent place
(if the owner or occupant cannot be located), the Town Manager may direct that
the weeds be cut by an employee of the town or a private contractor performing
the work on behalf of the town and charge the cost thereof to such owner,
tenant or agent, together with a 5% additional charge for inspection and other
incidental expense.
      (3)   (a)   The total cost shall be conveyed, by registered or certified
mail, to the owner or occupant with a demand that the sum be paid within 30
days of the date of the letter. Should the owner fail or refuse to pay the
assessment within the 30 days, the Clerk shall cause such assessment to become
a lien against the lot, block or parcel of land, which lien shall have priority
over all liens, except general taxes and prior, special assessment.
         (b)   The same may be certified at any time, after such failure to so
pay the assessment, by the Town Clerk to the County Treasurer to be placed upon
the tax list for the current year and to be collected in the same manner as
other taxes are collected, with 10% penalty to defray the cost of collection.
All other remedies that may be available to the town shall remain as an option
of collection.

permitted to continue for a period six months from the effective date hereof.
However, the Zoning Administrator may grant an extension of time during which

above, and the later established business(es) will be deemed to be in violation
of divisions (B) through (D) above.

stress or stresses allowed by the Uniform Building Code defined in Chapter 150
of this code of ordinances for new building of similar structure, purpose or
location;
   (D)   Whenever any portion thereof has been damaged by fire, earthquake,

catastrophe and is less than the minimum requirements of the Building Code for
new buildings of similar structure, purpose or location;
   (E)   Whenever any portion or member or appurtenance thereof is likely to
fail, or to become detached or dislodged, or to collapse and thereby injure
persons or damage property;
   (F)   Whenever any portion of a building, or any member, appurtenance or

stability, or is not so anchored, attached or fastened in place so as to be
capable of resisting a wind pressure of one half of that specified in the
Uniform Building Code defined in Chapter 150 of this code of ordinances for new
buildings of similar structure, purpose or location without exceeding the
working stresses permitted in the Building Code for such buildings;
   (G)   Whenever any portion thereof has wracked, warped, buckled or settled
to such an extent that walls or other structural portions have materially less
resistance to winds or earthquakes than is required in the case of similar new
construction;

   (I)   Whenever, for any reason, the building or structure, or any portion
thereof, is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is being used;

33% or more damage or deterioration of its supporting member or members, or 50%
damage or deterioration of its non- supporting members, enclosing or outside
walls or coverings;
   (L)   Whenever the building or structure has been so damaged by fire, wind,
earthquake or flood, or has become so dilapidated or deteriorated as to become
an attractive nuisance to children; a harbor for vagrants, criminals or immoral
persons; or as to enable persons to resort thereof for the purpose of
committing unlawful or immoral acts;
   (M)   Whenever any building or structure has been constructed, exists or is
maintained in violation of any specific requirement or prohibition applicable

   (O)   Whenever a building or structure, used or intended to be used for
dwelling purposes, because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, decay,
damage, faulty construction or arrangement, inadequate light, air or sanitation
facilities, or otherwise, is determined by a town, county or state health
officer, or caseworker to be unsanitary, unfit for human habitation or in such
a condition that it is likely to cause sickness or disease;
   (P)   Whenever any building or structure, because of obsolescence,
dilapidated condition, deterioration, damage, inadequate exits, lack of
sufficient fire resistive construction, faulty electric wiring, gas connections

(Prior Code, § 515.12.2) (Ord. 464, passed 8-2-2002; Ord. 584, passed 10-1-
2015)
§ 152.013 ENCROACHMENTS AND SETBACK DISTANCES.
   (A)   General. All requirements of the Land Development Code of the town
regarding encroachments in streets, yards and courts shall be obeyed, and
required setbacks from property lines and public roads shall be met.
   (B)   Fire separation distances. The distance a home must be sited from
other structures depends on its fire-resistance rating. No manufactured home
may be installed closer than ten feet from another primary structure.
   (C)   Bearing capacity. Test the bearing capacity of the soil in accordance
with this division (C) before designing the foundation. If the soil cannot be
tested, but its type can be identified, use the foundation bearing pressures
shown in Table 3-1 as a guide. If the soil cannot be identified, use a bearing
capacity of 1,000 pounds per square foot. Under unusual conditions, or if the
soil appears to be composed of peat or un-compacted fill, or has expansive
characteristics, consult a local geologist, engineer or architect.
   (D)   Soil. Use a pocket penetrometer or other methods acceptable to the
town. The proper penetrometer reading must be taken after removing all organic
material to undisturbed earth, at the foundation bearing level. The installer
is responsible for documenting soil types and bearing capacities.
   (E)   Gutters and downspouts. When gutters and/or downspouts are installed,
direct the runoff away from the home. The use of splash blocks and downspout
extensions will enhance drainage away from the home.
   (F)   Foundation requirements. All exterior walls, marriage walls, marriage
wall posts, columns and piers must be supported on an acceptable foundation
system that must be of sufficient design to support safely the loads imposed,
as determined by the character of the soil.
   (G)   Height above grade. Foundation wall shall extend at least six inches
above the finished grade adjacent to the foundation at all points.
   (H)   Minimum foundation wall and wall footing thickness. If masonry or
concrete construction is used, the minimum foundation wall width shall be six
inches. The minimum reinforced concrete footing thickness shall be three and
one-half inches or one and one-half times the length of the footing projection
from the foundation wall, whichever is greater.
   (I)   Crawl space requirements (basementless spaces).
      (1)   Height requirement. Ground level must be at last 18 inches below
the bottom of wood floor joists and 12 inches below the bottom of the chassis
beams. (See § 152.004 of this chapter.)
      (2)   Interior vs. exterior ground level. The interior ground level must
be above the outside finish grade with a minimum 2% slope to the exterior
unless:
         (a)   Adequate gravity drainage to a positive outfall is provided;
         (b)   A professional engineer or architect certifies the permeability
of the soil and the water table is such that water will not collect in the
crawl space; or
         (c)   A full perimeter foundation drain and sump pit are provided.
      (3)   Configuration. Select manufactured pier heights so that the
adjustable risers do not extend more than two inches when finally positioned.
All piers must rest on footings (see § 152.004 of this chapter) that extend
below the frost line (see § 152.004 of this chapter for exemptions to
placement) and are placed on either undisturbed soil or compacted fill except
for interior heated areas which may bear above frost line on undisturbed soil
or compacted fill.
      (4)   Design procedures. Pier height is to be measured from the top of
the footing.
      (5)   Other materials. Other materials approved for footings may be used
when approved by local authorities if they provide equal load-bearing capacity
and resistance to decay. Examples include: one-half inch maximum crushed stone;
three-eights inch or three-fourths graduated gravel; coarse sand, with no
grains smaller than one-sixteenth inch, placed so it provides a soil-bearing
capacity of at least 3,000 pounds per square foot; approved ANS footings.
   (J)   Permanent foundation. See Permanent Foundations Guide for Manufactured
Housing.
   (K)   Severe wind areas. Consult the authority having jurisdiction or a
professional engineer or architect.
   (L)   (Table 5-1) normal home installations (single - or - multi-section
homes).
      (1)   Piers-ground anchors. The manufactured home rests on piers of
concrete block; formed-in- place concrete; permanent wood; or steel pedestals
on permanent wood, crushed stone, approved ABS or concrete footers. The ground
anchors are embedded at an angle in the soil to act as dead-men to resist the
horizontal and vertical wind forces. Straps are tied to the frame, with or
without over-the-top straps.
      (2)   Duct-work cross-overs. Clamp the flexible air conditioning and/or
heating ducts to the sleeves projecting through the bottom covering, seal the
ducts’ adjustable collars with several wrappings of duct tape and suspend/
support them above the ground. (See Figure 5-1.)
      (3)   Number and location of anchors.
         (a)   The home must be anchored to the ground in order to resist
overturning and lateral movement (sliding) of the home caused by forces imposed
by the wind. The tie-down anchoring system described in this section is one
acceptable method of anchoring the home to withstand its wind load.
         (b)   Unless otherwise noted, all tie-down and anchoring instructions
are for homes with roof pitches which do not exceed 20 degrees (4.3 inches in
12 inches).
         (c)   The tie-down anchoring devices shall be certified by a
registered state professional engineer, architect or a nationally recognized
laboratory. They must be capable of resisting an allowable working load equal
to or exceeding 3,150 pounds and shall be capable of withstanding a 50%
overload (4,725 pounds total) at an angle of 45 degrees from the vertical.
Ground anchors must be installed as specified by the anchor manufacturer.
         (d)   Anchoring equipment exposed to weather shall have a resistance
to weather deterioration at least equivalent to that provided by a coat of zinc
on steel of not less than 0.3 ounces per square foot of surface coated. Slit or
cut edges of zinc-coated strapping do not need to be zinc-coated.
         (e)   Straps shall be Type 1, Finish B, Grade 1, steel strapping, one
and one-fourth inches wide and 0.035 inches in thickness, certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect, or listed as conforming with
ASTM Standard Specification D3953-91, Standard Specification for Strapping,
Flat Steel and Seals.
         (f)   The home must be in its final position with sections fastened
together prior to installing tie-down equipment.
      (4)   Ground anchors.
         (a)   Before ground anchor installation, determine that the anchors
will not be close to any underground utility lines.
         (b)   The ground anchor spacing and installation method were developed
by the Manufactured Housing Research Alliance.
         (c)   Ground anchors shall be installed in accordance with the
manufacturer’s written instructions. The following is one example: Install the
anchors at the locations selected from Table D when the home manufacturer’s
installation instructions are not available.
         (d)   Steps for proper ground anchor installation. These steps must be
followed to use Table D:
            1.   Place the anchors approximately four inches to the inside of
the exterior wall line of the home or a sufficient distance to avoid
interference with the skirting. (See diagram.)
            2.   Hold the Anchor at an angle of approximately 15 degrees off of
vertical so that the head of the anchor is just outside the sidewall. (See
diagram.)
            3.   Install the anchor to a depth of approximately one-third the
anchor length.
            4.   Place a stabilizer plate (all lateral loaded ground anchor
must have stabilizer plates) of the size indicated on the chart to the inside

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.001 PURPOSE.
   This chapter provides principles, procedures and associated funding for the
placement of structures and facilities, construction excavation encroachments
and work activities within or upon any public right- of-way and to protect the
integrity of the road system. To achieve these purposes, it is necessary to
require permits of private users of the public rights-of-way, to establish
permit procedures and to fix and collect fees and charges.
(Prior Code, § 165.1.1) (Ord. 503, passed 7-7-2005; Ord. 577, passed 11-6-2014)
§ 153.002 OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Public and private uses of public rights-of-way for location of
facilities employed in the provision of public services should, in the
interests of the general welfare, be accommodated; however, the town must
ensure that the primary purpose of the right-of-way, passage of pedestrian and
vehicular traffic, is maintained to the greatest extent possible. In addition,
the value of other public and private installations, roadways, facilities and
properties should be protected, competing uses must be reconciled and the
public safety preserved. The use of the right-of-way corridors by other users
is secondary to these public objectives and the movement of traffic. This code
is intended to strike a balance between the public need for efficient, safe
transportation routes and the use of rights-of-way for location of facilities
by public and private entities.
   (B)   It, thus, has several objectives:
      (1)   To ensure that the public safety is maintained and that public
inconvenience is minimized;
      (2)   To protect the town’s infrastructure investment by establishing
repair standards for the pavement, facilities and property in the public
rights-of-way, when work is accomplished;
      (3)   To facilitate work within the rights-of-way through the
standardization of regulations;
      (4)   To maintain an efficient permit process;
      (5)   To conserve and fairly apportion the limited physical capacity of
the public rights-of-way held in public trust by the town;
      (6)   To establish a public policy for enabling the town to discharge its
public trust consistent with the rapidly evolving federal and state regulatory
policies, industry competition and technological development;
      (7)   To promote cooperation among the permittees (as defined herein) and
the town in the occupation of the public rights-of-way, and work therein, in
order to:
         (a)   Eliminate duplication that is wasteful, unnecessary or
unsightly;
         (b)   Lower the permittee’s and the town’s costs of providing services
to the public; and
         (c)   Minimize street cuts.
      (8)   To assure that the town can continue to fairly and responsibly
protect the public health, safety and welfare.

nature unless caused by the negligent or intentional acts of the town, and
reimburse the town for all its reasonable expenses, as incurred, arising out of
the installation, maintenance, operation or any other work or activity in the

permittee shall have the right to defend the town with regard to all third
party actions, damages and penalties arising in any way out of the exercise of
any rights in the permit. If, at any time, however, the permittee refuses to
defend, and the town elects to defend itself with regard to such matters, the
permittee shall pay all reasonable expenses incurred by the town related to its
defense.
      (4)   In the event the town institutes litigation against the permittee
for a breach of the permit or for an interpretation of this code and the town
is the prevailing party, the permittee shall reimburse the town for all costs
related hereto, including reasonable attorney’s fees. The permittee shall not
be obligated to hold harmless or indemnify the town for claims or demands to
the extent that they are due to the negligence, or any intentional and/or
willful acts of the town or any of its officers, employees or agents.
      (5)   In the event the permittee is a public entity, the indemnification
requirements of this section shall be subject to the provisions of the state’s
Governmental Immunity Act, being C.R.S. §§ 24-10-101 et seq.

regulations, and upon payment of all judgments and costs rendered against the
applicant for any material violation of town codes, ordinances or state
statutes that may be recovered against the applicant by any person for damages
arising out of any negligent or wrongful acts of the applicant in the
performance of work done pursuant to the permit. The town may bring an action
on the bond or letter of credit on its own behalf or on behalf of any person so
aggrieved as beneficiary. The bond or letter of credit must be approved by the
Town Manager as to form and as to the responsibility of the surety thereon
prior to the issuance of the permit. However, the town may waive the
requirements of any such bond or letter of credit or may permit the applicant
to post a bond without surety thereon upon finding that the applicant has
financial stability and assets located in the state to satisfy any claims
intended to be protected against the security required by this section.
   (B)   A letter of responsibility will be accepted in lieu of a performance
bond or letter of credit from all public utilities, and all franchised entities
operating within the town.
   (C)   The performance bond, letter of credit or letter of responsibility
shall remain in force and effect for a minimum of three years after completion
and acceptance of the street cut, excavation or lane closure.

§ 153.010 PERFORMANCE WARRANTY/GUARANTEE.
   (A)   Any warranty made hereunder shall serve as security for the
performance of work necessary to repair the public right-of-way if the
permittee fails to make the necessary repairs or to complete the work under the
permit.
   (B)   The permittee, by acceptance of the permit, expressly warrants and
guarantees complete performance of the work in a manner acceptable to the town
and warrants and guarantees all work done for a period of two years after the
date of probationary acceptance, and agrees to maintain upon demand and to make
all necessary repairs during the two-year period. This warranty shall include
all repairs and actions needed as a result of:
      (1)   Defects in workmanship;
      (2)   Settling of fills or excavations;
      (3)   Any unauthorized deviations from the approved plans and
specifications;
      (4)   Failure to barricade;
      (5)   Failure to clean up during and after performance of the work; and
      (6)   Any other violation of this chapter or the codes or ordinances of
the town.
   (C)   The two-year warranty period shall run from the date of the town’s
probationary acceptance of the work. If repairs are required during the three-
year warranty period, those repairs need only be warranted until the end of the
initial two-year period starting with the date of probationary acceptance. It
is not necessary that a new two-year warranty be provided for subsequent
repairs after probationary acceptance.
   (D)   At any time prior to completion of the two-year warranty period, the
town may notify the permittee in writing of any needed repairs. Such repairs
shall be completed within 24 hours if the defects are determined by the town to
be an imminent danger to the public health, safety and welfare. Non- emergency
repairs shall be completed within 30 calendar days after notice.
   (E)   The warranty described in this section shall cover only those areas of
work undertaken by a permittee, and not directly impacted by the work of any
other permittee or the town. In the event that a portion of work warranted by
the permittee is subsequently impacted by work of another permittee or the town
during the warranty period, that other permittee or the town shall assume
responsibility for repair to the subsequently impacted section of right-of-way.
(Prior Code, § 165.9) (Ord. 503, passed 7-7-2005; Ord. 577, passed 11-6-2014)
§ 153.011 INSPECTIONS.
   A minimum of three inspections shall take place. First, the permittee shall
request that the town conduct a pre-construction inspection, to determine any
necessary conditions for the permit. Second, the permittee shall notify the
town immediately after completion of work operations. The town shall inspect
the completed work within 21 days of the permittee’s notification. Probationary
acceptance will be made if all work meets town and permit standards. Third,
approximately 30 days prior to the expiration of the two-year guarantee, the
town shall conduct a final inspection of the completed work. If the work is
still satisfactory the bond or letter of credit shall be returned or allowed to
expire, with a letter of final acceptance, less any amounts needed to complete
work not done by the permittee. Upon review of the application for a permit,
the Director shall determine how many additional inspections, if any, may be
required. For work that does not involve material disturbance in the rights-of-
way, the Director shall waive the final inspection and the performance bond/
letter of credit.
(Prior Code, § 165.10) (Ord. 503, passed 7-7-2005; Ord. 577, passed 11-6-2014)
§ 153.012 PUBLIC SAFETY.
   The permittee shall maintain a safe work area, free of safety hazards. The
town may make any repair necessary to eliminate any safety hazards not
performed as directed. Any such work performed by the town shall be completed
and billed to the permittee at overtime rates. The permittee shall pay all such
charges within 30 days of the statement date. If the permittee fails to pay
such charges within the prescribed time period, the town may, in addition to
taking other collection remedies, seek reimbursement through the warranty
guarantee. The town shall not issue any further permits of any kind to said
permittee, until all outstanding charges (except those outstanding charges that
are honestly and reasonably disputed by the permittee and being negotiated in
good faith with the town) have been paid in full.
(Prior Code, § 165.11) (Ord. 503, passed 7-7-2005; Ord. 577, passed 11-6-2014)
§ 153.013 TIME OF COMPLETION.
   All work covered by the permit shall be completed by the date stated on the
application. Permits shall be void if work has not commenced three months after
issuance, unless the Director has granted an extension. Performance bonds,
letters of credit or letters of responsibility deposited as a performance/
warranty guarantee for individual permits will be returned after voiding of the
permit, with administrative and any other town costs deducted.
(Prior Code, § 165.12) (Ord. 503, passed 7-7-2005; Ord. 577, passed 11-6-2014)
§ 153.014 TRAFFIC CONTROL.
   (A)   When it is necessary to obstruct traffic, a traffic control plan shall
be submitted to the town prior to starting construction. No permit will be
issued until the town approves the plan. No permittee shall block access to and
from private property, block emergency vehicles, block access to fire hydrants,
fire stations, fire escapes, water valves, underground vaults, valve housing
structures or any other vital equipment unless the permittee provides the town
with written verification of written notice delivered to the owner or occupant
of the facility, equipment or property at least 48 hours in advance. If a
street closing is desired, the applicant will request the assistance and obtain
the approval of the Director. It shall be the responsibility of the permittee
to notify and coordinate all work in the public way with police, fire,
ambulance, other government entities and transit organizations.
   (B)   (1)   When necessary for public safety, the permittee shall employ
flag persons whose duties shall be to control traffic around or through the
construction site.
      (2)   The Director may require the use of flag persons.
   (C)   Traffic-control devices, as defined in Part VI of the Manual on
Uniform Traffic-Control Devices, must be used whenever it is necessary to close
a traffic lane or sidewalk. Traffic control devices are to be supplied by the
permittee. If used at night, they must be reflectorized and may be required to
be illuminated or have barricade warning lights.
   (D)   Oil flares or kerosene lanterns are not allowed as means of
illumination. Nighttime work area flood lighting shall not be allowed to spill
out of the construction area in such a way as to disturb, annoy or endanger the
comfort, health or peace of others.
   (E)   (1)   Part VI of the Manual on Uniform Traffic-Control Devices or any
successor publication thereto shall be used as a guide for all maintenance and
construction signing.
      (2)   The permittee shall illustrate on the permit the warning and
control devices proposed for use.
      (3)   At the direction of the Director, such warning and control devices
shall be modified.
   (F)   The contractor shall be responsible for maintaining all work area
signing and barricading during construction operations as well as any signs and
barricades that are needed to protect roadway users and pedestrians during non-
work hours. During non-work hours, all construction work area signs that are
not appropriate shall be removed, covered or turned around so that they do not
face traffic. Any deficiencies noted by the town shall be corrected immediately
by the contractor. If contractor is not available or cannot be found, the town
may make such corrections and the contractor shall pay the actual costs plus a
penalty of 50% of the amount thereof.

GENERAL USE AND CONSTRUCTION
§ 153.030 RIGHT-OF-WAY MEETINGS.
   (A)   The permittee will make reasonable efforts to attend and participate
in meetings of the town, of which the permittee is made aware, regarding right-
of-way issues that may impact its facilities, including, planning meetings to
anticipate joint trenching and boring.
   (B)   Whenever it is possible and reasonably practicable to joint trench or
share bores or cuts, the permittee shall work with other providers, licensees,
permittees and franchisees so as to reduce so far as possible the number of
right-of-way cuts within the town and the amount of pedestrian and vehicular
traffic that is obstructed or impeded.
(Prior Code, § 165.14.1) (Ord. 503, passed 7-7-2005; Ord. 577, passed 11-6-
2014)
§ 153.031 MINIMAL INTERFERENCE.
   (A)   Work in the right-of-way, on other public property, near public
property or on or near private property shall be done in a manner that causes
the least interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property
owners and residents.
   (B)   (1)   The permittee’s facilities shall be constructed and maintained
in such manner as not to interfere with sewers, water pipes, or any other
property of the town, or with any other pipes, wires, conduits, pedestals,
structures or other facilities that may have been laid in the rights-of-way by,
or under, the town’s authority.
      (2)   The permittee’s facilities shall be located, erected and maintained
so as not to endanger or interfere with the lives of persons, or to interfere
with new improvements the town may deem proper to make or to unnecessarily
hinder or obstruct the free use of the rights-of-way or other public property,
and shall not interfere with the travel and use of public places by the public
during the construction, repair, operation or removal thereof, and shall not
obstruct or impede traffic.
(Prior Code, § 165.14.2) (Ord. 503, passed 7-7-2005; Ord. 577, passed 11-6-
2014)
§ 153.032 UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF POLES.
   (A)   When required by general codes, ordinances, resolutions, regulations
or rules of the town or applicable state or federal law, the permittee’s
facilities shall be placed underground at no cost to the town. Placing
facilities underground does not preclude the use of ground-mounted
appurtenances.
   (B)   Where all facilities are installed underground at the time of the
permittee’s construction, or when all such facilities are subsequently placed
underground, all permittee facilities shall also be placed underground at no
expense to the town unless funding is generally available for such relocation
to all users of the rights-of-way. Related equipment, such as pedestals, must
be placed in accordance with the town’s applicable code requirements and rules.
   (C)   For above ground facilities, the permittee shall utilize existing
poles and conduit when possible.
   (D)   Should the town desire to place its own facilities in trenches or
bores opened by the permittee, the permittee shall cooperate with the town in
any construction by the permittee that involves trenching or boring; provided
that, the town has first notified the permittee in some manner that it is
interested in sharing the trenches or bores in the area where the permittee’s
construction is occurring. The permittee shall allow the town to place its
facilities in the permittee’s trenches and bores; provided, the town incurs any
incremental increase in cost of the trenching and boring. Should the town
desire to install ducts or conduit for the possible use of other entities, then
the permittee shall allow the town to place these facilities in the permittee’s
trenches and bores; provided, the town shares proportionally in the cost of
trenching and boring. The town shall be responsible for maintaining its
respective facilities buried in the permittee’s trenches and bores under this
section.

2014)
§ 153.033 USE OF CONDUITS FROM TOWN.
   Unless otherwise restricted by tariff, the town may install or affix and
maintain its own facilities for town purposes in or upon any and all of
permittee’s ducts, conduits or equipment in the rights-of-way and other public
places, at a charge to be negotiated between the parties, to the extent space
therein or thereon is reasonably available, and pursuant to all applicable
ordinances and codes. For the purposes of this section, TOWN PURPOSES includes,
but is not limited to, the use of the structures and installations for town
fire, police, traffic, utility, telephone and/or signal systems.
(Prior Code, § 165.14.4) (Ord. 503, passed 7-7-2005; Ord. 577, passed 11-6-
2014)
§ 153.034 COMMON USERS.
   (A)   The rights-of-way have a finite capacity for containing facilities.
Therefore, whenever the town determines it is impracticable to permit
construction of an underground conduit system by any other entity which may at
the time have authority to construct or maintain conduits or ducts in the
rights-of- way, but excluding entities providing services in competition with
the permittee, and unless otherwise prohibited by federal or state law or
regulations, the town may require the permittee to afford to such entity the
right to use the permittee’s surplus ducts or conduits in common with the
permittee, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement for use of
surplus ducts or conduits entered into by the permittee and the other entity.
Nothing herein shall require the permittee to enter into an agreement with such
entity if, in the permittee’s reasonable determination, such an agreement could
compromise the integrity of the permittee’s facilities.
   (B)   All facilities shall meet any applicable local, state and federal
clearance and other safety requirements, be adequately grounded and anchored
and meet the provisions of contracts executed between the permittee and the
other common user. The permittee may, at its option, correct any attachment
deficiencies and charge the common user for its costs. Each common user shall
pay the permittee for any fines, fees, damages or other costs the common user’s
attachments cause the permittee to incur.
(Prior Code, § 165.14.5) (Ord. 503, passed 7-7-2005; Ord. 577, passed 11-6-
2014)
§ 153.035 JOINT PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION; COORDINATION OF EXCAVATIONS.
   (A)   Excavations in town rights-of-way disrupt and interfere with the
public use of town streets and damage the pavement and landscaping. The purpose
of this section is to reduce this disruption, interference and damage by
promoting better coordination among the permittees making excavations in town
rights-of-way and between these permittees and the town. Better coordination
will assist in minimizing the number of excavations being made wherever
feasible, and will ensure the excavations in town rights-of-way are, to the
maximum extent possible, performed before, rather than after, the resurfacing
of the streets by the town.
   (B)   Any permittee owning, operating or installing facilities in town
rights-of-way, providing water, sewer, gas, electric, communication, video or
other utility services, shall meet annually with the Director, at the
Director’s request, to discuss the permittee’s excavation master plan. At such
meeting, to the extent not already in possession of the town, the permittee
shall submit documentation, in a form required by the Director, showing a
location of the permittee’s existing facilities in the town rights-of- way. The
permittee shall discuss with the Director, its excavation master plan, and
identify planned major excavation work in the town. The Director may make his
or her own record on a map, drawing or other documentation, of each permittee’s
planned major excavation work in the town; provided, however, that, no such
document prepared by the Director shall identify a particular entity, or the
planned major excavation work of that particular entity. The permittee shall
meet with the Director to discuss an initial excavation master plan no later
than 60 days after submitting its first permit application. Thereafter, each
permittee shall submit annually, on the first regular business day of January,
a revised and updated excavation master plan. Such revised and updated plan
shall be submitted in both hard copy and digital format. As used in this
section, the term PLANNED MAJOR EXCAVATION WORK refers to any future
excavations planned by the permittee when the excavation master plan or update
is submitted that will affect any town right-of-way for more than five days;
provided that, the permittee shall not be required to identify future major
excavations planned to occur more than three years after the date that the
permittee’s master plan or update is discussed. Between the annual meetings to
discuss planned major excavation work, the permittee shall use its bests
efforts to inform the Director of any substantial changes in the planned major
excavation work discussed at the annual meeting.
   (C)   The Director shall prepare a repaving plan showing the street
resurfacing planned by the town. For purposes of this section, the repaving
plan shall include a landscaping or other right-of-way improvement plan. The
repaving plan shall be revised and updated on an annual basis after meeting to
discuss the permittee’s and town department’s master plans and updates. The
Director shall make the town’s repaving plan available for public inspection.
In addition, after determining the street resurfacing work that is proposed for
each year, the Director shall send a notice of the proposed work to all
permittees that have had an annual meeting with the Director.
   (D)   Prior to applying for a permit, any person planning to excavate in the
town’s rights-of-way shall review the town’s repaving plan on file with the
Director and shall coordinate, to the extent practicable, with the utility and
street work shown on such plans to minimize damage to, and avoid undue
disruption and interference with the public use of such rights-of-way.
   (E)   In performing location of facilities in the public rights-of-way in
preparation for construction under a permit, the permittee shall compile all
information obtained regarding its or any other facilities in the public
rights-of-way related to a particular permit, and shall make that information
available to the town in a written and verified format acceptable to the
Director. If the permittee fails to provide the locate information requested by
the town, the town may obtain this information and charge the Permittee the
actual costs for obtaining the information.
   (F)   Prior to undertaking any work in the rights-of-way or related
landscaping, the town may notify all permittees of the town work to be
performed. Upon such notification, all permittees shall, within seven days,
locate their facilities in the rights-of-way in which the work will be
performed and provide documentation in a format acceptable to the Director of
the permittee’s facilities in that right-of-way.
(Prior Code, § 165.15) (Ord. 503, passed 7-7-2005; Ord. 577, passed 11-6-2014)
§ 153.036 MINIMIZING IMPACTS OF WORK IN RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   (A)   Relocation and protection of utilities.
      (1)   Before beginning excavation in any public way, a permittee shall
contact the Utility Notification Center of Colorado (UNCC) and, to the extent
required by C.R.S. §§ 9-1.5-102 et seq., make inquiries of all ditch companies,
utility companies, districts, local government departments and all other
agencies that might have facilities in the area of work to determine possible
conflicts. The permittee shall contact the UNCC and request field locations of
all facilities in the area pursuant to UNCC requirements.
      (2)   Field locations shall be marked prior to commencing work. The
permittee shall support and protect all pipes, conduits, poles, wires or other
apparatus which may be affected by the work from damage during construction or
settlement of trenches subsequent to construction.
   (B)   Noise, dust, debris, hours of work. Each permittee shall conduct work
in such manner as to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and annoyance to the
general public and occupants of neighboring property. In the performance of the
work, the permittee shall take appropriate measures to reduce noise, dust and
unsightly debris. No Work shall be done between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 7:00
a.m. nor at any time on Saturday or Sunday, except with the written permission
of the Director, or in case of an emergency.
   (C)   Trash and construction materials. Each permittee shall maintain the
work site so that:
      (1)   Trash and construction materials are contained so that they are not
blown off of the construction site;

does not become a health, fire or safety hazard or public nuisance; and
      (3)   Trash dumpsters and storage or construction trailers are not placed
in the street without specific approval of the Director.
   (D)   Deposit of dirt and material on roadways. Each permittee shall utilize
their best efforts to eliminate the tracking of mud or debris upon any street
or sidewalk. Streets and sidewalks shall be cleaned of mud and debris at the
end of each day. All equipment and trucks tracking mud and debris into the
right-of-way shall be cleaned of mud and debris at the end of each day or as
directed by the Director.
   (E)   Protection of trees and landscaping. Each permittee shall protect
trees, landscape and landscape features as required by the town. All protective
measures shall be provided at the expense of the permittee.
   (F)   Protection of paved surfaces from equipment damage. Backhoe equipment
outriggers shall be fitted with rubber pads whenever outriggers are placed on
any paved surface. Tracked vehicles that will damage pavement surfaces are not
permitted on paved surface unless specific precautions are taken to protect the
surface. The permittee will be responsible for any damage caused to the
pavement by the operation of such equipment and shall repair such surfaces.
Failure to do so will result in the use of the applicant’s performance/warranty
guarantee by the town to repair any damage and, possibly, the requirement of
additional warranty(s).
   (G)   Protection of property. Each permittee shall protect from injury any
adjoining property by providing adequate support and taking other necessary
measures. The permittee shall, at its own expense, shore up and protect all
buildings, walls, fences or other property likely to be damaged during the
Work, and shall be responsible for all damage to public or private property
resulting from failure to properly protect and carry out work in the public
way.
   (H)   Clean-up. As the work progresses, all public rights-of-way and private
property shall be thoroughly cleaned of all rubbish, excess dirt, rock and
other debris. All clean-up operations shall be done at the expense of the
permittee.
   (I)   Preservation of monuments. A permittee shall not disturb any surface
monuments, property marks or survey hubs and points found on the line of work
unless approval is obtained from the Director. Any monuments, hubs and points
disturbed will be replaced by a state-registered land surveyor at the
permittee’s expense.
   (J)   Parking. Each permittee shall make provisions for employee and
construction vehicle parking so that neighborhood parking adjacent to a work
site is not impacted.
   (K)   Unobstructed walkway. Each permittee shall maintain an adequate and
safe unobstructed walkway around a construction site or blocked sidewalk. Such
provision shall be included in the traffic control plan.
   (L)   Clearing sidewalks. Each permittee shall clear all snow and ice
hazards from public sidewalks at the work site within 48 hours following a
snowfall.

§ 153.038 RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   If at any time the town requests the permittee to relocate is facilities, in
order to allow the town to make any public use of rights-of-way, or if at any
time it shall become necessary because of a change in the grade or for any
other purpose by reason of the improving, repairing, constructing or
maintaining of any rights-of-way, or reason of traffic conditions, public
safety or by reason of installation of any type of structure of public
improvement the town or other public agency or special district, and any
general program for the undergrounding of such facilities, to move or change
the permittee’s facilities within or adjacent to rights-of-way in any manner,
either temporarily or permanently, the town shall notify the permittee at least
90 days in advance, except in the case of emergencies, of the town’s intention
to perform or have such work performed. The permittee shall thereupon, at no
cost to the town, accomplish the necessary relocation, removal or change within
a reasonable time from the date of the notification, but in no event later than
three working days prior to the date the town has notified the permittee that
it intends to commence its work or immediately in the case of emergencies. Upon
the permittee’s failure to accomplish such work, the town or other public
agencies or special district may perform such work at the permittee’s expense
and the permittee shall reimburse the town or other agency within 30 days after
receipt of a written invoice. Following relocation, all affected property shall
be restored to, at a minimum, the condition which existed prior to construction
by the permittee at the permittee’s expense. Notwithstanding the requirements
of this chapter, a permittee may request additional time to complete a
relocation project. The Director shall grant a reasonable extension if, in his
or her sole discretion, the extension will not adversely affect the town’s
project.

§ 153.070 DEGRADATION COSTS.
   (A)   The formula for degradation costs is provided in Table 1 – 30-year
design standard. Table 2 illustrates a hypothetical calculation.
      (1)   Table 1: Cost of recovery method (30-year street design standard)
 
Cost of Recovery Method (30-Year Street Design Standard)
Cost per square yard for streets, overlays and sealcoats
X depreciation rate X area of influence (1)
Depreciation Rates         Cost Per Square Yard (3)
Street (2)        Overlays Type                   Cost
Age Rate Age Rate Age Rate Asphalt reconstruction $45
Cost of Recovery Method (30-Year Street Design Standard)
(1) Area of influence is equal to area of the cut plus 3 feet on each
side (expressed in square yards)
(2) Depreciation rates are based on a 30-year street design standard.
Depreciation for the first 5 years is 1% per year, followed by straight
line depreciation less 15% for the remaining street design standard (25
years).
(3) Depreciation can occur at 1% per year after this time for up to 15
years or street reconstruction, whichever occurs first.
 
      (2)   Table 2: Recommended cost of recovery method.
Recommended Cost of Recovery Method
Cost per square yard for streets, overlays and sealcoats
