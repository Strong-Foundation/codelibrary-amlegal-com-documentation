VAIL TOWN CHARTER
PREFATORY SYNOPSIS
   The Charter Commission of the Town of Vail, Colorado, hereby submits to the
voters of the Town the Home Rule Charter which has been framed in conformity
with Article XX of the Colorado Constitution and the Municipal Home Rule Act of
1971.
   The philosophy of the commission throughout the drafting of this document
has been that the people of Vail will elect a town council composed of men and
women whose intelligence, honesty and integrity will provide the high level of
leadership necessary to ensure Vail’s future as a quality community. This
Charter therefore provides for and encourages citizen involvement and
participation in matters of local government. Further, the Charter reflects a
broad granting of powers which, unless specifically restricted herein, are
intended to be as inclusive as permitted by the state constitution.
   This Charter provides for basic Council-Manager form of government. The
council shall consist of seven members, including a mayor who shall be elected
by the council for a two-year term. A majority of the council (four members)
shall be elected every two years, thereby providing continuity of government
while at the same time ensuring maximum responsiveness to the voters.
   The full legislative power of the municipal government shall be vested in
the council, and the executive responsibilities shall rest with the town
manager, who is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the council.
   The commission recognizes that the community of Vail is unique in that it
places greater emphasis on aesthetic, environmental, promotional and
recreational concerns than are traditional in most municipal governments. This
Charter is intended to provide the enduring framework within which these
concerns can best be implemented. This Charter is, therefore, fundamentally
founded in the belief that the quality of life of the people of Vail shall
continue and be enhanced through progressive municipal government.
PREAMBLE
   We, the people of the town of Vail, Colorado, under the authority of the
constitution of the state of Colorado and the municipal home rule act of 1971,
and in order to exercise the rights, privileges and responsibilities of self-
government granted to us by the said constitution and act do ordain and
establish this home rule charter for the town of Vail, Colorado.

(1972 Charter)

of the town are pledged, shall be issued, except in pursuance of an ordinance,

   Revenue bonds issued for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, improving
or extending any municipal utility system or other income-producing project may
be issued without an election and may be made payable solely from the net
revenues derived from the operation of such system or project. Any two (2) or
more of such systems or projects may be combined, operated and maintained
jointly, in which case such revenue bonds shall be made payable out of the net
revenues derived from the operation of the joint enterprise. Neither a failure
of the town historically to have maintained a special fund for any such
existing municipal utility system or other income-producing project nor a
previous commingling of revenues deriving from the operation thereof with the
general fund of the town shall prevent a pledge of such revenues for the
payment of revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section or the issuance of
such bonds without an election, provided that such a special fund is created
prior to or contemporaneously with the issuance of such revenue bonds and
thereafter maintained separate and apart from the general fund.
   Revenue bonds issued for any public purpose of the town may be made payable
solely from all or a portion of the proceeds of any tax, other than a general
property tax, imposed by or payable to the town. Neither a failure of the town
historically to have maintained special funds into which the proceeds of such
existing taxes are deposited nor a previous commingling of such tax proceeds
with the general fund of the town shall prevent a pledge of such revenues for
the payment of revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section or the issuance of
such bonds without an election, provided that such special funds are created
prior to or contemporaneously with the issuance of such revenue bonds and
thereafter maintained separate and apart from the general fund.
   Nothing herein shall be construed so as to prevent the issuance of revenue
bonds pursuant to this section for any of the purposes specified in the first
paragraph of this section which are payable from both system or project
revenues and the proceeds of the taxes herein specified. Revenue bonds issued
pursuant to this section may also be secured by a pledge of the full faith and
credit of the town or of general property taxes; however, except for such bonds
issued for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, extending or improving any
municipal utility system, no such bonds shall be issued until the question of
their issuance shall have been approved at an election as required by
section 10.4 of this charter. Revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section may
also be secured by a pledge of the governmental grants received or to be
received from the United States Of America or any agency thereof or from the
state of Colorado or any agency thereof or by a pledge of grant receipts
together with any other revenues or taxes as herein provided.
(1972 Charter)
Section 10.7 - Refunding Bonds:
   The council may authorize, by ordinance, without an election, the issuance
of refunding bonds or other like securities for the purpose of refunding any of
the bonded indebtedness of the town of Vail, whether due or not, or which has
or may become payable at the option of the town, or by the consent of the bond
holders or by any lawful means, whether such bonded indebtedness be now
existing or may hereafter be created. The proceeds derived from the issuance of
any refunding bonds under the provisions of this section shall either be
immediately applied to the payment, or redemption, and retirement of the bonds
to be refunded, and the costs and expenses incident thereto, or shall
immediately be placed in escrow to be applied to the payment of said bonds upon
their presentation therefor, and the costs and expenses incident thereto, as
may be provided by the town council. Any funds of the town legally available
therefore may be placed in any escrow account established under the provisions

special or local improvements of every character against benefited property
within designated districts in the town by:
   (a)   Order of council, subject however, to protest by a majority of the
owners of property in the proposed district; or
   (b)   On a petition by a majority of the owners of property in the proposed
district.   
   In either event, a public hearing shall be held at which all interested
parties may appear and be heard. Right to protest and notice of public hearing
shall be given as provided by council by ordinance. Such improvements shall
confer special benefits to the real or personal property within said district
and general benefits to the town at large. The council shall have the power by
ordinance without an election to prescribe the method of making such
improvements, of assessing the cost thereof, and of issuing bonds for cost of
constructing or installing such improvements including the cost incidental
thereto.
   Where all outstanding bonds of a special or local improvement district have
been paid and any monies remain to the credit of the district, they shall be
transferred to a special surplus and deficiency fund and whenever there is a
deficiency in any special or local improvement district fund to meet the
payments of outstanding bonds and interest due thereon, the deficiency may be
paid out of said surplus and deficiency fund. However, subject to the
requirements of any covenants contained in any ordinance authorizing the
issuance of special or local improvement district bonds, the town shall not be
obligated to make such transfers of payments or maintain the special surplus
and deficiency fund. Whenever a special or local improvement district has paid
and cancelled three-fourths of its bond issued, and for any reason the
remaining assessments are not paid in time to take up the remaining bonds of
the district and the interest due thereon and there are not sufficient monies
in the special surplus and deficiency fund, then the town shall pay said bonds
when due and the interest thereon, and reimburse itself by collecting the
unpaid assessments due said district.
   In consideration of general benefits conferred upon the town at large from
the construction and installation of improvements in improvement districts, the
council may levy annual taxes without an election on all taxable property
within the town at a rate to be determined by the council for the purpose of
advancing monies to maintain current payments of interest and equal annual
payments to the principal amount of bonds issued for any improvement district
hereafter created. The proceeds of such taxes shall be placed in a special fund
and shall be disbursed only for the purposes specified herein, provided that in
lieu of such tax levies, the council may annually transfer to such special fund
any available monies of the town.

unanimous recommendation of such action from the open space board of trustees.
      Once such recommendation is received, the town council shall consider an
ordinance referring such question of disposal of designated open space to the
registered electors at a town election for their acceptance or rejection. The
ordinance shall give the location of the land in question and the intended
disposal thereof. Every such ordinance shall require the affirmative vote of
three-fourths of the entire council for passage. The vote of the town on
proposed disposal of designated open space shall be held not less than thirty
days and not later than ninety days from the date of the final council vote
thereon. If no regular town election is to be held within the period prescribed
in this subsection, the council shall provide for a special election;
otherwise, the vote shall be held at the same time as such regular election,
except that the council may at its discretion provide for a special election at
an earlier date within the prescribed period. Copies of the proposed ordinance
to dispose of designated open space shall be made available to the public
within a reasonable time before the election and also at the polls at the time

applicable to every section of this code the same as though it were a part of
each and every separate section.
   (B)   One judgment only. In all cases where the same offense is made
punishable or is created by different clauses or sections of this code, the
prosecuting officer may elect under which to proceed, but not more than one
recovery shall be had against the same person for the same offense; provided,
that the revocation of a license or permit shall not be considered a recovery
or penalty so as to bar any other penalty being enforced.
   (C)   Breach of provisions. Whenever the doing of any act or the omission to
do any act constitutes a breach of any section or provision of this code and
there shall be no fine or penalty specifically declared for such breach, the
provisions of this chapter shall apply.
(1997 Code)
§ 1-4-3 LIABILITY OF OFFICERS.
   No provision of this code designating the duties of any officer or employee
shall be so construed as to make such officer or employee liable for any fine
or penalty provided for a failure to perform such duty, unless the intention of
the Town Council to impose such fine or penalty on such officer or employee is
specifically and clearly expressed in the section creating the duty.
(1997 Code)
§ 1-4-4 RESTITUTION.
   (A)   The purpose of this section is to provide for and collect full
restitution for victims of those municipal ordinance offenses that are under
the jurisdiction of the town’s municipal court in the most expeditious manner.
It is the intent of the Town Council that restitution be timely ordered,
collected and disbursed to victims, and this section shall be liberally
construed to accomplish such intent.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the
following meanings.
      CONVICTION. A guilty verdict, a plea of guilty or nolo contendere that is
accepted by the municipal court, and a deferred judgment and sentence which has
not been successfully completed, for any violation of this code.
      PROXIMATELY CAUSED. A cause which in the natural and probable sequence
produced the claimed injury and without which the claimed injury would not have
been sustained.
      RESTITUTION. A pecuniary loss suffered by a victim and proximately caused
by a defendant’s conduct, including, without limitation: all out of pocket
expenses, interest, loss of use of money, anticipated future expenses, rewards
paid by victims, money advanced by law enforcement agencies, extraordinary
public and private investigative costs, money advanced by a governmental agency
for a service animal, adjustment expenses, overtime wages for peace officers or
other government employees, operating expenses for equipment such as protective
clothing, costs to remove, clean up or remediate a place used to manufacture or
attempt to manufacture a controlled substance or which contains a controlled
substance or which contains chemicals; costs to store, preserve or test
evidence of a controlled substance violation; and costs incurred to sell and
provide for the care of and provision for an animal disposed of under any
applicable animal cruelty law. RESTITUTION does not include damages for
physical or mental pain and suffering, loss of consortium, loss of enjoyment of
life, loss of future earnings or punitive damages.
      VICTIM. A person aggrieved by the conduct of an offender, including,
without limitation: a person against whom a violation of this code has been
perpetrated or attempted; a person harmed by an offender’s conduct in the
course of a scheme, conspiracy or pattern of criminal activity; a person,
including an insurer, who has suffered losses because of a contractual
relationship with a victim; a victim compensation board that has paid a victim
compensation claim; and if any victim is deceased or incapacitated, the
victim’s spouse, parent, legal guardian, natural or adopted child, child living
with the victim, sibling, grandparent, significant other or other lawful
representative. VICTIM shall not include a person who is accountable for the
crime or a crime arising from the same conduct, criminal episode or plan. Any
VICTIM under the age of 18 is considered incapacitated, unless that person is
legally emancipated or the court orders otherwise.
   (C)   Every order of conviction shall include one or more of the following:
      (1)   An order of a specific amount of restitution to be paid by the
defendant;
      (2)   An order that the defendant is obligated to pay restitution, but
that the specific amount of restitution shall be determined within 91 days
following the order of conviction, unless good cause is shown for extending
such time period; or
      (3)   A specific finding that no victim suffered a pecuniary loss and
therefore no order for restitution is being ordered.
   (D)   All restitution shall be paid to the town, which shall distribute the
restitution to the victim(s).
   (E)   The municipal court shall base its order for restitution on
information presented by the prosecuting attorney, who shall compile such
information through victim impact statements or other means to determine the
amount of restitution and the identities of the victims. The municipal court
may not order restitution without a hearing at which the prosecution must prove
the amount of the victim’s loss and its causal link to the defendant’s conduct
by a preponderance of the evidence, and at which the defendant may contest
those matters.
   (F)   An order for restitution may be increased if additional victims or
additional losses not known to the judge or the prosecuting attorney at the
time the restitution order was entered are later discovered and the final
amount of restitution due has not been set by the court; and decreased with the
consent of the prosecuting attorney and the victim(s) to whom the restitution
is owed or if the defendant has otherwise compensated the victim(s) for the
pecuniary losses suffered.
   (G)   If more than one defendant owes restitution to the same victim for the
same loss, the restitution order shall be a joint and several obligation of the
defendants.
   (H)   Any amount paid to a victim under an order of restitution shall be set
off against any amount later recovered as compensatory damages by such victim
in a civil proceeding.
   (I)   The municipal court shall order restitution concerning only the
portion of the victim’s pecuniary loss for which the victim cannot be
compensated under a policy of insurance, self-insurance, an indemnity agreement
or a risk management fund. The court, in determining the restitution amount,
shall consider whether the defendant or the vehicle driven by the defendant at
the time of the offense was covered by: a complying policy of insurance or
certificate of self-insurance as required by the laws of the state; self-
insurance; or any other insurance or indemnity agreement that would indemnify
the defendant for any damages sustained by the victim. The municipal court may
award a victim restitution for a deductible amount under a policy of insurance.
   (J)   A victim’s confidential medical and mental health records in the
possession of the prosecuting attorney shall not be provided to the defendant,
but may be provided to the judge for an in camera review. To obtain an in
camera review of such records, a defendant must show:
      (1)   That his or her request is not speculative; and
      (2)   That an in camera review is warranted, because such records may
disprove all or part of the prosecuting attorney’s restitution request on the
basis that the loss was not proximately caused by the defendant’s conduct, or
that such records are otherwise relevant to the allegations pending against the
defendant.

Section
2-2-1 Statement of purpose

2-2-3 Objective
2-2-4 Standards of care
2-2-5 Safekeeping and custody
2-2-6 Suitable and authorized investments
2-2-7 Investment parameters

2-2-9 Policy
§ 2-2-1 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this investment policy is to establish the investment scope,
objectives, delegation of authority, standards of prudence, reporting
requirements, internal controls, eligible investments and transactions,
diversification requirements, risk tolerance, and safekeeping and custodial
procedures for the investment of the funds of the Town of Vail, Colorado
(hereby referred to as the “town”). The investment policy of the Vail Town
Council for the town of Vail represents the financial boundaries within which
its cash management process will operate.
(Ord. 24(2016) § 1)
§ 2-2-2 SCOPE.
   The investment policy applies to all financial funds of the town, except the
Pension Trust Fund.
(Ord. 24(2016) § 2)
§ 2-2-3 OBJECTIVE.
   The primary objectives, in priority of order, of investment activities shall
be:
   (A)   Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the
investment program. Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to
ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. The objective will
be to mitigate credit risk and interest rate risk.
      (1)   Credit risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss due to the failure of
the security issuer or backer. Credit risk may be mitigated by restricting the
types of securities which may be purchased, their credit ratings, and through
diversification to reduce exposure to any one security type or issuer.
      (2)   Interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that the market
value of securities in the portfolio will fall due to changes in general
interest rates. Interest rate risk may be mitigated by holding most investments
to their maturity date, by limiting the types and maturities of permitted
securities and, when feasible, by selecting maturities of investments to
coincide with large cash outflows.
   (B)   Liquidity. The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid
to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. This is
accomplished by structuring the portfolio so that securities mature concurrent
with cash needs to meet anticipated demands (static liquidity). Furthermore,
since all possible cash demands cannot be anticipated, the portfolio should
consist largely of securities with active secondary or resale markets (dynamic
liquidity).
   (C)   Yield. After the objectives of safety and liquidity are met, the
investment portfolio shall be managed with the objective of attaining a market
rate of return throughout interest rate cycles.
      (1)   The core of investments are limited to relatively low risk
securities in anticipation of earning a fair return relative to the risk being
assumed.
      (2)   Speculative investments will not be allowed. Speculative
investments are those attempting to gain market premium appreciation through
short term market volatility resulting in increased risk and loss exposure. The
town will not purchase a security which cannot be held to maturity. This does
not mean an investment cannot be sold prior to maturity.
(Ord. 24(2016) § 3)
§ 2-2-4 STANDARDS OF CARE.
   (A)   Prudence.
      (1)   The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall
be the “prudent person” standard and shall be applied in the context of
managing an overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with
written procedures and this investment policy and exercising due diligence
shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s
credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are
reported in a timely fashion and the liquidity and the sale of securities are
carried out in accordance with the terms of this policy.
      (2)   Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under
circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
   (B)   Ethics and conflicts of interest. Officers and employees involved in
the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could
conflict with the proper execution and management of the investment program, or
that could impair their ability to make impartial decisions. Employees and
investment officials shall disclose any material interest in financial
institutions with which they conduct business. They shall further disclose any
personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the
performance of the investment portfolio. Employees and officers shall refrain
from undertaking personal investments transactions with the same individual
with whom business is conducted on behalf of their entity.
   (C)   Delegation of authority.
      (1)   Management responsibility for the investment program is held by the
Town Manager and appointed designees. No employee may engage in an investment
transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and any
procedures which may be established by the Town Manager. The Town Manager shall
review the quarterly investment report (see §
2-2-8 of this chapter).
      (2)   There is hereby created an Investment Committee, consisting of the
Town Manager, Finance Director and the Finance Controller or such comparable
positions as may exist from time to time. Members of the Committee will meet at
least quarterly to determine general strategies and to monitor results. Minutes
of the decisions made by the Investment Committee shall be kept on file in the
Town Clerk’s office. The Committee shall include in its review and
deliberations such topics as: potential risks; authorized depositories; rate of
return; maturity structure; and investment transactions.
      (3)   It shall be the duty of the Finance Director or his or her
appointed designee to manage the day to day operations of the portfolio, and
place actual purchase/sell orders with institutions. In the absence of the
Finance Director, an appointed designee shall assume these duties. The Finance
Director or his or her appointed designee shall maintain internal procedures
for investing which provide appropriate investment and accounting controls and
which shall be available for review annually by the independent auditor.
      (4)   Management of a portion of the portfolio and placing of buy/sell
orders for a portion of the portfolio may be delegated to an independent
investment manager designated by the Town Council. The transactions of any
selected independent investment manager will be subject to the town’s
investment policy and will be reviewed and verified by the Finance Department.
      (5)   The authority for the investment philosophy and selection of
investment managers for the Town of Vail employee pension plan and the Town of
Vail police and fire employees pension plan shall be the responsibility of the
“pension plan trustee” as defined in the pension plan document.
(Ord. 3(1997) § 1; Ord. 24(2016) § 4)
§ 2-2-5 SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY.
   (A)   Authorized financial dealer and institution.
      (1)   Qualified banks can only be commercial banks and the town’s
investment with the bank may be in excess of $250,000 or whatever amount is
currently insured by the FDIC. The town’s Finance Director or his or her
appointed designee shall obtain and review whatever documents are necessary to
verify the bank’s continued stability including the monthly listing of
securities pledged for collateralization to monitor the bank’s
collateralization of town deposits.
      (2)   Nonqualified banks can be either commercial banks or savings and
loans or savings banks and the town’s investment with the bank will not be in
excess of $250,000 or whatever amount is currently insured by the FDIC. The
Finance Director or his or her appointed designee shall inquire with bank
officials and/or review an independent bank evaluation to determine the bank
meets the standard selection criteria established by the Investment Committee.
      (3)   The town has selected a primary bank, which bank the town uses to
process daily deposits and checks. It is the responsibility of the Investment
Committee to determine that the bank continues to meet the Committee’s standard
selection criteria. At the discretion of the Investment Committee, whether the
bank continues to meet the criteria or not, a new bank may be selected as the
primary bank. A formal request for proposal should be used in the selection
process.
      (4)   The town shall maintain a list of banks and securities dealers
approved for securities transactions initiated by the town, and it shall be the
policy of the town to purchase securities only from those authorized firms.
Securities dealers not affiliated with a bank shall be required to be
classified as reporting dealers affiliated with the New York Federal Reserve
Bank, as primary dealers. Broker/dealers which are not primary dealers may be
used if they have been approved by the Investment Committee. The Investment
Committee shall develop and document the methodology for qualifying nonprimary
broker/dealers.
   (B)   Internal controls.
      (1)   The Finance Director is responsible for establishing and
maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that the assets of
the entity are protected from loss, theft or misuse. The internal control
structure shall be designed to provide reasonable assurance that these
objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that:
         (a)   The cost of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to
be derived; and
         (b)   The valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and
judgments by management.
      (2)   Accordingly, the Finance Director shall establish a process for
annual independent review by an external auditor to assure compliance with
policies and procedures. The internal controls shall address the following
points.
         (a)   Control of collusion. Collusion is a situation where two or more
employees are working in conjunction to defraud their employer.
         (b)   Separation of transaction authority from accounting and
recordkeeping. By separating the person who authorizes or performs the
transaction from the people who record or otherwise account for the
transaction, a separation of duties is achieved.
         (c)   Custodial safekeeping. Securities purchased from any bank or
dealer shall be placed with an independent third party designated as primary
agent for custodial safekeeping. The primary agent shall issue a safekeeping
receipt to the town listing the specific instrument, rate, maturity and other
information. Securities may be purchased from the primary agent’s brokerage
department and kept safe by the same bank’s trust department.
         (d)   Avoidance of physical delivery securities. Book entry securities
are much easier to transfer and account for since actual delivery of a document
never takes place. Delivered securities must be properly safeguarded against
loss or destruction. The potential for fraud and loss increases with physically
delivered securities.
         (e)   Clear designation of authority to subordinate staff members.
Subordinate staff members must have a clear understanding of their authority
and responsibilities to avoid improper actions. Clear delegation of authority
also preserves the internal control structure that is contingent on the various
staff positions and their respective responsibilities.
         (f)   Written confirmation of telephone transactions for investments
and wire transfers. Due to the potential for error and improprieties arising
from telephone transactions, all telephone transactions should be supported by
written communications and approved by the appropriate person. Written
communications may be via e-mail or fax if on letterhead and the safekeeping
institution has a list of authorized signatures.
   (C)   Delivery versus payment. All trades where applicable will be executed
by delivery versus payment (DVP). This ensures that securities are deposited in
the eligible financial institution prior to release of funds. Securities will
be held by a third party custodian as evidenced by safekeeping receipts.
(Ord. 3(1997) § 1; Ord. 24(2016) §§ 5, 6)
§ 2-2-6 SUITABLE AND AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS.
   (A)   Types of accounts or securities. The town shall invest in the
following accounts, or securities:
      (1)   (a)   Fully collateralized or insured interest bearing checking
accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit at commercial banks with
amount not to exceed $250,000 or the current FDIC limit if the bank is not
designated as a qualified institution by the Investment Committee; and
         (b)   A commercial bank may use any securities authorized by the
public deposit protection act as collateral.
      (2)   (a)   Certificates of deposit at savings and loan associations
insured by the FDIC or other agency of the federal government with amount not
to exceed $250,000 or the current FDIC limit; and
         (b)   Deposits with savings banks insured by the FDIC with amount not
to exceed $250,000 or the current FDIC limit.
      (3)   (a)   Any security issued by, guaranteed by, or for which the
credit of any of the following is pledged for payment: the United States, a
Federal Farm Credit Bank, the Federal Land Bank, a Federal Home Loan Bank, the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage
Association, or the Government National Mortgage Association;
         (b)   Any security issued by, guaranteed by, or for which the credit
of the following is pledged for payment: an entity or organization which is not
listed in subsection (A)(3)(a) of this section but which is created by, or the
creation of which is authorized by, legislation enacted by the United States
Congress and which is subject to control by the federal government which is at
least as extensive as that which governs an entity or organization listed in
subsection (A)(3)(a) of this section. No security may be purchased pursuant to
this subsection (A)(3)(b)2. unless, at the time of purchase, the security is
rated in its highest rating category by one or more nationally recognized
organizations which regularly rate such obligations.
      (4)   Colorado investment pools: the town may participate in a Colorado
public investment pool, the Colorado Local Government Liquid Asset Trust or
other similar local government pools organized in conformity with C.R.S. Title
24, Article 75, Part 7, which provides specific authority for pooling of local
government funds;
      (5)   Any money market fund that is registered as an investment company
under the Federal Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, if, at the time
the investing public entity invests in such fund:
         (a)   The investment policies of the fund include seeking to maintain
a constant share price; and
         (b)   No sales or load fee is added to the purchase price or deducted
from the redemption price of the investments in the fund.
      (6)   No load mutual funds that invest in mortgage backed securities
issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) or the Federal
National Mortgage Association (FNMA), or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation (FHLMC); and
      (7)   Taxable municipal securities: taxable obligations of political and
governmental subdivisions may be purchased. The issue must be rated at least
“AA” by a nationally recognized security rating organization.
   (B)   Criteria for choice.
      (1)   If a specific maturity date is required for cash flow purposes,
bids will be requested for instruments which meet the maturity requirement. If
no specific maturity is required, a market trend (yield curve) analysis will be
conducted to determine which maturities would be most advantageous. After
selecting a type of instrument at least two bids should be obtained from
similar institutions. Two bids are not required if treasury bills or notes are
purchased at a treasury auction or for overnight or open term repurchase
transactions.

not the highest bidder, provided the bid is not more than 25 basis points below
the highest bidder.
      (3)   The rate of interest must be at least equivalent to the average

town and in most cases it will be a general policy of the town to pool all
available operating cash into a treasury cash management investment portfolio.
However, a specific investment purchased by a specific fund shall incur all
earnings and expenses to that particular fund. Interest earnings from pooled
funds shall be allocated to all participating funds based on the average
monthly cash balance of each fund included in the common portfolio for the
earning period.
   (D)   Funds borrowing from Pooled Cash Fund. All funds may borrow cash from
the pooled cash fund in order to cover shortfalls in their equity in pooled
cash. The interest rate charged shall be equal to the interest rate earned on
the pool at the time the money is borrowed.

environment of stable interest rates. Portfolio performance should be compared
to appropriate benchmarks on a regular basis.

   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CONSIDERATION. The full value of the real property affected by the transfer

contracted to be paid or delivered or conveyed, in return for the transfer of
ownership, title or interests in real property and shall include the amount of
any lien, mortgage, contract indebtedness or other encumbrance or debt, either

addition to full value the amount of any outstanding lien or encumbrance in
favor of the United States, the State of Colorado, or of a municipal or quasi-
government corporation or district for taxes, special benefits or improvements.
In the event the transaction or transfer is by lease agreement not specifically
exempted in §
2-6-5 of this chapter, the consideration shall be deemed to be the capitalized
value of the average annual rental under the lease, computed as follows: the
average annual rental over the entire term of the lease, including any renewal
term, plus the actual consideration, other than rent, paid or to be paid shall
be computed, and the average annual rental shall be 10% of the capitalized
value. The payment of ad valorem real property taxes, insurance and the
assumption of maintenance obligations shall not be included in the annual rent-
capitalization computation; however, capital improvements required to be made
shall be part of the actual consideration. When the average annual rental
cannot be determined, or at the election of the Town Manager, the tax shall be
based upon the assessed value of the property covered by the lease.
   PERSON. Any individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust,
partnership, association or any other legal entity.
   REAL ESTATE TRANSFER TAX. The tax imposed by this chapter on the transfer of
real property.

has possession or the right to possession on payment of rents. TAXABLE LEASE
also means any lease of real property for less than 29 years of term or initial
term and all renewal terms aggregated if lessee has a clause which would permit
lessee at its discretion to extend the lease beyond 29 years or if lessee has
an option to purchase some or all of the real property leased. If lessee has a
lease with such an option to purchase, which option may be exercised only
within three years after the date the lease and option is entered into, then
the real estate transfer tax shall not be due and payable unless and until the
exercise and consummation of such option. If any other lease with such an
option to purchase is entered into, the real estate transfer tax shall be due
and payable at the time of such transfer.
   TRANSFER. Means whether or not the same is in writing or is recorded, and
includes:
      (1)   Any sale, grant, assignment, transfer, exchange or conveyance of
any ownership or title to real property situated in the town; or
      (2)   The sale, letting, conveyance, assignment or transfer for a

§ 4-3-3-2 COLLECTION OF SALES TAX.
   (A)   When due and payable. Every retailer, also in this chapter called
“vendor”, engaged in business in the town shall, irrespective of the provisions
of §
4-3-3-3, be liable and responsible for the payment of an amount equal to 4.5%
of all sales made by such retailer of commodities or services as specified in §
4-3-3-1 and shall before the twentieth day of each month make a return to the
Finance Director for the preceding calendar month and remit an amount equal to
said 4.5% on such sales to said Finance Director. For the purposes of this
subsection (A), all such returns and remittance shall be considered made to the
Finance Director on or before the twentieth day of each month if they are sent
via the United States mail and are postmarked on or before the twentieth day of
each month. If the twentieth day of any month falls on a weekend or holiday,
said return and remittance may be postmarked the following business day. Such
returns of the taxpayer or duly authorized agent shall be furnished by the
Finance Department. The town shall use the standard municipal sales tax
reporting form and any subsequent revisions thereto adopted by the Executive
Director of the Department of Revenue by the first month commencing 120 days
after the effective date of the regulation adopting or revising such standard
form.
   (B)   Quarterly payments negotiable.
      (1)   If the accounting methods regularly employed by the vendor in the
transaction of such business or other conditions are such that the returns of
sales made on a calendar month basis shall impose unnecessary hardship, the
Finance Director, upon written request of the vendor, may accept returns at
such intervals as shall, in his or her opinion, better suit the convenience of
the taxpayer, and shall not jeopardize the collection of the tax.
      (2)   The Finance Director may permit taxpayers whose monthly collective
tax is less than $150 to make returns and pay taxes at intervals not greater
than three months.
   (C)   Maximum allowable grace period. The Finance Director may extend the
date for making a return and paying the taxes due under such reasonable rules
and regulations as may be prescribed therefor but no such extension shall be
for a greater period than as provided in subsection (B) of this section.
   (D)   Proof of exemption by taxpayer. The burden of proving that any
retailer is exempt from collecting the tax on any goods or services sold and
paying the same to the Finance Director, or from making such returns, shall be
on the retailer or vendor under such reasonable requirements of proof as set
forth in the rules and regulations prescribed therefor.
   (E)   Payment proceeds exemption ruling. If a dispute arises between the
purchaser and seller as to whether or not any sale, service or commodity is
exempt from taxation under §
4-3-3-6 of this §
4-3-3, nevertheless the seller shall collect, and the purchaser shall pay the
tax, and the seller shall thereupon issue to the purchaser a receipt or
certification, on forms furnished by the Finance Department, showing the names
of the seller and the purchaser, the items purchased, the date, price, amount
of tax paid, and a brief statement of the claim of exemption. The purchaser
thereafter may apply to the Finance Director for a refund of such taxes, and it
is then the duty of the Finance Director to determine the question of
exemption. The purchaser may request a hearing pursuant to this chapter, and
the final determination of the Finance Director may either be appealed to the
District Court pursuant to this chapter or the Department of Revenue pursuant
to this chapter.
   (F)   Double taxation prohibited. The town’s sales tax shall not apply to
the sale of tangible personal property at retail or the furnishing of services
if the transaction was previously subjected to a sales or use tax lawfully
imposed on the purchaser or user by another statutory or home rule municipality
equal to or in excess of the sales tax required to be paid pursuant to §
4-3-3-3 of this §
4-3-3. A credit shall be granted against the town’s sales tax with respect to
such transaction equal in amount to the lawfully imposed local sales or use tax
previously paid by the purchaser or user to the previous statutory or home rule
municipality. The amount of the credit shall not exceed the amount of the sales
tax required to be paid pursuant to §
4-3-3-3 of this §
4-3-3.
   (G)   Special sales tax on tobacco and nicotine products. Every retailer or
vendor engaged in the business of selling nicotine products or tobacco products
in the town, as those terms are defined in C.R.S. §§ 39-28-202 and 18-13-121,
shall be liable and responsible for the payment of an amount equal to $0.15 per
cigarette sold or $3 per pack of 20 cigarettes sold, and 40% on the price paid
for all other nicotine products and tobacco products, and shall before the
twentieth day of each month make a return to the Finance Director for the
preceding calendar month, together with remittance of all amounts due
hereunder. For purposes of this subsection (G), all such returns and remittance
shall be considered timely made to the Finance Director if they are submitted-
on or before the twentieth day of the month. If the twentieth day of any month
falls on a weekend or holiday, said return and remittance may be submitted the
following business day. The special sales tax levied by this section shall be
subject to all other provisions of this chapter.

Ord. 26(2021) §4)
Editor’s note:
   The effective date of Ordinance 27(2005) is January 1, 2006.
§ 4-3-3-3 SALES TAX BASE; SCHEDULE OF SALES TAX.
   (A)   Full purchase price taxable. Except as otherwise provided in this
subsection, the sales tax is imposed on the full purchase price of articles
sold after manufacture or after having been made to order, and includes the
full purchase price for material used and the service performed in connection
therewith, excluding, however, such articles as are otherwise exempted in this
chapter. In connection with the transaction referred to in §
4-3-1-2 of this chapter, definition of “purchase or sale”, the sales tax is
imposed only on the amount of any increase in the fair market value of such
assets resulting from the manufacturing, fabricating or physical changing of
the assets by the transferor corporation. Except as otherwise provided in this
subsection (A), the sales price is the gross value of all materials, labor and
service, and the profit thereon, included in the price charged to the user or
consumer.
   (B)   Percentage of tax. There is imposed upon all sales of commodities and
services specified in §
4-3-3-1, a tax at the rate of 4.5% of the amount of the sale, to be computed in
accordance with the schedules or system set forth in the rules and regulations
prescribed therefor. Said schedules or systems shall be designed so that no
such tax is charged on any sale of $0.24 or less.
   (C)   Tax distinct from price; exceptions. Except as provided in subsection
(C)(1) of this section, retailers shall add the tax imposed, or the average
equivalent thereof, to the sale price or charge, showing such tax as a separate
and distinct item, and when added, such tax shall constitute a part of such
price or charge and shall be a debt from the consumer or user to the retailer
until paid and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other debts.
      (1)   Any retailer selling malt, vinous or spirituous liquors by the
drink may include in his or her sales price the tax levied under this chapter,
except that no retailer shall advertise or hold out to the public in any
manner, directly or indirectly, that such tax is not included as a part of the
sales price to the consumer. The schedule referred to in subsection (B) of this
section shall be used by such retailer in determining amounts to be included in
such sales price. No such retailer shall gain any benefit from the collection
or payment of such tax, nor shall the use of the schedule referred to in
subsection (B) of this section relieve such retailer from liability for payment
of the full amount of the tax imposed pursuant to §
4-3-3-1 of this §
4-3-3.
      (2)   Any retailer of food may include in such sales price the tax levied
under this chapter, except that no retailer shall advertise or hold out to the
public in any manner, directly or indirectly, that such tax is not included as
a part of the sales price to the consumer. All menus or menu boards shall state
“Sales Tax included”.
   (D)   Charitable organization exempted; special accounting sales by
charitable organizations. Charitable organizations selling taxable “tangible
personal property” or services as defined by this code must collect sales tax
and purchasers must pay sales tax on such sales, subject to the conditions set
forth below. It is the desire of the Town Council that the taxes collected by
charitable organizations be retained by that organization as a contribution of
additional funds to be used in the course of that organization’s charitable
service to the community. Therefore, organizations are not required to remit or
report sales tax collections to the town provided that the organization meets
the following criteria:
      (1)   The organization has been authorized in writing by the Internal
Revenue Service as a § 501(c)(3) organization or has been approved in writing
by the Finance Director as being a voluntary, not for profit organization whose
fundraising activities are primarily for the providing of services in Vail;
      (2)   The town sales tax shall be included in the stated selling price
and the total proceeds of the sale of taxable tangible personal property or
services shall be retained and expended by the qualifying organization to
provide charitable services;
      (3)   The activity at which taxable tangible property or service is being
sold is an occasional business activity specifically held for fundraising; and
      (4)   The organization applies to the Town Finance Director on an annual
basis for a special license to be conspicuously displayed at all eligible
fundraising events and provides access to any financial records or documents
necessary to determine compliance with this subsection.

§ 4-3-3-4 CREDIT SALES.
   (A)   Tax computed per payment. In the case of a sale upon credit or a
contract for sale where the price is paid in installments, and title does not
pass until a future date, or a sale secured by a chattel mortgage or a
conditional sale, there shall be paid upon each payment that portion of the
total tax which the amount paid bears in relation to the total purchase price.
   (B)   Sale of accounts receivable; exception to tax. If the retailer
transfers, sells, assigns or otherwise disposes of an account receivable, then
the retailer shall be deemed to have received the full balance of the
consideration for the original sale and shall be liable for the remittance of
the sales tax on the balance of the total sale price not previously reported,
except that such transfer, sale, assignment or other disposition of an account
receivable by a retailer to a “closely held subsidiary”, as defined in §
4-3-1-2 of this chapter, definition of “purchase or sale”, shall not be deemed
to require the retailer to pay the sales tax on the credit sale represented by
the account transferred prior to the time that the customer makes payment on
said account.
(Ord. 45(1991) § 1)
§ 4-3-3-5 BAD DEBT CHARGE-OFFS.
   Taxes paid on gross taxable sales represented by accounts found to be
worthless and actually charged off for income tax purposes may be credited upon
a subsequent payment of the tax provided in this chapter, but if any such
accounts are thereafter collected by the taxpayer, then a tax shall be paid
upon the amounts so collected.

whichever is greater, and interest on such delinquent taxes at the rate of 1%
per month from the time the return was due. If any part of the deficiency is
due to fraud with the intent to evade the tax, then there shall be added 100%
of the total amount deficiency and in such case, the whole amount of the tax
unpaid, including the additions, shall become due and payable ten days after
written notice and demand by the Finance Director, and an additional 3% per
month on said amount shall be added from the date that the return was due until
paid.
      (2)   Promptly thereafter, the Finance Director shall give to the
delinquent taxpayer written notice of such estimated taxes, penalty and
interest, which notice of assessment shall be sent by first class mail directed
to the last address of such person on file with the Finance Department. Such
estimate shall thereupon become a notice of deficiency. Within 30 days after
the notice of deficiency is mailed, the taxpayer may petition the Finance
Director for a hearing in the manner provided in §
4-3-6-1 of this chapter and either may appeal to the District Court as provided
in §
4-3-6-2 of this chapter or to the Department of Revenue as provided in §
4-3-6-3 of this chapter.
   (C)   Delinquent tax a lien.
      (1)   If any taxes, penalty or interest imposed by this chapter and shown
due by returns filed by the taxpayer or as shown by assessments duly made as
provided in this section are not paid within five days after the same are due,
then the Finance Director shall issue a notice, setting forth the name of the
taxpayer, the amount of the tax, penalties and interest, and the date of the
accrual thereof, and the town claims a first and prior lien therefor on the
real and tangible personal property of the taxpayer except as to preexisting
claims or liens of a bona fide mortgagee, pledgee, judgment creditor or
purchaser whose rights have attached prior to the filing of the notice as
provided in this section on property of the taxpayer, other than the goods,
stock in trade, and business fixtures of such taxpayer.
      (2)   Said notice shall be on forms furnished by the Finance Department
and shall be verified by the Town Manager or by the Finance Director or any
duly qualified agent of the Town Manager or the Finance Director, whose duties
are the collection of such tax, and may be filed in the office of the County
Clerk and Recorder in which the taxpayer owns real or tangible personal
property, and the filing of such notice shall create a lien on such property in
that county and constitute notice thereof. After said notice has been filed, or
concurrently therewith, or at any time when taxes due are unpaid, whether such
notice shall have been filed or not, the Finance Director may issue a warrant
directed to any duly authorized revenue collector, or the sheriff of the county
commanding him or her to levy upon, seize, and sell sufficient of the real and
personal property of the amount due together with interests, penalties and
costs, as may be provided by law, subject to valid preexisting claims or liens.
   (D)   Recovery of costs by county. Such revenue collector or the sheriff
shall forthwith levy upon sufficient of the property of the taxpayer or any
property used by such taxpayer in conducting such taxpayer’s retail business,
and said property so levied upon shall be sold in all aspects to with like
effect and in the same manner as is prescribed by law with respect to
executions against property upon judgment of a court of record, and the
remedies of garnishment shall apply. The sheriff shall be entitled to such fee
in executing such warrants as are allowed by law for similar services.
   (E)   Lien released by county. Any lien for taxes as shown on the records of
the County Clerks and Recorders as provided in this section, upon payment of
all taxes, penalties and interest covered thereby shall be released by the
Finance Director in the same manner as mortgages and judgments are released.
   (F)   Costs recovered by town.
      (1)   The Finance Director may also treat any such taxes, penalties or
interest due and unpaid as debt due to the town from the vendor. The return of
the taxpayer or the assessment made by the Finance Director, as provided in
this chapter, shall be prima facie proof of the amount due.
      (2)   To recover such taxes, penalties or interest due, the Finance
Director may bring an action in attachment, and a writ of attachment may be
issued to the sheriff. In any such proceedings, no bond shall be required of
the Finance Director, nor shall any sheriff require of the Finance Director an
indemnifying bond for executing the writ of attachment or writ of execution
upon any judgment entered in such proceedings. The Finance Director may
prosecute appeals in such cases without the necessity of providing bond
thereof. It is the duty of the Town Attorney, when requested by the Finance
Director, to commence action for the recovery of taxes due under this chapter,
and this remedy shall be in addition to all other existing remedies or remedies
provided in this chapter.
   (G)   Town is defendant. In any action affecting the title to real estate or
the ownership or rights to possession of personal property, the town may be
made a party defendant for the purpose of obtaining an adjudication or
determination of its lien upon the property involved therein. In any such
action, service of summons upon the Finance Director or any person of the
office of the Finance Director shall be sufficient service and shall be binding
upon the town.
   (H)   Waiver. The Finance Director is authorized to waive, for good cause
shown, any penalty and interest assessed as provided in this chapter.
   (I)   Payment by insufficient funds check. If a taxpayer pays for any tax
imposed pursuant to this chapter by check for which there are insufficient
funds to cover such check, then the Finance Director may assess a penalty
against such taxpayer as follows:
      (1)   Fifteen dollars for the first violation;
      (2)   Thirty dollars for the second violation; and
      (3)   Seventy five dollars for each additional violation. If a penalty of
$35 or more has been assessed against a taxpayer by the Finance Director, then
the Finance Director may require such taxpayer to pay all tax payments, whether
due or to be due in the future by certified funds, cashier’s check or cash. The
penalty imposed by this subsection is in addition to all other penalties
imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   (J)   Enforce collection. If any person, firm or corporation liable for the
payment of any tax covered by this chapter has repeatedly failed, neglected or
refused to pay the same within the time specified for such payment, and the
town has been required to issue distraint warrants to enforce the collection of
any taxes due from such taxpayer, the Finance Director is hereby authorized to
assess and collect the amount of such taxes due, together with all interest and
penalties provided therefor by law, and also, the following additional
penalties for recurring distraint warrants:
      (1)   Three, four or five consecutive distraint warrants issued: 15% of
the delinquent taxes, interest and penalties due or the sum of $25, whichever
is greater; and
      (2)   Six or more consecutive distraint warrants: 30% of the delinquent
taxes, interest, and penalties due or the sum of $50, whichever is greater.
(Ord. 45(1991) § 1; Ord. 13(2010) § 3)
§ 4-3-5-2 TAX LIEN.
   (A)   Tax procedure when business sold or closed.
      (1)   The sales tax imposed pursuant to §
4-3-3 of this chapter, shall be a first and prior lien upon the tangible
personal property and business fixtures of or used by any retailer under lease,
title retaining contract or other contract arrangement, excepting stock of
goods sold or for sale in the ordinary course of business, and shall take
precedence on all such property over other liens or claims of whatsoever kind
or nature.
      (2)   Any retailer who sells out his or her business or stock of goods,
or quits business, shall be required to make out the return as provided in this
chapter within ten days after the date such person sold his or her business or
stock of goods, or quit business, and his or her successor in business shall be
required to withhold sufficient purchase money to cover the amount of said
taxes due and unpaid until such time as the former owner produces a receipt
from the Finance Director showing that the taxes have been paid or a
certificate that no taxes are due.
      (3)   If the purchaser of a business or stock of goods fails to withhold
the purchase money as provided in subsection (A)(2) of this section and the
taxes are due and unpaid after the ten-day period allowed, such person, as well
as the vendor, shall be personally liable for the payment of the taxes unpaid
by the former owner. Likewise, anyone who takes any stock of goods or business
fixtures of or used by any retailer under lease, title retaining contract or
other contract arrangement, by purchase, foreclosure sale, or otherwise, takes
the same subject to the lien for any delinquent sales taxes owned by such
retailer and shall be liable for payment of all delinquent sales taxes of such
prior owner, not, however, exceeding the value of property so taken or
acquired.
   (B)   Tax procedure for bankruptcy, receivership, assignment. Whenever the
business or property owner of any taxpayer subject to this chapter shall be
placed in receivership, bankruptcy or assignment for the benefit of creditors,
or seized under distraint for property taxes, all taxes, penalties and interest
imposed by this chapter and for which said retailer is in any way liable under
the terms of this chapter shall be a prior and preferred claim against all the
property of said taxpayer, except as to preexisting claims or liens of a bona
fide mortgagee, pledgee, judgment creditor or purchaser whose rights shall have
attached prior to the filing of the notice as provided in §
4-3-5-1(C)(2) of this chapter on the property of the taxpayer, other than the
goods, stock in trade, and business fixtures of such taxpayer. No sheriff,
receiver, assignee or other officer shall sell the property of any person
subject to this chapter under process or order of any court without first
ascertaining from the Finance Director the amount of any taxes due and payable
under this chapter, and if there are any such taxes due, owing, or unpaid, it
is the duty of such officer to first pay the amount of said taxes out of the
proceeds of said sale before making payment of any monies to any judgment
creditor or other claims of whatsoever kind or nature, except the costs of the
proceedings and other preexisting claims or liens as provided in this section.
For the purposes of this subsection, “taxpayer” includes “retailer”.
(Ord. 45(1991) § 1; 1997 Code)
§ 4-3-5-3 INTEREST ON TAX PAYMENTS.
   (A)   Commencement of interest. If any amount of sales tax is not paid on or
before the last date prescribed for payment, then interest on such amount at
the rate of 1% per month shall be paid for the period from such last date to
the date paid. The last date prescribed for payment shall be determined without
regard to any extension of time for payment and shall be determined without
regard to any notice and demand for payment issued, by reason of jeopardy,
prior to the last date otherwise prescribed for such payment. In the case of a
tax in which the last date for payment shall be deemed to be the date that the
liability for the tax arises, and in no event shall such date be later than the
date that notice and demand for the tax is made by the Finance Director.
   (B)   Interest due with tax. Interest prescribed under this section and §
4-3-5-1(B) of this chapter shall be paid upon notice and demand and shall be
assessed, collected, and paid in the same manner as the tax to which such
interest is applicable.
   (C)   Overpayment interest recovery. If any portion of a tax is satisfied by
credit of an overpayment, then no interest shall be imposed under this section
on the portion of the tax so satisfied for any period, during which, if the
credit has not been made, interest would have been allowed with respect to such
overpayment.
   (D)   Collection of interest. Interest prescribed under this section and §
4-3-5-1(B) of this chapter on any sales tax may be assessed and collected at
any time during the period within which the tax to which such interest relates
may be assessed and collected.
(Ord. 45(1991) § 1)
§ 4-3-5-4 OTHER REMEDIES.
   No provisions of this chapter shall preclude the town from utilizing any
other lawful penalties or other remedies applicable to the collection of sales
taxes.
(Ord. 45(1991) § 1)
§ 4-3-5-5 JEOPARDY ASSESSMENT AND DEMANDS.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if the Finance Director
finds that collection of the tax will be jeopardized by delay, in the Finance
Director’s discretion, the Finance Director may declare the taxable period
immediately terminated, determine the tax, and issue notice and demand for
payment thereof; and, having done so, the tax shall be due and payable
forthwith, and the Finance Director may proceed immediately to collect such tax
by distraint, levy and sale. Collection may be stayed if the taxpayer gives
such security for payment as shall be satisfactory to the Finance Director.
(Ord. 5(2004) § 1)
§ 4-3-6 HEARINGS AND APPEALS.

a hearing held pursuant to §§
4-3-6-2 and

§ 4-3-6-2 REVIEW BY DISTRICT COURT.
   (A)   Authority. If the petitioner or if an applicant for a refund is
aggrieved at the final decision of the Finance Director then he or she may
proceed to have same reviewed by the District Court. The procedure of review
shall be in accordance with Rule 106(a)(4) of the Colorado Rules of Civil
Procedure.
   (B)   Bond required. Within 15 days after filing a notice of appeal as
provided in this section, the taxpayer shall file with the District Court a
surety bond in twice the amount of the taxes, and other charges stated in the
final decision by the Finance Director that are contested on appeal. The
taxpayer may, at such taxpayer’s option, satisfy the surety bond requirement by
a savings account or deposit in or a certificate of deposit issued by a state
or national bank or by a state or federal savings and loan association, in
accordance with the provisions of C.R.S. § 11-35-101(1), equal to twice the
amount of the taxes, interest and other charges stated in the final decision by
the Finance Director. The taxpayer may, at his or her option, deposit the
disputed amount with the Finance Director in lieu of posting a surety bond. If
such amount is so deposited, no further interest shall accrue on the deficiency
contested during the pendency of the action. At the conclusion of the action,
after appeal to the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals of the state or after
the time for such appeal has expired, the funds deposited shall be, at the
direction of the District Court, either retained by the Finance Director and
applied against the deficiency or returned in whole or part to the taxpayer
with interest at the rate imposed pursuant to §
4-3-5-3 of this chapter. No claim for refund of amounts deposited with the
Finance Director need be made by the taxpayer in order for such amounts to be
repaid in accordance with the direction of the District Court.
   (C)   Writ issuance. The District Court shall have original jurisdiction in
proceedings to review all questions of law and fact determined by the Finance
Director in administering the provisions of this chapter by writ under Rule 106
(a)(4) of the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure. Any writ issued pursuant to
this subsection (C) shall be issued by the Clerk of the District Court upon a
verified petition of the taxpayer filed within 20 days after notice of the
decision of the Finance Director in any such matter. Such writ shall be served
within five days after its issuance and shall be returnable at such time as the
District Court may determine, not less than ten days nor more than 20 days
after the date of issuance of such writ. The Finance Director shall certify the
record of his or her proceedings to the District Court.
   (D)   Appeal of Court decision. The decision of the District Court may be
reviewed in the Supreme Court of the state upon writ of error by any party
thereto.
(Ord. 45(1991) § 1)
§ 4-3-6-3 ALTERNATE REVIEW BY DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE.
   In lieu of the procedure provided for in §
4-3-6-2 of this chapter, the taxpayer may elect a hearing on the Finance
Director’s final decision on a deficiency notice or claim for refund pursuant
to procedure set forth in this section.
   (A)   State hearing defined. As used in this section, STATE HEARING means a
hearing before the Executive Director of the Department of Revenue or a
delegate thereof as provided in C.R.S. § 29-2-106.1(3).
   (B)   Deficiency notice. When the Finance Director asserts that sales tax is
due in an amount greater than the amount paid by a taxpayer, then the Finance
Director shall mail a deficiency notice to the taxpayer by certified mail. The
deficiency notice shall state that additional sales tax is due. The deficiency
notice shall contain notification, in clear and conspicuous type, of the time
limit to file a protest to the notice and that the taxpayer has the right to
elect a state hearing on the deficiency pursuant to C.R.S. § 29-2-106.1(3). Any
protest to the deficiency notice shall be filed with the Finance Director
within 30 days after the date of notice. The taxpayer shall also have the right
to elect a state hearing on the Finance Director’s denial of such taxpayer’s
claim for a refund of sales tax paid.
   (C)   Local remedies unsatisfactory. The taxpayer shall request the state
hearing within 30 days after the taxpayer’s exhaustion of local remedies. The
taxpayer shall have no right to such hearing if such taxpayer has not exhausted
local remedies or if he or she fails to request such hearing within the time
period of this subsection. For purposes of this subsection (C), EXHAUSTION OF
LOCAL REMEDIES means:
      (1)   The taxpayer has timely requested in writing a hearing before the
Finance Director, and the Finance Director has held such hearing and issued a
final decision thereon. Such hearing shall be informal, and no transcript,
rules of evidence or filing of briefs shall be required, but the taxpayer may
elect to submit a brief, in which case the Finance Director may submit a brief.
The Finance Director shall hold such hearing and issue the final decision
thereon within 90 days after the Finance Director’s receipt of the taxpayer’s
written request therefor, except that the town may extend such period if the
delay in holding the hearing or issuing the decision thereon was occasioned by
the taxpayer, but, in any such event, the Finance Director shall hold such
hearing and issue the decision thereon within 180 days of the taxpayer’s
request in writing therefor; or
      (2)   The taxpayer has timely requested in writing a hearing before the
Finance Director, and the Finance Director has failed to hold such hearing or
has failed to issue a final decision thereon within the time periods prescribed
in this subsection.
   (D)   State hearing procedure. If a taxpayer has exhausted his or her local
remedies as provided in subsection (C)(1) of this section, then the taxpayer
may request a state hearing on such deficiency notice or claim for refund, and
such hearing shall be conducted in the same manner as set forth in C.R.S. § 29-
2-106.1(3) through (7), inclusive.
   (E)   Appeal to District Court. If the deficiency notice or claim for refund
involves only the Finance Director, then in lieu of requesting a state hearing,
the taxpayer may appeal such deficiency or denial of a claim for refund to the
District Court as provided in C.R.S. § 29-2-106.1(8), if the taxpayer complies
with the procedures set forth in subsection (C) of this section.
   (F)   Judicial review. No provision of this section shall prohibit the
taxpayer from pursuing judicial review of a final decision of the Finance
Director as otherwise provided in §
4-3-6-2 of this chapter.
(Ord. 45(1991) § 1; Ord. 13(2010) § 5)
§ 4-3-6-4 AMENDMENTS.
   The Town Council may amend, alter or change this chapter, subsequent to
adoption by a majority vote of the Town Council and such amendment, alteration
or change need not be submitted to the electors of the town for their approval
except to the extent required by the Town Charter or the Colorado Constitution.
(Ord. 45(1991) § 1; Ord. 32(2002) § 9)
§ 4-3-6-5 VIOLATION; PENALTY.
   Any person convicted of violating any of the provisions of this chapter
shall be subject to penalty as provided in §
1-4-1 of this code.
(Ord. 45(1991) § 1; 1997 Code)
§ 4-3-7 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
§ 4-3-7-1 COORDINATED AUDIT.
   (A)   Combine records. Any taxpayer licensed in the town pursuant to §
4-3-2 of this chapter and holding a similar sales tax license in at least four
other Colorado municipalities that administer their own sales tax collection,
may request a coordinated audit as provided herein.
   (B)   Time limitation stayed. Within 14 days of receipt of notice of an
intended audit by any municipality that administers its own sales tax
collection, the taxpayer may provide to the Finance Director of this town, by
certified mail, return receipt requested, a written request for a coordinated
audit indicating the municipality from which the notice of intended audit was
received and the name of the official who issued such notice. Such request
shall include a list of those Colorado municipalities utilizing local
collection of their sales tax in which the taxpayer holds a current sales tax
license and a declaration that the taxpayer will sign a waiver of any passage
of time based limitation upon this town’s right to recover tax owed by the
vendor for the audit period.
   (C)   One year time frame. Except as provided in subsection (G) of this
section, any taxpayer that submits a complete request for a coordinated audit
and promptly signs a waiver of the town’s statute of limitations found in §
4-3-1-11 of this chapter, may be audited by the town during the 12 months after
such request is submitted only through a coordinated audit involving all
municipalities electing to participate in such an audit.
   (D)   Cooperation between municipalities. If this town desires to
participate in the audit of a taxpayer that submits a complete request for a
coordinated audit pursuant to subsection (C )of this section, the Finance
Director shall so notify the Finance Director of the municipality whose notice
of audit prompted the taxpayer’s request within ten days after receipt of the
taxpayer’s request for a coordinated audit. The Finance Director shall then
cooperate with other participating municipalities in the development of
arrangements for the coordinated audit, including arrangement of the time
during which the coordinated audit will be conducted, the period of time to be
covered by the audit, and a coordinated notice to the taxpayer of those records
most likely to be required for completion of the coordinated audit.
   (E)   Municipality calling audit responsible. If the taxpayer’s request for
a coordinated audit was in response to a notice of audit issued by this town,
this town’s Finance Director shall facilitate arrangements between this town
and other municipalities participating in the coordinated audit unless and
until an official from some other participating municipality agrees to assume
this responsibility. The Finance Director shall cooperate with other
participating municipalities to, whenever practicable, minimize the number of
auditors that will be present on the taxpayer’s premises to conduct the
coordinated audit on behalf of the participating municipalities. Information
obtained by or on behalf of those municipalities participating in the
coordinated audit may be shared only among such participating municipalities.
   (F)   Taxpayer notified. If the taxpayer’s request for a coordinated audit
was in response to a notice of audit issued by this town, this town’s Finance
Director shall, once arrangements for the coordinated audit between the town
and other participating municipalities are completed, provide written notice to
the taxpayer of which municipalities will be participating, the period to be
audited and the records most likely to be required by participating
municipalities for completion of the coordinated audit. The Finance Director
shall also propose a schedule for the coordinated audit.
   (G)   Exception to audit procedure. The coordinated audit procedure set
forth in this section shall not apply:
      (1)   When the proposed audit is a jeopardy audit;
      (2)   To audits for which a notice of audit was given prior to the
effective date hereof;
      (3)   When a taxpayer refuses to promptly sign a waiver of the town’s
statute of limitations found in §
4-3-1-11 of this chapter; and
      (4)   When a taxpayer fails to provide a timely and complete request for
a coordinated audit as provided in subsection (B) of this section.
(Ord. 45(1991) § 1)
§ 4-3-7-2 INTERCITY CLAIMS FOR RECOVERY.
   The intent of this section is to streamline and standardize procedures
related to situations where tax has been remitted to the incorrect
municipality. It is not intended to reduce or eliminate the responsibilities of
the taxpayer or vendor to correctly pay, collect, and remit sales taxes to the
town.
   (A)   Definition. As used herein, CLAIM FOR RECOVERY means a claim for
reimbursement of sales taxes paid to the wrong taxing jurisdiction.
   (B)   Notice of error. When it is determined by the Director of Finance of
the town that sales tax owed to the town has been reported and paid to another
municipality, the town shall promptly notify the vendor that taxes are being
improperly collected and remitted, and that as of the date of the notice the
vendor must cease improper tax collections and remittances.
   (C)   Claim for recovery; content; extension. The town may make a written
claim for recovery directly to the municipality that received tax and/or
penalty and interest owed to the town, or, in the alternative, may institute
procedures for collection of the tax from the taxpayer or vendor. The decision
to make a claim for a recovery lies in the sole discretion of the town. Any
claim for recovery shall include a properly executed release of claim from the
taxpayer and/or vendor releasing its claim to the taxes paid to the wrong
municipality, evidence to substantiate the claim, and a request that the
municipality approve or deny in whole or in part, the claim within 90 days of
its receipt. The municipality to which the town submits a claim for recovery
may, for good cause, request an extension of time to investigate the claim, and
approval of such extension by the town shall not be unreasonably withheld.
   (D)   Verification of claim. Within 90 days after receipt of a claim for
recovery, the town shall verify to its satisfaction whether or not all or a
portion of the tax claimed was improperly received, and shall notify the
municipality submitting the claim in writing that the claim is either approved
or denied in whole or in part, including the reasons for the decision. If the
claim is approved in whole or in part, the town shall remit the undisputed
amount to the municipality submitting the claim within 30 days of approval. If
a claim is submitted jointly by a municipality and a vendor or taxpayer, the
check shall be made to the parties jointly. Denial of a claim for recovery may
only be made for good cause.
   (E)   Denial. The town may deny a claim on the grounds that it has
previously paid a claim for recovery arising out of an audit of the same
taxpayer.
   (F)   Limitation. The period subject to a claim for recovery shall be
limited to the 36-month period prior to the date the municipality that was
wrongly paid the tax receives the claim for recovery.
(Ord. 45(1991) § 1)
§ 4-3-7-3 NOTICE OF SALES TAX ORDINANCE AMENDMENT.
   (A)   Central register. In order to initiate a central register of sales and
use tax ordinances for municipalities that administer local sales tax
collection, the Finance Director of the town shall file with the Colorado
Municipal League prior to the effective date hereof a copy of the town sales
tax ordinance reflecting all provisions in effect on the effective date hereof.
   (B)   Update responsibility. In order to keep current the central register
of sales tax ordinances for municipalities that administer local sales tax
collection, the Finance Director of the town shall file with the Colorado
Municipal League prior to the effective date of any amendment a copy of each
sales tax ordinance amendment enacted by the town.
   (C)   Failure to file. Failure of the town to file such ordinance or
ordinance amendment pursuant to this section shall not invalidate any provision
of the sales tax ordinance or any amendment thereto.
(Ord. 45(1991) § 1)
§ 4-3-7-4 PARTICIPATION IN SIMPLIFICATION MEETINGS.
   The Finance Director shall cooperate with and participate on an as needed
basis with a permanent statewide Sales and Use Tax Committee convened by the
Colorado Municipal League which is composed of state and municipal sales and
use tax and business officials. Said committee will meet for the purpose of
discussing and seeking resolution to sales and use tax problems which may
arise.

and benefit of the town until paid to the Finance Director, and for failure to
so pay to the Finance Director, such vendor shall be punished as provided
herein:
   (A)   Make estimate on tax due and owing. If a vendor neglects or refuses to
make a return in payment of the tax required by this chapter, the Finance
Director shall estimate the amount of taxes due, based upon such information as

upon the basis of such estimated amount compute and assess in addition thereto
a penalty equal to 10% thereof, together with interest on such delinquent taxes
at the rate of 1% per month from the date when due.

shall give to the delinquent vendor notice of such estimated taxes, penalty,
and interest.

shall thereupon become an assessment, and such assessment shall be final and
due and payable from the vendor to the town 30 days from the date of the

such person on file with the Finance Department. Within 30 days after the
notice of deficiency is mailed, the vendor may petition the Finance Director
for a hearing on a revision or modification of such assessment. The filing of a
petition shall not toll the accrual of interest on the amount of taxes due.
   (D)   Petition form. Such petition shall be in writing, and the facts and
figures submitted shall be submitted under oath either in writing or orally at
a hearing scheduled by the Director of Finance. The hearing shall take place in
the office of the Director of Finance, and notice thereof, and the proceedings
shall be in substantial conformity with C.R.S. § 24-4-105 except as modified by
regulations issued by the Director of Finance.
   (E)   Final determination; possible review. Thereupon, the Director of
Finance shall make a final determination and, if appropriate, modify such

Finance deems correct. Such assessment, as modified, shall be considered a
final order of assessment of the Director of Finance and may be reviewed under
Rule 106(a)(4) of the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure; provided, that the
taxpayer has given written notice to the Town Manager of such intention to
petition for review under Rule 106(a)(4) within ten calendar days after notice

(Ord. 14(1992) § 1)
§ 4-5-21 JEOPARDY ASSESSMENTS AND DEMANDS.
   If the Finance Director finds that collection of the tax will be jeopardized
by delay, in the Finance Director’s discretion, the Finance Director may
declare the taxable period immediately terminated, determine the tax, and issue
notice and demand for payment thereof; and, having done so, the tax shall be
due and payable forthwith, and the Finance Director may proceed immediately to
collect such tax by distraint, levy and sale. Collection may be stayed if the
taxpayer gives such security for payment as shall be satisfactory to the
Finance Director.
(Ord. 14(1992) § 1)
§ 4-5-22 METHODS OF ENFORCING COLLECTIONS.
   (A)   Attach lien to properties. If any taxes, penalty or interest proposed
by this chapter and shown due by returns filed by the taxpayer or shown by
assessments duly made as provided herein are not paid within 30 days after the
same are due, the Director of Finance shall issue a notice setting forth the
name of the taxpayer, the amount of the tax, penalties and interest, the date
of the accrual thereof and that the town claims a first and prior lien therefor
on the real and tangible property of the taxpayer, except as to preexisting
perfected liens of a mortgagee, pledgee, judgement creditor or claims of a bona
fide purchaser whose rights shall have attached tax prior to the filing of
notice as herein provided on property of the taxpayer other than the goods,
stock and trade and business fixtures of such taxpayer. Said notice shall be on
forms furnished by the Finance Department and shall be verified by the Town
Manager or by the Finance Director or any duly qualified agent of the Town
Manager or the Finance Director, whose duties are the collection of such tax,
and may be filed in the office of the County Clerk and Recorder of any county
in the state in which the taxpayer owns real or tangible personal property, or,
in the case of personalty, with the Secretary of State, and the filing of such
notice shall create a lien on such property and constitute notice thereof.
After such notice has been filed, or concurrently therewith, or at any time
when taxes due are unpaid, whether such notice shall have been filed or not,
the Finance Director may issue a warrant directed to any duly authorized
revenue collector, or the sheriff of the county commanding such person to levy
upon, distrain, seize and sell sufficient of the real and personal property of
the taxpayer found within the country for the payment of the amount due,
together with interest, penalties and costs as may be provided by law, subject
to valid preexisting claims or liens.
   (B)   Fix levy. Such revenue collector or the sheriff shall forthwith
distrain and levy upon sufficient of the property of the taxpayer, or any
property used by such taxpayer in conducting his or her business, and said
property so levied upon shall be sold in all respects to and with like effect
and in the same manner as is prescribed by law with respect to executions
against property upon judgement of a court of record, and the remedies of
garnishment shall apply. The sheriff shall be entitled to such fees in
executing such warrants as are allowed by law for similar services.
   (C)   Lien released upon payment. Any lien for taxes as shown on the records
of the County Clerk and Recorder as provided in this section, upon payment of
all taxes, penalties and interest covered thereby, shall be released by the
Finance Director in the same manner as mortgages and judgements are released.
   (D)   Treat as debt to town. The Finance Director may also treat any such
taxes, penalties or interest due and unpaid as debt due to the town from the
vendor or taxpayer. The return of the vendor or taxpayer or the assessment made
by the Finance Director as provided in this chapter shall be prima facie proof
of the amount due. To recover such taxes, penalties or interest due the Finance
Director may bring an action and a writ of attachment may be issued to the
sheriff. At any such proceedings, no bond shall be required of the Finance
Director, nor shall any sheriff require of the Finance Director an indemnifying
bond for executing the writ of attachment or writ of execution upon any
judgement entered in such proceedings. The Finance Director may prosecute
appeals in such cases without the necessity of providing bond thereof. It is
the duty of the Town Attorney, when requested by the Finance Director to
commence action for the recovery of taxes due under this chapter and this
remedy shall be in addition to all existing remedies provided in this chapter.
   (E)   Town is party defendant. In any action affecting the title to real
estate or the ownership of rights to possession of personal property, the town
may be made a party defendant for the purposes of obtaining an adjudication or
determination of its lien upon the property involved therein. In any such
action, service of summons upon the Finance Director or any person in the
office of the Finance Director shall be sufficient service and shall be binding
upon the town.
   (F)   Possible waiver. The Finance Director is authorized to waive for good
cause shown any penalty assessed as provided in this chapter and any interest
imposed in excess of 10% per annum.
(Ord. 14(1992) § 1)
§ 4-5-23 TAX LIEN.
   (A)   First and prior lien. The tax imposed by this chapter shall be a first
and prior lien upon the goods and business fixtures of or used by any ski area
operator or vendor, excepting stock of goods sold or for sale in the ordinary
course of business, and shall take precedence on all such property over other
liens or claims of any kind or nature whatsoever.
   (B)   Business sold; discontinued. Any ski area operator or vendor who sells
his or her business or quits business shall be required to make out such
person’s tax return as provided for in this chapter within ten days after the
date the business is sold or the operator quits business, and such person’s
successor in business shall be required to withhold sufficient purchase money
to cover the amount of said taxes due and unpaid until such time as the former
owner produces a receipt from the Finance Director showing that the taxes have
been paid or a certificate that no taxes are due.
   (C)   Seller or new owner equally liable. If the purchaser of a ski area
fails to withhold the purchase money as provided in this section and the taxes
are due and unpaid after the ten-day period, he or she as well as the seller
shall be personally liable for the payment of the taxes unpaid by the former
owner.
(Ord. 14(1992) § 1)

receivership, bankruptcy or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or seized
under distraint for property taxes, all taxes, penalties, and interest imposed
by this chapter and for which the vendor or taxpayer is in any way liable under
the terms of this chapter shall be a prior and preferred claim against all the
property of said taxpayer, except as to preexisting claims or liens of a bona
fide mortgagee, pledgee, judgement creditor or purchaser whose rights shall
have attached prior to the filing of the notice as provided for in §
4-5-22 of this chapter on the property of the taxpayer other than goods, stock
and trade and business fixtures of such taxpayer. No sheriff, receiver,
assignee or other officer shall sell the property of any person subject to this
chapter under process or order of any court without first ascertaining from the
Finance Director the amount of any taxes due and payable under this chapter,
and if there are any such taxes due, owing or unpaid it is the duty of such
officer to first pay the amount of said taxes out of the proceeds of said sale
before making payment of any monies to any judgment creditor or other claims of
whatsoever kind or nature except the cost of the proceedings and other
preexisting claims for liens as provided in this section.

control of such speed and course at all times when skiing and to maintain a
proper lookout so as to be able to avoid other skiers and objects. However, the
primary duty shall be on the person skiing downhill to avoid collision with any
person or objects below him or her. It is presumed, unless shown to the

collisions by skiers with any person, natural object or human-made structure
that is marked is solely that of the skier or skiers involved and not that of
the ski area operator.

cause or contribute to the injury of the skier or others. Each skier shall be
presumed to have seen and understood all information posted in accordance with
this chapter near base area lifts, on the passenger tramways and on such ski
slopes or trails as such person is skiing. Under conditions of decreased
visibility, the duty is on the skier to locate and ascertain the meaning of all
signs posted.
   (F)   Equipment provision. Each ski, snowboard or telemarking ski used by a
skier while skiing shall be equipped with a strap or other device capable of
stopping the ski or snowboard should the ski or snowboard become unattached
from the skier.
   (G)   Safety. Before beginning to ski from a stationary position or before
entering a ski slope or trail from the side, the skier shall have the duty of
avoiding moving skiers already on the ski slope or trail.
   (H)   Impaired ability. No person shall move uphill on any passenger tramway
or use any ski slope or trail while such person’s ability to do so is impaired
by the consumption of alcohol or by the use of any “controlled substance”, as
defined in C.R.S. §12-22-303(7), or other drug or while such person is under
the influence of alcohol or any “controlled substance”, as defined in C.R.S. §
12-22-303(7), or other drug.
   (I)   Report collision; provide information. No skier involved in a
collision with another skier or person in which an injury results shall leave
the vicinity of the collision before giving his or her name and current address
to an employee of the ski area operator except for the purpose of securing aid
for a person injured in the collision; in which event the person so leaving the
scene of the collision shall give his or her name and current address as
required by this subsection (I) after securing such aid.
   (J)   Trespass. No person shall knowingly enter upon public or private lands
from an adjoining ski area when such land has been closed by its owner and so
posted by the owner or by the ski area operator.

§ 5-5-4 PENALTIES.

CHAPTER 7: FIRE PROTECTION SERVICES
Section

5-7-2 Services outside town boundaries; fees
5-7-3 Adjustment for inflation
5-7-4 Payment; delinquency constitutes a lien
5-7-5 Foreclosure on lien
§ 5-7-1 PURPOSE.
   The Town Council finds and determines that it would be of benefit to the
town as well as to the areas outside the Town of Vail boundary to continue
providing fire protection services to these areas under the conditions set
forth in this chapter, because provision of such services would protect
property located outside the town and would also help prevent the spread of any
fire into the town itself.
(Ord. 10(2016) § 1)
§ 5-7-2 SERVICES OUTSIDE TOWN BOUNDARIES; FEES.
   (A)   Response. The Town Fire Department may respond to requests for fire
protection services out of the town’s boundaries. Because the town operates the
dispatch for emergency and fire services for Eagle County, the Eagle County
Sheriff is not required to request that the town respond to fires outside the
town’s boundaries.
   (B)   Alternative fees. As an alternative to the fee schedule set forth in
subsection (C) of this section, the town may enter into contracts with property
owners, homeowners’ associations or tenants for the provision of fire
protection services outside the town’s boundaries. When such a service contract
is in place, the fees for fire protection services shall be as stated in such
service contract, and no additional fees or costs shall be charged for a
response to a request for fire protection services.
   (C)   Fees. The fees for provision of fire protection services outside town
boundaries without a service contract shall be as currently adopted by the Town
Council and shall be set forth on the schedule of fees maintained in the Fire
Department.
   (D)   Liability. If a property is not subject to a service contract for fire
protection services as described in subsection (B) of this section, and the
Town Fire Department responds to a request, the town may seek reimbursement
from the property owner(s) and/or any party benefitted by such fire protection
services, as determined by the Fire Chief in his or her sole discretion, for
the actual costs incurred by the town in the provision of such fire protection
services. The party benefitting from the fire protection services and the
property owner(s) shall be jointly and severally liable for such costs. Any
such costs, if unpaid, may be certified to the Eagle County Treasurer as a
first and prior lien on any associated real property.
(Ord. 10(2016) § 2)
§ 5-7-3 ADJUSTMENT FOR INFLATION.
   The fees and rates set forth in §
5-7-2(C) of this chapter shall be automatically increased each year by the
percentage the consumer price index has increased over the preceding year.
(Ord. 3(1991) § 3)
§ 5-7-4 PAYMENT; DELINQUENCY CONSTITUTES A LIEN.
   Any fee which is to be paid pursuant to this chapter for the provision of
fire protection services or any consideration which is to be paid pursuant to
any contract for fire protection services, if not paid within 30 days of
billing, and all costs of collection of such fee or consideration shall
constitute a lien on the real property for which said fire protection services
are provided. Such liens shall continue until the amount thereof is paid or
until its discharge of record by foreclosure or otherwise.
(Ord. 19(1985) § 3)
§ 5-7-5 FORECLOSURE ON LIEN.
   If any fee due hereunder is not paid within the 30-day time period as set
forth in §
5-7-4 of this chapter, then the town may record upon the land records of Eagle
County, Colorado, a written notice of lien, which lien may be foreclosed as a
mortgage is foreclosed in the courts of the State of Colorado.

minimum of $32.40 shall be applied to a 96-gallon container).

prohibit any hauler from establishing rules and regulations regarding the safe
maximum weight of containers of solid waste and recyclable material containers.

hauler from providing separate pricing for special collection of bulky items,
yard waste, contaminated recyclables, unscheduled pick up or extra volumes of
solid waste or recyclable material, or more than what was subscribed for with
the hauler.
   (G)   Commercial embedded rates. On commercial customer account bills, every
hauler shall combine charges for solid waste and recyclable material collection

hauler’s subscription, billing and other relevant records to determine whether
or not the provider has complied with the provisions of §

perpetrated by the accused.

§ 6-3H-6 CONDITIONAL EXCEPTION.

liability for, or against whom a judgment is entered for commission of a
traffic infraction shall be fined or penalized as set forth in the penalty
assessment schedule as adopted and amended from time to time by the town; or,
if no penalty is specified therein, the penalty shall be $15. These penalties
shall apply whether the defendant acknowledges guilt or liability, is found
guilty or liable by a court of competent jurisdiction, or has judgment entered
against said defendant by the Municipal Court.
   (B)   Penalty. Except as provided in subsection (A) of this section, traffic
infractions shall be subject to a minimum penalty of $5 and a maximum penalty
of $100 which is authorized upon entry of judgment against the defendant.
(Ord. 2(1993) § 1)
§ 7-2A-4 PENALTY ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   Schedule. The town’s adopted penalty assessment schedule shall not
apply when the provisions of subsection (B)(3) of this section prohibit the
issuance of a penalty assessment notice.
   (B)   Notice.
      (1)   At any time that a person is charged with the commission of a
traffic infraction, the peace officer shall, except when the provisions of
subsection (B)(3) of this section prohibit it, give a penalty assessment notice
to the defendant. Such penalty assessment notice shall contain all the
information required by §
7-2A-7 of this article. The peace officer shall advise the person cited of the
points to be assessed in accordance with applicable state law. The penalty
specified in the penalty assessment schedule for the violation charged may be
paid at the office of the Municipal Court Clerk, either in person or by
postmarking such payment within 20 days from the date the penalty assessment
notice is served upon the defendant. Acceptance of a penalty assessment notice
and payment of the prescribed penalty thereon to the Municipal Court shall be
deemed a complete satisfaction for the violation. Checks tendered by the
defendant to and accepted by the Municipal Court and on which payment is
received by the Municipal Court shall be deemed sufficient receipt.
      (2)   Should the defendant charged with a traffic infraction accept the
penalty assessment notice but fail to post the prescribed penalty thereon
within 20 days thereafter, said defendant shall be allowed to pay such penalty,
plus court costs, to the Clerk of the Municipal Court prior to the time for
appearance as specified in the notice. If the penalty, and court costs, are not
timely paid, the case shall thereafter be heard in the Municipal Court in
accordance with applicable Municipal Court rules of procedure. In such case,
the maximum penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed the penalty set forth
in the penalty assessment schedule.
      (3)   The penalty assessment schedule shall not apply to traffic
infractions specified in the schedule when it appears that:
         (a)   The alleged violation has caused, or contributed to the cause
of, an accident resulting in appreciable damage to property of another or an
injury or death to any person; and
         (b)   The defendant is charged with two or more violations, arising
out of the same transaction, any one of which is a criminal violation requiring
a court appearance. In such cases, the procedures for criminal violations shall
apply.
      (4)   In all cases where subsection (B)(3) of this section prohibits the
issuance of a penalty assessment notice, the penalty contained in the schedule
shall be inapplicable.
(Ord. 2(1993) § 1)
§ 7-2A-5 MUNICIPAL COURT JURISDICTION.
   (A)   Jurisdiction. The Municipal Court shall have jurisdiction over all
traffic infractions arising under this code and the Model Traffic Code for
Colorado municipalities, which has been adopted by reference herein, with power
to assess and collect civil penalties, costs and enter judgments for violations
thereof.
   (B)   Noncriminal traffic infractions. If the only violations charged
constitute noncriminal traffic infractions, no warrant or arrest may issue.
Instead the court may enter a judgment of liability by default against the
defendant; assess any penalty and costs established by law; and report the
judgment to the state motor vehicle division which may access points against
the defendant’s driving privileges and may deny an application or renewal of a
defendant’s driver’s license until the judgment and all other lawful costs are
satisfied.
   (C)   Hearing. Every hearing upon a traffic infraction shall be held before
the Municipal Court pursuant to applicable Municipal Court rules of procedure.
Whenever an infraction and a misdemeanor are charged in the same summons and
complaint, all charges may be adjudicated simultaneously as a criminal matter
by the Municipal Court and the Municipal Court rules and procedures shall
apply.
   (D)   Determination of Court. When the Municipal Court determines that a
person charged with a misdemeanor is guilty of a lesser included traffic
infraction, the court may enter a judgment as to such lesser charge.
   (E)   Burden of proof. The burden of proof for infractions shall be upon the
town, and the court shall enter judgment in favor of the defendant unless the
town proves the liability of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. The Town
Attorney may, in his or her discretion, enter traffic infraction cases to
engage in plea discussions or stipulations to deferred judgment and sentence
but shall not be required to so enter. The Municipal Court Judge shall be
permitted to call and question witnesses and shall also act as the fact finder
at hearings on traffic infraction matters.
   (F)   Appeal. An appeal from a final judgment on an infraction shall be made
in accordance with the Municipal Court rules of procedure.
(Ord. 2(1993) § 1)
§ 7-2A-6 COLLATERAL ATTACKS.
   (A)   Time limit. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no person
against whom a judgment has been entered for an infraction shall collaterally
attack the validity of that judgment unless such attack is commenced within six
months after the date of entry of judgment.
   (B)   Litigation of stale claims; exceptions to time limitations. In
recognition of the difficulties attending the litigation of stale claims and
the potential for frustrating various ordained provisions and statutes directed
at repeat offenders, former offenders and habitual offenders, the only
exceptions to the time limitations specified in subsection (A) of this section
shall be:
      (1)   A case in which the Municipal Court of the town did not have
jurisdiction over the subject matter of the alleged infraction;
      (2)   A case in which the Municipal Court of the town did not have
jurisdiction over the person of the violator;
      (3)   Where the Municipal Court of the town, after hearing the collateral
attack, finds by a preponderance of evidence that the failure to seek relief
within the applicable time period was caused by an adjudication of incompetence
or by commitment of the violator to an institution for treatment as a mentally
ill person; or
      (4)   Where the Municipal Court of the town, after hearing the collateral
attack, finds that the failure to seek relief within the applicable time period
was a result of circumstances amounting to justifiable excuse or excusable
neglect.
(Ord. 2(1993) § 1)
§ 7-2A-7 PENALTY ASSESSMENT NOTICES.
   (A)   Notice issued. At the time a person is charged with a traffic
infraction, the police officer shall issue or tender the defendant a penalty
assessment notice.
   (B)   Information required. The penalty assessment notice shall be signed
and served on or tendered to the defendant by a peace officer and shall contain
the name and address of the defendant; the license number of the vehicle
involved, if any; the number of defendant’s driver’s license, if any; a
citation of the Model Traffic Code or ordinance section alleged to have been
violated; a brief description of the infraction; the date and approximate
location thereof, the amount of penalty prescribed; the number of points, if
any, prescribed for such infraction pursuant to C.R.S. § 42-2123; and the date
the penalty assessment notice is served on the defendant.
   (C)   Court appearance required if penalty not paid. The notice shall direct
the defendant to appear in the Municipal Court on a specified date, time and
place in the event the prescribed penalty is not paid, shall be signed by the
peace officer, and shall contain a place for the defendant to elect to execute
a signed acknowledgment of liability and an agreement to pay the penalty on or
before the appearance date. The notice shall also contain any additional
information which shall be required by law to convert the penalty assessment
notice into a summons and complaint should the penalty not be paid within the
time allowed.
   (D)   Copies sent. One copy of the penalty assessment notice shall be served
upon the defendant by the peace officer and one copy sent to the Chief of
Police and such other copies as may be required by the Municipal Court and Town
Attorney.
   (E)   Time limit. The time specified in the summons portion of the penalty
assessment notice shall be at least 30 days and not more than 90 days after the
date the penalty assessment notice is served, unless the defendant shall demand
an earlier hearing.
   (F)   Refusal to accept service of notice. Whenever the defendant refuses to
accept service of the penalty assessment notice, tender of such notice by the
peace officer to the defendant shall constitute service thereof upon the
defendant.
(Ord. 2(1993) § 1)
§ 7-2A-8 FAILURE TO PAY PENALTY; PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The fine or penalties specified in the penalty assessment notice may
be paid at the office of the Clerk of the Municipal Court, either in person or
by mail, before the appearance date specified on the penalty assessment notice.
If a person pays the fine and surcharge for the violation before the appearance
date, the points assessed for the violation are reduced as follows:
      (1)   For a violation having an assessment of three or more points under
C.R.S. § 42-2-127(5), as amended, the points are reduced by two points; and
      (2)   For a violation having the assessment of two points under C.R.S. §
42-2-127(5), as amended, the points are reduced by one point.
   (B)   If the defendant fails to pay the penalty on the penalty assessment
notice on or before the appearance date, then said defendant shall appear at
the Municipal Court on the date and time specified in the notice and answer the
complaint against him or her. If the defendant answers that he or she is liable
or if he or she fails to appear for the hearing, judgment shall be entered
against said defendant.
   (C)   If the defendant denies the allegations in the notice or complaint, a
final hearing shall be held subject to the provisions of the Colorado Municipal
Court Rules of Procedure, regarding a speedy trial. If the defendant is found
guilty or liable or if he or she fails to appear at such final hearing,
judgment shall be entered against said defendant.
   (D)   If judgment is entered against a defendant, he or she shall be
assessed an appropriate penalty plus applicable court costs. The penalty shall
be no more than the amount specified in the penalty assessment notice.
   (E)   A defendant’s failure to appear upon a penalty assessment notice for a
traffic infraction shall not constitute a criminal offense.
   (F)   If the defendant fails to satisfy the judgment in the time allowed,
such failure shall be treated as a default. In addition to the procedure of
notification to the State Motor Vehicle Division of such default pursuant to
this title, the Town Attorney is hereby authorized to file a civil action with
any state court having appropriate jurisdiction, which filing shall include the
record of the case certified by the Clerk of the Municipal Court, praying for
judgment based thereon. Upon the entry of such judgment the Town Attorney shall
be authorized to proceed with all judgment execution and collection procedures
authorized by law for the amount of the judgment, costs, legal interest and
fees incurred in the proceedings.

§ 7-2A-9 VIOLATIONS.
   Except as otherwise provided in §

judgment for noncriminal traffic infractions, in accordance with the penalty
assessment schedule of the town, as the same may be amended from time to time;
and the town shall report the judgment to the State Motor Vehicle Division
which may assess points against the defendant’s driving privilege and may deny
an application for renewal of a defendant’s driver’s license until the judgment
and all other lawful costs are satisfied.
(Ord. 2(1993) § 1)

the possessor shall assume liability for all subsequent storage charges. The
certificate shall advise the possessor of such requirement.

claim for refund shall be made to the Town Manager, who shall make a thorough
examination of the claim. The failure on the part of any person to request the
initiation of a refund to him or her within one year from the date of sale
shall be conclusive of the fact that said person has no meritorious claim for
the refund within the set period of one year from the date of sale and shall
not thereafter commence any action, suit or proceeding whatsoever to obtain the
refund and the town shall be under no liability to said person whatsoever by
reason of the sale for the payment of any part of the proceeds of the sale or

   It is unlawful for any person to make any tunnel, opening, boring,
excavation of any kind in or under the surface of a public way, or occupy/use
the public way for any other purpose than for travel or other permitted uses,
without first securing a permit from the town for each separate undertaking;
provided, that any person maintaining pipes, lines or other underground
facilities in or under the surface of any street may proceed without a permit
when emergency circumstances demand the work be done immediately and the permit
cannot reasonably and practically have been obtained beforehand. Such person
shall thereafter apply for a permit on the first regular business day on which
the town offices are open for business. All permit applications are subject to
approval and conditions by Public Works. If the application is denied the
applicant may appeal the decision, as set forth in §

§ 8-1-26 CONSTRUCTION METHODS FOR PAVED STREET RESTORATION.
   (A)   Strict rules for compaction; penalty. The bottom 12 inches and the top
18 inches of the subgrade backfill shall be the same type of backfill material
specified in §
8-1-25 of this chapter. The excavated material may be used for the remainder of
the backfill, provided that no materials greater than six inches in diameter
shall be used for backfill. The material shall be deposited in layers not
exceeding 12 inches in thickness prior to compacting. Each layer shall be
compacted with suitable mechanical tamping equipment. It shall be compacted
sufficiently to obtain a field density which is at least 95% of theoretical
density as determined by AASHTO method T-147. The permittee shall be required
to obtain geotechnical test inspections by a certified technician and reports
reviewed by a professional engineer. Public Works shall require all permittees
to contact Public Works 24 hours in advance of commencement of backfill
operations to allow the Department time to arrange for additional inspection.
Failure to obtain proper inspections or contact the Department will result in
forfeiture of the street cut bond monies. The cost of compaction tests will be

§ 8-2-1 ABUTTING PROPERTY OWNERS; CONNECTION REQUIRED.
   Whenever any paving of the street is authorized or ordered by the Town
Council its agents or employees, the Town Council may order the owners of the
abutting property to connect their premises with the gas, sewer or water main,
or with any other utility in the street right-of-way. If connecting to

of- way. Upon default of any owner for 20 days after such an order to make the
connections, the Town Manager may contract for and make the connections or
improvements at the same distance under the regulations and in accordance with
the specifications as may be prescribed. The whole cost of each connection or
improvement including labor, material, equipment, necessary engineering, legal
and publication expenses, shall be ascertained by the town and the cost to each
owner shall be determined according to the material used and worked on under
the contract in connecting or improving such property to said utilities. The

days after final publication of the assessing ordinance without demand except
that all assessments at the election of the owner may be paid in installments.
   (B)   Installments automatic unless paid in full. Failure to pay the whole
assessment within said 30 days shall be conclusively considered and held to be
an election on the part of the persons interested, whether under disability or
not, to pay in such installments. All persons so electing to pay in
installments shall be conclusively held and considered as consenting to said
improvements and such election shall be conclusively held and considered as a
waiver of any right to question the power or jurisdiction of the municipality
to construct the improvement, the quality of work, the regularity or
sufficiency of the proceedings, or the validity or the correctness of the
assessments or the validity of the lien therefor.
(Ord. 14(1988) § 1)

the assessments pursuant to this section.
(Ord. 14(1988) § 1)
§ 8-2-5 DEFAULT.
   Failure to pay any installment, whether principal or interest, when due,
shall cause the whole of the unpaid principal to become due and collectible
immediately, and the whole amount of the unpaid principal and accrued interest
shall thereafter draw interest at the rate of 1.5% per month or fraction of a
month until the date of sale, as provided hereinafter. At any time prior to the
date of sale, the owner may pay the amount of all unpaid installments with
interest and all penalties accrued, and shall thereupon be restored to the
right thereafter to pay in installments in the same manner as if default had
not been suffered. The owner of any property not in default as to any
installment or payment may at any time pay the whole of the unpaid principal
with the interest accruing to the maturity of the next installment of interest
or principal.
(Ord. 14(1988) § 1)
§ 8-2-6 SALE OF PROPERTY.
   The County Treasurer shall receive payment of all assessments on the
assessment roll, with interest, and, in the case of default in the payment of
any installment of principal or interest when due, shall advertise and sell any
and all property concerning which such default is suffered for the payment of
the whole of the unpaid assessments thereon. The advertisements and sales shall
be at the same times and in the same manner under all the same conditions and
penalties and with the same effect as is provided by general laws for sales of
real property in default of payment of general taxes.

   (A)   Encroachments identified. No person shall erect or maintain any
building, structure, stand, cart, fence, barrier, post, hedge or other
obstruction or encroachment under or upon any street, alley, sidewalk or other
public property without first obtaining a permit from the Department of Public
Works under this section.
   (B)   Procedure. An applicant for a right-of-way permit shall:
      (1)   File a written application on forms furnished by the Department of
Public Works that include the following: the date, the name of the applicant,
the location of the proposed encroachment or obstruction, the type of
encroachment or obstruction, and such other information as the Department of
Public Works may deem necessary;
      (2)   File a site plan showing the location of the encroachment and how
it relates to the public right-of-way and, where relevant, a survey may be
required;
      (3)   File evidence of adequate public liability insurance naming the
town as an additional insured. Minor landscaping encroachments, such as
landscaping between the property line and the edge of asphalt on the right-of-
way may be excluded from this requirement; and
      (4)   Pay such fee as currently adopted by the Town Council and set forth
on the schedule of fees maintained in the Public Works Department and stated on
the right-of-way permit.
   (C)   Criteria for granting. Before issuing a right- of-way permit under
this section, the Department of Public Works shall consult with relevant town
departments which may include the Fire, Police, Community Development
Departments and all public utilities to determine whether the permit meets all
the requirements of this code and other ordinances of the town. The Department
of Public Works shall issue each permit upon a finding that in view of the
location or area proposed to be used and the type of encroachment or
obstruction proposed to be carried on, the proposed encroachment or obstruction
does not constitute a traffic hazard or destroy or impair the use of the right-
of-way or land by the public or serves a purpose that cannot otherwise be
accomplished and is a temporary obstruction of the right-of-way.
   (D)   Permit termination procedure. For any encroachment, obstruction or
other structure which is:
      (1)   Recommended by the town streetscape plan;
      (2)   The Town of Vail Village Master Plan; or
      (3)   The Lionshead urban design guide plan, or other plans which are a
part of the town’s comprehensive plan, the following process shall be utilized
for the termination of any revocable right-of- way permit for such improvement.
         (a)   Prior to installation, the improvement shall be presented to the
Town Council at a work session or regular Town Council meeting. The Town
Council shall establish an amortization schedule providing for specific
payments to the permittee upon the termination by the town of the permit. In
determining the maximum length of time for the amortization schedule, the Town
Council shall use the public interest as a guideline. However, in no event
shall the amortization schedule extend for a period greater than eight years.
The amortization schedule shall be based on the hard costs of the improvement.
The permittee may make application to include the design and/or labor costs in
the amortization schedule. The costs and maintenance agreement shall be set
after a review of the Town Council.
         (b)   Should the town terminate any revocable right-of-way permit for
any improvement set forth in this subsection (D), the town shall pay the
permittee the funds provided therefor in the amortization schedule for the year
in which the improvement is terminated.
         (c)   In the event the improvement is destroyed or eliminated for any
reason or any cause other than the town’s revocation of the permit, the town
shall not be liable for any damages or payment to the permittee. Additionally,
the permittee agrees that the improvement will be returned to the condition
that was in existence pursuant to the permit prior to its destruction or
elimination at the expense of the permittee.
(Ord. 6(1993) § I; Ord. 5(2001) § 8)
§ 8-3-2 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Determination; notice. A permit may be revoked whenever the Town
Manager determines that the encroachment, obstruction or other structure
constitutes a nuisance, destroys and impairs the use of the right-of-way by the
public, constitutes a traffic hazard, or the property on which the
encroachment, obstruction or structure exists is required for use by the
public; or it may be revoked at any time for any reason deemed sufficient by
the town. The permittee will remove, at such permittee’s expense, the
encroachment, obstruction or other structure, within such period of time as
specified by the Town Manager, not to exceed 60 days after receiving notice of
revocation of permit.
   (B)   Failure to comply with order. If a person is notified under subsection
(A) of this section and fails to comply with the order to remove the
encroachment or obstruction, the Town Manager may cause the encroachment or
obstruction to be removed and charge the cost thereof, plus up to 15% of such
cost for administration to the person so notified. If any person fails or
refuses to pay when due any charge imposed under this section, the Town Manager
may, in addition to taking other collection remedies, certify due any unpaid
charges, including interest, to the Eagle County Treasurer to be levied against
the person’s property for collection by the county in the same manner as
delinquent general taxes upon such property are collected.

   (C)   Defeat of ordinance. By defeat of a proposed ordinance, the Town
Council will determine that the improvement project is not in the public
interest, but it shall not limit proceedings for the same or similar
improvements from being considered again at any time in the future.
(Ord. 9(1976) § 1-6(a))
§ 8-4-7 COSTS WHEN ABOVE ESTIMATE.

(Ord. 9(1976) § 1-8)
§ 8-4-10 ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Hearing.
      (1)   Manager hearing. The Town Manager may hold such administrative
hearings relating to the imposition of assessments as the Manager deems
appropriate to obtain reactions thereto from affected property owners. The
Manager shall use whatever procedures he or she determines to be appropriate to
inform affected property owners of the administrative hearing(s).
      (2)   Council hearing. Upon ascertaining the costs of the project. and
after holding administrative hearings, if any, the Town Manager shall bring the
matter on the levying of assessments before the Town Council. No such hearing
will be held before the Council until the improvements have been substantially
completed.
   (B)   Levying.
      (1)   Special benefit designated.
         (a)   If the Town Council determines that the improvements confer
special benefits to the real or personal property within the district,
assessments may be made, pursuant to this chapter, and levied on any basis
which the Town Council determines to be equitable under all of the
circumstances. The assessments made shall be sufficient to cover the portion of
the total cost of the improvements to be defrayed by the levying of special
assessments. Special assessments shall not exceed the special benefits as
determined by the Council.
         (b)   For purposes of this chapter, SPECIAL BENEFITS means that the
real property has available improvements which enhance the present and/or
potential use, convenience, value, reduction in maintenance costs, alleviation
of health and sanitation hazards, or enjoyment of the property. Factors which
may be weighed and considered by the Town Council in determining special
benefits include, but are not limited to, the following:
            1.   The effects upon the appearance and environment of and for the
properties abutting upon or in the vicinity of the improvements;
            2.   The availability of the improvements for use by the properties
abutting upon or in the vicinity of the improvements;
            3.   The type of improvements made and the policy followed in
making assessments on similar improvements constructed in the past;
            4.   The nature of the improvements, singularly or in combination,
and their influence throughout the area and as to the individual parcels of
property;
            5.   The ever-increasing responsibility and changing concept of
what is required of the individual property owners at their own costs under the
police power even though the general public also has available to it such
improvements;
            6.   Unique features of particular properties;
            7.   The zoning, the uses and potential uses of the properties in
the vicinity of the improvements;
            8.   Opinions on the effects upon the fair market values from the
improvements upon properties in the vicinity of the improvements; and
            9.   The probable influence from the improvements relating to the
protection or preservation of the values of the properties in the vicinity of
the improvements.
      (2)   Imposition by ordinance. If the Town Council at the hearing, or at
any later time or times to which the hearing might be continued, determines
from the evidence that special benefits have accrued to affected properties,
then the assessments will be levied and imposed by ordinance. The ordinance
will include a finding relating to notice and public hearing requirements of
this chapter and resolve the issues, if any, which have been presented through
appropriate objection. In the event installment payments can be made, the
ordinance shall set forth the schedule and the interest rate.
   (C)   Ordinance levying; conclusiveness. After the expiration of 30 days
from the effective date of the ordinance described in subsection (B)(2) of this
section, all actions or suits attacking in any way the proceedings held, the
determinations and findings made, and the assessments levied therein, shall be
perpetually barred and shall not thereafter be questioned in any court or
before any other tribunal. In order for one to have standing to challenge the
proceedings in any respect, or the ordinance adopted, or any assessment levied,
one must have asserted his or her objections in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter. Review shall be limited to the objections so
asserted.
   (D)   Set aside, new assessment. If a court of competent jurisdiction sets
aside any final assessment, then the Town Council may make a new assessment
generally in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Notices and
procedures followed need not be in strict compliance with this chapter so long
as the affected property owner is afforded due process of law.
   (E)   Lien; exception. All assessments made in pursuance of this chapter
shall be a lien in the several amounts assessed against each tract or parcel of
land from the effective date of the assessing ordinance. A lien shall not,
however, attach to any tract or parcel of land so assessed which is owned by
the state, or any agency, or instrumentality thereof, or any county,
municipality, school district, special or quasi-municipal district, other
political subdivision or private corporation operating a public utility.
   (F)   Subdivision. As to any subdivisions of any real estate assessed in
pursuance of this chapter, the assessments shall in each case be a lien upon
the individual lots of the subdivision in proportion to their respective
shares.
   (G)   Lien; superiority. The liens for assessments granted by subsections
(E) and (F) of this section shall be prior and superior to all other liens,
claims, encumbrances and titles, whether prior in time or not, and shall
constitute such a lien until paid; provided, however, the assessment lien is
subordinate and junior to any lien for general taxes and is subject to
extinguishment by the sale of any property on account of the nonpayment of
general taxes; and provided, further, any such assessment lien on any tract or
parcel of land is prior and superior to any assessment lien thereon
subsequently levied.
   (H)   Time due. Subject to the requirements of subsections (I) and (J) of
this section, all installments both of principal and interest, shall be payable
at such times as may be determined in and by the assessing ordinance referred
to in subsection (B)(2) of this section.
   (I)   Lump payment; when due. All assessments made in pursuance of this
chapter shall be due and payable without demand within 30 days after the
publication of the assessing ordinance, after its final passage.
   (J)   Installment payment.
      (1)   Owner discretion. All assessments as mentioned in subsection (J)(2)
of this section may, at the election of the owner, be paid in installments with
interest as provided in subsection (J)(5) of this section, if so authorized by
the Town Council.
      (2)   Election of method. Whenever the Town Council authorizes the
payment of assessments in installments with interest as provided in subsection
(J)(3) of this section, failure to pay the whole assessment within the period
of 30 days shall be conclusively considered and held as election on the part of
all persons interested, whether under disability or otherwise, to pay in
installments the amount of the assessment then unpaid.
      (3)   Regaining right. At any time prior to the date a delinquent
assessment is certified to the County Treasurer for collection, but not
thereafter, the owner may pay the amount of delinquent installments and accrued
interest as provided under subsection (J)(5) of this section, and shall
thereupon be restored to the right thereafter to pay in installments in the
same manner as if default had not been made.
      (4)   Prepayment. The owner of any piece of real estate may at any time
pay the whole unpaid principal due under the assessing ordinance referred to in
subsection (B)(2) of this section, with the interest accrued to the next
interest payment date, together with penalties, if any.
      (5)   Annual or semi-annual installments. In case of an election to pay
in installments under subsection (J)(2) and (J)(3) of this section, the
assessment shall be payable in annual or semi-annual installments not to exceed
20 years in length, or as determined and directed by the Council, shall be
substantially equal, including principal, with interest in all cases on the
unpaid principal payable annually or semi-annually at a rate equal to or less
than that set in the ordinance ordering the improvements. The Town Council
shall set the installment interest rate in the ordinance ordering the
improvements, but the interest rate shall in no event be less than the highest
interest rate to be borne by the bonds, if any, of the district. Further,
nothing contained in this subsection (J)(5) shall be construed as limiting the
discretion of the Town Council in providing a different number of installments
or periods of payment than is provided in this chapter, or in determining the
time when the first installment of principal or interest or both shall become
due.
   (K)   Interest-free period. Payments under the assessing ordinance referred
to in subsection (B)(2) of this section, may be made to the Director of Finance
and recorded at any time within 30 days of the final publication of the
assessing ordinance, without penalty or the payment of interest. The Town
Manager may publish a notice in at least one newspaper published and of general
circulation in the town at least ten days before the end of the 30-day period,
which notice shall state the place of payment and the time for it to close.
Before any installment payment date a notice may also be published. The failure
to publish such notice or to do any other act or thing required by this chapter
shall not affect the assessment or any installment thereof, or the lien the
town holds therefor, nor extend the time for payment thereof.
(Ord. 9(1976) §§ 1-9(a,b), 1-14 – 1-26)
§ 8-4-11 BONDS.
   (A)   Issuance authority. The Town Council shall have the power by ordinance
without an election to issue bonds for the purpose of paying all or such
portion of the cost of constructing or installing any special or local
improvement projects ordered pursuant to the provisions of this chapter,
including the costs incidental thereto. The bonds may be of the total principal
amount, date, denomination, form, terms and bear such interest as may be
prescribed by the Town Council and shall be payable in a sufficient period of
years after their date to cover the period of payment of the improvements to be
provided. If the Town Council so determines, the bonds may be redeemable prior
to maturity with or without the payment of a premium. The bonds may be issued
upon estimates approved by the Town Council and may be payable in whole or in
part out of the monies collected on account of the assessments made for the
authorized improvements. All monies collected from the assessments for the
improvements shall be applied to the payment of the bonds so issued, until
payment in full is made of all the bonds, both as to principal and interest.
   (B)   Refunding. All bonds may be refunded as authorized in §
10.7 of the Town Charter.
   (C)   Surplus or deficit fund. Where all outstanding bonds of a special or
local improvement district have been paid and any monies remain to the credit
of the district, they shall be transferred to a special surplus and deficiency
fund, and whenever there is a deficiency in any special or local improvement
district fund to meet the payments of outstanding bonds and interest due
thereon, the deficiency shall be paid out of the surplus and deficiency fund.
Whenever a special or local improvement district has paid and cancelled three-
fourths of its bonds issued, and for any reason the remaining assessments are
not paid in time to take up the remaining bonds of the district and the
interest due thereon and there are not sufficient monies in the special surplus
and deficiency fund, then the town shall pay the bonds when due and the
interest due thereon, and reimburse itself by collecting the unpaid assessments
due the district.
   (D)   Town payment. In consideration of general benefits conferred upon the
town at large from the construction and installation of improvements in
improvement districts, the Town Council may levy annual taxes without an
election on all taxable property within the town at a rate to be determined by
the Town Council, for the purpose of advancing monies to maintain current
payments of interest and equal annual payments to the principal amount of bonds
issued for any improvement district created pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter. The proceeds of the taxes shall be placed in a special fund and shall
be disbursed only for the purposes specified in this chapter, provided that in
lieu of the tax levies, the Town Council may annually transfer to the special
fund any available monies of the town.
(Ord. 9(1976) § 1-10(a–d))
§ 8-4-12 LIMITATION ON ACTIONS AGAINST BONDS OR ORDINANCE.
   After the expiration of 30 days from the date of the final action and
approval by the Town Council of the ordinance providing for the issuance of the
bonds, all actions or suits attacking its findings, determinations, and content
or questioning the legality of the bonds authorized therein and all proceedings
relating thereto, shall be perpetually barred and the ordinance and bonds shall
be conclusive of the facts so stated in the ordinance and bonds and shall be
conclusively deemed valid and legal in every court or other tribunal and shall
not be open to contest by the town or any person whomsoever, for any reason
whatever.

improvement district, shall be considered delinquent if not paid within 30 days
after the date set for payment thereof in the provisions of the assessing
ordinance.
      (1)   A delinquency shall cause the whole amount of unpaid principal and

      (2)   As soon as any assessment or installment thereof becomes
delinquent, the Director of Finance shall mark it delinquent on the assessment
roll and shall, at least once each calendar year, but not sooner than October

of Eagle County, Colorado; and the County Treasurer shall extend the assessment
upon the real property tax rolls of the county and collect it in the same

become due and payable.
   (B)   Certification.
      (1)   There shall be no interest charged against an assessment which is
paid in full to the town within 30 days from the effective date of the

Council may order the owners of the abutting property to connect their premises
with the gas or water mains, or with any other utility in the street in front

§ 8-5-13 CONSIDERATION OF APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Criteria examined. The town shall consider each application for a
franchise with the applications found to be acceptable for filing and in
substantial compliance with the requirements of this chapter and any applicable
request for proposals. In evaluating an application, the town will consider,
among other things, the applicant’s past service record in other communities,
the nature of the proposed facilities and services, including rates to be
charged therefor, and whether the proposal is adequate to meet the future
cable-related community needs and interests of the citizens of the town. Where
the application is for a renewed franchise, the town shall consider whether:
      (1)   The cable operator has substantially complied with the material
terms of the existing franchise and with applicable law;
      (2)   The quality of the operator’s service, including signal quality,
response to consumer complaints and billing practices, but without regard to
the mix quality, or level of cable services or other services provided over the
system, has been reasonable in light of community needs;
      (3)   The operator has the financial, legal and technical ability to
provide the services, facilities and equipment as set forth in the operator’s
proposal; and
      (4)   The operator’s proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable-
related community needs and interest, taking into account the cost of meeting
such needs and interests.
   (B)   Grant of franchise; ordinance required. Where the town determines that
an applicant’s proposal, including the proposed service area, would serve the
public interest, it may grant a franchise to the applicant. The franchise
agreement will constitute a contract, freely entered into, between the town and
the grantee. Said franchise agreement shall incorporate by reference the
relevant provisions of this chapter. Any such franchise must be approved by
ordinance of the Town Council pursuant to the ordinances of the town and the
Charter of the town.
   (C)   Public hearing for franchise renewal. In the course of considering an
application for renewed franchise, the Council shall hold a public hearing,
consistent with the provisions of 47 U.S.C. § 626 as existing or as may from
time to time be amended.
   (D)   Grant fee. A franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall not take
effect until the applicant pays a grant fee to the town. The grant fee shall be
equal to the town’s reasonable direct costs in the franchising process, less
the application filing fee received. The town shall provide the grantee a
statement summarizing such costs prior to the execution of the franchise.
(Ord. 18(1989) § 13; Ord. 25(1994))
§ 8-5-14 ACCEPTANCE.
   A franchise and its terms and conditions shall be accepted by a grantee by
written instrument, in a form acceptable to the Town Attorney, and filed with
the Town Clerk within 30 days after the granting of the franchise by the town.
In its acceptance, the grantee shall declare that it has carefully read the
terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise and accepts all of the
terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise and agrees to abide by
same. In accepting a franchise, a grantee shall indicate that it has relied
upon its own investigation of all relevant facts, that it was not induced to
accept the franchise and that it accepts all reasonable risks relating to the
interpretation of the franchise.
(Ord. 25(1994))
§ 8-5-15 FRANCHISE TERM.
   The term of a franchise shall be as specified in the franchise agreement,
but it shall not exceed 15 years. If a franchisee seeks authority to operate a
cable system in the town beyond the term of its franchise, it shall file an
application for a renewed franchise not later than 30 months prior to the
expiration of its franchise.
(Ord. 25(1994))
§ 8-5-16 FRANCHISE FEE.
   (A)   Gross revenue percentage due to city. The franchisee in consideration
of the privilege granted under a franchise for the use of the public ways and
the privilege to construct and operate a cable communications system, shall pay
to the town up to 5% of its annual gross revenues or, if more than 5% is
permitted by law, the amount provided in the franchise agreement for the term
of the franchise.
   (B)   Quarterly financial statements required. A franchisee shall file with
the town, 30 days after the last day of each quarter, a financial statement
showing the gross revenues received by the franchisee during the preceding
quarter. A franchisee shall pay the quarterly portion of the franchise fee to
the town on or before the time such financial statement is due to be filed.
With each payment required by this section, the franchisee shall submit a
written statement, signed and certified by the franchisee to be true and
correct, showing for the immediately preceding calendar quarter the amount of
gross revenues, the amount of all revenues derived from the system and an
itemization of all permissible deductions therefrom to arrive at gross
revenues. The franchisee shall also submit to the town on or before the
thirtieth day following the end of each calendar year and following the
expiration or termination of the franchise a written statement, signed and
certified by the franchisee to be true and correct, showing for the immediately
preceding year or partial year, as applicable, the amount of gross revenues,
the amount of all revenues derived from the system and an itemization of all
permissible deductions therefrom to arrive at gross revenues. The town shall
have the right on 30 days’ notice to the franchisee to demand that the annual
statement be certified to be true and correct and in compliance with the
requirements of this chapter by both the franchisee and an independent
certified public accountant in accordance with sound and accepted accounting
practices. The statements referred to in this subsection (B) shall be in such
form and style and contain such details and information as the town shall
reasonably designate. The acceptance by the town of payments or reports thereof
shall be without prejudice and shall not constitute a waiver of the town’s
right to claim a deficiency in the payment of franchise fees or to audit the
franchisee’s books and records, as hereinafter set forth.
   (C)   Authority to audit. Upon five days’ prior written notice to the
franchisee, the town shall have the right to cause a complete audit to be made
of the books and records of the franchisee with respect to the system. If the
results of such audit show that the franchisee’s statement of gross revenues
for any period ending not more than three years prior to the commencement of
the audit has been understated by 3% or more, then the franchisee shall pay the
town the cost of such audit, any deficiency payment shown by such audit to be
due and interest thereon at the agreed rate. A report of the findings of the
town’s accountant shall be binding and conclusive upon the franchisee and the
town.
   (D)   Due date; penalty. In the event that any franchise payment is not
received by the town on or before the applicable date, interest shall be
charged from such due date at an annual interest rate then chargeable for
unpaid federal income taxes (26 U.S.C. § 6621). In addition to the foregoing,
the franchisee shall pay a late charge of 5% of the amount of such payment.
Interest and late charges will not be chargeable to the franchisee for
additional payment required under the yearly adjustment; provided, that such
payment does not exceed 10% of the total monthly payments made during the year.
In the event such payment exceeds 10%, the franchisee shall be liable for
interest and late charges for the entire amount.
   (E)   Procedure upon revocation; termination. In the event a franchise is
revoked or otherwise terminated prior to its expiration date, the franchisee
shall file with the town, within 90 days of the date of revocation or
termination, an audited financial statement showing the gross revenues received
by the franchisee since the end of the previous year and shall make adjustments
at that time for the franchise fees due up to the date of revocation or
termination.

   (A)   Breach of franchise; criteria. In addition to all other rights and

liability to the town, nor shall the town have the right to terminate or revoke

8-5-19 of this chapter as a result of any failure of the franchisee to perform,
or delay by franchisee in the performance of its obligations hereunder (other
than to pay the franchise fee and other payments required by this agreement) if
such failure or delay is caused by factors beyond the control of the
franchisee, including without limitation, any flood or other act of God, laws,
regulations, rules or orders of any governmental agency, sabotage, strikes,
lockouts or job actions, failure or delay in transportation or the
unavailability of any product or material necessary to the performance hereof;
provided that, franchisee has exercised all due care to prevent the occurrence
of such events which are reasonably foreseeable, including without limitation,
actively pursuing alternative products, materials and means of transportation.
In the event that delay in performance or failure to perform affects only part
of franchisee’s capacity to perform, then the franchisee shall perform to the
extent it is reasonably able to do so. The franchisee agrees that the excuse
for nonperformance under this section shall last only so long as the act which
excuses performance under this section shall continue without interruption. In
correcting any causes of nonperformance and in effecting any partial
performance, the franchisee shall take all necessary corrective actions as
expeditiously as possible.
   (C)   Demand certified. The town shall make a written demand by certified
mail that the franchisee comply with any such provision, rule, order or
determination under or pursuant to the franchise. If a violation of the
franchise continues for a period of 30 days following such written demand
without written proof that the corrective action has been taken or is being
actively and expeditiously pursued, the town may consider terminating the
franchise; provided, however, a written notice thereof shall be given to the
franchisee at least 15 days in advance and the franchisee must be given an
opportunity to appear before the Council to present its arguments. Should the
town determine, following the public hearing, that the violation by the
franchisee was the fault of the franchisee and within the franchisee’s control,
the town may, by resolution, declare that the franchise be forfeited and
terminated; provided, however, the town may in its discretion, provide an
opportunity for the franchisee to remedy the violation and come into compliance
with the franchise and this chapter so as to avoid the termination.

underground in newly platted areas in concert with both the telephone and
electric utilities unless this requirement is waived by the town. Equipment
shall not be stored on town rights-of-way.
      (2)   A preconstruction conference with the property owners will be
completed prior to commencing any underground construction, and the town shall
assist and cooperate in such conferences if necessary. All soil, earth, sod or
improvements disturbed by the installation shall be replaced and restored to
their original condition. Patching of highways, roads and driveways will be
completed in accordance with the specifications promulgated by, and subject to,

(Ord. 25(1994))
§ 8-5-35 EXCAVATION; CABLE LOCATION.
   A person or entity planning an excavation within the town shall request the
company or companies franchised to provide cable television within the town to
inform it of the location of its cable or other equipment in the vicinity of
the planned excavation, and as promptly as practicable after its receipt of the
request, the company shall give said information to said person or entity. The
company shall furnish said information within 48 hours of the receipt of the
request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and Colorado legal holidays, unless
unusual circumstances preclude it from doing so. The willful or negligent
failure of the company to furnish said information shall relieve the person or
entity which requested it from the obligation to pay for the damage or repair
that it causes or necessitates to the company’s cable or other equipment;
provided, that the person or entity uses reasonable care in making the planned
excavation; and the request for information was in writing.
(Ord. 20(1970) § 1)
§ 8-5-36 DAMAGE TO CABLE.
   (A)   Liability of responsible party. At any time cable and/or other
equipment of a company or companies franchised to provide cable television
within the town is disturbed, damaged or severed, the cost of the repair shall
be paid by the party responsible for said damage. The company may charge the
responsible party for the time and materials expended for repair of said
damage. The company shall repair any damage to its cable or other equipment and
restore service immediately if such is feasible, or otherwise as promptly as is
practicable, ordinarily prior to seeking payment for the damage or repair from
the responsible party.
   (B)   Lengthy repair time. In the event any necessary repair is not
completed within 48 hours after the damage to the cable or other property
occurs, the company which owns the damaged cable or other property shall inform
the town thereof, in writing, if feasible, giving the reasons for the delay and
the estimated time when the repair will be completed.
(Ord. 20(1970) § 1)
§ 8-5-37 REPLACEMENT OF PAVING.
   The franchisee at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the
town shall replace and restore all paving, sidewalks, driveways or surface of
any street or alley or public way disturbed, in as good a condition as before
the work was commenced and shall maintain the restoration in an improved
condition for a period of one year. Failure of the franchisee to replace or
restore such paving, sidewalk, driveway, or street surface within 48 hours
after completion of work shall authorize the town to cause the proper
restoration to be made at the franchisee’s expense.
(Ord. 25(1994))
§ 8-5-38 ALTERATION OF STREETS BY TOWN.
   If the town shall lawfully decide to alter or change the grade of any
street, alley, or other public way, the franchisee, upon reasonable notice by
the town, shall, in a timely manner as requested by the town, remove and
relocate its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits and other facilities at
its own expense. If other utilities are compensated, the franchisee shall be
entitled to the same compensation.
(Ord. 25(1994))
§ 8-5-39 TRIMMING TREES.
   A franchisee shall have the authority to trim trees upon an overhanging of
streets, alleys, sidewalks and public places of the town so as to prevent the
branches of such trees from coming into contact with wires and cables and other
television conductors and fixtures of the franchisee. The town may require all
trimming to be done under its supervision and direction and at the expense of
the franchisee.
(Ord. 25(1994))
§ 8-5-40 TEMPORARY MOVE OF CABLES.
   (A)   A franchisee shall, on the request of any person holding a valid house
moving permit, temporarily raise or lower its wires or cables to permit the
moving of buildings or other large objects.
   (B)   The expense of such temporary raising or lowering of wires shall be
paid by the person making the request, and the franchisee shall have the
authority to require such payment in advance. The franchisee shall be given not
less than 48 hours’ advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes.
(Ord. 25(1994); 1997 Code)
§ 8-5-41 REFUNDS AND SERVICE TERMINATIONS.
   A franchisee shall establish and conform to the following policy regarding
refunds to subscribers and users:
   (A)   Equipment deposits refunded with interest. If the franchisee collects
a deposit or advance charge on any service or equipment requested by a
subscriber or user, the franchisee shall provide such service or equipment
within 30 days of the collection of the deposit or charge or the franchisee
shall refund such deposit or charge within five business days thereafter. Any
converter security deposit collected by the franchisee shall be returned to the
subscriber 24 months after the installation of such converter, or upon
termination of service by the subscriber and return of such converter undamaged
with allowance for reasonable wear and tear and payment of any outstanding
balance due and payable, whichever occurs first. If and when the franchisee
collects deposits from its subscribers, it shall pay interest on any deposit
required of the subscriber at the agreed rate in effect from time to time minus
two percentage points. The franchisee may elect to pay such interest in the
form of credits to subscriber accounts. Nothing in this section shall be
construed:
      (1)   To relieve a franchisee of any responsibility it may have under
separately executed contracts or agreements with its subscribers or users;
      (2)   As limiting a franchisee’s liability for damages, if any, which may
be imposed under the franchise for the violation or breach of any provisions
thereof; or
      (3)   To limit the franchisee’s liability for damages, if any, because of
its failure to provide the service for which deposit or charge was made.
   (B)   Disconnections; reconnections. The following requirements shall apply
to subscriber disconnections.
      (1)   There shall be no charge for disconnection of any installation,
service or outlet. All cable communications equipment shall be removed within a
reasonable time from a subscriber’s property upon the subscriber’s request,
such time not to exceed 30 days from the date of request. The franchisee may
charge for adding or deleting channels at the subscriber’s request.
      (2)   If any subscriber fails to pay a properly due monthly subscriber’s
fee, or any other properly due fee or charge, the franchisee may disconnect the
subscriber’s service; provided, however, that such disconnection shall not be
effected until 30 days after the due date of the monthly subscriber fee or
charges and shall include a minimum five days’ written notice to the subscriber
of the intent to disconnect. After disconnection, upon payment in full of all
proper fees or charges, including the payment of any reconnection charge, the
franchisee shall promptly reinstate the service.
(Ord. 25(1994))
§ 8-5-42 SERVICE AREA.
   The franchisee shall offer full cable television service to all areas of the
town unless specifically authorized to serve a lesser area. A franchise issued
in accordance with this chapter shall require that all dwelling units within
the franchise territory be offered service on the same terms and conditions;
provided, however, multiple-family dwelling complexes, apartments or
condominiums may be served on a master-bill basis; and further, service to
motels, hotels, hospitals and similar businesses or institutions may be offered
on terms and conditions different from single-residence subscribers. In the
event that subsequent to the issuance of a franchise the town annexes
additional territory, a franchisee shall extend its cable television services
into the annexed area within a reasonable time of a request by the town to do
so. Such reasonable time shall not be less than nine months.
(Ord. 25(1994))
§ 8-5-43 CONTINUITY OF SERVICE.
   (A)   Guaranteed continuous service. Where a franchisee rebuilds, modifies
or sells its system, it shall ensure that all subscribers receive continuous,
uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances.
   (B)   Specific conditions not excepted. As long as it is entitled to
revenues from the operation of the cable system, a franchisee shall maintain
continuity of service during any temporary transition in the franchise,
including, but not limited to, the following circumstances:
      (1)   Revocation of the franchise;
      (2)   Nonrenewal of the franchise; and
      (3)   Transfer of the cable system to the town or another entity.
(Ord. 25(1994))
§ 8-5-44 TRANSITIONAL OPERATION.
   (A)   In the event a franchisee continues to operate the system in a
transitional period, with town acquiescence, following the expansion,
revocation, or other termination of the franchise, it shall be bound by all the
terms, conditions and obligations of the franchise as if it were in full force
and effect.
   (B)   The terminating franchisee shall cooperate with the town and any
subsequent franchisee in maintaining and transferring service responsibility.
(Ord. 25(1994))
§ 8-5-45 PERIODIC REEVALUATION AND RENEGOTIATIONS.
   (A)   Position stated. Since the field of cable communications is rapidly
evolving and many technological, regulatory, financial, marketing, legal,
competitive and other changes are likely to occur during a franchise term, a
degree of flexibility is needed in order to achieve and maintain a modern and
efficient cable communications system that adequately serves the public. To
this end, the town, with cooperative assistance from a franchisee, shall
periodically reevaluate the system operation and negotiate appropriate
franchise changes.
   (B)   Three-year intervals. The town shall reevaluate the franchisee’s cable
operations and service three years following the award date of the franchise
and every three years thereafter for the life of the franchise. The franchisee
shall cooperate with the town in such evaluation and provide information as may
be necessary for the evaluation.
   (C)   Conduct survey; reevaluation; public release.
      (1)   Following the public release of a reevaluation report, the town and
the franchisee shall meet to discuss the reevaluation and possible means of
improving service to the public. At that time, the parties shall negotiate any
changes in the franchise that may be necessary or desirable. Upon request of
the town, the franchisee shall, no earlier than 90 days and no later the 30
days prior to a review and evaluation session, conduct a written survey of
subscribers. Each questionnaire shall be prepared and constructed in good faith
so as to provide measurements of subscribers preferences and satisfaction for:
         (a)   Programming offered by the franchisee at the time the survey is
conducted;
         (b)   Programming generally available to cable subscribers nationally
but not offered by the franchisee at the time the service is conducted; and
         (c)   Maintenance and subscriber complaint practices.
      (2)   As a part of the review and evaluation session, the franchisee
shall report in writing what steps it may be taking to implement the findings
of the survey.
   (D)   Accommodating changes in statutes or circumstances. The town and the
franchisee may meet at other times to discuss and negotiate possible changes to
the franchise pursuant to an agenda agreed to in advance by both parties. Such
special sessions are intended to provide a mechanism for effecting franchise
changes necessitated by major events affecting cable communications, such as
state or federal legislation, new or revised state or federal regulations, or
an extraordinary change in circumstances.
(Ord. 25(1994))
§ 8-5-46 THEFT OF SERVICES AND TAMPERING.
   (A)   Violation. No person, whether or not a subscriber of the cable
television system may intentionally or knowingly damage or cause to be damaged
any wire, cable, conduit, equipment or apparatus of the franchisee or commit
any act with an intent to cause such damage, or to tap, remove or tamper with
or otherwise connect or maintain any wire or device to a wire, cable, conduit,
equipment and apparatus or appurtenances of the franchisee with the intent to
obtain and maintain a signal or impulse from the cable system without
authorization from or compensation to the franchisee, or to obtain and maintain
cable television or other communications service with the intent to cheat or
defraud franchisee of any lawful charge to which it is entitled.
   (B)   Penalty. Any person convicted of violating any provision of this
section is subject to a fine of not more than $500 for each offense.
(Ord. 25(1994))
§ 8-5-47 RENEGOTIATION.
   If any court of competent jurisdiction, the FCC or any state regulatory body
rule, decision or other action determines, prior to the commencement of system
construction, that any material provision of this chapter or any franchise
granted pursuant thereto, is invalid or unenforceable, then in such event, the
town shall retain the right to renegotiate any franchise entered into prior to
any such rule, decision or other action. For the purpose of this section,
COMMENCEMENT OF SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION shall mean the first day that physical
construction, including, but not limited to, the placing of cable on poles or
underground, actually begins.
(Ord. 25(1994))
§ 8-5-48 FRANCHISE RENEWAL.
   Franchise renewals shall be in accordance with applicable law. The town and
the franchisee, by mutual consent, may enter into renewal negotiations at any
time during the term of the franchise. Upon mutual execution of a franchise
renewal agreement, the franchisee shall reimburse the town for costs incidental
to the franchise renewal award, not to exceed any maximum specified in the
agreement. Any such reimbursement shall not be charged against any franchise
fee due to the town during the term of the franchise.
(Ord. 25(1994))
§ 8-5-49 FRANCHISE NONTRANSFERABLE.
   (A)   Consent of town required. The franchisee shall not sell, transfer,
lease, assign, sublet or dispose of, in whole or in part, either by forced or
involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, contract, consolidation or otherwise,
the franchise or any of the rights or privileges therein granted, without the
prior consent of the town and then only upon such terms and conditions as may
be prescribed by the town under applicable law, which consent shall not be
unreasonably denied or delayed. Any attempt to sell, transfer, lease, assign or
otherwise dispose of the franchise without the consent of the town shall be
null and void. The granting of a security interest in any the franchisee
assets, or any mortgage or other hypothecation, shall not be considered a
transfer for the purposes of this section. The transfer of the franchise from
one wholly owned subsidiary of a franchisee’s parent company to another wholly
owned subsidiary shall not require town consent.
   (B)   Change in control defined. The requirements of subsection (A) of this
section apply to any change in control of the franchisee. The word “control” as
used herein is not limited to major stockholders or partnership interests, but
includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. In the event that
the franchisee is a corporation, prior authorization of the town shall be
required where ownership or control of more than 10% of the voting stock of the
franchisee is acquired by a person or group of persons acting in concert, none
of whom own or control the voting stock of the franchisee as of the effective
date of the franchise, singularly or collectively.
   (C)   Notification of legal changes. The franchisee shall notify the town in
writing of any foreclosure or any other judicial sale of all or a substantial
part of the franchise property of the franchisee or upon the termination of any
lease or interest covering all or a substantial part of said franchise
property. Such notification shall be considered by the town as notice that a
change in control of ownership of the franchise has taken place and the
provisions under this section governing the consent of the town to such change
in control of ownership shall apply.
   (D)   Franchisee provide information to town. For the purpose of determining
whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of control,
the town may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective transferee or
controlling party, and the franchisee shall assist the town in such inquiry. In
seeking the town’s consent to any change of ownership or control, the
franchisee shall have the responsibility of ensuring that the transferee
completes an application in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
town, which application shall include the information required under §
8-5-12 of this chapter. An application shall be submitted to the town not less
then 60 days prior to the date of transfer. The transferee shall be required to
establish that it possesses the qualifications and financial and technical
capability to operate and maintain the system and comply with all franchise
requirements for the remainder of the term of the franchise. If the legal,
financial character and technical qualifications of the applicant are
satisfactory, the town shall consent to the transfer of the franchise. The
consent of the town to such transfer shall not be unreasonably denied or
delayed.
   (E)   Authority of pledgor. Any financial institution having a pledge of the
franchisee or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/
or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the town that it
or its designee satisfactory to the town shall take control of and operate the
cable television system in the event of a franchisee default of its financial
obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for
such operation within 30 days of assuming such control that will insure
continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the
term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial
institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding
one year unless extended by the town in its discretion and during said period
of time it shall have the right to petition the town to transfer the franchise
to another franchisee.
   (F)   Reimburse processing and review expense. Upon transfer, the franchisee
shall reimburse the town for the town’s reasonable processing and review
expense in connection with a transfer of the franchise or of control of the
franchise, up to a maximum of $2,500, the cost of administrative review,
financial, legal and technical evaluation of the proposed transfer, consultants
(including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by such experts),
notice and publication costs and document preparation expenses. Any such
reimbursement shall not be charged against any franchise fee due to the town
during the term of the franchise.
(Ord. 25(1994))
§ 8-5-50 MULTIPLE FRANCHISES.
   (A)   Authority. The town may grant any number of franchises subject to
applicable state or federal law. The town may limit the number of franchises
granted, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of
applicable law and specific local considerations; such as:
      (1)   The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate multiple
cables in addition to the cables, conduits and pipes of the utility systems,
such as electrical power, telephone, gas and sewerage;
      (2)   The benefits that may accrue to cable subscribers as a result of
cable system competition, such as lower rates and improved service; and
      (3)   The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition,
such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents’ property, and the
disruption arising from numerous excavations of the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Availability of service to all. Each franchisee awarded a franchise to
serve the entire town shall offer service to all residences in the town, in
accordance with construction and service schedules mutually agreed upon between
the town and the franchisee, and consistent with applicable law.
   (C)   Cable-ready residential developments. Developers of new residential
housing with underground utilities shall provide conduit to accommodate cables
for at least two cable systems.
   (D)   Franchisee or developer responsibilities and options. In the event of
multiple franchisees desiring to serve new residential developments in which
the electric power and telephone utilities are underground, the following
procedure shall apply with respect to access to and utilization of underground
easements.
      (1)   The developer shall be responsible for contacting and surveying all
franchised cable operators to ascertain which operators desire to provide cable
television service to that development. The developer may establish a
reasonable deadline to receive cable operator responses. The final development
map shall indicate the cable operators that have agreed to serve the
development.
      (2)   If one or two cable operators wish to provide service, they shall
be accommodated in the joint utilities trench on a nondiscriminatory shared
cost basis. If fewer than two operators indicate interest, the developer shall
provide conduit to accommodate two sets of cable television cables and dedicate
to the town any initially unoccupied conduit. The developer shall be entitled
to recover the costs of such initially unoccupied conduit in the event that the
town subsequently leases or sells occupancy or use rights to any franchisee.
      (3)   The developer shall provide at least ten working days’ notice of
the date that utility trenches will be open to the cable operators that have
agreed to serve the development. When the trenches are open, cable operators
shall have two working days to begin the installation of their cables, and five
working days after beginning installation to complete installation.
      (4)   The final development map shall not be approved until the developer
submits evidence that:
         (a)   It has notified each franchisee that underground utility
trenches are to be open as of an estimated date, and that each franchisee will
be allowed access to such trenches, including trenches from proposed streets to
individual home sites, on specified nondiscriminatory terms and conditions; and
         (b)   It has received a written notification from each franchisee that
the franchisee intends to install its facilities during the open trench period
on the specified terms and conditions, or such other terms and conditions as
are mutually agreeable to the developer and the franchisee, or has received no
reply from a franchisee within ten days after its notification to such
franchisee, in which case the franchisee will be deemed to have waived its
opportunity to install its facilities during the open trench period.
      (5)   Sharing the joint utilities trench shall be subject to compliance
with state regulatory agency and utility standards. If such compliance is not
possible, the developer shall provide a separate trench for the cable
television cables, with the entire cost shared among the participating
operators. With the concurrence of the developer, the affected utilities and
the cable operators, alternative installation procedures, such as the use of
deeper trenches, may be utilized, subject to applicable law.
      (6)   Any cable operator wishing to serve an area where the trenches have
been closed shall be responsible for its own trenching and associated costs.
      (7)   In the event that more than one franchise is awarded, the town
reserves the right to limit the number of drop cables per residence, or to
require that the drop cable(s) be utilized only by the cable operator selected
by the resident to provide service.
      (8)   The town reserves the right to grant an encroachment permit to a
cable franchisee applicant to install conduit and/or cable in anticipation of
the granting of a franchise. Such installations shall be at the applicant’s
risk, with no recourse against the town in the event the pending franchise
application is not granted. The town may require an applicant to provide a
separate trench for its conduit and/or cable, at the applicant’s cost. The
construction of such separate trench, if provided, shall be coordinated with,
and subject to, to the developer’s overall construction schedule.
(Ord. 25(1994))
§ 8-5-51 RIGHTS RESERVED TO TOWN.
   (A)   In addition to any rights specifically reserved to the town by this
chapter, the town reserves to itself every right and power which is required to
be reserved by a provision of any ordinance or under the franchise.
   (B)   (1)   The town shall have the right to waive any provision of the
franchise, except those required by federal or state regulation, if the town
determines:
         (a)   That it is in the public interest to do so; and
         (b)   That the enforcement of such provision will impose an undue
hardship on the franchisee or the subscribers.
      (2)   To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by a statement in
writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the town. Waiver of any
provision in one instance shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision
subsequent to such instance nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of
the franchise unless the statement so recites.
   (C)   If any area of franchise regulation by the town is preempted by
federal or state law or regulation, and such preemption is later eliminated or
modified, the town, at its sole option, may assume or reassume regulation to
the extent permitted by law.
(Ord. 25(1994))
§ 8-5-52 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this
chapter is for any reasons held to be unconstitutional, void or invalid or for
any reason unenforceable, the validity of the remaining portions of this
chapter shall not be affected thereby, it being the intent of the Town Council
in adopting and approving this chapter that no portion hereof or provision or
regulation contained herein shall become inoperative or fail by reason of any
unconstitutionality or invalidity of any other portion, provision or regulation
and all provisions of this chapter are declared to be severable.

urban interface areas is a potential threat to life and property from fire and
resulting erosion, the objective of this Chapter is to establish minimum
regulations consistent with nationally recognized good practice for the
safeguarding of life and for property protection, and to mitigate the risk to
life and structures from intrusion of fire from wildland fire exposures and
fire exposures from adjacent structures and to mitigate structure fires from
spreading to wildland fuels. This Chapter supplements the Town's codes to
provide for special regulations to mitigate fire and life-safety hazards in the
wildland-urban interface areas.
      7A01.3 Additions or alterations. Additions or alterations shall be
permitted to be made to any building or structure without requiring the

The building official or fire code official shall first find that a special
individual reason makes enforcement of the provisions of this Chapter
impractical, that the modification is in conformance to the intent and purpose
of this Chapter, and that the modification does not lessen any fire protection
requirements or any degree of structural integrity.
      7A03.2 Technical assistance. To determine the acceptability of
technologies, processes, products, facilities, materials and uses attending the
design, operation or use of a building or premises subject to the inspection of
the building official or fire code official, the building official or fire code
official are authorized to require the owner, the owner's authorized agent or
the person in possession or control of the building or premises to provide,
without charge to the Town, a technical opinion and report. The opinion and
report shall be prepared by a qualified engineer, specialist, laboratory or
fire safety specialty organization acceptable to the code official and the
owner or the owner's authorized agent, and shall analyze the fire safety of the
design, operation or use of the building or premises, the facilities and

CHAPTER 5: DESIGN GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS; SIGN MEASUREMENT
Section
11-5-1 Purpose
11-5-2 Design guidelines
11-5-3 Design standards
11-5-4 Sign measurement
§ 11-5-1 PURPOSE.
   The design guidelines and standards exist to provide direction for signs
within the Town of Vail that enhance local streetscapes and provide aesthetic
consistency with both the built and natural environment. The guidelines and
standards are intended to encourage expression and creativity. The design
guidelines make use of the word “should”, to allow for subjectivity and
creativity, whereas the design standards make use of the word “shall”,
signifying strict interpretation and enforcement. The sign measurement section
exists to ensure that measurement of sign area is properly calculated in order
to facilitate signage that upholds the purpose of this title.
(Ord. 11(2021) § 1)
§ 11-5-2 DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   Any sign erected within the Town of Vail should:
   (A)   Be consistent with the scale and architecture already present in the
town. Sign location, configuration, mounting structure, framing design, and
size should be aesthetically harmonious with the mountain setting and the
alpine village atmosphere of the town;
   (B)   Be compatible with the placement of surrounding signs. Similar signs
should not be placed within close proximity of each other, but should instead
incorporate variety and visual interest within the “view corridor” that they
are placed. Signs shall not create visual clutter. The staff shall review all
proposed signs in the context of adjacent signage to verify that the sign is
appropriately placed;
   (C)   Be composed of predominately natural materials.
      (1)   Be composed of predominately natural materials which may include,
but are not limited to, painted, stained, solid, or carved wood; brick; stone;
wrought iron or metals such as copper or brass that have been treated to
prevent reflective glare; nonreflective glass and stained glass; other
naturally textured building materials.
      (2)   Plastic and other synthetic materials that are not naturally
textured, such as sign foam, vinyl or Plexiglas®, are discouraged.
   (D)   Use natural colors.
      (1)   Earth tones. Full spectrum of soil, clay, and metallic colors;
      (2)   Neutrals. Off whites to deep brown and black; and
      (3)   Bright colors. Bright colors should be used only as accents.
   (E)   Use creative graphics and lettering. The creative use of depth,
relief, shading, three- dimensional projections and other pleasing textural
qualities is generally encouraged. Three-dimensional projections shall not be
calculated as part of total sign area, but shall be subject to design review;
   (F)   Be surrounded by landscaping. Landscaping, when appropriate, should be
designed in harmony with surrounding natural landforms and native plants
(xeriscaping); and
   (G)   Use inconspicuous lighting. Lighting should be integrated into the
overall design of the sign, both in color and placement, and should be of no
greater illumination than is necessary to make the sign visible at night.
Recessed and indirect light sources are encouraged.
(Ord. 11(2021) § 1)
§ 11-5-3 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   Any sign erected within the Town of Vail shall conform to the following
standards.
   (A)   Compatibility. Signs shall be visually compatible with the size of
surrounding structures and other signage and shall not visually dominate the
structure or business to which they belong. The staff shall review all proposed
signs in the context of adjacent signage to verify that the sign is
appropriately sized.
   (B)   Colors. Fluorescent, Day-Glo® and neon colors are prohibited, unless
the owner of the sign has a copyright to such color.
   (C)   Reflective surfaces. Sign surfaces that reflect light are prohibited
and shall instead be comprised of matte or flat finishes.
   (D)   Lighting fixtures. Lighting shall be white in color. Lights shall not
shine or reflect onto adjacent properties. Internal illumination and
fluorescent/neon light sources are prohibited. All lighting shall be subject to
design review.
   (E)   Sign maintenance. All signs, including their support structures and
related fixtures, shall be kept in good repair; this includes replacement of
lighting, repainting when appropriate and other actions that contribute to
attractive signage. The display surfaces and hardware of all signs shall be
properly painted, finished or posted at all times. The glass surfaces on which
window signs are affixed shall be well maintained.
   (F)   Electrical wiring. Electrical wiring shall be concealed. In addition,
all signs that contain electrical wiring shall be subject to the provisions of
the adopted Electrical Code of the town and the electrical components shall
bear the label of an approved testing agency.
   (G)   Wind pressure and dead load requirements. Any “sign”, as defined
throughout this title, shall be designed to withstand wind pressures and shall
support dead loads as required by the most recent building code (IBC) at the
time of construction, as adopted by the Town of Vail and determined by the
Chief Building Official.
   (H)   Placement on public property. Signs shall be constructed on private
property outside of the town right-of-way and shall not project onto the town
right- of-way except when permitted under a licensing agreement or a revocable
right-of-way permit issued from the Town of Vail.
   (I)   Sign inspection. Each sign for which a permit is required shall be
subject to inspection by the staff.
(Ord. 11(2021) § 1)

signs) shall be measured by up to two imaginary polygons enclosing all letters,
graphics and sign base material, including framing, not integrated into the
architecture of the building.
   (B)   Multifaced signs. When two sign faces are placed back to back and are
at no point more than one foot from one another, the sign area shall be the
area of the larger face. Sign area of all other multifaced signs shall be
calculated as the total area of all sign faces.
   (C)   Window signs. Window signs shall be measured by the exact square
footage of opaque or translucent materials affixed within three feet of the
window.
   (D)   Display boxes. Display boxes shall be measured by the area of the
outside dimensions of the box, including framing.

§ 12-3-4 DETERMINATION OF SIMILAR USE.
   (A)   Uses not listed. In order to ensure that the zoning regulations will
permit similar uses in certain prescribed commercial zones, the Town Council,
on its initiative or upon written request, shall determine whether a use not
specifically listed as a permitted use shall be deemed a permitted use on the
basis of similarity to uses specifically listed. The procedure prescribed in
this section shall not be substituted for the amendment procedure as a means of
adding new uses to the lists of permitted uses, but shall be followed to
determine whether the characteristics of a particular use not listed are
sufficiently similar to certain classes of permitted uses to justify a finding
that the use should be deemed a permitted use.
   (B)   Review use characteristics. The Administrator, upon request of the
Town Council, or written request of any person for a determination under this
section, shall review the characteristics of any use proposed to be determined
as similar to permitted uses, and shall transmit a report to the Council
advising in what respects the proposed use would be, in fact, similar to
specified permitted uses in the same zone district, or in what respects the
proposed use would not be similar to permitted uses, or would be similar to
uses specifically permitted only in other zone districts. After receipt of the
report, the Council may determine the proposed use to be similar to uses
specified as permitted uses in the same zone district if it finds that the
proposed use will not be substantially different in its operation or other
characteristics from uses specifically permitted in the same zone district. The
Council shall state the basis for its determination, and the use thereafter
shall be deemed a permitted use subject to the same regulations as specifically
permitted uses in the same zone district.

site allocation be sworn to by the owner or owners of the site.
   (D)   Lots to meet standards.
      (1)   No site declared under this section shall be recognized as a usable
site pursuant to the provisions of this title if it results in creation of any
site or parcel of land which does not fully meet the lot site and dimension
requirements of the zone district in which it is located.
      (2)   The declaration of site allocation procedure shall not be
substituted for the procedures prescribed in Title 13 of this code if the site
constitutes a portion of a parcel which can be further subdivided or otherwise
is subject to the provisions of Title 13 of this code.

§ 12-6J-1 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The Vail Village Townhouse District is intended to provide sites for,
and maintain the unique residential character of, existing townhouse properties
in the East Gore Creek subarea of the Vail Village Master Plan area. This zone
district was specifically developed to only be applied to the properties known
at the time of the establishment of this district as the Vail townhouses
condominium, Vail row houses, Vail trails chalets, Vail trails east
condominiums and the Texas townhomes. The Vail Village Townhouse District is
intended to ensure adequate light, air, open space and other amenities
commensurate with townhomes, and to maintain the desirable residential and
resort qualities of the zone district by establishing appropriate site
development standards. Certain nonresidential uses are permitted as conditional
uses, which relate to the nature of Vail as a winter and summer recreation and
year round community and, where permitted, are intended to blend harmoniously
with the residential character of the zone district.
   (B)   This zone district was established to regulate existing townhome
properties that were legally nonconforming in the High Density Multiple-Family
District. The Vail Village Townhouse District is meant to encourage and provide
incentives for redevelopment of existing townhouse properties in accordance
with the Vail Village Master Plan. The incentives in this zone district include
addressing both townhouse projects and individually platted townhouse lots,
reductions in lot area standards, reductions in setbacks, increases in density,
increases in gross residential floor area (GRFA) and changes in parking design
requirements. More restrictive design considerations have been applied to these
properties in accordance with the Vail Village Master Plan to maintain the
unique residential character of existing townhouse developments in Vail
Village.

mixture of multiple-family dwellings, lodges, hotels, fractional fee clubs,
timeshares, lodge dwelling units, restaurants, offices, skier services, and
commercial establishments in a clustered, unified development. Lionshead Mixed
Use 1 District, in accordance with the Lionshead Redevelopment Master Plan, is
intended to ensure adequate light, air, open space and other amenities
appropriate to the permitted types of buildings and uses and to maintain the
desirable qualities of the zone district by establishing appropriate site
development standards. This zone district is meant to encourage and provide
incentives for redevelopment in accordance with the Lionshead Redevelopment
Master Plan.
   (B)   This zone district was specifically developed to provide incentives
for properties to redevelop. The ultimate goal of these incentives is to create
an economically vibrant lodging, housing and commercial core area. The
incentives in this zone district include increases in allowable gross
residential floor area, building height and density over the previously
established zoning in the Lionshead Redevelopment Master Plan study area. The
primary goal of the incentives is to create economic conditions favorable to
inducing private redevelopment consistent with the Lionshead Redevelopment
Master Plan. Additionally, the incentives are created to help finance public
off site improvements adjacent to redevelopment projects. With any development/
redevelopment proposal taking advantage of the incentives created herein, the
following amenities will be evaluated: streetscape improvements; pedestrian/
bicycle access; public plaza redevelopment; public art; roadway improvements;
and similar improvements.

mixture of multiple-family dwellings, lodges, hotels, fractional fee clubs,
timeshares, lodge dwelling units, restaurants, offices, skier services, light
industrial activities and commercial establishments in a clustered, unified
development. Lionshead Mixed Use 2 District, in accordance with the Lionshead
Redevelopment Master Plan, is intended to ensure adequate light, air, open
space and other amenities appropriate to the permitted types of buildings and
uses and to maintain the desirable qualities of the zone district by
establishing appropriate site development standards. This zone district is
meant to encourage and provide incentives for redevelopment in accordance with
the Lionshead Redevelopment Master Plan.
   (B)   This zone district was specifically developed to provide incentives
for properties to redevelop. The ultimate goal of these incentives is to create
an economically vibrant lodging, housing and commercial core area. The
incentives in this zone district include increases in allowable gross
residential floor area, building height, and density over the previously
established zoning in the Lionshead Redevelopment Master Plan study area. The
primary goal of the incentives is to create economic conditions favorable to
inducing private redevelopment consistent with the Lionshead Redevelopment
Master Plan. Additionally, the incentives are created to help finance public,
off site, improvements adjacent to redevelopment projects. Public amenities
which will be evaluated with redevelopment proposals taking advantage of the
incentives created herein may include: streetscape improvements; pedestrian/
bicycle access; public plaza redevelopment; public art; roadway improvements;
and similar improvements.

§ 12-10-1 PURPOSE.
   In order to alleviate progressively or to prevent traffic congestion and
shortage of on street parking areas, off-street parking and loading facilities
shall be provided incidental to new structures, enlargements of existing
structures or a conversion to a new use which requires additional parking under
this chapter. The number of parking spaces and loading berths prescribed in
this chapter shall be in proportion to the need for such facilities created by
the particular type of use. Off-street parking and loading areas are to be
designed, maintained and operated in a manner that will ensure their
usefulness, protect the public safety, and, where appropriate, insulate
surrounding land uses from their impact. In certain districts, all or a portion
of the parking spaces prescribed by this chapter are required to be within the
main building in order to avoid or to minimize the adverse visual impact of
large concentrations or exposed parking and of separate garage or carport
structures.
(Ord. 8(1973) § 14.100; Ord. 19(1976) § 12; Ord. 26(1982) § 1)
§ 12-10-2 APPLICABILITY.
   Off-street parking and loading space shall be provided for any new building,
for any addition or enlargement of an existing building or for any conversion
of uses which requires additional parking under this chapter.

§ 12-10-3 EXISTING FACILITIES.
   Off-street parking and loading facilities used for off-street parking and
loading on the effective date hereof shall not be reduced in capacity to less
than the number of spaces prescribed in this chapter, or reduced in area or
number to less than the minimum standards prescribed in this chapter.

§ 12-10-4 ADDITIONS OR CHANGES.
   For additions or enlargements of any existing building or change of use that
would increase the total number of parking spaces required, the additional
parking shall be required only for such addition, enlargement or change and not
for the entire building or use.
(Ord. 8(1973) § 14.202; Ord. 19(1976) § 12)
§ 12-10-5 CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE.
   All off-street parking and loading facilities required by this chapter shall
be constructed and maintained in accordance with the minimum standards for such
facilities prescribed by this chapter, and shall be maintained free of
accumulated snow or other materials preventing full use and occupancy of the
facilities in accordance with the intent of this chapter, except for temporary
periods of short duration in event of heavy or unusual snowfall.
(Ord. 8(1973) § 14.300)
§ 12-10-6 PARKING; OFF SITE AND JOINT FACILITIES.
   All parking and loading facilities required by this chapter shall be located
on the same site as the use for which they are required, provided that the Town
Council may permit off site or jointly used parking facilities if located
within 300 feet of the use served. Authority to permit off site or joint
parking facilities shall not extend to parking spaces required by this title to
be located within the main building on a site, but may extend to parking spaces
permitted to be unenclosed. Prior to permitting off site or joint parking
facilities, the Council shall determine that the proposed location of the
parking facilities and the prospective operation and maintenance of the
facilities will fulfill the purposes of this chapter, will be as usable and
convenient as parking facilities located on the site of the use, and will not
cause traffic congestion or an unsightly concentration of parked cars. The
Council may require such legal instruments as it deems necessary to ensure
unified operation and control of joint parking facilities or to ensure the
continuation of such facilities, including evidence of ownership, long term
lease or easement.
(Ord. 8(1973) § 14.400; Ord. 29(2005) § 29)
§ 12-10-7 STANDARDS; AUTHORITY TO ADJUST.
   Parking standards shall be those provided in Title 14 of this code. The
standards set out in Title 14 of this code shall govern the design and
construction of all off-street parking and loading facilities, whether required
by this chapter or provided in addition to the requirements of this chapter.
Minor adjustments of the dimensions prescribed in this chapter may be
authorized by the Administrator if consistent with generally recognized design
standards for off-street parking and loading facilities.

§ 12-10-9 LOADING STANDARDS.
   Standards for off-street loading shall be as follows.
   (A)   Location. All off-street loading berths shall be located on the same
lot as the use served, but not in the required front setback. Off-street
loading berths shall be provided in addition to required off-street parking and
shall not be located within accessways.
   (B)   Size. Each required loading berth shall be not less than 12 feet wide,
35 feet long, and if enclosed and/or covered, 14 feet high. Adequate turning
and maneuvering space shall be provided within the lot lines. At the Planning
and Environmental Commission’s discretion, variations to
the minimum loading berth dimension standards outlined above may be approved or
required, subject to the Planning and Environmental Commission finding that
such variation is necessary to prevent negative impacts to the public right-of-
way.
   (C)   Access. Accessways not less than ten feet or more than 20 feet in
width shall connect all loading berths to a street or alley. Such accessways
may coincide with accessways to parking facilities.

§ 12-10-16 EXEMPT AREAS; PARKING FUND ESTABLISHED.
   (A)   Criteria. The Town Council by resolution may exempt certain areas from
the off-street parking and loading requirements of this chapter if alternative
means will meet the off-street parking and loading needs of all uses in the
area. Prior to exempting any area from the off-street parking and loading
requirements, the Council shall determine the following:
      (1)   That the exemption is in the interests of the area to be exempted
and in the interests of the town at large;
      (2)   That the exemption will not confer any special privilege or benefit
upon properties or improvements in the area to be exempted, which privilege or
benefit is not conferred on similarly situated properties elsewhere in the
town;
      (3)   That the exemption will not be detrimental to adjacent properties
or improvements in the vicinity of the area to be exempted; and
      (4)   That suitable and adequate means will exist for provision of
public, community, group or common parking facilities; for provision of
adequate loading facilities and for a system for distribution and pick up of
goods; and for financing, operating and maintaining such facilities; and that
such parking, loading and distribution facilities shall be fully adequate to
meet the existing and projected needs generated by all uses in the area to be
exempted.
   (B)   Parking Fund. For projects located within the town’s “parking pay-in-
lieu” zones (as identified on the town’s official “parking pay-in-lieu zone”
maps, incorporated by reference) property owners or applicants shall be
required to contribute to the Town Parking Fund, hereby established for the
purpose of meeting the demand and requirements for vehicle parking to the
extent outlined in applicable master plan documents and the zoning regulations.
At such time as any property owner or other applicant proposes to develop or
redevelop a parcel of property within an exempt area which would require
parking and/or loading areas, the owner or applicant shall pay to the town the
parking fee hereinafter required:
      (1)   The Parking Fund established in this section shall receive and
disburse funds for the purpose of conducting parking studies or evaluations,
construction of parking facilities, the maintenance of parking facilities, the
payment of bonds or other indebtedness for parking facilities, and
administrative services relating to parking;
      (2)   The parking fee to be paid by any owner or applicant shall be
determined by the Town Council;
      (3)   If any parking funds have been paid in accordance with this section
and if subsequent thereto a special or general improvement district is formed
and assessments levied for the purpose of paying for parking improvements, the
payer shall be credited against the assessment with the amount previously paid;
      (4)   The parking fee to be paid by any owner or applicant is hereby
determined to be $18,597.80 per space for residential uses (including, but not
limited to, accommodation units, timeshares and fractional fee units). There is
no pay in lieu fee for commercial uses. This fee shall be automatically
adjusted annually by the percentage the consumer price index of the City of
Denver has increased or decreased over each successive year;
      (5)   For additions or enlargements of any existing building or change of
use that would increase the total number of parking spaces required, an
additional parking fee will be required only for such addition, enlargement or
change and not for the entire building or use. No refunds will be paid by the
town to the applicant or owner;
      (6)   (a)   The owner or applicant has the option of paying the total
parking fee at the time of building permit or paying over a five-year period.
If the latter course is taken, the first payment shall be paid on or before the
date the building permit is issued. Four more annual payments will be due to
the town on the anniversary of the building permit. Interest of 10% per annum
shall be paid by the applicant on the unpaid balance.
         (b)   If the owner or applicant does choose to pay the fee over a
period of time, he or she shall be required to sign a promissory note which
describes the total fee due, the schedule of payments, and the interest due.
Promissory note forms are available at the offices of the Department of
Community Development.
      (7)   When a fractional number of spaces results from the application of
the requirements schedule (§
12-10-10 of this chapter) the parking fee will be calculated using that
fraction. This applies only to the calculation of the parking fee and not for
on site requirements.

§ 12-10-17 LEASING OF PARKING SPACES.
   (A)   General. Except as expressly provided in this section, no person shall
lease, rent, convey or restrict the use of any parking space to any person
other than a tenant, occupant or user of the building for which the space is
required.
   (B)   Eligibility. A parking space may be leased in accordance with the
following:
      (1)   Zone Districts. Any person who owns or manages private parking

      (2)   Prohibited areas. The leasing of parking spaces is prohibited in
any area where vehicle access to said parking spaces is over or through an
established pedestrian mall;
      (3)   Common areas. The leasing of parking spaces on commonly owned
property, including without limitation common areas within a common interest
community, requires the written approval of the applicable homeowners’ or
condominium association, a copy of which shall be provided to the town prior to
leasing any parking spaces;
      (4)   Duration. Leasing is permitted for short term parking only, and
long-term storage of vehicles is prohibited; and
      (5)   Rental agencies. Vehicle rental agencies may lease parking spaces
only in the Commercial Core 3 Zone District, with a maximum of one lease and a

   (C)   Required parking. Parking required by this title for any use may not
be satisfied by the leasing of parking spaces under this section.
   (D)   Signage. Any person leasing parking spaces under this section shall
post adequate signage on the premises to ensure that the leased parking spaces
are used and occupied in accordance with the applicable lease agreement. At
least one on site sign shall include the name and telephone number of the
person to contact concerning parking disputes.
   (E)   Contact information. Any person who accepts electronic reservations
for the leasing of parking spaces pursuant to this section shall include on the
reservation page a contact name and telephone number in case of any problems

   Tables 1 and 2 (core area parking maps I and II, respectively, attached to
the ordinance codified herein, and available for inspection in the office of
the Town Clerk) shall be used to identify properties within Vail’s commercial
core areas for parking purposes.
(Ord. 9(2000) § 4; Ord. 15(2000) § 1)
§ 12-10-20 SPECIAL REVIEW PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Notwithstanding the provisions of §
12-10-18 of this chapter, the Planning and Environmental Commission may approve
a reduction to the number of required spaces specified in §
12-10-10 of this chapter, provided a report documenting the presence of unique
parking characteristics is provided by a qualified consultant and the following
findings are made by the Planning and Environmental Commission:
      (1)   The parking demand will be less than the requirements identified in
§
12-10-10 of this chapter;
      (2)   The probable long term use of the building or structure, based on
its design, will not generate additional parking demand;
      (3)   The use or activity is part of a demonstrated permanent program
(including, but not limited to, “rideshare” programs, shuttle service or
staggered work shifts) intended to reduce parking demand that has been
incorporated into the project’s final approved development plan; and
      (4)   Proximity or availability of alternative modes of transportation
(including, but not limited to, public transit or shuttle services) is
significant and integral to the nature of the use or business activity.
   (B)   In reaching a decision, the Planning and Environmental Commission
shall consider survey data submitted by a qualified transportation planning or
engineering consultant. Projects under “special review” are subject to
additional scrutiny by the Planning and Environmental Commission after
development plan approval if it is deemed necessary to verify continued
compliance with the above listed criteria. The maximum allowable reduction in
the number of required spaces shall not exceed 25% of the total number required
under §
12-10-10 of this chapter.
(Ord. 9(2000) § 5; Ord. 29(2005) § 29)
§ 12-10-21 PARKING PAY IN LIEU ZONES ESTABLISHED.
   The “parking pay in lieu zone” maps (attached to the ordinance codified
herein, and available for inspection in the office of the Town Clerk) shall be
used to identify properties within the parking pay in lieu zones referenced in
§
12-10-16 of this chapter. Properties will be required to comply with the
amended program upon demolition/rebuild. Properties not included in the pay in
lieu zones may apply to the Planning and Environmental Commission for review if
the provision of on site parking on the property would circumvent relevant
objectives of applicable comprehensive plan documents including, but not
limited to, parking, pedestrianization, and vehicle penetration elements.

12-11-12 Lapse of design review approval
§ 12-11-1 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Attractive attributes recognized. Vail is a town with a unique natural
setting, internationally known for its natural beauty, alpine environment and
the compatibility of human-made structures with the environment. These
characteristics have caused a significant number of visitors to come to Vail
with many visitors eventually becoming permanent residents participating in
community life.
   (B)   Area character protection. These factors constitute an important
economic base for the town, both for those who earn their living here and for
those who view the town as a precious physical possession. The Town Council
finds that new development and redevelopment can have a substantial impact on
the character of an area in which it is located. Some harmful effects of one
land use upon another can be prevented through zoning, subdivision controls and
building codes. Other aspects of development are more subtle and less amenable
to exact rules put into operation without regard to specific development
proposals. Among these are the general form of the land before and after
development, the spatial relationships of structures and open spaces to land
uses within the vicinity and the town, and the appearance of buildings and open
spaces as they contribute to the area as it is being developed and redeveloped.
In order to provide for the timely exercise of judgment in the public interest
in the evaluation of the design of new development and redevelopment, the Town
Council has created a Design Review Board (DRB) and design criteria.
   (C)   Design review. Therefore, in order to preserve the natural beauty of
the town and its setting, to protect the welfare of the community, to maintain
the values created in the community, to protect and enhance land and property,
for the promotion of health, safety and general welfare in the community, and
to attain the objectives set out in this section; the improvement or alteration
of open space, exterior design of all new development, and all modifications to
existing development shall be subject to design review as specified in this
chapter.
   (D)   Guidelines. It is the intent of these guidelines to leave as much
design freedom as possible to the individual designer while at the same time
maintaining the remarkable natural beauty of the area by creating structures
which are designed to complement both their individual sites and surroundings.
The objectives of design review shall be as follows:
      (1)   Recognize the interdependence of the public welfare and aesthetics,
and to provide a method by which this interdependence may continue to benefit
its citizens and visitors;
      (2)   Allow for the development of public and private property which is
in harmony with the desired character of the town as defined by the guidelines
herein provided;
      (3)   Prevent the unnecessary destruction or blighting of the natural
landscape;
      (4)   Ensure that the architectural design, location, configuration
materials, colors and overall treatment of built up and open spaces have been
designed so that they relate harmoniously to the natural landforms and native
vegetation, the town’s overall appearance, with surrounding development and
with officially approved plans or guidelines, if any, for the areas in which
the structures are proposed to be located; and
      (5)   Protect neighboring property owners and users by making sure that
reasonable provision has been made for such matters as pedestrian and vehicular
traffic, surface water drainage, sound and sight buffers, the preservation of
light and air, and those aspects of design not adequately covered by other
regulations which may have substantial effects on neighboring land uses;
      (6)   Balance the design and aesthetic desires of the community and the
economy of Vail as an international resort destination with the need to protect
the community from the risk of wildland fire.
(Ord. 39(1983) § 1; Ord. 29(2005) § 30; Ord. 19(2019) § 3)
§ 12-11-2 DEFINITIONS AND RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   Basis for meanings. Any words, terms or phrases used in this design
review guide shall be defined and interpreted in accordance with the
definitions contained in §
12-2-2 of this title, unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning
was intended. If the context is unclear, the matter will be referred to the
Design Review Board for final determination.
   (B)   Mandatory, discretionary distinction. The distinction made between
those items contained within this chapter that are mandatory and those that are
discretionary is that statements which are mandatory are prefaced by the word
“shall”, and the statements or guidelines which are discretionary (or merely
suggestions) are prefaced by the words “should” or “may”. In all instances, any
particular or specific controls over the general.
(Ord. 39(1983) § 1)
§ 12-11-3 DESIGN APPROVAL.
   (A)   Scope. No person shall commence removal of vegetation, site
preparation, building construction or demolition, dumping of material upon a
site, sign erection, exterior alteration or enlargement of an existing
structure, paving, fencing or other improvements of open space within the
corporate limits of the town unless design approval has been granted as
prescribed in this chapter. The addition of plant materials to existing
landscaping, gardening and landscape maintenance shall be exempt from this
provision, but should still comply with the Vail Fire and Emergency Services
Fire-Resistant Landscaping guidelines.
   (B)   Violation. It shall be a violation of this chapter and the building
permit for any person to commence, continue or complete work that has not
received design approval as prescribed in this chapter and/or is not in
conformity with the plans approved and authorized by the Administrator and/or
the Design Review Board and the Building Official.
   (C)   Nonconforming sites and structures; effect of design guidelines.
      (1)   Buildings and sites which are not in conformance with the design
guidelines, due to annexations or changes in code provisions (i.e., legal
nonconformities), shall be required to conform with the design guidelines when
allowable gross residential floor area (GRFA) (the GRFA that is permitted by
the density control section of various zone districts), gross floor area,
commercial floor area or garage area credit is added to any existing structure
or site. Nothing in this code shall be deemed to retroactively require
conformance with design guidelines for existing buildings or sites unless
specifically required by this code.
      (2)   From the effective date of July 21, 1998, there shall be permitted
a one-time exclusion from this provision for an expansion to single-family,
two-family and primary/secondary residential dwelling units. This one-time
exclusion shall be allowed for a single expansion of 500 square feet or less of
allowable GRFA or garage area credit per dwelling unit. In which case,
structures may be expanded without requiring upgrades to entire structures and
sites to conform to the design guidelines. The addition itself, however, shall
conform to the design guidelines. An expansion which is greater than 500 square
feet, or any subsequent expansion to a structure, regardless of size, shall
require full compliance of the dwelling unit with the design guidelines.
      (3)   General maintenance and upkeep of a property shall continue to be
required regardless of the amount of floor area added to a structure. The one-
time exclusion noted above shall not preclude the Design Review Board, pursuant
to the design guidelines, from requiring landscaping and other improvements
necessary to buffer or mitigate development impacts associated with the
expansion/remodel.
      (4)   Expansions made pursuant to §
12-15-5 of this title shall require full compliance of the entire dwelling unit
with the design guidelines. Interior conversion additions pursuant to §
12-15-4 of this title shall not trigger the requirement for upgrading sites and
structures to fully comply with the design guidelines, unless it can be
classified as a “demo/rebuild”, pursuant to §
12-2-2 of this title.

§ 12-11-4 MATERIAL TO BE SUBMITTED; PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Preapplication conference. Prior to the formal filing of an
application for design approval, the applicant should confer with the
Department of Community Development to obtain information and guidance. The
purpose of such a conference is to permit the applicant and the staff to review
informally the proposal before substantial commitments of time and money are
made. The Department of Community Development shall indicate on the application
form appropriate staff with which the applicant shall confer. Topics of
discussion shall include, but not be limited to:
      (1)   Characteristics of the site and surrounding areas, including its
location, significant natural and human-made features with particular attention
to natural hazard areas, the size and accessibility of the site, surrounding
development and land use, and existing zoning;
      (2)   The nature of the development proposed, including land use types
and their densities; the placement and design of proposed buildings and other
improvements of the site, the location, type, and treatment of open space
areas, the preservation of natural features, proposed parking areas and
internal circulation system, the total ground coverage of paved areas, and
structures;
      (3)   Community policy considerations including the review process and
likely conformity of the proposed development with the policies and regulations
of the town;
      (4)   Applicable regulations, review procedures and submission
requirements; and
      (5)   For certain low impact applications, such as, but not limited to,
minor remodels, the staff shall assist the applicant in determining applicable
regulations and shall specify submission requirements which may be waived.
   (B)   Conceptual design review.
      (1)   Submittal requirements. The owner or authorized agent of any
project requiring design approval may submit plans for conceptual review by the
Design Review Board to the Department of Community Development. The purpose of
a conceptual review is to give the applicant a basic understanding with respect
to the design concept and the compatibility of a proposal with the design
guidelines contained within this chapter. This procedure is recommended mainly
for those applications of a higher impact than single-family and two-family
residences although projects of that nature shall not be excluded the
opportunity to request a conceptual design review. The following information
shall be submitted for a conceptual review ten days prior to a scheduled Design
Review Board meeting:
         (a)   A conceptual site and landscape plan at a minimum scale of one
inch equals 20 feet;
         (b)   Conceptual elevations and exterior materials, and a description
of the character of the proposed structure or structures;
         (c)   Sufficient information to show that the proposal complies with
the development standards of the zone district in which the project is to be
located (i.e., square footage total, site coverage calculations, number of
parking spaces and the like);
         (d)   Application form. If the property is owned in common
(condominium association) or located within a development lot, the written
approval of the other property owner, owners or applicable owners’ association
is required. This can be either in the form of a letter of approval or
signature on the application. Such approval shall not be necessary if the
application is solely for installation of a renewable energy generation device
as allowed by C.R.S. § 38-30-168, as amended; and
         (e)   Planning and Environmental Commission and/or Town Council
approval if required.
      (2)   Staff; Board procedure.
         (a)   Upon receipt of an application for conceptual design review the
Department of Community Development shall review the submitted materials for
general compliance with the appropriate requirements of the zoning regulations.
If the proposal is in basic compliance with the zoning regulations the project
shall be forwarded to the Design Review Board for conceptual review. If the
application is not generally in compliance with the zoning regulations the
application and submittal materials shall be returned to the applicant with a
written explanation of the Department of Community Development’s findings.
         (b)   The Design Review Board shall review the application and
supporting material that has been submitted for a conceptual review in order to
determine whether or not the project generally complies with the design
guidelines, and forward comments concerning the design to the applicant. No
vote of the Design Review Board will be required unless requested by the
applicant. The property owner or his or her representative shall be present at
the Design Review Board hearing.

(2019) § 5; Ord. 2(2023) § 1)
§ 12-11-5 DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   The design guidelines for all development are contained in Title 14 of this
code.
(Ord. 22(1999) § 5; Ord. 29(2005) § 30)
§ 12-11-6 PARK DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   (A)   Purpose. These guidelines shall be used by the Design Review Board in
reviewing any proposals for the development of town park land. The guidelines
shall be used in conjunction with the general design review guidelines found in
Title 14 of this code. It is the intent of these guidelines to leave as much
design freedom as possible to the individual designer while at the same time
encouraging park development that will complement the natural beauty of our
park land. The purpose of the guidelines is to provide continuity in the
character of the parks which will be developed over many years. The guidelines
will provide consistent design criteria to maintain the quality of town parks
through all phases of development.
   (B)   Building materials and design.
      (1)   General.
         (a)   Natural materials are strongly encouraged in park construction.
Materials and detailing must complement the park’s environment as well as be
functional and attractive.
         (b)   Materials and designs should be chosen that are economical to
maintain.
      (2)   Stone. Natural rock should be used for architectural features such
as exposed building walls and small retaining walls. Sandy gray and brown
colors are encouraged, as they blend in with the natural environment.
Construction should minimize exposed mortar, and detailing should reflect
concern for local climatic conditions.
      (3)   Pedestrian walks; plazas. Impervious surfacing may be used to
emphasize important features or pedestrian areas. Natural materials and colors
are encouraged, as they blend in well with wood, stone and plant materials.
Asphalt is discouraged except when necessary for bike paths and parking areas.
      (4)   Children’s play areas. Children’s play areas are to be designed
with challenge and safety in mind. Multilevel play structures, tunnels and
other climbing apparatus are to be designed to excite and to encourage free
expression. Native landscaping materials shall be incorporated into the play
areas to soften and blend into the environment. Plant materials shall be
provided for the enclosure of the play areas and for summer shading. Play areas
shall be oriented to take advantage of warm winter exposure and to utilize
natural buffers from the wind.
      (5)   Visual impact.
         (a)   Structures, shelters or other site buildings shall be designed
in a low profile or be set into slope areas to reduce their vertical dominance
upon the site.
         (b)   Major architectural structures shall be designed and accented to
attract visitors without becoming a distracting visual element to other
visitors of the park or to adjacent developments.
   (C)   Landscaping; site planning.
      (1)   General.
         (a)   Plantings should be used to soften the edge between developed
and natural park areas and to heavily screen conflicting adjacent uses. Such
plantings unify developed and natural areas as well as provide a protective
buffer where the adjacent land uses conflict with recreational activities. As
an example, gently sloping lawns are desirable for picnic areas and open field
play. Irrigated and manicured lawn areas can transition into natural areas
through the use of native grasses and shrubs. Fences shall be discouraged
between active and passive areas.
         (b)   Noise generating and active play areas should be integrated
together and placed away from passive or natural areas. Needed service
facilities, such as restrooms, drinking fountains and the like, should be
located in or adjacent to activities with a high user demand.
      (2)   Views. Plantings and site work should be used to direct views by
framing interesting and attractive features such as distant mountain ranges,
ponds or Gore Creek. Visual screens of plant materials may be used to close off
undesired views such as the interstate, frontage roads or neighboring
development.
      (3)   Accent plantings and materials. In areas of special interest or
activity, and in pedestrian areas, plantings should be used to provide color,
texture, form and scent to highlight and emphasize the special character of
these places. Horizontal ground plane textures such as native shrubs, ground
covers, colored pavers and smooth boulders may also be used to complement the
environment.
      (4)   Lighting. If site lighting is deemed appropriate, the lighting
should provide for clear visibility while at the same time eliminating any
glare within the park or on adjacent properties. Lighting fixtures shall be as
subtle as possible so that they blend in with the natural park setting. A
lighting plan designating location and appropriate styles of lighting shall be
designed for each park that requires site lighting.
      (5)   Signage. Any signs within the park shall conform to a unified park
signage program. Private signs are prohibited from the park.
   (D)   Access and parking.
      (1)   Pedestrian walks and bike paths.
         (a)   Pedestrian walks and bike paths shall be provided in the areas
of developed facilities and circulation routes. Walks and bike paths shall be
accessible to the physically handicapped and should be constructed of a hard
material.
         (b)   Pathways through natural areas shall be placed where little
grade change is required. Surface materials which provide a hard surface and
have a natural appearance should be encouraged.
      (2)   Parking.
         (a)   Parking areas shall be sensitively planned to provide needed
parking without impacting the natural or recreational use areas. Parking shall
be visually screened to as great a degree as feasible.
         (b)   Landscaping should be provided along public perimeter roads and
between parking areas to provide screening of noise and visual pollution.
   (E)   Site preservation and maintenance.
      (1)   Site preservation. Open meadows of native grasses and flowers, and
permanent stands of evergreens should be maintained in undeveloped areas of the
parks.
      (2)   Site revegetation. Natural areas that are disturbed during
construction shall be vegetated to encourage plant associations that develop
naturally on the site. Revegetation should match preexisting conditions as
closely as possible.
      (3)   Erosion control.
         (a)   Temporary erosion control measures during construction, and
permanent control measures after construction shall be established to prevent
sediment pollution of the creek and to stabilize disturbed areas. Straw bales
shall be used for temporary control measures and jute netting should be used to
permanently stabilize slopes. Any park projects shall be required to include a
site preservation program during construction phases.
         (b)   Limits of site disturbance shall be clearly and physically
defined as well as enforced in order to minimize disturbance to other areas in
the park.
(Ord. 4(1986) § 1; Ord. 29(2005) § 30)
§ 12-11-7 DESIGN REVIEW FEE.
   The Town Council shall set a design review fee schedule sufficient to cover
the cost of town staff time, consultant fees and incidental expense.
(Ord. 39(1983) § 1; Ord. 29(2005) § 30)
§ 12-11-8 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   The Building Official shall not issue a final certificate of occupancy for
structures which have obtained design review approval until upon inspection it
is determined that the project is constructed in accordance with the approved
design review application and plans, and all improvements, amenities and
landscaping have been installed. The Building Official may issue a temporary
certificate of occupancy not to exceed 210 days upon the applicant posting with
the Department of Community Development a performance bond or other security
acceptable to the Town Council in the sum of 125% of the bona fide estimate of
the cost of installing landscaping and paving and other accessory improvements
provided for in the approved design review application and plans. If said
landscaping, paving and other accessory improvements are not installed by the
applicant within the period allowed, the temporary certificate of occupancy may
be revoked until the same are installed by the applicant or by the town
pursuant to the terms of the performance bond or other accepted security that
has been approved by the town.

   This section was repealed by Ord. 2(2003) § 1.
§ 12-11-11 ENFORCEMENT; INSPECTION.
   Before occupying or using any structure included in a design review
application, the applicant must obtain an occupancy certificate after
inspection by the Department of Community Development. The Department of
Community Development shall inspect the site to ensure that the work has been
completed in accordance with the application and plans approved by the Design
Review Board. It shall be the duty of the property owner or his or her
authorized agent to notify the Department of Community Development that such
work is ready for inspection in order to ascertain compliance with approved
plans. If the project is found upon inspection to be fully completed and in
compliance with the approved design review application and plans, the
Department of Community Development shall issue a final certificate of
occupancy. If the project is found to be completed in such a manner that a
temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued as specified by the adopted
Building Code, the applicant shall post a bond as set forth in § 
12-11-8 of this chapter. Upon forfeiture of said bond or surety, the town shall
proceed to install the improvements for which bond or surety was posted. In the
event that the cost of installing the improvements exceeds the amount of the
bond, the owner of said property shall be individually liable to the town for
the additional costs thereof. Furthermore, the amount that the cost of
installing said improvements exceeds the amount of the performance bond shall
automatically become a lien upon any and all property included within the
design review application.

§ 12-11-12 LAPSE OF DESIGN REVIEW APPROVAL.
   Approval of the design of a project as prescribed by this chapter shall
lapse and shall become void one year following the date of final approval of
the project unless prior to the expiration of one year, a building permit is
issued and construction is commenced and diligently pursued toward completion.
However, if there have been no zoning revisions or revisions or amendments to
these guidelines which would alter the conditions under which the approval was
given, the community development staff may extend the period of approval.

§ 12-12-11 ACTION BY COMMISSION.
   (A)   Criteria for decision. Following review of the environmental impact
report, the Planning and Environmental Commission shall approve, disapprove or
request changes in the project in writing. The Planning and Environmental
Commission shall approve the project unless it finds that either the project
will have significant long term adverse effects on the environment with respect
to the natural systems or other factors studied as prescribed in §
12-12-4 of this chapter or the project will have short term adverse effects on
the environment so detrimental that public health, safety or welfare
considerations preclude approval of the project. In the case of either finding,
if changes in the project are feasible which ameliorate or avoid the adverse
effects on the environment sufficiently to permit approval of the project, the
Planning and Environmental Commission, in writing, shall describe those changes
and request those changes be made. If the Planning and Environmental Commission
determines that the changes are not feasible, it shall disapprove the project
in writing, describing the adverse effects on the environment, the significance
of the effects either to the natural systems or other factors studied as
prescribed in §
12-12-4 of this chapter or to the public health, safety or welfare and the
Planning and Environmental Commission’s reasons for concluding that no changes
in the project are feasible to ameliorate or avoid those effects.
   (B)   Design changes require resubmission to Design Review Board. If the
Planning and Environmental Commission requests any changes in the project which
would alter the design of the project previously approved by the Design Review
Board, and the sponsor of the project makes those changes, the revised design
shall be resubmitted to the Design Review Board for its approval unless the
Planning and Environmental Commission waives this requirement.
(Ord. 8(1973) § 16.503; Ord. 16(1978) § 2(b); Ord. 29(2005) § 31)
§ 12-12-12 PERMIT ISSUANCE.
   (A)   Conformance to environmental impact report. Upon approval of the
project, applicable permits may be issued and the project may proceed, subject
to such additional requirements, permits, or authorizations as may be required
by this title and by other applicable ordinances or regulations of the town. No
permits shall be issued and no authorizations shall be granted which would
allow a project to proceed in the event that the Planning and Environmental
Commission does not grant approval of the environmental impact report after
review. No permits shall be issued and no authorizations shall be granted for
any project which does not conform substantially to the description of the
project contained in the environmental impact report.
   (B)   Exception. This section shall not apply to a project for which an
environmental impact report is not required, as prescribed in §
12-12-3 of this chapter.

§ 12-13-1 PURPOSE.
   The town’s economy is largely tourist based and the health of this economy
is premised on exemplary service for Vail’s guests. Vail’s ability to provide
such service is dependent upon a strong, high quality and consistently
available work force. To achieve such a work force, the community must work to
provide quality living and working conditions. Availability and affordability
of housing plays a critical role in creating quality living and working
conditions for the community’s work force. The town recognizes a permanent,
year round population plays an important role in sustaining a healthy, viable
community. Further, the town recognizes its role in conjunction with the
private sector in ensuring housing is available.
(Ord. 9(2007) § 1)
§ 12-13-2 APPLICABILITY.

to and occupied by tenants who are full-time employees who work in Eagle
County. An EHU shall not be leased for a period less than 30 consecutive days.
An EHU shall be continuously rented and shall not remain vacant for a period to
exceed three consecutive months.
      (3)   Thirty days prior to the transfer of a deed for an EHU, the
prospective purchaser shall submit an application to the Administrator
documenting that the prospective purchaser meets the criteria set forth herein
and shall include an affidavit affirming that he or she meets these criteria.
      (4)   No later than February 1 of each year, the owner of an EHU shall
submit a sworn affidavit on a form provided by the town to the Community
Development Department containing the following information:
         (a)   Evidence to establish that the EHU has been occupied throughout
the year by an employee;
         (b)   The rental rate;
         (c)   The employer; and
         (d)   Evidence to demonstrate that at least one tenant residing in the

provision is met.
      (5)   Any existing legal nonconforming dwelling unit in the town may be
converted to an EHU administratively by the town without obtaining a
conditional use permit. Dwelling units and lock off units which exist as of the
date hereof but which are nonconforming with respect to density and GRFA may be
converted to a conforming EHU administratively by the town, as long as they
otherwise comply with the development standards and parking requirements found
herein and comply with the town’s Building Code requirements. Upon being
converted to an EHU per this section, such dwelling unit shall be considered a
legally conforming EHU and shall be governed by all requirements of this
chapter.
   (D)   Enforcement. All EHUs governed by this chapter shall be operated and
maintained in accordance with this title. Failure to do so may result in
enforcement proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction and in accordance
with Chapter 3 of this title.

§ 12-13-5 EMPLOYEE HOUSING UNIT DEED RESTRICTION EXCHANGE PROGRAM.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide occupied livable,
affordable employee housing units within the Town of Vail through the
establishment of an employee housing unit deed restriction exchange program.
The exchange program allows the Town Council to release a deed restriction from
an existing employee housing unit in exchange for the placement of an employee
housing deed restriction on another dwelling unit and/or a fee in lieu payment
made to the Town of Vail.
   (B)   Applicability. The program established under this section applies to
existing employee housing units. This shall not apply to any existing employee
housing unit that is already price appreciation capped or any employee housing
unit established to meet the on site employee mitigation requirements of
Chapter 23, “Commercial Linkage”, or Chapter 24, “Inclusionary Zoning”, of this
title or as part of an approved development plan.
   (C)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section:
      COMMERCIAL JOB CORE. Those areas located south of Interstate 70, east of
the intersection of Forest Road and South Frontage Road, north of Vail
Mountain, and west of the Town of Vail soccer fields on Vail Valley Road, as
further defined by exhibit A of this section.

number of units, site coverage, landscaping and parking requirements and the
like), as outlined in the applicable zone district section of this title, upon
exchange of the deed restrictions.
      (2)   Proposed EHU requirements.

any other requirements deemed to be similarly restrictive by the Administrator.
         (c)   The proposed EHU shall comply with the minimum size requirements
shown in Table 13-2 of this section.
 
Table 13-2

attached.
      (3)   Exchange rate for proposed EHUs.
         (a)   If the exchange EHU(s) is within the commercial job core and the

an accessory use by the provisions of this title, shall be subject to issuance
of a home occupation permit by the Administrator. Application shall be made on
a form prescribed by the Administrator, and shall be accompanied by a statement
fully describing the nature of the home occupation, including hours of
operation, equipment or machinery to be used, anticipated number of customers,
clients or students, and other features of the home occupation. The application
shall describe in detail the manner in which the home occupation will conform
to the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Application contents. An application for a home occupation permit
shall be made upon a form provided by the Administrator. The application shall

plans, verification of liability insurance and title reports.
   (C)   Permit issuance and findings. After review of the application, the
Administrator may issue a home occupation permit if he or she finds that the
proposed use will conform to the requirements of this chapter. The permit may
be subject to such conditions as the Administrator deems necessary to guarantee
operation of the home occupation in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter and compatibly with other uses in the vicinity. The Administrator shall
deny the application if he or she finds that the proposed use will not conform
to the provisions of this chapter, or would be injurious or detrimental to
other properties in the vicinity.
   (D)   Permit time limit; renewal. Home occupation permits, when issued,
shall be for a limited time period not exceeding one year. Permits shall be
renewable upon application, subject to such regulations as shall be in effect
at the time of application for renewal. The Administrator shall make the same
findings with respect to an application for renewal as for the original
issuance of a home occupation permit.
   (E)   Requirements for permit. Where permitted, home occupations shall be
subject to the following limitations.
      (1)   The use shall be conducted entirely within a dwelling and carried
on principally by the inhabitants thereof. A home child daycare facility shall
be exempt from this requirement to allow outdoor play areas.
      (2)   Employees, other than inhabitants of the dwelling, shall not exceed
one person at any time.
      (3)   The use shall be clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the
dwelling for dwelling purposes and shall not change the residential character
of the property and neighborhood.
      (4)   The total floor area used for the home occupation shall not exceed
one-fourth of the gross residential floor area of the dwelling, nor exceed 500
square feet. Home child daycare facilities shall not exceed one-half of the
gross residential floor area of the dwelling, nor 1,250 square feet.
      (5)   There shall be no advertising, display or other indication of the
home occupation on the premises.
      (6)   Selling stocks, supplies or products on the premises shall not be
permitted, provided that incidental retail sales may be made in connection with
other permitted home occupations.
      (7)   There shall be no exterior storage on the premises of material used
in the home occupation.
      (8)   There shall be no noise, vibration, smoke, dust, odor, heat or
glare noticeable at or beyond the property line, as a result of the home
occupation. A home child daycare facility shall be exempt from this requirement
to allow outdoor play areas.
      (9)   A home occupation shall not generate significant vehicular traffic
in excess of that typically generated by residential dwellings and shall not
interfere with parking, access or other normal activities on adjacent
properties, or with other units in a multi-family residential development.
      (10)   No parking or storage of commercial vehicles in association with a
home occupation permit shall be permitted on the site.
   (F)   Interpretation.
      (1)   For purposes of this chapter, provided that all requirements

nursing home, tearoom, restaurant, antique shop, veterinarian’s office or any
similar use.
   (G)   Permit revocation or discontinuance.
      (1)   A home occupation permit may be revoked by the Administrator if he
or she determines that the provisions of this chapter or the limitations
prescribed as a condition of the permit are being violated.
      (2)   A home occupation permit shall become void if not used within two
months of issuance, or if the use for which it was issued is discontinued for a
continuous period of six months.

§ 12-15-3 DEFINITION, CALCULATION AND EXCLUSIONS.
   (A)   Within the Hillside Residential (HR), Single-Family Residential (SFR),
Two-Family Residential (R) and Two-Family Primary/Secondary Residential (PS)
Districts.
      (1)   Gross residential floor area defined. For residential uses, the
total square footage of all horizontal areas on all levels of a structure, as
measured to the outside face of the sheathing of the exterior walls (i.e., not
including exterior wall finishes). Floor area shall include, but not be limited
to, elevator shafts and stairwells at each level, lofts, fireplaces, bay
windows, mechanical spaces, vents and chases, storage areas and other similar
areas. Garages; attics; vaulted or open to below spaces; basements; crawl
spaces; and roofed or covered decks, porches, terraces or patios shall be
included as floor area; except the horizontal areas of a structure as set forth
herein shall then be deducted from the calculation of GRFA.
         (a)   GRFA shall be calculated by measuring the total square footage
of a building as set forth in the definition above.
         (b)   Excluded areas as set forth herein, shall then each be deducted
from the total square footage.
            1.   Enclosed garage area. Enclosed garage areas of up to 300
square feet per vehicle space not exceeding a maximum of two vehicle parking
spaces for each allowable dwelling unit permitted by this title.
               a.   Garage area deducted from floor area is awarded on a “per
space basis” and shall be contiguous to a vehicular parking space. Each
vehicular parking space shall be designed with direct and unobstructed
vehicular access.
               b.   Alcoves, storage areas and mechanical areas which are
located in a garage and which are 25% or more open to the garage area may be
included in the garage area deduction.
               c.   Interior walls separating the garage from other areas of a
structure may be included in the garage area deduction.
            2.   Attic areas with a ceiling height of five feet or less. Attic
areas with a ceiling height of five feet or less, as measured from the topside
of the structural members of the floor to the underside of the structural
members of the roof directly above.
            3.   Attic areas with trusses. Attic areas created by construction
of a roof with structural truss type members, provided the trusses are spaced
no greater than 30 inches apart.
            4.   Attic areas with nontruss system. Attic areas created by
construction of a roof structure utilizing a nontruss system, with spaces
greater than five feet in height, if all of the following criteria are met:
               a.   The area cannot be accessed directly from a habitable area
within the same building level;
               b.   The area shall have only the minimum access required by the
Building Code from the level below;
               c.   The attic space shall not have a structural floor capable
of supporting a “live load” greater than 40 pounds per square foot, and the
“floor” of the attic space shall not be improved with decking;
               d.   It must be demonstrated by the architect that a “truss
type” or similar structural system cannot be utilized as defined in the
definition of floor area; and
               e.   It will be necessary that a structural element (i.e.,
collar tie) be utilized when rafters are used for the roof system. In an
unusual situation, such as when a bearing ridge system is used, the staff will
review the space for compliance with this policy.
            5.   Crawl spaces.
               a.   Crawl spaces accessible through an opening not greater than
12 square feet in area, with five feet or less of ceiling height, as measured
from the surface of the earth to the underside of structural floor members of
the floor/ceiling assembly above.
               b.   Crawl spaces created by a “stepped foundation”, hazard
mitigation or other similar engineering requirement that has a total height in
excess of five feet may be excluded from GRFA calculations at the discretion of
the Administrator.
            6.   Basements. On the lowest level of a structure, the total
percentage of all exterior wall surfaces of the structure as a whole (interior
party walls are not considered exterior walls for the purposes of this section)
that are unexposed and below existing or finished grade, whichever is more
restrictive, shall be the percentage of the horizontal area of the lowest level
deducted from the GRFA calculations. The lowest level shall be the finished
floor level with the lowest USGS elevation, including all floor levels within
six vertical feet of the lowest level. A multi-unit building shall be
considered one structure. The percentage deduction calculations shall be
rounded to nearest whole percent. The lowest level exterior wall surface area
shall be measured from the finished floor elevation of that level to the
underside of the structural floor members of the floor/ceiling assembly above.
For the purposes of these calculations, retaining walls and site walls shall
not be considered part of the lowest level exterior walls. The deduction shall
be applied to all horizontal areas on the lowest level of a structure,
including garages and employee housing units also deducted from the calculation
of GRFA elsewhere in this title; but the deduction does not apply to any crawl
space or attic.
            7.   Vaulted spaces. Interior vaulted spaces and areas “open to
below” with a floor to ceiling height less than 16 feet, as measured from the
finished floor to the underside of the structural members of the floor/ceiling
assembly above.
            8.   Roofed or covered decks and the like. Roofed or covered decks,
porches, terraces, patios or similar features or spaces with no more than three
exterior walls and a minimum opening of not less than 25% of the linear
perimeter of the area of said deck, porch, terrace, patio or similar feature or
space, provided the opening is contiguous and fully open from floor to ceiling,
with an allowance for a railing of up to 44 inches in height and support posts
with a diameter of 18 inches or less which are spaced no closer than ten feet
apart. The space between the posts shall be measured from the outer surface of
the post.
            9.   Under ground vaults.
               a.   Underground vaults with a mechanical lift system for the
purpose of enclosed parking, if all the following criteria are met:
                  i.   The vault is only used for the storage of vehicles;
                  ii.   The vault floor to the finished floor elevation of the
garage does not exceed 16 feet in height;
                  iii.   The entire perimeter and volume of the vault shall be
below finished grade and be within the footprint of the garage;
                  iv.   The vault is only accessible from within the garage;
                  v.   Any openings to the vault shall be no larger than the
minimum required by the Building Code; and
                  vi.   The floor area of the vault shall not exceed 300 square
feet per vehicle space and not exceed a maximum of two vehicle spaces for each
allowable dwelling unit permitted by this title.
               b.   Underground vaults with a mechanical lift system for the
purpose of enclosed parking that meet the criteria above shall not be
considered as part of the lowest level for the purpose of the deduction for
basements in subsection (6) above.
      (2)   Additional calculation provisions.
         (a)   Common interior party walls. Where more than one dwelling unit
exists within a single structure, GRFA shall be measured for each dwelling unit
from the center of common interior party walls to the outside face of the
sheathing of the exterior walls.
         (b)   Greenhouse windows. Greenhouse windows (self-supporting windows)
shall not be counted as GRFA. GREENHOUSE WINDOWS are defined according to the
following criteria.
            1.   Distance above inside floor level. In order for a window to be
considered a greenhouse window, a minimum distance of 36 inches must be
provided between the bottom of the window and the floor surface, as measured on
the inside face of the building wall. (Floor surface shall not include steps
necessary to meet Building Code egress requirements.) The 36 inch minimum was
chosen because it locates the window too high to be comfortably used as a
window seat and because it allows for a typical four foot high greenhouse
window to be used in a room with an eight foot ceiling height.
            2.   Projection. No greenhouse window may protrude more than 18
inches from the exterior surface of the building. This distance allows for
adequate relief for appearance purposes, without substantially adding to the
mass and bulk of the building.
            3.   Construction characteristics. All greenhouse windows shall be
self-supporting and shall not require special framing or construction methods
for support, with the exception that brackets below the window may be allowed
provided they die into the wall of the building at a 45 degree angle. A small
roof over the window may also be allowed provided the overhang is limited to
four inches beyond the window plane.
            4.   Dimensional requirement. No greenhouse window shall have a
total window surface area greater than 44 square feet. This figure was derived
on the assumption that the maximum height of a window, in an average sized
room, is four feet and the maximum width for a four-foot high self-supporting
window is between six feet and eight feet (approximately 32 square feet). Since
the window would protrude no more than 18 inches, the addition of side windows
would bring the overall window area to approximately 44 square feet.
            5.   Quantity. Up to two greenhouse windows will be allowed per
dwelling unit, however, the 44 square foot size limitation will apply to the
combined area of the two windows.
            6.   Site coverage. Greenhouse windows do not count as site
coverage.
         (c)   Vaulted spaces. Any interior space with a floor to ceiling
height of 16 feet or greater, as measured from the finished floor to the
underside of the structural members of the floor/ceiling assembly above, shall
be calculated as GRFA on two levels of a structure.
   (B)   Within the Residential Cluster (RC), Low Density Multiple-Family
(LDMF), Medium Density Multiple-Family (MDMF), High Density Multiple-Family
(HDMF), Vail Village Townhouse (VVT), West Vail Multi-Family Overlay (WVMF)
Districts, Community Housing – 1 (CH-1), Community Housing – 2 (CH-2), and
Community Housing – 3 (CH-3).
      (1)   Gross residential floor area defined. For residential uses, the
total square footage of all horizontal areas on all levels of a structure, as
measured to the outside face of the sheathing of the exterior walls (i.e., not
including exterior wall finishes). Floor area shall include, but not be limited
to, elevator shafts and stairwells at each level, lofts, fireplaces, bay
windows, mechanical spaces, vents and chases, storage areas, and other similar
areas. Garages; attics; vaulted or open to below spaces; basements; crawl
spaces; and roofed or covered decks, porches, terraces or patios shall be
included as floor area; except the horizontal areas of a structure as set forth
herein shall then be deducted from the calculation of GRFA.
         (a)   GRFA shall be calculated by measuring the total square footage
of a building as set forth in the definition above. Excluded areas as set forth
herein, shall then each be deducted from the total square footage.
            1.   Common spaces. All or part of the following spaces, provided
such spaces are common spaces:
               a.   Common hallways, stairways, elevator shafts and airlocks;
               b.   Common lobby areas;
               c.   Common enclosed recreation facilities;
               d.   Common heating, cooling or ventilation systems, solar rock
storage areas, or other mechanical systems;
               e.   Common closet and storage areas, providing access to such
areas is from common hallways only;
               f.   Meeting and convention facilities;
               g.   Office space, provided such space is used exclusively for
the management and operation of on site facilities;
               h.   Floor area to be used in a Type III “employee housing unit
(EHU)” as defined and restricted by Chapter 13 of this title; and
               i.   Common enclosed garages to accommodate on site parking
requirements.
            2.   Enclosed garage areas. Enclosed garage areas, which are not
common spaces, of up to 300 square feet per vehicle space not exceeding a
maximum of two vehicle parking spaces for each allowable dwelling unit
permitted by this title.
               a.   This garage area deducted from floor area is awarded on a
“per space basis” and shall be contiguous to a vehicular parking space. Each
vehicular parking space shall be designed with direct and unobstructed
vehicular access.
               b.   Alcoves, storage areas and mechanical areas which are
located in a garage and which are 25% or more open to the garage area may be
included in the garage area deduction.
               c.   Interior walls separating the garage from other areas of a
structure may be included in the garage area deduction.
            3.   Attic areas with a ceiling height of five feet or less. Attic
areas with a ceiling height of five feet or less, as measured from the topside
of the structural members of the floor to the underside of the structural
members of the roof directly above.
            4.   Attic areas with trusses. Attic areas created by construction
of a roof with structural truss type members, provided the trusses are spaced
no greater than 30 inches apart.
            5.   Attic areas with nontruss system. Attic areas created by
construction of a roof structure utilizing a nontruss system, with spaces
greater than five feet in height, if all of the following criteria are met:
               a.   The area cannot be accessed directly from a habitable area
within the same building level;
               b.   The area shall have only the minimum access required by the
Building Code from the level below;
               c.   The attic space shall not have a structural floor capable
of supporting a “live load” greater than 40 pounds per square foot, and the
“floor” of the attic space shall not be improved with decking;
               d.   It must be demonstrated by the architect that a “truss
type” or similar structural system cannot be utilized as defined in the
definition of floor area; and
               e.   It will be necessary that a structural element (i.e.,
collar tie) be utilized when rafters are used for the roof system. In an
unusual situation, such as when a bearing ridge system is used, the staff will
review the space for compliance with this policy.
            6.   Crawl spaces.
               a.   Crawl spaces accessible through an opening not greater than
12 square feet in area, with five feet or less of ceiling height, as measured
from the surface of the earth to the underside of structural floor members of
the floor/ceiling assembly above.
               b.   Crawl spaces created by a “stepped foundation”, hazard
mitigation or other similar engineering requirement that has a total height in
excess of five feet may be excluded from GRFA calculations at the discretion of
the Administrator.
            7.   Basements. On the lowest level of a structure, the total
percentage of all exterior wall surfaces of the structure as a whole (interior
party walls are not considered exterior walls for the purposes of this section)
that are unexposed and below existing or finished grade, whichever is more
restrictive, shall be the percentage of the horizontal area of the lowest level
deducted from the GRFA calculations. The lowest level shall be the finished
floor level with the lowest USGS elevation, including all floor levels within
six vertical feet of the lowest level. A multi-unit building shall be
considered one structure. The percentage deduction calculations shall be
rounded to nearest whole percent. The lowest level exterior wall surface area
shall be measured from the finished floor elevation of that level to the
underside of the structural floor members of the floor/ceiling assembly above.
For the purposes of these calculations, retaining walls and site walls shall
not be considered part of the lowest level exterior walls. The deduction shall
be applied to all horizontal areas on the lowest level of a structure,
including garages and employee housing units also deducted from the calculation
of GRFA elsewhere in this title; but the deduction does not apply to any crawl
space or attic.
            8.   Vaulted spaces. Interior vaulted spaces and areas “open to
below” with a floor to ceiling height less than 16 feet, as measured from the
finished floor to the underside of the structural members of the floor/ceiling
assembly above.
            9.   Roofed or covered decks and the like. Roofed or covered decks,
porches, terraces, patios or similar features or spaces with no more than three
exterior walls and a minimum opening of not less than 25% of the linear
perimeter of the area of said deck, porch, terrace, patio or similar feature or
space, provided the opening is contiguous and fully open from floor to ceiling,
with an allowance for a railing of up to 44 inches in height and support posts
with a diameter of 18 inches or less which are spaced no closer than ten feet
apart. The space between the posts shall be measured from the outer surface of
the post.
            10.   Airlock. All or part of an airlock within an accommodation or
dwelling unit not exceeding a maximum of 25 square feet, providing such unit
has direct access to the outdoors.
      (2)   Additional calculation provisions.
         (a)   Common interior party walls. Where more than one dwelling unit
exists within a single structure, GRFA shall be measured for each dwelling unit
from the center of common interior party walls to the outside face of the
sheathing of the exterior walls.
         (b)   Greenhouse windows. Greenhouse windows (self-supporting windows)
shall not be counted as GRFA. GREENHOUSE WINDOWS are defined according to the
following criteria:
            1.   Distance above inside floor level. In order for a window to be
considered a greenhouse window, a minimum distance of 36 inches must be
provided between the bottom of the window and the floor surface, as measured on
the inside face of the building wall. (Floor surface shall not include steps
necessary to meet Building Code egress requirements.) The 36 inch minimum was
chosen because it locates the window too high to be comfortably used as a
window seat and because it allows for a typical four foot high greenhouse
window to be used in a room with an eight foot ceiling height;
            2.   Projection. No greenhouse window may protrude more than 18
inches from the exterior surface of the building. This distance allows for
adequate relief for appearance purposes, without substantially adding to the
mass and bulk of the building;
            3.   Construction characteristics. All greenhouse windows shall be
self-supporting and shall not require special framing or construction methods
for support, with the exception that brackets below the window may be allowed
provided they die into the wall of the building at a 45 degree angle. A small
roof over the window may also be allowed provided the overhang is limited to
four inches beyond the window plane;
            4.   Dimensional requirement. No greenhouse window shall have a
total window surface area greater than 44 square feet. This figure was derived
on the assumption that the maximum height of a window, in an average sized
room, is four feet and the maximum width for a four foot high self-supporting
window is between six feet and eight feet (approximately 32 square feet). Since
the window would protrude no more than 18 inches, the addition of side windows
would bring the overall window area to approximately 44 square feet; and
            5.   Quantity. Up to two greenhouse windows will be allowed per
dwelling unit, however, the 44 square foot size limitation will apply to the
combined area of the two windows.
            6.   Site coverage. Greenhouse windows do not count as site
coverage.
         (c)   Vaulted spaces. Any interior space with a floor to ceiling
height of 16 feet or greater, as measured from the finished floor to the
underside of the structural members of the floor/ceiling assembly above, shall
be calculated as GRFA on two levels of a structure.
   (C)   Within all other districts.
      (1)   Gross residential floor area defined. The total square footage of
all levels of a building, as measured at the inside face of the exterior walls
(i.e., not including furring, sheetrock, plaster and other similar wall
finishes). GRFA shall include, but not be limited to, elevator shafts and
stairwells at each level, lofts, fireplaces, bay windows, mechanical chases,
vents and storage areas. Attics, crawl spaces and roofed or covered decks,
porches, terraces or patios shall also be included in GRFA, unless they meet
the following provisions
         (a)   Within buildings containing two or fewer dwelling units, the
following areas shall be excluded from calculation as GRFA. GRFA shall be
calculated by measuring the total square footage of a building as set forth in
the definition above. Excluded areas as set forth herein, shall then be
deducted from total square footage:
            1.   Enclosed garages of up to 300 square feet per vehicle space
not exceeding a maximum of two spaces for each allowable dwelling unit
permitted by this title;
            2.   Attic space with a ceiling height of five feet or less, as
measured from the topside of the structural members of the floor to the
underside of the structural members of the roof directly above. Attic area
created by construction of a roof with truss type members will be excluded from
calculation as GRFA, provided the trusses are spaced no greater than 30 inches
apart;
            3.   Crawl spaces accessible through an opening not greater than 12
square feet in area, with five feet or less of ceiling height, as measured from
the surface of the earth to the underside of structural floor members of the
floor/ceiling assembly above; and
            4.   Roofed or covered deck, porches, terraces, patios or similar
features or spaces with no more than three exterior walls and a minimum opening
of not less than 25% of the linear perimeter of the area of said deck, porch,
terrace, patio, or similar feature or space, provided the opening is contiguous
and fully open from floor to ceiling with an allowance for a railing of up to
44 inches in height.
         (b)   Within buildings containing more than two allowable dwellings or
accommodation units, the following additional areas shall be excluded from
calculation as GRFA. GRFA shall be calculated by measuring the total square
footage of a building as set forth herein. Excluded areas as set forth shall
then be deducted from the total square footage:
            1.   Enclosed garages to accommodate on site parking requirements;
            2.   All or part of the following spaces, provided such spaces are
common spaces:
               a.   Common hallways, stairways, elevator shafts and airlocks;
               b.   Common lobby areas;
               c.   Common enclosed recreation facilities;
               d.   Common heating, cooling or ventilation systems, solar rock
storage areas, or other mechanical systems;
               e.   Common closet and storage areas, providing access to such
areas is from common hallways only;
               f.   Meeting and convention facilities;
               g.   Office space, provided such space is used exclusively for
the management and operation of on site facilities; and
               h.   Floor area to be used in a Type III “employee housing unit
(EHU)” as defined and restricted by Chapter 13 of this title.
            3.   All or part of an airlock within an accommodation or dwelling
unit not exceeding a maximum of 25 square feet, providing such unit has direct
access to the outdoors;
            4.   Overlapping stairways within an accommodation unit or dwelling
unit shall only be counted at the lowest level;
            5.   Attic space with a ceiling height of five feet or less, as
measured from the topside of the structural members of the floor to the
underside of the structural members of the roof directly above. Attic areas
created by construction of a roof with truss type members will be excluded from
calculation as GRFA, provided the trusses are spaced no greater than 30 inches
apart;
            6.   Crawl spaces accessible through an opening not greater than 12
square feet in area, with five feet or less of ceiling height, as measured from
the surface of the earth to the underside of structural floor members of the
floor/ceiling assembly above;
            7.   Roofed or covered decks, porches, terraces, patios or similar
features or spaces with no more than three exterior walls and a minimum opening
of not less than 25% of the linear perimeter of the area of said deck, porch,
terrace, patio or similar feature or space, provided the opening is contiguous
and fully open from floor to ceiling, with an allowance for a railing of up to
44 inches in height and support posts with a diameter of 18 inches or less
which are spaced no closer than ten feet apart. The space between the posts
shall be measured from the outer surface of the post.
      (2)   Additional calculation provisions.
         (a)   Walls. Interior walls are included in GRFA calculations. For
two-family and primary/secondary structures, common party walls shall be
considered exterior walls.
         (b)   Greenhouse windows. Greenhouse windows (self-supporting windows)
shall not be counted as GRFA. GREENHOUSE WINDOWS are defined according to the
following criteria:
            1.   Distance above inside floor level. In order for a window to be
considered a greenhouse window, a minimum distance of 36 inches must be
provided between the bottom of the window and the floor surface, as measured on
the inside face of the building wall. (Floor surface shall not include steps

         (c)   Vaulted spaces. Vaulted spaces and areas “open to below” are not
included in GRFA calculations.
         (d)   Garage credit.
            1.   Allowable garage area is awarded on a “per space basis”, with
a maximum of two spaces per allowable unit. Each garage space shall be designed
with direct and unobstructed vehicular access. All floor area included in the
garage credit shall be contiguous to a vehicular space.
            2.   Alcoves, storage areas and mechanical areas which are located
in the garage and which are 25% or more open to the garage area shall be
included as garage credit.
            3.   Garage space in excess of the allowable garage credit shall be
counted as GRFA.
      e.   Crawl and attic space.
            1.   Crawl spaces created by a “stepped foundation”, hazard
mitigation or other similar engineering requirement that has a total height in
excess of five feet may be excluded from GRFA calculations at the discretion of
the Administrator.
            2.   If a roof structure is designed utilizing a nontruss system,
and spaces greater than five feet in height result, these areas shall not be
counted as GRFA if all of the following criteria are met:
               a.   The area cannot be accessed directly from a habitable area
within the same building level;
               b.   The area shall have the minimum access required by the
building code from the level below six square foot opening maximum);

§ 12-15-4 INTERIOR CONVERSIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. This section provides for flexibility and latitude with the
use of interior spaces within existing dwelling units that meet or exceed the
allowable gross residential floor area (GRFA). This would be achieved by
allowing for the conversion of existing interior spaces such as vaulted spaces,
crawl spaces and other interior spaces into floor area, provided the bulk and
mass of the building is not increased. This provision is intended to
accommodate existing homes where residents desire to expand the amount of
usable space in the interior of a home. The town has also recognized that
property owners have constructed interior space without building permits. This
provision is also intended to reduce the occurrence of interior building
activity without building permits and thereby further protecting the health,
safety, and welfare of the community.
   (B)   Applicability. Within all zone districts except the Single-Family
Residential (SFR), Two-Family Residential (R), Two-Family Primary/Secondary
Residential (PS) and Vail Village Townhouse (VVT) Districts, dwelling units
that meet or exceed allowable GRFA will be eligible to make interior
conversions provided the following criteria are satisfied.
      (1)   Any existing dwelling unit shall be eligible to add GRFA, via the
“interior space conversion” provision in excess of existing or allowable GRFA
including such units located in a special development district; provided, that
such GRFA complies with the standards outlined herein.
      (2)   For the purpose of this section, EXISTING UNIT shall mean any
dwelling unit that has been constructed prior to August 5, 1997, and has
received a certificate of occupancy, or has been issued a building permit prior
to August 5, 1997, or has received final Design Review Board approval prior to
August 5, 1997.
   (C)   Standards.
      (1)   No application to add floor area pursuant to this section shall be
made until such time as all the allowable GRFA has been constructed on the
property, or an application is presently pending in conjunction with the
application to add floor area that utilizes all allowable GRFA for the
property.
      (2)   Applications to add floor area pursuant to this section shall be
constructed utilizing the floor area or volume of the building that is in
existence prior to August 5, 1997. New structures or exterior additions to
existing structures built after the effective date hereof will not be eligible
for interior conversions. Examples of how floor area can be increased under the
provision of this section include the conversion of existing basement or crawl
spaces to GRFA, the addition of lofts within the building volume of the
existing building, and the conversion of other existing interior spaces such as
storage areas to GRFA.
      (3)   Proposals for GRFA pursuant to this section may involve exterior
modifications to existing buildings, however, such modifications shall not
increase the building bulk and mass of the existing building. Examples of
exterior modifications which are considered to increase building bulk and mass
include, but are not limited to, the expansion of any existing exterior walls
of the building, regrading around a building in a manner which exposes more
than two vertical feet of existing exterior walls and the expansion of existing
roofs. Notwithstanding the two vertical foot limitation to regrading around a
building described above, additional regrading may be permitted in order to
allow for egress from new interior spaces. The extent of such regrading shall
be limited to providing adequate egress areas for windows or doors as per the
minimum necessary requirement for the adopted Building Code. Examples of
exterior modifications which are not considered to increase building bulk and
mass include, but are not limited to, the addition of windows, doors,
skylights, and window wells. Subject to design approval, dormers may be
considered an exterior modification in conjunction with interior conversions
permitted by this section. Prior to approval of proposed dormers or regrading
for windows or doors as described above, the staff or the Design Review Board
shall find that they do not add significantly to the bulk and mass of the
building and are compatible with the overall scale, proportion and design of
the building. For the purpose of this section, DORMERS are defined as a
vertical window projecting from a sloping roof of a building, having vertical
sides and a gable or shed roof, in which the total cumulative length of the
dormer(s) does not exceed 50% of the length of the sloping roof, per roof
plane, from which the dormer(s) projects.

      (4)   Proposals for the utilization of interior conversion GRFA pursuant
to this section shall comply with all town zoning standards and applicable
development standards.
      (5)   Floor area within a garage that was originally approved through the
garage space credit may not be converted to GRFA pursuant to this section.
   (D)   Process. Applications shall be made to the Department of Community
Development staff on forms provided by the Department. Applications for
interior conversions to single-family, two-family, primary/secondary or multi-
family dwelling units located in a special development district (SDD) pursuant
to this section shall also be allowed without amending the GRFA provisions of
the SDD. However, properties with GRFA restrictions recorded on the plat for
the development shall be regulated according to the plat restrictions unless
the plat is modified to remove such restrictions. If the property is owned in
common (condominium association) and/or located within a development lot, the
written approval of the other property owner, owners or applicable owners’
association shall be required. This can be either in the form of a letter of
approval or signature on the application. The planning staff will review the
application to ensure the proposed addition complies with all provisions of the
interior conversion section. Submittals shall include:
      (1)   Application fees pursuant to the current fee schedule;
      (2)   Information and plans as set forth and required by §
12-11-4(C) of this title or as determined by the Department of Community
Development staff. Applicants need to submit as built floor plans of the
structure so that staff can identify the existing building from any new
additions that have occurred after the approval of this chapter;
      (3)   Proposals deemed by the Department of Community Development staff
to be in compliance with this section and all applicable zoning and development
regulations shall be approved by the Department of Community Development or
shall be forwarded to the Design Review Board in accordance with Chapter 11 of
this title. Proposals deemed to not comply with this section or applicable
zoning and development regulations shall be denied.
      (4)   Upon receiving approvals pursuant to this section, applicants shall
proceed with securing a building permit prior to initiating construction of the
project.
      (5)   Any decisions of the Department of Community Development pursuant
to this section may be appealed by any applicant in accordance with the
provisions of §
12-3-3 of this title.
(Ord. 13(1997) § 3; Ord. 16(1998) § 1; Ord. 24(2000) § 2; Ord. 31(2001) § 11;

§ 12-15-5 ADDITIONAL GROSS RESIDENTIAL FLOOR AREA (250 ORDINANCE).
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide an inducement for
the upgrading of existing dwelling units which have been in existence within
the town for a period of at least five years by permitting the addition of up
to 250 square feet of gross residential floor area (GRFA) to such dwelling
units, provided the criteria set forth in this section are met. This section
does not assure each single-family or two-family dwelling unit located within
the town an additional 250 square feet, and proposals for any additions
hereunder shall be reviewed closely with respect to site planning, impact on
adjacent properties and applicable town development standards. The 250 square
feet of additional gross residential floor area may be granted to existing
single-family dwellings, existing two-family and existing multi-family dwelling
units only once, but may be requested and granted in more than one increment of
less than 250 square feet. Upgrading of an existing dwelling unit under this
section shall include additions thereto or renovations thereof, but a demo/
rebuild shall not be included as being eligible for additional gross
residential floor area.
   (B)   Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to dwelling
units in all zone districts except the Single-Family Residential (SFR), Two-
Family Residential (R), Two-Family Primary/Secondary Residential (PS), Vail
Village Townhouse (VVT), and West Vail Multi-Family Overlay (WVMF) Districts.
   (C)   Single-family dwellings and two-family dwellings in zone districts
other than the Single-Family Residential (SFR), Two-Family Residential (R),
Two-Family Primary/Secondary Residential (PS) And Vail Village Townhouse (VVT)
Districts. A single-family or two-family dwelling unit shall be eligible for
additional gross residential floor area (GRFA) not to exceed a maximum of 250
square feet of GRFA in addition to the existing or allowable GRFA for the site.
Before such additional GRFA can be granted, the single-family or two-family
dwelling unit shall meet the following criteria.
      (1)   Eligible time frame. A single-family or two-family dwelling unit
shall be eligible for additional GRFA, pursuant to this section, if it is in
existence prior to November 30, 1995, or a completed Design Review Board
application for the original construction of said unit has been accepted by the
Department of Community Development by November 30, 1995. In addition, at least
five years must have passed from the date the single-family dwelling or two-
family dwelling unit was issued a certificate of occupancy (whether temporary
or final) or, in the event a certificate of occupancy was not required for use
of the dwelling at the time of completion, from the date of original completion
and occupancy of the dwelling.
      (2)   Use of additional floor space. Proposals for the utilization of the
additional gross residential floor area (GRFA) under this provision shall
comply with all town zoning requirements and applicable development standards.

§ 12-16-1 PURPOSE; LIMITATIONS.
   In order to provide the flexibility necessary to achieve the objectives of
this title, specified uses are permitted in certain districts subject to the
granting of a conditional use permit. Because of their unusual or special
characteristics, conditional uses require review and evaluation so that they
may be located properly with respect to the purposes of this title and with
respect to their effects on surrounding properties. The review process
prescribed in this chapter is intended to assure compatibility and harmonious
development between conditional uses and surrounding properties and the town at
large. Uses listed as conditional uses in the various districts may be
permitted subject to such conditions and limitations as the town may prescribe
to ensure that the location and operation of the conditional uses will be in
accordance with development objectives of the town and will not be detrimental
to other uses or properties. Where conditions cannot be devised to achieve
these objectives, applications for conditional use permits shall be denied.
(Ord. 8(1973) § 18.100)
§ 12-16-2 APPLICATION; CONTENTS.

the approval has been granted is discontinued for a period of two years,
regardless of any intent to resume operation of the use.
(Ord. 12(2008) § 26)
§ 12-16-9 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   In addition to the conditions which may be prescribed pursuant to this
chapter, a conditional use shall also be subject to all other procedures,
permits and requirements of this chapter and other applicable ordinances and
regulations of the town. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of
a conditional use permit and any other permit or requirement, the more
restrictive provision shall prevail.
(Ord. 8(1973) § 18.900; Ord. 10(1998) § 10)
§ 12-16-10 AMENDMENT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The Administrator may approve amendments to an existing conditional
use permit (including, but not limited to, additions to buildings and
structures associated with the use, changes to the operation of the use,
changes to the previous conditions of approval and the like) if the
Administrator determines the amendment meets the following criteria:
      (1)   The amendment is in accordance with all applicable elements of this
code and the Vail Comprehensive Plan;
      (2)   The amendment does not alter the basic character or intent of the
original conditional use permit; and
      (3)   The amendment will not adversely affect the public health, safety
and welfare.
   (B)   All amendments to an existing conditional use permit not meeting the
above listed criteria, as determined by the Administrator, shall be reviewed by
the Planning and Environmental Commission in accordance with the procedures
described in §

12-17-5 Planning and Environmental Commission action
12-17-6 Criteria and findings
12-17-7 Permit approval and effect
12-17-8 Related permits and requirements
§ 12-17-1 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Reasons for seeking variance. In order to prevent or to lessen such
practical difficulties and unnecessary physical hardships inconsistent with the
objectives of this title as would result from strict or literal interpretation
and enforcement, variances from certain regulations may be granted. A practical
difficulty or unnecessary physical hardship may result from the size, shape or
dimensions of a site or the location of existing structures thereon; from
topographic or physical conditions on the site or in the immediate vicinity; or
from other physical limitations, street locations or conditions in the
immediate vicinity. Cost or inconvenience to the applicant of strict or literal
compliance with a regulation shall not be a reason for granting a variance.
   (B)   Development standards excepted. Variances may be granted only with
respect to the development standards prescribed for each zone district,
including lot area and site dimensions, setbacks, distances between buildings,
height, density control, building bulk control, site coverage, usable open
space, landscaping and site development, and parking and loading requirements;
or with respect to the provisions of Chapter 11 of this title, governing
physical development on a site.
   (C)   Use regulations not affected. The power to grant variances does not
extend to the use regulations prescribed for each zone district because the
flexibility necessary to avoid results inconsistent with the objectives of this
title is provided by Chapter 16, “Conditional Use Permits”, and by §
12-3-7, “Amendment”, of this title.
(Ord. 8(1973) § 19.100; Ord. 29(2005) § 39)
§ 12-17-2 APPLICATION INFORMATION REQUIRED.
   Application for a variance shall be made upon a form provided by the
Administrator. The application shall be supported by documents, maps, plans and
other material containing the following information:
   (A)   Name and address of the owner and/or applicant and a statement that
the applicant, if not the owner, has the permission of the owner to make
application and act as agent for the owner;
   (B)   Legal description, street address and other identifying data
concerning the site;
   (C)   A statement of the precise nature of the variance requested, the
regulation involved and the practical difficulty or unnecessary physical
hardship inconsistent with the objectives of this title that would result from
strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified regulation;
   (D)   A site plan showing all existing and proposed features on the site,
and on adjoining sites if necessary, pertinent to the variance requested,
including site boundaries, required setbacks, building locations and heights,
topography and physical features, and similar data;
   (E)   Such additional material as the Administrator may prescribe or the
applicant may submit pertinent to the application and to the findings
prerequisite to the issuance of a variance as prescribed in §
12-17-6 of this chapter;
   (F)   A list of the owner or owners of record of the properties adjacent to
the subject property which is subject of the hearing; provided, however,
notification of owners within a condominium project shall be satisfied by
notifying the managing agent, or the registered agent of the condominium
project, or any member of the board of directors of a condominium association.
The list of owners, managing agent, registered agent or members of the board of
directors, as appropriate, shall include the names of the individuals, their
mailing addresses and the general description of the property owned or managed
by each. Accompanying the list shall be stamped, addressed envelopes to each
individual or agent to be notified to be used for the mailing of the notice of
hearing. It will be the applicant’s responsibility to provide this information
and stamped, addressed envelopes. Notice to the adjacent property owners shall
be mailed first class, postage prepaid; and
   (G)   If the property is owned in common (condominium association) and/or
located within a development lot, the written approval of the other property
owner, owners, or applicable owners’ association shall be required. This can be
either in the form of a letter of approval or signature on the application.

cost of town staff time and other expenses incidental to the review of the
application. The fee shall be paid at the time of application, and shall not be
refundable.
(Ord. 8(1973) § 19.300; Ord. 29(2005) § 39)

§ 12-17-5 PLANNING AND ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION ACTION.
   Within 20 days of the closing of a public hearing on a variance application,
the Planning and Environmental Commission shall act on the application. The
Commission may approve the application as submitted or may approve the
application subject to such modifications or conditions as it deems necessary
to accomplish the purposes of this title, or the Commission may deny the
application. A variance may be revocable, may be granted for a limited time
period, or may be granted subject to such other conditions as the Commission
may prescribe.
(Ord. 8(1973) § 19.500; Ord. 29(2005) § 39)
§ 12-17-6 CRITERIA AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Factors enumerated. Before acting on a variance application, the
Planning and Environmental Commission shall consider the following factors with
respect to the requested variance:
      (1)   The relationship of the requested variance to other existing or
potential uses and structures in the vicinity;
      (2)   The degree to which relief from the strict or literal
interpretation and enforcement of a specified regulation is necessary to
achieve compatibility and uniformity of treatment among sites in the vicinity,
or to attain the objectives of this title without grant of special privilege;
      (3)   The effect of the requested variance on light and air, distribution
of population, transportation and traffic facilities, public facilities and
utilities, and public safety; and
      (4)   Such other factors and criteria as the Commission deems applicable
to the proposed variance.
   (B)   Necessary findings. The Planning and Environmental Commission shall
make the following findings before granting a variance:
      (1)   That the granting of the variance will not constitute a grant of
special privilege inconsistent with the limitations on other properties
classified in the same zone district;
      (2)   That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety or welfare, or materially injurious to properties or
improvements in the vicinity; and
      (3)   That the variance is warranted for one or more of the following
reasons:
         (a)   The strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the
specified regulation would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary
physical hardship inconsistent with the objectives of this title;
         (b)   There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or
conditions applicable to the site of the variance that do not apply generally
to other properties in the same zone district; and
         (c)   The strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the
specified regulation would deprive the applicant of privileges enjoyed by the
owners of other properties in the same zone district.
(Ord. 8(1973) § 19.600; Ord. 29(2005) § 39)
§ 12-17-7 PERMIT APPROVAL AND EFFECT.
   Approval of the variance shall lapse and become void if a building permit is
not obtained and construction not commenced and diligently pursued toward
completion within two years from when the approval becomes final.
(Ord. 16(1978) § 5(c); Ord. 48(1991) § 2)
§ 12-17-8 RELATED PERMITS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   In addition to the conditions which may be prescribed pursuant to this
chapter, any site or use subject to a variance permit shall also be subject to
all other procedures, permits and requirements of this and other applicable
chapters and regulations of the town. In event of any conflict between the
provisions of a variance permit and other permit or requirement, the more
restrictive provision shall prevail.

§ 12-18-1 PURPOSE.
   This chapter is intended to limit the number and extent of nonconforming
uses and structures by prohibiting or limiting their enlargement, their
reestablishment after abandonment and their restoration after substantial
destruction. While permitting nonconforming uses, structures and improvements
to continue, this chapter is intended to limit enlargement, alteration,
restoration or replacement which would increase the discrepancy between
existing conditions and the development standards prescribed by this title.
(Ord. 8(1973) § 20.100)
§ 12-18-2 CONTINUANCE.
   Nonconforming sites, uses, structures and site improvements lawfully
established prior to the effective date hereof may continue, subject to the
limitations prescribed in this chapter. Sites, uses, structures and site
improvements lawfully authorized by permits or regulations existing prior to
the effective date hereof may continue, subject to such limitations as
prescribed by such permits or regulations.
(Ord. 8(1973) § 20.200)
§ 12-18-3 SITES.
   Sites lawfully established pursuant to regulations in effect prior to the
effective date hereof which do not conform to the minimum lot area and
dimension requirements prescribed by this title for the zone district in which
they are situated may be continued and shall be deemed legally established
building sites, subject to the site development standards prescribed by this
title. No such site shall be further reduced in area or dimensions.
(Ord. 8(1973) § 20.300; Ord. 29(2005) § 40)
§ 12-18-4 USES.
   The use of a site or structure lawfully established prior to the effective
date hereof which does not conform to the use regulations prescribed by this
title for the zone district in which it is situated may be continued, provided
that no such nonconforming use shall be enlarged to occupy a greater site area
or building floor area than it occupied on the effective date hereof. Any
subsequent reduction in site area or floor area occupied by a nonconforming use
shall be deemed a new limitation, and the use shall not thereafter be enlarged
to occupy a greater site area or floor area than such new limitation.
(Ord. 8(1973) § 20.400; Ord. 5(2001) § 5; Ord. 29(2005) § 40)
§ 12-18-5 STRUCTURE AND SITE IMPROVEMENT.
   Structures and site improvements lawfully established prior to the effective
date hereof which do not conform to the development standards prescribed by
this title for the zone district in which they are situated may be continued.
Such structures or site improvements may be enlarged only in accordance with
the following limitations.
   (A)   Lot and structure requirements. Structures or site improvements which
do not conform to requirements for setbacks, distances between buildings,
height, building bulk control or site coverage, may be enlarged; provided, that
the enlargement does not further increase the discrepancy between the total
structure and applicable building bulk control or site coverage standards; and
provided that the addition fully conforms with setbacks, distances between
buildings and height standards applicable to the addition.
   (B)   Density control. Structures which do not conform to density controls
(includes GRFA and dwelling units/acre) may be modified, only if the total
gross residential floor area of the enlarged structure does not exceed the
total gross residential floor area of the preexisting nonconforming structure.
   (C)   Open space and landscaping. Structures or site improvements which do
not conform to requirements for usable open space or landscaping and site
development may be enlarged; provided, that the usable open space requirements
applicable to such addition shall be fully satisfied, and provided that the
percentage of the total site which is landscaped shall not be reduced below the
minimum requirement.
   (D)   Off-street parking and loading. Structures or site improvements which
do not conform to the off- street parking and loading requirements of this
title may be enlarged; provided, that the parking and loading requirements for
such addition shall be fully satisfied and that the discrepancy between the
existing off-street parking and loading facilities and the standards prescribed
by this title shall not be increased.
(Ord. 8(1973) § 20.500; Ord. 29(2005) § 40; Ord. 14(2006) § 4)
§ 12-18-6 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS.
   Nonconforming uses, structures and site improvements may be maintained and
repaired as necessary for convenient, safe or efficient operation or use;
provided, that no such maintenance or repair shall increase the discrepancy
between the use, structure or site improvement and the development standards
prescribed by this title.
(Ord. 8(1973) § 20.600)
§ 12-18-7 DISCONTINUANCE.
   Any nonconforming use which is discontinued for a period of 12 months,
regardless of any intent to resume operation of use, shall not be resumed
thereafter, and any future use of the site or structures thereon shall conform
to the provisions of this title.
(Ord. 8(1973) § 20.700; Ord. 29(2005) § 40)
§ 12-18-8 CHANGE OF USE.
   A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use unless
permission has been granted by the Town Council. Prior to granting such
permission, the Council shall determine that the proposed use does not
substantially differ from the existing nonconforming use in terms of
compatibility with the character of the area in which it is located, and the
Council shall determine that the proposed use does not increase or aggravate
the degree of nonconformity existing prior to any such change of use.
(Ord. 8(1973) § 20.800; Ord. 29(2005) § 40)
§ 12-18-9 RESTORATION.
   Whenever a nonconforming use which does not conform with the regulations for
the zone district in which it is located, or a nonconforming structure or site
improvement which does not conform with the requirements for setbacks, height,
density control, building bulk control or site coverage is destroyed by fire or
other calamity, by act of God or by the public enemy, its use may be resumed or
the structure may be restored, provided the restoration is commenced within one
year and diligently pursued to completion. All new construction must conform to
the applicable adopted building codes, fire codes and other relevant codes
regarding safety and construction which are in effect at the time rebuilding is
proposed.

otherwise delay the development or use of the property as set forth in the site
specific development plan, except:
      (1)   With the consent of the affected landowners;
      (2)   Upon the discovery of natural or human-made hazards on or in the
immediate vicinity of the subject property, which hazards could not reasonably
have been discovered at the time of site specific development plan approval,
and which hazards, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public
health, safety, and welfare; or

consultants fees incurred after approval by the Town Council, or applicable
town board or commission, together with interest thereon at the legal rate
until paid.
         (b)   Just compensation shall not include any diminution in the value
of the property which is caused by such action.
   (B)   The establishment of a vested property right pursuant to law shall not
preclude the application of ordinances or regulations which are general in
nature and are applicable to all properties subject to land use regulation by
the town, including, but not limited to, building codes, fire, plumbing,
electrical and mechanical codes, housing, and dangerous building codes, and

      (4)   Permit fees. The Town Council shall set a floodplain permit
schedule sufficient to cover the cost of town staff time, consultant fees and
incidental expense.
      (5)   Expiration of permit. A floodplain permit shall expire two years
after its date of issuance if the permittee has not started construction under
the permit.
   (G)   Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
      (1)   General standards. In all special flood hazard areas, the following
provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements:
         (a)   Habitable structures or improvements shall not be permitted to
be constructed within the 100-year floodplain. Improvements that may be
approved for construction within the 100-year floodplain include:
            1.   Temporary grading in the floodplain approved by the Floodplain
Administrator, in which the site is returned to its existing grade and
conditions;
            2.   Utility construction/ maintenance within the floodplain
approved by the Floodplain Administrator which is deemed to have an
insignificant impact to the floodplain;
            3.   Stream bank stabilization within the floodplain approved by
the Floodplain Administrator and is deemed to have an insignificant impact to
the floodplain; and
            4.   Public infrastructure construction/maintenance approved by the
Floodplain Administrator including, but not limited to, roads, bridges,
recreation paths, walks, stream drop structures, and stream erosion control
measures which are deemed to have an insignificant impact to the floodplain.
         (b)   Insignificant impact to the floodplain: an INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT
TO THE FLOODPLAIN shall be defined as an improvement in the floodplain that is
a public benefit that meets the criteria set out in subsection (G)(1)(a) of
this section and causes no negative impacts to adjacent properties and no
permanent localized cumulative increase in the adopted base flood elevations
(BFE) greater than 0.25 vertical feet. The applicant shall apply for a
conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA, if applicable;
         (c)   All new structures or improvements, unless otherwise
specifically provided for within this chapter, shall not influence the 100-year
floodplain and shall maintain a minimum clear distance from the 100-year
floodplain of one foot in both the horizontal and vertical directions;
         (d)   Floor plans and elevations illustrating that the lowest floor
elevations including basement, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, of the new or substantially improved structure, shall be elevated
to at least one foot above the base flood elevation;
         (e)   All approved new or modified improvements shall be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the improvement resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
         (f)   All new approved construction or modified improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
         (g)   All new approved construction or modified improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage;
         (h)   All existing nonconforming structures located within the 100-
year floodplain that may require maintenance shall not negatively impact the
adopted BFEs or adjacent properties in any way, unless as provided by
subsection (G)(1)(a) of this section; and shall increase conformity and flood
protection as required by the Floodplain Administrator (i.e., floodproofing,
flotation prevention, flood resistant materials and the like);
         (i)   All existing nonconforming structures that may require
maintenance to operational systems that are within the floodplain shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding;
         (j)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
         (k)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge
from the systems into floodwaters; and
         (l)   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      (2)   Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH Zones). Located
within the special flood hazard areas established in subsection (C) of this
section, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special
flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions
apply:
         (a)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities) elevated one foot above the highest adjacent
grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community’s
FIRM (at least three feet if no depth number is specified);
         (b)   All new construction and substantial improvements of
nonresidential structures have the lowest floor (including basement, together
with attendant utility and sanitary facilities) elevated one foot above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community’s FIRM (at least three feet if no depth number is specified),
or; together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that
one foot above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy;
         (c)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this
chapter are satisfied; and
         (d)   Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
      (3)   Floodways. Floodways located within special flood hazard areas
established in subsection (C) of this section, are areas designated as
floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion
potential, the following provisions shall apply.
         (a)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
         (b)   If this subsection (G) is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this subsection (G).
         (c)   Under the provisions of 44 C.F.R. Chapter 1, § 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments
within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base
flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional
FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA.
   (H)   Properties removed from floodplain by fill.
      (1)   Permit. A floodplain permit shall not be issued for the
construction of a new structure or addition to an existing structure on a
property removed from the floodplain by the issuance of a FEMA letter of map
revision based on fill (LOMR-F), unless such new structure or addition complies
with the following.
         (a)   Residential construction. The lowest floor (including basement),
electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and
other service facilities (including ductwork), must be elevated to one foot
above the base flood elevation that existed prior to the placement of fill.
         (b)   Nonresidential construction. The lowest floor (including
basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork), must be elevated
to one foot above the base flood elevation that existed prior to the placement
of fill, or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed
so that the structure or addition is watertight to at least one foot above the
base flood level that existed prior to the placement of fill with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
   (I)   Critical facilities.
      (1)   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent
possible, located outside the limits of the regulatory floodplain.
      (2)   Construction of new critical facilities in the regulatory
floodplain shall be permissible if no feasible alternative site is available,
provided:
         (a)   Critical facilities shall have the lowest floor elevated three
feet above the base flood elevation or to the height of the 500-year flood,
whichever is higher. If there is no available data on the 500-year flood, the
permit applicants shall develop the needed data in accordance with FEMA mapping
guidelines; and
         (b)   Access to and from the critical facility shall be protected to
the elevation of the 500-year flood.

   (B)   Investigation.
      (1)   In any area located within the boundaries of the Lincoln DeVore
map, or in any area identified as a debris flow or debris avalanche area by the
Mears map, or in any area identified as a rockfall area by the Schmueser map,
no initial application for a building permit, grading permit or major or minor
subdivision shall be approved until a site specific geologic investigation is
complete. For the purpose of this section, a site specific geologic
investigation shall be deemed a detailed geologic investigation which is
applicable to each respective site. All reports and studies required by this
section shall be prepared by a “professional geologist”, as defined by C.R.S. §
23-41-208, as amended, or a “registered professional engineer”, as defined by
C.R.S. § 12-120-202, as amended, under the direction of and at the expense of
the owner/applicant and submitted to the Department of Community Development.
      (2)   The extent of the site specific ecologic investigation required
shall be determined by the geologist or engineer who is responsible for the
investigation; however, the investigation shall be of sufficient thoroughness
and accuracy to allow such expert to certify to the following:
         (a)   For all structures other than single-family and two-family
dwellings, and “accessory uses” thereto as defined in §
12-6C-4 of this code:
            1.   Whether the geologic conditions are such that the site can or
cannot be developed for the specific structure or use proposed without
corrective engineering or engineered construction, or other mitigation or
alterations; or
            2.   Whether corrective engineering or engineered construction, or
other mitigation or alterations can or cannot be accomplished to reduce the
danger to the public health, safety or to property due to problems related to
geologic sensitivity to a reasonable level, and not increase the hazard to
other properties or structures, or to public buildings, rights-of-way, roads,
streets, easements, utilities or facilities or other properties of
construction.
         (b)   For single-family and two-family dwellings, and “accessory uses”
thereto as defined in §
12-6C-4 of this title, the site specific geologic investigation shall certify
to the following:
            1.   Whether the site can be developed for the specific structure
or use proposed without corrective engineering or engineered construction or
other mitigation or alterations; or
            2.   That the site is a geologically sensitive area but development
will not increase the hazard to other property or structures, or to public
buildings, rights-of-way, roads, streets, easements, utilities or facilities or
other properties of any kind.
   (C)   Development plan or building permit. Following the completion of the
site specific geological investigation and its review by the Department of
Community Development, a development plan may be approved or a building permit
may be issued as follows.
      (1)   For all structures other than single-family and two-family
dwellings, and “accessory uses” thereto as defined in §
12-6C-4 of this title.
         (a)   If the conclusion of the engineer or geologist performing the
investigation is that the site can be developed for the specific structure or
activity proposed without corrective engineering or engineered construction or
other mitigation or alterations, the subdivision plan or building permit or
grading permit may be approved without conditions relating to the mitigation of
the areas of geologic sensitivity.
         (b)   If the finding of the engineer or geologist performing the
geologic investigation is that the site is a geologically sensitive area, but
that corrective engineering or engineered construction or other mitigation or
alterations can be accomplished to reduce the danger to the public health and
safety or to property to a reasonable level, and such mitigation does not
increase the hazard to other property or structures, or to public buildings,
roads, streets, rights-of-way, easements, utilities or facilities, approval of
the development plan and/or the issuance of the building or grading permit
shall be conditional and contingent upon approval of plans for corrective
engineering and engineered construction or other litigation or alterations as
set forth in this title.
         (c)   If the conclusion of the geologist or engineer performing the
site specific geologic investigation is that the site cannot be developed for
the structure or use proposed because the danger posed by the geologically
sensitive area cannot be reduced or mitigated to a reasonable level, the
subdivision plan or building permit or grading permit shall be denied.
      (2)   For single-family and two-family dwellings, and “accessory uses”
thereto as defined in section
12-6C-4 of this title.
         (a)   If the conclusion of the engineer or the geologist performing
the investigation is that the site can be developed for the specific structure
or use proposed without corrective engineering or engineered construction or
other mitigation or alterations, or that the site is a geologically sensitive
area, but will not increase the hazard to other property or structures or to
public buildings, roads, streets, rights-of-way, easements, utilities or
facilities, a grading permit or building permit may be issued.
         (b)   If the finding of the engineer or geologist performing the site
specific geologic investigation is that the site is a geologically sensitive
area, but that corrective engineering or engineered construction or other
mitigation or alterations can be accomplished so that there is no increased
hazard to other property or structures, or to public buildings, roads, streets,
rights-of-way, easements, utilities or facilities, the issuance of a building
or grading permit shall be conditional and contingent upon approval of plans
for corrective engineering or engineered construction or other mitigation or
alterations as set forth in this section.
         (c)   If the conclusion of the geologist or engineer performing the
site specific geologic investigation is that the site cannot be developed for
the structure proposed because the danger posed by the geologically sensitive
area cannot be reduced or mitigated so that the hazard to other properties or
structures will not increase from the present level or the hazard to public
buildings, roads, streets, rights-of-way, easements, utilities and facilities
will not increase from the present level, then the building permit or grading
permit shall be denied.
   (D)   Construction requirements. The following requirements shall pertain to
the construction of any building or structure to be built in an identified or
designated area of geologic sensitivity and which requires corrective
engineering or engineered construction or other mitigation or alterations to
reduce the danger to public health and safety or to property due to such
problems as set forth in subsections (C)(1)(b) or (C)(2)(b) of this section:
       (1)   The certified site specific reports and plans required by this

§ 12-21-16 RESTRICTIONS IN WILDFIRE HAZARD AREAS.
   (A)   The entirety of the Town of Vail lies within a wildfire hazard area.
The natural vegetation surrounding and throughout the community is dependent on
wildfire for regeneration and ecosystem health. The ecosystem is dependent upon
infrequent, high severity stand replacing wildfire. Wildfires of this character
can carry over many thousands of acres and burn for several weeks. Besides
substantial flaming fronts, fires of this nature frequently send large
quantities of embers miles outside of the main fire perimeter igniting
additional spot fires. Due to the long and narrow layout of the town, no
location within the town limits is outside the potential ember fall area from a

§ 12-22-5 AMENDMENTS.
   An amendment of the regulations of this chapter, including a request to add
a new view corridor, delete an existing view corridor, or amend the boundary of
an existing view corridor, may be initiated by the Town Council on its own
motion, by the Planning and Environmental Commission on its own motion, or by
application of any resident or property owner in the town, or by the
Administrator or his or her designee.
   (A)   Application information for amendments. An application for the
amendment of the provisions of this chapter including the addition of a new
view corridor, the deletion of an existing view corridor or an amendment to the
boundary of an existing view corridor shall be filed with the Department of
Community Development on a form to be prescribed by the Administrator. The
application shall include the following information:
      (1)   A summary or description of the proposed amendment;
      (2)   A photograph of the proposed view to be protected if the
application is to add a new view corridor or amend the boundary of an existing
view corridor. The point used as the view point origination and the height of
the camera above existing grade or pavement at the time the photograph was
taken shall be identified. The
photograph or photographs shall be marked to show the proposed view corridor
boundary or shall be marked to show the proposed improvements in relation to
existing improvements and existing view corridor boundaries;
      (3)   The Department of Community Development may require models,
overlays, sketches or other submittal requirements to show:
         (a)   For a new view corridor, the potential impact the new view
corridor could have on the development potential of surrounding properties; or
         (b)   For a modification to a view corridor boundary, the potential
impact the change would have upon the protected view corridor.
      (4)   Names and addresses of the property owners whose development
potential, as set forth in this title on the date the application is received
by the Department of Community Development, may be increased or decreased by
the proposed view corridor or by the proposed modification to the existing view
corridor;
      (5)   If the application is to add a new view corridor or amend the
boundary of an existing view corridor, the applicant shall submit a legal
description of the new view corridor or the amended boundary prepared in the
same format as those set forth in §
12-22-4 of this chapter, and any other information deemed necessary by the
Department of Community Development 30 days prior to the final Planning and
Environmental Commission public hearing; and
      (6)   An application for an amendment may require review by consultants
other than town staff. Should a determination be made by the town staff that an
outside consultant is needed to review an amendment application, the Department
of Community Development shall obtain the approval of the Town Council for the
hiring of such a consultant. Upon approval of the Town Council to hire an
outside consultant, the Department of Community Development shall estimate the
amount of money necessary to pay the outside consultant, and this amount shall
be forwarded to the town by the applicant at the time the amendment application
is submitted to the Department of Community Development. Upon completion of the
review of the application by the consultant, any of the funds forwarded by the
applicant for payment of the consultant which have not been paid to the
consultant, shall be returned to the applicant. Expenses incurred by the town
in excess of the amount forwarded by the applicant shall be paid to the town by
the applicant within 30 days of notification by the town.
   (B)   Notice and hearing procedure.
      (1)   Upon the filing of an application for an amendment to this chapter,
or upon initiation of an amendment by the Town Council, Planning and
Environmental Commission or Department of Community Development Director, the
Department of Community Development Director or his or her designee shall set a
date for a public hearing before the Planning and Environmental Commission.
Subsequent to the hearing, the Planning and Environmental Commission shall make
a recommendation for approval or denial to the Town Council. After considering
the Planning and Environmental Commission’s recommendation, the Town Council
shall make a final determination on the amendment at a public hearing by
ordinance.
      (2)   Notice for the public hearing before the Planning and Environmental
Commission shall be given to the property owners designated in subsection (A)
(4) of this section, or §
12-22-6(B)(1)(b) of this chapter, in accordance with §
12-3-6(C) of this title and the hearing shall be conducted in conformity with §
12-3-6(D) of this title.
   (C)   Criteria for amendments. The Town Council shall only approve an
amendment to this chapter adding a new view corridor, deleting an existing view
corridor, or amending the boundary of an existing view corridor if the
amendment complies with the policies and goals of the applicable elements of
the Vail land use plan, town policies, and urban design guide plans and other
adopted master plans, and meets all of the following criteria.
      (1)   If the request is to add a new view corridor or to amend the
boundary of an existing view corridor in such a way which expands an existing
view corridor:
         (a)   That the proposed view corridor or the boundary amendment
protects and perpetuates a view or views from public pedestrian areas, public
ways or public spaces within the town which foster civic pride and are in the
public interest for the town;
         (b)   That the proposed view corridor or boundary amendment protects
and enhances the town’s attraction to residents, guests and property owners;
and
         (c)   That the proposed view corridor or boundary amendment protects a
view which is commonly recognized and has inherent qualities which make it more
valuable to the town than other more common views.
      (2)   If the amendment is to amend the boundary of an existing view
corridor in such a way which reduces the existing view corridor or is to repeal
an existing view corridor:
         (a)   That the boundary amendment or repeal will not reduce or
eliminate any view or views from public pedestrian areas, public ways, or
public spaces within the town which foster civic pride and are in the public
interest for the town;
         (b)   That the boundary amendment or repeal will not reduce the town’s
attraction to residents, guests and property owners nor be detrimental to the
enjoyment of public pedestrian areas, public ways, public spaces or public
views; and
         (c)   That the boundary amendment or repeal will not diminish the
integrity or quality, nor compromise the original purpose of the existing view
corridor.

         (d)   The Department of Community Development may require models,
overlays, sketches or other submittal requirements to show how the proposed
encroachment could impact the protected view corridor; and
         (e)   An application for an encroachment may require review by
consultants other than town staff. Should a determination be made by the town
staff that an outside consultant is needed to review an encroachment
application, the Department of Community Development shall obtain the approval
of the Town Council for the hiring of such a consultant. Upon approval of the
Town Council to hire an outside consultant, the Department of Community
Development shall estimate the amount of money necessary to pay the outside
consultant, and this amount shall be forwarded to the town by the applicant at
the time the encroachment is submitted to the Department of Community
Development. Upon completion of the review of the application by the
consultant, any of the funds forwarded by the applicant for payment of the
consultant which have not been paid to the consultant, shall be returned to the

the applicant shall be paid to the town by the applicant within 30 days of
notification by the town.
      (2)   Notice and hearing procedure. Notice and hearing on an application
for an encroachment into an existing view corridor shall be in accordance with
§
12-22-5(B) of this chapter.
      (3)   Criteria for encroachment. No encroachment into an existing view
corridor shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates by clear and
convincing evidence that the encroachment meets all of the following criteria:
         (a)   That the literal enforcement of this chapter would preclude a
reasonable development of a proposed structure on the applicant’s land;
         (b)   That the development of the structure proposed by the applicant
would not be such as to defeat the purposes of this chapter;
         (c)   That the development proposed by the applicant would not be
detrimental to the enjoyment of public pedestrian areas, public ways, public
spaces or public views;
         (d)   That the development proposed by the applicant complies with
applicable elements of the Vail land use plan, town policies, urban design
guide plans and other adapted master plans; and

(Ord. 18(1992) § 1; Ord. 29(2005) § 49; Ord. 10(2012) § 2)
§ 12-22-7 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Removal of encroachments encouraged; exceptions. Any structure which
presently encroaches into an existing view corridor which was lawfully
authorized by ordinances or regulations existing prior to the effective date
hereof may continue. However, such encroachments will be encouraged to be
removed as part of any remodeling or reconstruction of the structure. In the
case of certain focal points, such as the Clock Tower and Rucksack Tower, the
town recognizes their importance to the character of Vail Village and to the
quality of the urban design of Vail Village. Notwithstanding their
nonconforming status, the town does not encourage their removal.
   (B)   Allowed modifications to existing structures. Structures lawfully
established prior to the effective date hereof may be modified; provided, that
such modification does not cause the structure to encroach into a view corridor
to a greater extent in any dimension or configuration, specifically height,
width or mass, than the existing structure.
   (C)   Maintenance; repair. Nonconforming structures may be maintained and
repaired as necessary for the convenient, safe or efficient operation or use
provided that no such maintenance or repair shall cause the structure to
encroach into a view corridor to a greater extent in any dimension or
configuration, specifically height, width or mass, than the structure
encroached prior to such maintenance and repair.
   (D)   Restoration. Whenever a nonconforming structure which does not conform
to the provisions of this chapter is destroyed by fire or other calamity, by
act of God, or by the public enemy, its use may be resumed or the structure may
be restored, provided the restoration is commenced within one year and
diligently pursued to completion. The structure after such restoration shall
not encroach into a view corridor to a greater extent in any dimension or
configuration, specifically height, width or mass, than the encroachment which
existed prior to destruction.
(Ord. 18(1992) § 1; Ord. 29(2005) § 50)
§ 12-22-8 HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
   If the maximum height allowed in any zone district within the town differs
from the height permitted by a view corridor, the more restrictive height
limitation shall apply.
(Ord. 18(1992) § 1)
§ 12-22-9 FEES.
   The Town Council shall by motion establish a view application fee sufficient
to cover the cost of town staff time and other expenses incidental to the
review of the application. The fee shall be paid at the time of the
application, and shall not be refundable.

§ 12-23-1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that new commercial
development and redevelopment in the town provide for a reasonable amount of
employee housing to mitigate the impact on employee housing caused by such
commercial development and redevelopment.
   (B)   Except as provided in §
12-23-5 of this chapter, this chapter shall apply to all new commercial
development and redevelopment located within the following zone districts:
      (1)   High Density Multiple-Family (HDMF);
      (2)   Public Accommodation (PA);
      (3)   Public Accommodation 2 (PA-2);
      (4)   Commercial Core 1 (CC1);
      (5)   Commercial Core 2 (CC2);

      (13)   Ski Base/Recreation (SBR);
      (14)   Ski Base/Recreation 2 (SBR2);
      (15)   Parking District (P); and
      (16)   Special Development (SDD).
   (C)   The requirements of this chapter shall be in addition to all other
requirements of this code.
   (D)   When any provision of this chapter conflicts with any other provision
of this code, the provision of this chapter shall control.
(Ord. 1(2008) § 24)
§ 12-23-2 EMPLOYEE GENERATION AND MITIGATION RATES.
   (A)   The employee generation rates found in Table 23-1, “Employee
Generation Rates By Type Of Commercial Use”, of this section, shall be applied
to each type of use in a commercial development. For any use not listed, the
Administrator shall determine the applicable employee generation rate by
consulting the town’s current nexus study.
Table 23-1
Employee Generation Rates by Type of Commercial Use
Type of Use Employee Generation Rate
Table 23-1
Employee Generation Rates by Type of Commercial Use
Type of Use                             Employee Generation Rate
Accommodation unit/ limited service     0.6 employee per net new units
lodge unit
Business office and professional office 3.2 employees per 1,000 feet of new net
(including real estate and property     floor area
management office)
Conference facility                     0.8 employee per 1,000 feet of new net
                                        floor area
Eating and drinking establishment       10.2 employees per 1,000 feet of new
                                        net floor area
Health club                             0.96 employee per 1,000 feet of new net
                                        floor area
Retail store/personal service/repair    2.4 employees per 1,000 feet of new net
shop                                    floor area
Spa                                     2.1 employees per 1,000 feet of new net
                                        floor area
 
   (B)   If an applicant submits competent evidence that the employee
generation rates contained in Table 23-1 of this section or the nexus study do
not accurately reflect the number of employees generated by the proposed
commercial development or redevelopment and the Administrator finds that such
evidence warrants a deviation from those employee generation rates, the
Administrator shall allow for such a deviation as the Administrator deems
appropriate.
   (C)   (1)   Each commercial development or redevelopment shall mitigate its
impact on employee housing by providing EHUs for 20% of the employees
generated, pursuant to Table 23-1 of this section, or the nexus study, in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   For example, for a development proposing 2,500 square feet of new
net floor area for an eating and drinking establishment, the equation would be
as follows:
 
([2,500 square feet/1,000 square feet] x [10.2]) = 25.5 new employees generated
25.5 new employees generated x 20% = 5.1 employees to be housed
 
(Ord. 24(2018) § 1)
§ 12-23-3 SIZE AND BUILDING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Table 23-2, “Size Of Employee Housing Units”, of this section,
establishes the minimum size of EHUs and the number of employees that can be
housed in each. All EHUs shall meet or exceed the minimum size requirements.
Table 23-2
Size of Employee Housing Units
Type of Unit Minimum Size (GRFA) Number of Employees Housed
Table 23-2
Size of Employee Housing Units
Type of Unit       Minimum Size (GRFA) Number of Employees Housed
Dormitory          250                 1
Studio             438                 1.25
1 bedroom          613                 1.75
2 bedroom          788                 2.25
3 or more bedrooms 1,225               3.5
 
   (B)   Every EHU shall contain a kitchen facility or kitchenette and a
bathroom.
   (C)   All trash facilities shall be enclosed.
   (D)   (1)   Generally. Parking shall be provided in accordance with Chapter
10 of this title.
      (2)   Exception for on site units. At the discretion of the applicable
governing body, variations to the parking standards outlined in Chapter 10 of
this title may be approved during the review of an employee housing plan
subject to a parking management plan. The parking management plan may be
approved by the applicable governing body and may provide for a reduction in
the parking requirements for on site units based on a demonstrated need for
fewer parking spaces than Chapter 10 of this title would require. For example,
a demonstrated need for a reduction in the required parking could include:
         (a)   Proximity or availability of alternative modes of transportation
including, but not limited to, public transit or shuttle services;
         (b)   A limitation placed in the deed restrictions limiting the number
of cars for each unit; and
         (c)   A demonstrated permanent program including, but not limited to,
rideshare programs, car share programs, shuttle service or staggered work
shifts.
   (E)   Each EHU shall have its own entrance. There shall be no interior
access from any EHU to any dwelling unit to which it may be attached.
(Ord. 1(2008) § 24)
§ 12-23-4 REDEVELOPMENT.
   Employee housing impacts need only be mitigated for a redevelopment that
results in a greater number of employees generated from an increase in net
floor area, or an increase in the number of accommodation units or limited
service lodge units in the redevelopment; provided however, that if any
existing EHUs are to be removed, an equal amount of EHUs shall be replaced in
addition to the other requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 1(2008) § 24)
§ 12-23-5 EXEMPTIONS.
   The following shall be exempt from this chapter:
   (A)   The redevelopment of existing commercial development, if no new net
floor area, accommodation units or limited service lodge units are created; and
   (B)   The construction of EHUs.
(Ord. 1(2008) § 24)
§ 12-23-6 METHODS OF MITIGATION.
   (A)   For all new construction (i.e., development that does not affect any
existing buildings or structures) and demo/rebuild projects that result in a
mitigation requirement of 1.25 employees or greater, no less than one-half the
mitigation of employee housing required by this chapter shall be accomplished
with on site units.
      (1)   Exceptions. At the sole discretion of the applicable governing
body, an exception may be granted from this subsection (A) based upon one of
the following findings.
         (a)   Implementation of the on site unit mitigation method would be
contrary to the intent and purpose of the applicable zone district.
         (b)   Implementation of the on site unit mitigation method would be
contrary to the goals of the applicable elements of the Vail Comprehensive Plan
and the town’s development objectives.
         (c)   Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions apply
to the site that prevents the implementation of the on site unit mitigation
method.
         (d)   The method of mitigation proposed better achieves the intent and
purpose of this chapter and general and specific purposes of this title than
the on site mitigation unit method.
      (2)   On site EHUs. All on site EHUs shall be deed restricted as a “Type
IV-CL” (type four, commercial linkage mitigation) or “Type VII-CL” (type seven,
commercial linkage mitigation) EHU in accordance with Chapter 13, “Employee
Housing”, of this title.
      (3)   On site dormitory style units. At the sole discretion of the
applicable governing body, an applicant may provide on site dormitory style
units.
      (4)   Fees in lieu. An applicant may provide a payment of fees in lieu
only for any fractional remainder of the requirement generated under this
chapter totaling less than one employee.
      (5)   Remaining portion of requirement. Any remaining portion of the
mitigation requirement not provided with on site units shall be provided in
accordance with subsection (B) of this section.
   (B)   For all development projects except those mitigated by subsection (A)
of this section, the mitigation of employee housing required by this chapter
shall be accomplished through one, or any combination, of the methods further
described in this section. Unless otherwise regulated by this title, the choice
of method(s) used to mitigate the employee housing requirements of this chapter
shall be at the sole discretion of the applicant.
      (1)   On site units.
         (a)   All on site EHUs shall be deed restricted as a “Type IV-CL”
(type four, commercial linkage mitigation) or “Type VII-CL” (type seven,
commercial linkage mitigation) EHU in accordance with Chapter 13, “Employee
Housing”, of this title.
         (b)   At the sole discretion of the applicable governing body, an
applicant may provide on site dormitory style units.
      (2)   Conveyance of vacant property on site. An applicant may convey on
site real property to the town on which no covenants, restrictions or issues
exist that would limit the construction of EHUs, at the sole discretion of the
Town Council. This method does not mitigate the on site unit requirements of
subsection (A) of this section.
      (3)   Off site units.
         (a)   The requisite number of EHUs, or a portion thereof, may be
provided off site within the town, provided that such EHUs are deed restricted
in accordance with this chapter.
         (b)   At the sole discretion of the Planning and Environmental
Commission, an applicant may provide off site dormitory units, unless the
application is for a special development district, in which case, the Town
Council, in its sole discretion, may accept dormitory units as a method of
mitigation.
      (4)   Payment of fees in lieu.
         (a)   The fee in lieu for each employee to be housed shall be
established annually by resolution of the Town Council, provided that, in
calculating that fee, the Town Council shall include the net cost (total cost
less the amount covered by rental or sale income) of real property and all
related planning, design, site development, legal, construction and
construction management costs of the project, in current dollars, which would
be incurred by the town to provide housing for the employee to be housed in
that year.
         (b)   An administrative fee, established by resolution of the Town
Council, shall be added to the amount set forth in subsection (B)(4)(a) of this
section.
         (c)   Fees in lieu shall be due and payable prior to the issuance of a
building permit for the development.
         (d)   The town shall use monies collected from fees in lieu only to
provide incremental new employee housing units.
         (e)   An applicant may provide a payment of fees in lieu only for any
fractional remainder of the requirement generated under this chapter totaling
less than one employee.
      (5)   Conveyance of vacant property off site. The Town Council may, at
its sole discretion, accept the conveyance of vacant property off site in lieu
of requiring the provision of EHUs, provided that no covenants, restrictions or
issues exist on such property that would limit the construction of EHUs.
(Ord. 1(2008) § 24; Ord. 23(2016) § 2)
§ 12-23-7 MITIGATION BANK.
   (A)   The town will provide credit for any EHUs constructed on site,
constructed off site, or otherwise acquired in anticipation of future
commercial development or redevelopment, provided that those EHUs meet all
applicable requirements of this title. However, the construction or acquisition
of EHUs in anticipation of future development is at the sole risk of the
applicant, because the commercial development shall be subject to all
regulations pertaining to EHUs which are in effect at the time the application
for commercial development review is submitted to the town, even if those
regulations change after the EHUs are constructed.
   (B)   It shall be the applicant’s responsibility to provide documentation of
any existing EHU credit upon submission of an application for development
review. If the applicant cannot adequately document such credits, the town
shall not be obligated to provide such credit.
(Ord. 1(2008) § 24)
§ 12-23-8 ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Employee housing plan. Each application for development review, except
those exempt pursuant to §
12-23-5 of this chapter, shall include an employee housing plan which includes

      (1)   Calculation method. The calculation of employee generation,
including credits if applicable, and the mitigation method by which the
applicant proposes to meet the requirements of this chapter;
      (2)   Plans. A dimensioned site plan and architectural floor plan that
demonstrates compliance with §
12-23-3, “Size And Building Requirements”, of this chapter;
      (3)   Lot size. The average lot size of the proposed EHUs and the average
lot size of other dwelling units in the commercial development or
redevelopment, if any;
      (4)   Schedules. A time line for the provision of any off site EHUs;

shall include a brief statement explaining the basis for the request;
      (7)   Fees in lieu. A proposal to pay fees in lieu shall include a brief
statement explaining the basis of the proposal; and
      (8)   Written narrative. A written narrative explaining how the employee
housing plan meets the purposes of this chapter and complies with the town’s
comprehensive plan.
   (B)   Review.
      (1)   The Administrator shall approve, approve with modifications or deny
an employee housing plan involving a total mitigation requirement of less than
1.25 employees.
      (2)   The Planning and Environmental Commission shall approve, approve
with modifications or deny an employee housing plan unless the plan involves a
total mitigation requirement of less than 1.25 employees; the development is
located within a special development district; or the plan includes a request
to convey property.
      (3)   The Town Council shall approve, approve with modifications or deny
an employee housing plan for a development located within a special development

§ 12-24-2 EMPLOYEE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Every residential development and redevelopment shall be required to
mitigate its direct and secondary impacts on the town by providing employee
housing at a mitigation rate of 10% of the total new GRFA.
   (B)   For example, for a development proposing 5,500 square feet of new
GRFA, the calculation would be as follows:
 
5,500 square feet of new GRFA x 10% mitigation rate = 550 square feet of
employee housing to be provided
 
(Ord. 1(2008) § 25)
§ 12-24-3 BUILDING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Table 24-1, “Size Of Employee Housing Units”, of this section,
establishes the minimum size requirements for EHUs under this chapter. All EHUs
shall meet or exceed the minimum size requirements.

this title may be approved during the review of an employee housing plan
subject to a parking management plan. The parking management plan may be
approved by the applicable governing body and may provide for a reduction in
the parking requirements for on site units based on a demonstrated need for
fewer parking spaces than Chapter 10 of this title would require. For example,
a demonstrated need for a reduction in the required parking could include:
         (a)   Proximity or availability of alternative modes of transportation
including, but not limited to, public transit or shuttle services;
         (b)   A limitation placed in the deed restrictions limiting the number
of cars for each unit; and

redevelopment; provided however, that if any existing EHUs are to be removed,
an equal amount of EHUs shall be replaced in addition to other requirements of
this chapter.
(Ord. 1(2008) § 25)
§ 12-24-5 EXEMPTIONS.
   The following shall be exempt from this chapter:
   (A)   The remodeling of an existing dwelling unit;
   (B)   The replacement of a demolished residential development, provided the
replacement structure does not exceed the total GRFA of the original structure;
and
   (C)   The construction of EHUs.
(Ord. 1(2008) § 25)
§ 12-24-6 METHODS OF MITIGATION.
   (A)   For all new construction (i.e., development that does not affect any
existing buildings or structures) and demo/rebuild projects that result in a
mitigation requirement of 438 square feet or greater, no less than one-half the
mitigation of employee housing required by this chapter shall be accomplished
with on site units.
      (1)   Exceptions. At the sole discretion of the applicable governing
body, an exception may be granted from this subsection (A) based upon one of
the following findings.
         (a)   Implementation of the on site unit mitigation method would be
contrary to the intent and purpose of the applicable zone district.
         (b)   Implementation of the on site unit mitigation method would be
contrary to the goals of the applicable elements of the Vail Comprehensive Plan
and the town’s development objectives.
         (c)   Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions apply
to the site that prevents the implementation of the on site unit mitigation
method.
         (d)   The method of mitigation proposed better achieves the intent and
purpose of this chapter and general and specific purposes of this title than
the on site mitigation unit method.
      (2)   On site EHUs. All on site EHUs shall be deed restricted as a “Type
IV-IZ” (type four, inclusionary zoning mitigation) or “Type VII-IZ” (type
seven, inclusionary zoning mitigation) EHU in accordance with Chapter 13,
“Employee Housing”, of this title.
      (3)   On site dormitory style units. At the sole discretion of the
applicable governing body, an applicant may provide on site dormitory style
units.
      (4)   Fees in lieu. An applicant may provide a payment of fees in lieu
only for any fractional remainder of the requirement generated under this
chapter totaling less than 438 square feet of EHU floor area.
      (5)   Remaining portion of requirement. Any remaining portion of the
mitigation requirement not provided with on site units shall be provided in
accordance with subsection (B) of this section.
   (B)   For all development projects except those mitigated by subsection (A)
of this section, the mitigation of employee housing required by this chapter
shall be accomplished through one, or any combination, of the methods further
described in this section. Unless otherwise regulated by this title, the choice
of method(s) used to mitigate the employee housing requirements of this chapter
shall be at the sole discretion of the applicant.
      (1)   On site units.
         (a)   All on site EHUs shall be deed restricted as a “Type IV-IZ”
(type four, inclusionary zoning mitigation) or “Type VII-IZ” (type seven,
inclusionary zoning mitigation) EHU in accordance with Chapter 13, “Employee
Housing”, of this title.
         (b)   At the sole discretion of the applicable governing body, an
applicant may provide on site dormitory style units.
      (2)   Conveyance of vacant property on site. An applicant may convey on
site real property to the town on which no covenants, restrictions or issues
exist that would limit the construction of EHUs, at the sole discretion of the
Town Council. This method does not mitigate the on site unit requirements of
subsection (A) of this section.
      (3)   Off site units.
         (a)   The requisite number of EHUs, or a portion thereof, may be
provided off site within the town, provided that such EHUs are deed restricted
in accordance with this chapter.
         (b)   At the sole discretion of the Planning and Environmental
Commission, an applicant may provide off site dormitory units, unless the
application is for a special development district, in which case, the Town
Council, in its sole discretion, may accept dormitory units as a method of
mitigation.
      (4)   Payment of fees in lieu.
         (a)   The fee in lieu for each square foot shall be established
annually by resolution of the Town Council, provided that in calculating that
fee, the Town Council shall include the net cost (total cost less the amount
covered by rental or sale income) of real property and all related planning,
design, site development, legal, construction and construction management costs
of the project, in current dollars, which would be incurred by the town to
provide the square feet in that year.
         (b)   An administrative fee, established by resolution of the Town
Council, shall be added to the amount set forth in subsection (B)(4)(a) of this
section.
         (c)   Fees in lieu shall be due and payable prior to the issuance of a
building permit for the development.
         (d)   The town shall use monies collected from the fees in lieu only
to provide incremental new employee housing units.
         (e)   An applicant may provide a payment of fees in lieu only for any
fractional remainder of the requirement generated under this chapter totaling
less than 438 square feet of EHU floor area.
      (5)   Conveyance of vacant property off site. The Town Council may, at
its sole discretion, accept a conveyance of vacant property off site in lieu of
requiring construction of EHUs, provided that no covenants, restrictions or
issues exist on the property that would limit the construction of EHUs.
(Ord. 1(2008) § 25; Ord. 23(2016) § 3)
§ 12-24-7 MITIGATION BANK.
   (A)   The town will provide credit for any EHUs constructed on site,
constructed off site or otherwise acquired in anticipation of future
residential development or redevelopment, provided that those EHUs meet all
applicable requirements of this chapter. However, the construction or
acquisition of EHUs in anticipation of future development is at the risk of the
applicant, because the residential development shall be subject to all
regulations pertaining to EHUs which are in effect at the time the application
for development review is submitted to the town, even if those regulations
change after the EHUs are constructed.
   (B)   It shall be the applicant’s responsibility to provide documentation of
any existing EHU credits upon submission of an application for development
review. If the applicant cannot adequately document such credits, the town
shall not be obligated to provide such credits.
(Ord. 1(2008) § 25)

CHAPTER 26: TRANSPORTATION IMPACT FEES
Section
12-26-1 Findings and purpose
12-26-2 Applicability
12-26-3 Fee
12-26-4 Credit
12-26-5 Review
§ 12-26-1 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   Findings. The Town Council finds and determines as follows:
      (1)   A legitimate, identifiable public purpose is served by requiring a
transportation impact fee for new development and redevelopment projects in the
town;
      (2)   There is an essential nexus between the transportation impact fee
imposed in this chapter and the town’s interest in providing transportation
infrastructure, facilities and services;
      (3)   The town is acting within its power to provide transportation
infrastructure, facilities and services;
      (4)   But for new development and redevelopment projects, the town would
not be considering either the provision or expansion of transportation
infrastructure, services or facilities;
      (5)   New development and redevelopment projects are contributing causes
to the need for new or expanded transportation infrastructure, facilities and
services;
      (6)   The town would be legally justified in denying applications for new
development or redevelopment projects unless the transportation impact fee is
imposed, because of the burden the new development or redevelopment projects
would place on the town’s transportation infrastructure, facilities and
services; and
      (7)   The town has conducted a study to determine the amount of the
transportation impact fee, and the study demonstrates that the transportation
impact fee will be roughly proportional, both in nature and extent, to the
impacts of new development and redevelopment projects.
   (B)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to impose a transportation
impact fee on new development and redevelopment projects in the town, as set
forth herein.
(Ord. 4(2017) § 1)
§ 12-26-2 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   The transportation impact fee shall be imposed on the following
construction, development or redevelopment in the town:
      (1)   For commercial development (except accommodation units), on any net
new square footage to be constructed;
      (2)   For residential development, on each new residential unit to be
constructed; and
      (3)   For accommodation units, on each new accommodation unit to be
constructed.
   (B)   The transportation impact fee shall not be imposed on the
construction, development or redevelopment of any employee housing unit.
(Ord. 4(2017) § 1)
§ 12-26-3 FEE.
   The transportation impact fee shall be in the amount set by resolution of
the Town Council. The fee shall be imposed by the Community Development
Department, Design Review Board, Planning and Environmental Commission or Town
Council, as part of the last land use approval for the project. The fee shall
be payable prior to issuance of the building permit for the project.
(Ord. 4(2017) § 1)
§ 12-26-4 CREDIT.
   (A)   An applicant may apply for a credit as set forth in this section,
which credit shall be applied to offset the transportation impact fee that
would otherwise be imposed for the project.
   (B)   Credit shall be provided for any dedication or conveyance of land from
the applicant to the town. The amount of the credit shall be the present, fair
market value of the land being dedicated or conveyed, as determined by the town
in its reasonable discretion.
   (C)   Credit shall be provided for any construction of town-approved system
level transportation infrastructure or facilities as identified in the Vail
Transportation Impact Fee Study, undertaken by the applicant at the applicant’s
cost that offset the transportation impacts of the project. The transportation
infrastructure or facilities may be constructed as part of the project, or in
other areas of the town, as determined by the town and the applicant. The value
of the credit shall be determined by the town, in its reasonable discretion,
considering the total cost of construction and other relevant factors.
   (D)   Credit shall be provided for any transportation services provided by
the applicant at the applicant’s cost, that offset the transportation impacts
of the project, as approved by the town. The value of the credit shall be
determined by the town, in its reasonable discretion, considering actual costs
to provide the services and other relevant factors.
(Ord. 4(2017) § 1)
§ 12-26-5 REVIEW.
   (A)   An applicant aggrieved by the application of this chapter by the
Community Development Department, the Planning and Environmental Commission or
Design Review Board may apply for review by the Town Council, by filing a
written request for review within ten days of the decision at issue.
   (B)   Within 30 days of receipt of the written request, the Town Council
shall hold a public hearing. At such hearing, the burden of proof shall be on
the applicant to establish that the imposition of the transportation impact fee
as assessed would result in an unconstitutional taking of private property
without just compensation.
   (C)   If the Town Council determines that the application of this chapter
would result in an unconstitutional taking of private property without just
compensation, the Town Council may decrease the transportation impact fee (or
increase any credit) to ensure that there is no unconstitutional taking. The
decision of the Town Council shall be final, subject only to judicial review
pursuant to C.R.C.P. § 106(a)(4).
   (D)   An applicant aggrieved by the application of this chapter by the Town
Council may seek judicial review pursuant to C.R.C.P. § 106(a)(4).

§ 13-5-1 PURPOSE.
   It is hereby declared to be the policy of the town that whenever there is a
major subdivision, which is subdivided for residential use or partial
residential use, the owner of the land shall provide land for school needs
generated by the proposed residential use. It is the purpose of this chapter to
require the dedication of land or the payment of fees in lieu thereof, or both,
to fulfill such needs.
(Ord. 1(1991) § 1)
§ 13-5-2 SCHOOL LAND DEDICATION OR CASH IN LIEU THEREOF.
   (A)   Dedication formula. The subdivider of land in each residential major
subdivision or portion of the subdivision which is intended for residential
use, shall allocate and convey sites in land areas for schools when such are
reasonably necessary to serve the proposed subdivision and future residents
thereof, by the application of the formulas set forth below:
      (1)   Single-family and duplex or primary secondary.
 
number of units x .014495 = dedication requirement in acres
 
      (2)   Multi-family.
 
number of units x .002676 = dedication requirement in acres
 
   (B)   Land held by town. When land is dedicated for the purpose of providing
a school site, it shall be that which is usable by the Eagle County School
District for such purpose, and shall be maintained by the School District in a
reasonable manner until developed. Said land shall be held by the town for the
School District until required by the School District. In the event that the
School District determines subsequent to dedication that the dedicated school
site is not reasonably necessary, the Town Council may, at the request of the
School District, sell the land.
   (C)   Cash in lieu of. When sites and land areas for schools are not
reasonably necessary to serve the proposed subdivision and future residents
thereof, the Town Council, with recommendations from the School District and
other affected entities, shall require, in lieu of such conveyance of land, the
payment in cash by the subdivider of an amount not to exceed the full market
value of such sites and land areas for schools.
   (D)   Full market value. The full market value shall mean the current market
value of unimproved land. This value shall be set annually by the Town Council
on an acre basis with recommendations from the School District. The same value
per acre shall be used throughout the town.
   (E)   Consensus on land value. If the subdivider does not agree with the
value per acre, the subdivider may submit the report by a qualified appraiser
who is M.A.I. designated, which establishes a new value. The Town Council shall
review the report and determine if the value is reasonable. Based upon their
review, the Town Council will determine the value of such land.
   (F)   In-lieu monies held by town. When money in lieu of land is required or
when monies have been paid to the Town Council from the sale of such dedicated
sites for schools, it shall be held by the Town Council for the acquisition of
reasonably necessary sites for the construction of school facilities, for the
construction of employee housing required by the School District, for the
purchase of employee housing units for the School District, or for the
development of such sites. If housing units are purchased, a deed restriction
restricting their use to School District employee housing shall be required and
ownership shall remain in the name of the School District. A subdivision school
dedication shall apply only once to the same land area. Dedication shall not be
required of resubdivisions of the same land on a dedication that has previously
been made.

Government Land Use Control Enabling Act of 1974, as found in C.R.S. §§ 29-20-
101 et seq., as more particularly spelled out in C.R.S. § 29-20-104, to

condominiums and converted condominiums, and to promote the public health,
safety and welfare;

reasonable physical standards as required by subdivision and building codes
adopted by the town;
   (C)   To protect from unnecessary eviction the residents of rental units
being converted to condominiums, and to assist these residents in meeting their
future housing needs;
   (D)   To preserve a reasonable balance in the owned versus rental housing
mix and to maintain the supply of low to moderate income units available in the
town;
   (E)   To monitor the supply of low to moderate income units so that the town
may take measures to avoid a worsening housing crisis; and
   (F)   To ensure the rental pool of accommodation units is not depleted by
the conversion of lodges and accommodation units to condominiums.

documents to ensure compliance with these provisions.
      (2)   Listing; deposit; sale. In the event that an owner desires to sell
the unit, the owner shall execute a standard listing contract on forms approved
by the Colorado Real Estate Commission with the town providing for a 180-day
listing period, or such other time period as required by the Town of Vail
affordable housing guidelines in effect at the time of listing. At this time,
the owner shall deposit with the town an amount equal to 0.5% of the estimated
value of the unit. The town shall promptly advertise the unit for sale by
competitive bid to qualified buyers. At the time of closing, the owner shall
pay to the town an additional 1.5%.
      (3)   Restriction.
         (a)   In no event shall a unit be sold for an amount (“maximum sales
price”) in excess of the owner’s purchase price, plus an increase of 3% of such
price per year from the date of purchase to the date of owner’s notice of
intent to sell (prorated at the rate of 0.25% for each whole month for any part
of a year).
         (b)   Nothing herein shall be construed to constitute a representation
or guarantee by the town that on sale the owner shall obtain the maximum sales
price.
      (4)   Determining maximum sales price.
         (a)   For the purpose of determining the maximum sales price in
accordance with this section, the owner may add to the amount specified in
subsection (D)(3) of this section, the cost of “permitted capital improvements”
(as defined in this section). The amount shall not exceed 10% of the initial
listed purchase price set forth in subsection (D)(3) of this section. For every
ten-year period from the date of original purchase and deed restriction, up to
another 10% of the purchase price may be added to the value of the property for
capital improvements. In calculating such amount, only permitted capital
improvements shall qualify for inclusion. All such permitted capital
improvements installed or constructed over the life of the unit shall qualify.
         (b)   Permitted capital improvements shall not include any changes or
additions to the property made by the owner during construction or thereafter,
except in accordance with subsection (D)(4)(a) of this section. Permitted
capital improvements shall not increase the base price, even if made or
installed during original construction.
         (c)   In order to qualify as permitted capital improvements, the owner
must furnish to the town the following information with respect to the
improvements which the owner seeks to include in the calculation of maximum
sales price:
            1.   Original or duplicate receipts to verify the actual costs
expended by the owner for the permitted capital improvements;
            2.   Owner’s affidavit verifying that the receipts are valid and
correct receipts tendered at the time of purchase; and
            3.   True and correct copies of any building permit or certificate
of occupancy required to be issued by the Town Building Department with respect
to the permitted capital improvements.
         (d)   For the purpose of determining the maximum sales price in
accordance with this section, the owner may also add to the amount specified in
subsections (D)(3) and (D)(4)(a) of this section, the cost of any permanent
improvements constructed or installed as a result of any requirement imposed by
any governmental agency, or homeowners’ association, provided that written
certification is provided to the town of both the applicable requirement and
the information required by subsections (D)(4)(c)1. through (D)(4)(c)3. of this
section.
         (e)   In calculating the costs under subsections (D)(4)(a) and (D)(4)
(d) of this section, only the owner’s actual out of pocket costs and expenses
shall be eligible for inclusion. Such amount shall not include an amount
attributable to owner’s “sweat equity” or to any appreciation in the value of
the improvements.
      (5)   Permitted capital improvements.
         (a)   The term “permitted capital improvements” as used in this
section shall only include the following:
            1.   Improvements or fixtures erected, installed or attached as
permanent, functional, nondecorative improvements to real property, excluding
repair, replacement and/or maintenance improvements;
            2.   Improvements for energy and water conservation;
            3.   Improvements for health and safety protection devices;
            4.   Improvements to add and/or finish permanent/fixed storage
space; and/or
            5.   Improvements to finish unfinished space.
         (b)   Permitted capital improvements as used in this section shall not
include the following:
            1.   Upgrades/replacements of appliances, plumbing and mechanical
fixtures, carpets and other similar items included as part of the original
construction of the unit;
            2.   The cost of adding decks and balconies, and any extension
thereto;
            3.   Jacuzzis, saunas, steam showers and other similar items;
            4.   Improvements required to repair, replace and maintain existing
fixtures, appliances, plumbing and mechanical fixtures, painting, carpeting and
other similar items; and/or
            5.   Upgrades or addition of decorative items, including lights,
window coverings and other similar items.
         (c)   All permitted capital improvement items and costs shall be
approved by the town staff prior to being added to the maximum resale price as
defined herein.
      (6)   Closing costs, other consideration. The owner shall not permit any
prospective buyer to assume any or all of the owner’s customary closing costs
nor accept any other consideration which would cause an increase in the
purchase price above the bid price so as to induce the owner to sell to such
prospective buyer.
      (7)   Procedure. In the event that one qualified bid is received equal to
the maximum sales price herein established, the property shall be sold to such
bidder at the maximum sales price; and in the event owner receives two or more
such bids equal to the maximum sales price, the qualified buyer shall be
selected according to the priority for sale units set forth in the Town of Vail
employee housing guidelines; and, in the event that all such qualified bidders
are of equal priority pursuant to the guidelines, the qualified buyer shall be
selected by lottery among the qualified buyers, whereupon the unit shall be
sold to the winner of such lottery at the maximum sales price. If the lottery
winner does not proceed to contract within five business days after
notification, the next in line will be notified and so on, until the unit is
under contract for purchase. Backup contracts in the priority order set forth
in the lottery will be accepted. Prospective purchasers must be prequalified by
a lender prior to submitting a bid for a unit at the subject property/project.
The seller may reject any and all bids, however, the owner is subject to the
provisions in the Town of Vail employee housing guidelines pertaining to the
listing fee. Bids in excess of the maximum sales price shall be rejected. If
all bids are below maximum sales price, owner may accept the highest qualified
bid. If all bids are below maximum sales price and two or more bids are for the
same price, the qualified buyer shall be selected by lottery from among the
highest qualified bidders.
      (8)   Nonqualified transferee. In the event that title to the unit vests
by descent in individuals and/or entities who are not qualified buyers as that
term is defined herein (hereinafter “nonqualified transferee(s)”), the unit
shall immediately be listed for sale as provided in subsection (D)(2) of this
section (including the payment of the specified fee to the town), and the
highest bid by a qualified buyer, for not less than 95% of the maximum sales
price or the appraised market value, whichever is less, shall be accepted; if
all bids are below 95% of the maximum sales price or the appraised market
value, the unit shall continue to be listed for sale until a bid in accordance
with this section is made, which bid must be accepted. The cost of the
appraisal shall be paid by the nonqualified transferee(s).
         (a)   Nonqualified transferee(s) shall join in any sale, conveyance or
transfer of the unit to a qualified buyer and shall execute any and all
documents necessary to do so; and
         (b)   Nonqualified transferee(s) agree not to:
            1.   Occupy the said unit;
            2.   Rent all or any part of the unit;
            3.   Engage in any other business activity on or in the unit;
            4.   Sell or otherwise transfer the unit except in accordance with
this section and the affordable housing guidelines; or
            5.   Sell or otherwise transfer the unit for use in a trade or
business.
         (c)   The town, or its respective successors, as applicable, shall
have the right and option to purchase the unit, exercisable within a period of
15 calendar days after receipt of any sales offer submitted to the town by a
nonqualified transferee(s), and in the event of exercising their right and
option, shall purchase the unit from the nonqualified transferee(s) for a price
of 95% of the maximum sales price, or the appraised market value, whichever is
less. The offer to purchase shall be made by the nonqualified transferee(s)
within 15 days of acquisition of the unit.
   (E)   Enforcement.
      (1)   In the event that the town has reasonable cause to believe the
owner is violating the provisions of this section, the town, by its authorized
representative, may inspect the unit between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00
p.m., Monday through Friday, after providing the owner with no less than 24
hours’ written notice.
      (2)   (a)   The town, in the event a violation of this chapter is
discovered, shall send a notice of violation to the owner detailing the nature
of the violation and allowing the owner 15 days to cure. Said notice shall
state that the owner may request a hearing before the Vail Town Council within
15 days to determine the merits of the allegations. If no hearing is requested
and the violation is not cured within the 15-day period, the owner shall be
considered in violation of this section. If a hearing is held before the Vail
Town Council, the decision of the town based on the record of such hearing
shall be final for the purpose of determining if a violation has occurred.
         (b)   If the town determines that there has been a violation of the
occupancy standards, the owner of the restricted employee housing unit shall be
found to be in noncompliance. Penalties the town may assess against the owner
include eliminating resale gain (see subsection (D)(3) of this section), and/or
penalties found in §
1-4-1 of this code.
      (3)   There is hereby reserved to the parties hereto any and all remedies
provided by law for breach of this section or any of its terms. In the event
the parties resort to litigation with respect to any or all provisions of this
section, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover damages and costs,
including reasonable attorney fees.
      (4)   In the event the unit is sold and/or conveyed without compliance
herewith, such sale and/or conveyance shall be wholly null and void and shall
confer no title whatsoever upon the purported buyer. Each and every conveyance
of the unit, for all purposes, shall be deemed to include and incorporate by
this reference, the covenants herein contained, even without reference therein
to this section.
      (5)   (a)   In the event that the owner fails to cure any breach, the
town may resort to any and all available legal action, including, but not
limited to, specific performance of the requirements of this section or a
mandatory injunction requiring sale of the unit by owner.
         (b)   The costs of such sale shall be taxed against the proceeds of
the sale with the balance being paid to the owner.
      (6)   In the event of a breach of any of the terms or conditions
contained herein by the owner, his or her heirs, successors or assigns, the
town’s initial listed purchase price of the unit as set forth in this section
shall, upon the date of such breach as determined by the town, automatically
cease to increase as set forth in this section, and shall remain fixed until
the date of cure of said breach.

§ 13-7-7 CONDOMINIUM CONVERSION OF LODGE OR ACCOMMODATION UNITS; NO NEW
CONVERSIONS ALLOWED; EXCEPTION.
   There shall not be permitted any conversion of a lodge or accommodation unit
within the town to a condominium, except as provided for the provision of
employee housing units. Employee housing units created pursuant to this chapter

Ord. 5(2000) § 1; Ord. 29(2005) § 62)
§ 13-7-8 RESTRICTIONS ON UNITS CONVERTED PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 7, 1995.
   (A)   Compliance. Any accommodation unit within the town which has been
converted to a condominium or has received approval for a conversion prior to
the effective date of February 7, 1995, shall comply with the requirements of
this section. The requirements contained in this section shall not apply to
structures or buildings which contain two units or less.
   (B)   Use by owner/renter. The requirements and restrictions herein
contained shall be included in the condominium declaration for the project, and
filed of record with the Eagle County Clerk and Recorder. The condominium units
created shall remain in the short term rental market to be used as temporary
accommodations available to the general public.
      (1)   An owner’s personal use of his or her unit shall be restricted to
28 days during the seasonal periods of December 24 through January 1 and
February 1 through March 20. This seasonal period is hereinafter referred to as
“high season”. OWNER’S PERSONAL USE shall be defined as owner occupancy of a
unit or nonpaying guest of the owner or taking the unit off the rental market
during the seasonal periods referred to herein for any reason other than
necessary repairs which cannot be postponed or which make the unit unrentable.
Occupancy of a unit by a lodge manager or staff employed by the lodge, however,
shall not be restricted by this section.
      (2)   A violation of the owner’s use restriction by a unit owner shall
subject the owner to a daily assessment rate by the condominium association of
three times a rate considered to be a reasonable daily rental rate for the unit
at the time of the violation, which assessment when paid shall be common
elements of the condominiums. All sums assessed against the owner for violation
of the owner’s personal use restriction and unpaid shall constitute a lien for
the benefit of the condominium association on that owner’s unit, which lien
shall be evidenced by written notice placed of record in the office of the
Clerk and Recorder of Eagle County, and which may be collected by foreclosure
on an owner’s condominium unit by the association in like manner as a mortgage
or deed of trust on real property. The condominium association’s failure to
enforce the owner’s personal use restriction shall give the town the right to
enforce the restriction by the assessment and the lien provided for hereunder.
If the town enforces the restriction, the town shall receive the funds
collected as a result of such enforcement. In the event litigation results from
the enforcement of the restriction, and the town prevails in such litigation,
the court shall award the town its court costs together with reasonable
attorney fees incurred.
      (3)   The town shall have the right to require from the condominium
association an annual report of owner’s personal use during the high seasons
for all converted condominium units.
      (4)   The converted lodge units shall not be used as permanent
residences. For the purposes of this section, a person shall be presumed to be
a permanent resident if such person has resided in the unit for six consecutive
months notwithstanding from time to time during such six-month period the
person may briefly dwell in other places.
   (C)   Converted lodge retains customary facilities. Any lodge located within
the town which has converted accommodation units to condominiums shall continue
to provide customary lodge facilities and services including a customary
marketing program.
   (D)   Unsold condominiums rented. The converted condominium units shall
remain available to the general tourist market. If unsold 30 days after
recording of the condominium map, the unsold converted condominiums shall be
required to be furnished and made available to the general tourist market
within 90 days after the date of recording of the condominium map. This
requirement may be met by inclusion of the units of the condominium project at
comparable rates in any local reservation system for the rental of lodge or
condominium units in the town.
   (E)   Common areas remain. The common areas of any lodge with converted
units shall remain common areas and be maintained in a manner consistent with
its previous character. Any changes, alterations or renovations made to common
areas shall not diminish the size or quality of the common areas.
   (F)   Employee housing. Any accommodation units that were utilized to
provide housing for employees at any time during the three years previous to
the date of the application shall remain as employee units for such duration as
may be required by the Planning and Environmental Commission or the Town
Council.
   (G)   Applicability. All conditions set forth within this section shall be
made binding on the applicant, the applicant’s successors, heirs, personal
representatives and assigns and shall govern the property which is the subject
of the application for the life of the survivor of the present Town Council
plus 21 years.
      (1)   Conversion of accommodation units located within a lodge pursuant
to this section, shall be modified only by the written agreement of the Town
Council and the owner or owners of the units which have been converted into
condominiums.
      (2)   The documents creating and governing any accommodation unit which
has been converted into a condominium shall be modified by the owners of such
units only with the prior written approval of the Town Council.

§ 13-7-9 ACTION ON PRELIMINARY MAP.
   (A)   Criteria considered. At the hearing on the preliminary map, the
Planning and Environmental Commission shall consider whether the proposed
conversion is consistent with the following housing goals of the town:
      (1)   To encourage continuation of social and economic diversity in the
town through a variety of housing types;
      (2)   To expand the supply of decent housing for low and moderate income
families; and
      (3)   To achieve greater economic balance for the town by increasing the
number of jobs and the supply of housing for people who will hold them.
   (B)   Determine percentages for sale or rent. The Commission may require
that a reasonable percentage of the converted units be reserved for sale or
rental to persons of moderate income.
   (C)   Findings supporting denial. The Planning and Environmental Commission
may deny the tentative or preliminary map upon finding that:
      (1)   Based on the information required by §
13-7-6 of this chapter, and on the vacancy rate for rental housing, tenants
will have substantial difficulty in obtaining comparably priced rental housing.
A rental vacancy rate below 5% based on the most recent town survey constitutes
a housing emergency situation; and
      (2)   The ratio of multiple-family rental units would be reduced to less
than 25% of the total number of dwelling units in the Gore Valley, from Dowd
Junction east to the base of Vail Pass, with no replacement rental housing
being provided.

§ 13-7-11 IMPROVEMENT SECURITY.
   (A)   Acceptable form of security. The Planning and Environmental Commission
and the Town Council may require a security to be posted by the applicant which
shall consist of one or more arrangements which the Council shall accept to
secure the actual cost of construction of such public improvements as are
required by the ordinances of the town. The improvement security may include
any one or a combination of the types of security or collateral listed in this
subsection (A) and the applicant may substitute security in order to release
portions of the condominium project for sale. The types of collateral which may
be used as security are as follows:
      (1)   Restrictions on the conveyance, sale or transfer of any unit within
the condominium project as set forth on the final map;
      (2)   Performance of property bond;
      (3)   Private or public escrow agreement;
      (4)   Loan commitment;
      (5)   Assignments of receivables;
      (6)   Liens on property;
      (7)   Letters of credit; and
      (8)   Deposits of security funds; or other similar surety agreements.
   (B)   Amount determined. Security other than plat restrictions, required
under the improvement security, shall equal in value the cost of the
improvements to be completed but shall not be required on the portion of the
condominium project subject to plat restrictions. The Council shall not require
security with collateral arrangements in excess of the actual cost of
construction of the improvements. The amount of security may be incrementally
reduced as subdivision or condominium improvements are completed.

street, except by special permission of the Town Engineer.
   (C)   Existing utilities. All existing utility lines, pipes and structures
shall be located sufficiently ahead of the work to avoid damage to these
facilities and permit their relocation, if necessary.
   (D)   Monuments. Monuments of concrete, iron or other lasting material set
for the purpose of locating or preserving the lines of any street or property
subdivision, or a precise survey reference point or a permanent survey bench
mark within the town, shall not be removed or disturbed unless permission to do
so is first obtained in writing from the Town Engineer. Permission shall be
granted only upon condition that the permittee shall pay all expenses incident
to the proper replacement of the monument. The town reserves the right to
reestablish lost monuments and such costs incurred shall be paid by the
permittee or deducted from his or her bond.
   (E)   Drainage. When work performed by the permittee interferes with the
existing drainage system of any street, provision shall be made by the
permittee to provide proper drainage to the satisfaction of the Town Engineer,
including the improvement, enlargement or replacement of downstream facilities
impacted by the proposed project.
   (F)   Street cleaning. When any earth, gravel or other excavated material is
caused to roll, flow or wash upon any street, the permittee shall cause the
debris to be removed from the street by the end of the workday. In the event
the earth, gravel or other excavated material so deposited is not removed, the
engineer shall cause such removal and the cost incurred shall be paid by the
permittee or deducted from his or her bond.
   (G)   Traffic warning.
      (1)   It shall be the duty of every person cutting or making an
excavation in or upon any public place, to place and maintain barriers and
warning devices necessary for safety of the general public. The contractor
shall be responsible for the furnishing of barriers and warning devices through
his or her own means.
      (2)   Barriers, warning signs, lights and the like shall conform to the
requirements of the Town Engineer. Warning lights, electrical markers or
flashers shall be used to indicate a hazard to traffic from one hour before
sunset of each day to sunrise of the next day.
      (3)   The permittee shall take appropriate measures to assure that during
the performance of the excavation work, traffic conditions as near normal as
possible shall be maintained at all times so as to minimize inconvenience to
the occupants of the adjoining property and to the general public.
      (4)   When traffic conditions permit, the Town Engineer may, by written
approval, permit the closing of streets to all traffic for a period of time
prescribed by the Town Engineer. The written approval of the Town Engineer may
require that the permittee give notification to various public agencies and to
the general public. In such cases, such written approval shall not be valid
until such notice is given.
      (5)   Warning signs shall be placed far enough in advance of the
construction operation to alert traffic within a public street, and cones or
other approved devices shall be placed to channel traffic, in accordance with
the instructions of the Town Engineer.
   (H)   Access to existing structures. The excavation work shall be performed
and conducted so as not to interfere with access to fire hydrants, fire
stations, fire escapes, water gates, underground vaults, valve housing
structures and all other vital equipment as designated by the Town Engineer.
(Ord. 2(1983) § 1; 1997 Code; Ord. 2(2007) § 8)
§ 13-10-5-4 BACKFILLING AND RESTORATION.
   (A)   General. All pavement cuts, openings and excavations shall be properly
made, backfilled, and a temporary surface installed by the permittee according
to town regulations, design standards and construction specifications.
   (B)   Backfilling. Backfilling shall be done in accordance with the
specifications as listed in these design standards. The permittee shall
backfill all cuts as soon as possible to allow normal traffic usage. See also §
13-10-11(B) of this chapter and the street cut ordinance.
   (C)   Street resurfacing. If the area to be resurfaced exceeds 50% of the
total pavement surfacing in any block, the Town Engineer may require the
permittee to resurface the block. Fifty percent or greater damage shall be
deemed to require 100% restoration. This damage may be caused where trenches
are laid in close proximity to one another, or where the equipment or method
used causes damage. RESTORATION is defined as the complete removal and
replacement of surface pavement and preparation of base material.
   (D)   Inspections. The Town Engineer shall make such inspections as he or
she may deem necessary. For street improvements, the permittee shall work
closely with the Engineer and give at least one working day’s notice of
inspections and not less than one day’s notice whenever possible. For
underground installation, the town recognizes that other agencies require
inspections and the town’s concern is that the surface is properly restored.
Inspections may be requested by calling the Public Works Department during
normal working hours.
   (E)   Liability. In no case shall any opening made by a permittee be
considered in the charge or care of the town or any of its officers or
employees, and no officer or employee is authorized in any way to take or
assume any jurisdiction over any such opening, except in the exercise of the
police power, or when it is necessary to protect life and property. If any
failure in the restored area occurs within a period of one year from the
acceptance date, the permittee shall be notified and necessary corrections made
and required expenses deducted from the bond.
(Ord. 2(1983) § 1; 1997 Code)

   Street cuts, see Title 8, Chapter 1 of this code
§ 13-10-5-5 UNDERGROUND WARNING TAPE.
   (A)   Requirements. Underground warning tape shall be required in all
utility trenches within town rights-of-way (ROWs) and easements. When replacing
or repairing existing lines, warning tape shall be added during backfill.
Service lines also require warning tape within the ROW.
   (B)   Location. The tape shall be placed approximately half way between the
top of the pipe and the surface. The town will inspect placement at this time.
   (C)   Type of warning tape. The underground warning tape shall be six inches
wide, four one-hundredths inch thick, and have the type of utility printed on
the tape. Each utility shall use a specific color as listed below:
 
Blue     Water lines
Green    Sewer lines
Yellow   Gas lines
Red      Power lines
Orange   Telephone lines
Hot pink Cable TV
 
(Ord. 2(1983) § 1; 1997 Code)
§ 13-10-6 PROTECTION OF EXISTING IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Utility locations. Existing utilities are to be located by the
respective utility company or acknowledgment that no utility is located in the
construction area. This process shall be accomplished as the permittee procures
a public way permit by signing of the permit by each utility listed on the
permit.
   (B)   Existing utilities.
      (1)   Reasonable care shall be exercised in showing the location of
existing utilities on the plans. The exact location of such utilities may not
be known in all cases. The contractor shall explore the area ahead of the
ditching operation by observation and/or electronic devices to locate such
utilities in advance of trenching operations, and shall conduct his or her work
so as to minimize damage to the existing structures.
      (2)   Existing utilities shall be properly supported as required by the
owner and protected from damage during the progress of the work. All pipe
lines, utilities or structures which are broken or damaged shall be
reconstructed of the same material, to the satisfaction of the owner. Where it
was reasonably possible for the contractor to have located the utilities, he or
she shall assume the responsibility for proper repair or replacement to them.
The contractor shall immediately report any damaged utilities.
      (3)   The contractor shall contact the owners of all irrigation ditches,
and make arrangements for necessary construction clearances and/or dry-up
periods.
      (4)   All irrigation ditches, culverts, catch basins, headgates, pipe,
valves, checks and the like, damaged or removed by the contractor, shall be
restored to their original condition or better, at the contractor’s expense.
   (C)   Protection of existing structures.
      (1)   Where trenches are located closely adjacent to buildings,
foundations and structures, the contractor shall take all necessary precaution
against damage to them. The contractor shall be liable for any damage caused by
the construction.
      (2)   Trees, fences, mailboxes, poles and all other property shall be
protected unless their removal is authorized by the Town Engineer, and property
damaged or removed shall be satisfactorily restored by the contractor at his or
her cost, in no more than 30 calendar days.
(Ord. 2(1983) § 1)
§ 13-10-7 INSPECTION AND TESTING.
   (A)   Inspections.
      (1)   It is the responsibility of the contractor or the developer to
contact the Town Building Official one day in advance of the required
inspections. In-progress inspections of all elements of work will eliminate the
need for extensive post-testing.
      (2)   Any work or material which does not conform to town standards will
be brought to the attention of the contractor or developer and, if immediate
corrections are not made, construction may be stopped.
      (3)   The general types of inspections required are as follows:
         (a)   Culverts, storm sewer lines and appurtenances. Trenching, grade
bedding, installation of pipe, backfill, and compaction. Inspection to be
requested when backfill is completed to one-half the depth of culvert, or storm
sewer line;
         (b)   Structures, including manholes. Finished excavation, grade,
forming, reinforcing steel, concrete pour, finish and test cylinders.
Inspections required:
            1.   Prior to placing steel; and
            2.   Prior to the concrete pour.
         (c)   Roadway. Subgrade, subbase, base course, prime, and paving to be
called for at each completed stage. Locations of required field tests will be
determined by the construction inspector;
         (d)   Final. A request for the final inspection and acceptance for
maintenance or release from bond must be made in writing to the Town Engineer
after all other inspections have been passed; and
         (e)   Water and sewer lines. All water and sewer lines shall be
inspected by the appropriate district. All designs shall be submitted to the
appropriate district and to the Town Engineer for review and approval.
   (B)   Testing. When required by the Town Engineer, a recognized testing firm
shall certify to the quality of materials or construction. All testing shall be
by recognized methods and shall be at the contractor’s, developer’s or owner’s
expense.
   (C)   Developer’s warranty. The developer or owner shall be fully
responsible for the maintenance and correction of any faulty construction,
including unsuitable street cuts, chuckholes and storm sewer line blockages for
a period of one year after the roads are accepted by the town.
(Ord. 2(1983) § 1)
§ 13-10-8 STREETS.
   Provisions providing for street classification, design criteria and
construction provisions shall be as set forth in the following sections.
(Ord. 2(1983) § 1)
§ 13-10-8-1 GENERAL.
   Road layout shall bear a logical relationship to existing or platted roads
in adjacent properties and thoroughfare plan.
(Ord. 2(1983) § 1)
§ 13-10-8-2 CLASSIFICATION.
   (A)   Arterial. Arterial streets (frontage roads) are those which permit the
relatively rapid and unimpeded movement of large volumes of traffic from one
part of the community to another.
   (B)   Collector. Collector streets are those which collect traffic from
minor or local streets and carry it to arterial streets or to local traffic
generators. Collector streets include the principal entrance streets to a
residential development, those linking such adjacent developments, and those
streets providing circulation within such developments.
   (C)   Local. Local streets are those used primarily for direct access to
properties abutting the right-of-way. Local streets carry traffic having an
origin or destination within the development and do not carry through traffic.
   (D)   Minor. Minor streets (includes private) are those used primarily for
direct access to properties abutting the right-of-way. Minor streets carry
fewer vehicles than local streets. They do not carry through traffic.
(Ord. 2(1983) § 1)
§ 13-10-9 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (A)   Major points.
      (1)   Local and minor. Local and minor streets shall be designed in such
a manner that through traffic within the subdivision will be discouraged.
      (2)   Intersections. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as
nearly as possible at right angles.
      (3)   Street names. Street names shall not duplicate an existing street
name, unless the said street is an extension of the existing street. Street
names shall be subject to the approval of the Town Council.
      (4)   Curves. The minimum curve radius shall be as designated in
subsection (A)(9) of this section.
      (5)   Alleys. Alleys shall be provided if required by the Planning and
Environmental Commission. The minimum width of the alley shall be 20 feet.
Dead-end alleys shall not be permitted. All alleys shall be paved.
      (6)   Easements. Easements shall be provided for all utilities,
drainageways, channels or streams which traverse across the subdivision.
      (7)   Block lengths. The length, width and shapes of blocks shall be
determined by the type of use, zoning requirements, needs for convenient
access, circulation and safety of street traffic, and limitations and
opportunities of topography.
      (8)   Culs-de-sac. Cul-de-sac streets, however, shall be designed as
minor or local with a right-of-way bulb of 50-foot radius and pavement radius
of 40 feet.
      (9)   Street width. Street width shall conform to the following:
 
Class      ROW Width Paved    Shoulder Design Max. Grade Min. Curve Future ADT
                     Width             Speed  %          Radius
Arterial   70        12 ft.   8        50     6          650        750 and
(Frontage)           per lane                                       over
Collector  50        24       4        40     7          250        300—750
Local      50        22       3        30     8          60         150—300
Minor      40        22       2        30     9          50         0—150
(Private)
 
   (B)   Horizontal alignment.
      (1)   The major considerations in horizontal alignment design are:
safety; grade profile; road type; design speed; sight distance; and topography.
All these factors must be balanced to produce an alignment that is safest, most
economical, and adequate for the type of road proposed.
      (2)   Horizontal alignment must provide at least the minimum stopping
sight distance for the design speed at all points. This includes visibility at
intersections, as well as around curves and roadside encroachments.
   (C)   Vertical alignment.
      (1)   Reference. The grade line is the reference line by which the
elevation of the pavement and other features of the road are established. It is
controlled mainly by topography, the factors of horizontal alignment, safety,
sight distance, design speed, drainage and construction costs. The
configuration of heavy duty vehicles must also be considered.
      (2)   Grade line. The grade line should be positioned with relation to
the cross section as follows.
         (a)   It should coincide with the road centerline on two lane and
multi-lane undivided roads.
         (b)   Separate grade lines may be required on divided multi-lane
roads.
   (D)   Vertical curve.
      (1)   Properly designed vertical curves should provide adequate stopping
and passing sight distance, headlight sight distance, driver comfort, good
drainage and pleasing appearance.
      (2)   Long, flat vertical curves should be avoided as they may develop
poor drainage at the level section and tend to create driver insecurity in
passing maneuvers.
      (3)   Lengths of vertical curves shall be determined by the site distance
requirements.
   (E)   Sight distance.
      (1)   All portions of the grade line must meet sight distance
requirements for the design speed.
      (2)   The minimum stopping sight distance is the distance required by the
driver of a vehicle, traveling at a given speed, to bring his or her vehicle to
a stop after an object on the road becomes visible. Stopping sight distance is
measured from the driver’s eyes, which are assumed to be three and three-
fourths feet above the pavement surface to an object six inches high on the
road. The required stopping sight distance for a given design speed shall be
designed by the engineer.
   (F)   Crown slopes.
 
Type Of Surface          Min. Crown Max. Slope
Portland cement concrete 1.5%       4.0%
Bituminous mix pavements 2.0%       4.0%
 
   (G)   Clearances. The following are minimum clearances to structures or
other roadside obstructions. Additional clearance must be provided for sight
distance and other requirements. Where streets or highways under the
jurisdiction of other agencies are involved the clearance, as required by said
agency, if more restrictive than town standards, shall apply.
      (1)   Horizontal clearance. The minimum horizontal clearance from the
edge of traveled way shall be ten feet to the right and four feet to the left
when facing in the direction of travel.
      (2)   Vertical clearance. The minimum vertical clearance to major
overhead structures shall be 15 feet above the traveled way and 14 feet above
the shoulders. For minor overhead structures, such as signs, cables and the
like, the minimum vertical clearance shall be 18 feet.
   (H)   Structural design.
      (1)   Design formula. The design of pavements is based upon the American
Association of State Highway Officials group index rating, which is obtained by
the use of a group index formula based upon the gradation, liquid limit and
plasticity index of the soil. The group index formula is as follows:
 
Group Index = 0.2a + 0.005 ac + 0.01bd
 
      Where:
      a = that portion of the gradation percentage passing the No. 200 sieve
greater than 35% and not exceeding 75%, expressed as a positive whole number (1
to 40);
      b = that portion of the gradation percentage passing the No. 200 sieve
greater than 15% and not exceeding 55%, expressed as a positive whole number (1
to 40);
      c = that portion of the numerical liquid limit greater than 40 and not
exceeding 60, expressed as a positive whole number (1 to 20); and
      d = that portion of the numerical plasticity index greater than ten and
not exceeding 30, expressed as a positive whole number (1 to 20).
      (2)   Pavement thickness. The group index shall be computed for each soil
sample taken and then applied to the proper design curve to obtain the minimum
total pavement thickness required to the nearest one-half inch. That total
thickness shall be used for pavements where the soil sample is representative.
(See Figure 3.1.*)
   (I)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks are not generally required but may be required by
the planning staff, Planning and Environmental Commission, or Town Engineer if
deemed appropriate. (See Figure 3.2.*)
   (J)   Curbs and gutters. Approved types of concrete curb and gutter are not
generally required but may be required by the planning staff, Planning and
Environmental Commission or Town Engineer if deemed appropriate. (See Figures
3.2 and 3.3*, and §
13-10-11(E) of this chapter.)
   (K)   Drainage.
      (1)   The primary objective of drainage design shall be the protection of
town streets and property while minimizing the possible flood damage to
surrounding properties and structures. It should be emphasized that good
drainage is one of the most important factors in road design. It preserves the
good appearance as well as the level of service of the street while at the same
time minimizing the cost of maintenance.
      (2)   Culverts under collector and arterial streets are to be designed to
accommodate a 50-year frequency storm runoff, utilizing the maximum available
head. The maximum available head shall be determined by the uppermost ponding
elevation, so chosen as not to cause flood damage to upstream properties.
      (3)   On-site facilities and culverts under minor streets shall be
designed to accommodate the 25-year frequency storm runoff.
      (4)   Inlets and other facilities draining the street surface shall be
designed to accommodate the ten-year frequency storm runoff.
      (5)   All drainage installations shall also be designed to permit free
unobstructed passage of debris and silt, or provide for their deflection and/or
collection at a point upstream in such a manner as not to create an expensive
maintenance problem.
      (6)   Storm runoff estimates: unless approved by the Town Engineer, the
Soil Conservation Service method shall be utilized for drainage calculations.
The appropriate design manual shall be Procedures for Determining Peak Flows in
Colorado.
         (a)   Precipitation and snowmelt rates to be used are itemized below:
 
Frequency (years) Precipitation (inches) Snow Melt (cfs/acre)
2                 1.0                    0.040
5                 1.4                    0.048
6                 1.6                    0.060
25                1.9                    0.067
50                2.2                    0.072
100               2.4                    0.080
 
         (b)   1.   Unless an extensive drainage report is prepared by a
registered professional engineer with supporting data on soil types, vegetation
and historic flows, the following design procedures shall be used:
 
Calculation Of Runoff Curve Numbers
Impervious surface    CN = 98
Lawn areas            CN = 60
Wood or forest land   CN = 70
 
            2.   A weighted CN shall be calculated for the immediate area
proposed for development. Open space areas will be lumped in separate tributary
basins and a CN of 70 assigned to them independent of the developed area.
   SAMPLE:
    Total drainage shed = 5.0 acres
    Immediate developed areas = 0.5 acres
    Open space area = 4.5 acres
    Impervious surface = 70% of developed area
   Apply CN = 70 to 4.5 acres and calculate runoff
   Weighted CN for developed area:
    Weighted CN =    .7 x 0.5 x 98+.3 x 0.5 x 60 = 86.6 = 87
                     .5
         (c)   Calculation of runoff depth.
            1.   Open space: From CN = 70 and 25-year precipitation of 1.9
inches; runoff depth = 0.20 inches.
            2.   Developed area: From CN = 87 and 25-year precipitation of 1.9
inches; runoff depth = 0.83 inches
         (d)   Calculation of flow (cubic feet/second).
            Open space: Use Figure SI-A, flat slope (16%)
            peak discharge (cfs/inch of runoff) = 8.3
            Q = 8.3 x 0.2 = 1.7 cfs
            Developed area: use Figure SI-A, flat slope (1%)
            peak discharge = 1.6
            Q:= 1.6 x.83 = 1.3 cfs
      For piped systems, tributary areas for each inlet should be calculated
and the flows calculated as above.
      (7)   Culverts. Culverts are to be located at each natural draw or
watercourse as conditions warrant to prevent excessive accumulation of flow in
street-side ditches or along the toe of slopes. Draws and watercourses are to
be cleared of debris for a distance of 100 feet upstream from all culvert
inlets.
         (a)   Inverts at the inlet should be slightly elevated above the
normal flow line in steep natural draws to avoid plugging by debris. Excessive
ponding shall be avoided.
         (b)   The culvert should slope downward in the direction of natural
flow and designed to be self-cleaning wherever possible. The outlet should be
designed so as not to discharge on unprotected fills or unstable material or at
adverse angles to streams or open channels. Headwalls, riprap or other means of
protection are required at inlets or outlets where erosion may occur.
         (c)   Minimum diameter for round pipe shall be 12 inches. The minimum
rise of arch pipes and box culverts shall be 12 inches.
         (d)   Cleanout access shall be provided at least every 200 feet for
pipes 24 inches in diameter or less, and at least every 400 feet for larger
pipes. Cleanout accesses shall also be required at each angle point and at each
change in grade.
      (8)   Subsurface drainage. Subgrades subject to poor drainage,
underground seepage or a high water table must be adequately drained for
roadbed stabilization. Drains must be installed to control or prevent the high
ground water level from coming to within four feet of the roadway pavement.
Surface drainage will be considered as an alternate.
      (9)   Inlet structures. Acceptable designs for inlet structures will be
permitted on approval by the Town Engineer. Curb openings with protection bars
are preferred. Special grates are permitted where pedestrians, bicycles, or
debris laden flows are anticipated. (See Figures 3.4 and 3.5.*)
   (L)   Traffic control devices.
      (1)   All signs, striping, marking, delineators, signals and other
traffic control devices are to conform to the requirements of the state as
outlined in uniform traffic control devices.
      (2)   In new developments, all required street name signs are to be
installed and paid for by the developer. Nonstandard signs or other traffic
control devices are subject to rigid state control and approval by the Town
Engineer must be obtained for their use. Requests for using nonstandard signs
or other devices must be submitted to the Town Engineer along with all data
required to support the request.

with a neat and finished appearance.
      (5)   Removing and salvaging structures. The contractor may remove
existing fences, pipes, aprons, curbs and/or gutters, sidewalks and other
similar items, the removal of which is necessary in connection with
construction of the project. The contractor shall dispose of the removed
material, except that, as ordered by the Town Engineer, culvert pipe, castings
and items suitable for reuse shall be protected from damage and be salvaged,
and except that suitable material may be salvaged for riprap or bank
protection. All salvaged items within the public right- of-way shall be the
property of the town.
   (B)   Excavation and grading.
      (1)   General. This item shall consist of all excavation and grading of
whatever nature, above or below subgrade elevation, required to bring the
street, alley, curb, gutters, sidewalks, ditches or other areas to be
constructed to the proper subgrade elevation, construction of embankments,
excavation and proper sloping of all cuts, and other items of excavation not
separately designated.
      (2)   Excavations. All excavations shall be made to subgrade elevations
and shall be true to grade. Material below subgrade elevation in cuts shall not
be loosened by plowing, ripping or other methods during the progress of the
work except with the approval of the Town Engineer. No excavation shall be made
below subgrade elevation except to remove unsuitable material as ordered by the
Engineer. In the event the contractor does excavate any other area below
subgrade elevation, he or she shall replace the excavated material with
satisfactory material and shall thoroughly compact the same.
      (3)   Unsuitable material. Material that is unsuitable for the planned
use shall be excavated and disposed of as directed by the Town Engineer.
      (4)   Excavation below subgrade. Whenever excavation below subgrade
elevation to remove unsuitable material is ordered by the Town Engineer, the
contractor shall remove the same to the satisfaction of the Engineer and shall
replace it with satisfactory material in layers not to exceed six inches in
thickness, or as designated by the Engineer, and shall thoroughly compact each
layer to 90% compaction standard Proctor before the next layer is placed.
      (5)   Surplus material. Unless otherwise shown on the plans or specified
in the special provisions, no surplus excavated material may be disposed of
within the right-of-way unless approved by the Town Engineer.
      (6)   Embankments. Embankments shall be constructed up to subgrade
elevation in layers not to exceed six inches in thickness and for the full
width of the embankment. Each layer shall be thoroughly compacted to 90%
standard Proctor up to the last 12 inches of subgrade before the next layer is
placed and the upper 12 inches to be compacted to 95% standard Proctor. When
borrow is required, it shall be taken from a source approved by the Engineer.
      (7)   Compaction of upgrade. After excavation (for new construction) has
been completed to approximate grade, upon direction of the Engineer, the
subgrade shall be scarified to a depth of six inches, wetted or aerated as
needed, and compacted until a density equal to 95% of the density determined by
the Proctor Method (AASHO designation: T99) is obtained in the upper 18 inches.
      (8)   Subgrade for curbs and gutters. Subgrade areas occupied by curbs
and gutters shall be excavated, backfilled, and compacted to established grade.
This work shall be done with particular care in accordance with all
requirements herein.
      (9)   Subgrade for sidewalks. Subgrade under sidewalks shall be compacted
to 95% standard Proctor.

dust control at all times during construction operations. Dust control may be
accomplished by water sprinkling or by other means approved by the Town
Engineer.
   (C)   Pavement and surface replacement.
      (1)   General. All excavations that are made in a public right-of-way
must be completely restored within seven days subsequent to acceptance of
backfill by the Town Engineer.
      (2)   Bases.
         (a)   A minimum of six inches of select base material shall be
installed and thoroughly compacted immediately beneath the paving or concrete
patch to be installed, and no less than the base course immediately adjacent to
such cut will be acceptable.
         (b)   In the event that asphaltic concrete base, soil cement base or
other base course materials be encountered by excavation, restoration shall be
made in kind subject to the approval of the Town Engineer.
      (3)   Bituminous pavement. Permanent hot mix asphalt cement patches shall
in no instance be less than two inches in thickness nor less than the hot mix
asphalt cement adjacent to the excavation, and shall be installed in accordance
with good construction practices and these specifications. Prior to replacement
of the pavement the exposed edges of the existing pavement and base course
shall be neatly trimmed to a neat straight line by a spade, bit or hammer.
      (4)   Concrete patch replacement. When a concrete patch is used, the
width shall be extended six inches on each side of the undisturbed trench
shoulders. The pavement edges shall be trimmed to form a uniform edge to allow
better adherence between material. Due care should be taken to assure that no
voids or air pockets are left in the concrete or along the edge between
concrete and asphaltic material. The patch shall be a minimum of six-inch thick
concrete with a minimum of 4,000 psi crushing strength. The top is then to be
sealed with asphalt oil and sand.
      (5)   Gravel surfaced streets. In areas where existing gravel surfacing
is removed from the streets, the contractor shall replace the graveled
surfacing with material at least equal in depth and quality to that removed,
but in no case shall the surfacing be less than six inches in thickness. The
existing graveled surfacing may be salvaged and reused if handled so as to
prevent mixing with other excavated materials.
      (6)   Driveways and entrances. Resurfacing of driveways and entrances
crossed by the construction shall be performed as outlined above for bituminous
surfaced streets and granular surfaced streets for the particular driveway and
entrance involved.
      (7)   Other surface improvements. Driveways, sidewalks or other surface
improvements shall be replaced with a base course, six inches minimum, and

      (8)   Cleanup. All paved streets wherein excavation has been performed
will be thoroughly cleaned and completely policed from all debris and
extraneous material created by the work.
      (9)   Grassed areas. The upper six inches of the trench shall be
backfilled with topsoil, fertilized and seeded. The seed shall be applied at
the rate of one pound per 500 square feet, and the area so seeded shall then be
mulched with peat to retard evaporation of water. The seeding shall be done at
a time approved by the Town Engineer. In lieu of seeding, the Town Engineer may
require removing and replacing the existing sod or sodding the backfilled area.
   (D)   Adjusting frames, covers, and valve boxes.
      (1)   General. The contractor shall notify the owner to make necessary
adjustments. The frames shall be set to grades approved by the Town Engineer,
or one-fourth inch below finished pavement grade, in a manner hereinafter
specified. The contractor may elect to remove old frames, covers and valve
boxes and to install new frames and/or boxes.
      (2)   Adjusting frames. The contractor shall loosen frames in such a
manner that existing monuments, cleanouts or valve boxes will not be disturbed
or manholes damaged. Should the frame or cover become damaged as a result of
mishandling by the contractor, it shall be replaced by the contractor with a
ring and cover of comparable weight, size and quality at no cost to the town.
Debris shall not be permitted to enter sanitary or storm drain conduits. All
loose material and debris shall be removed from the excavation and the
interiors of structures prior to resetting frames.
         (a)   Manhole sidewalls that require adjustment shall be constructed
at least eight inches thick by the use of common brick and mortar or class A
concrete.
         (b)   Additional manhole steps shall be added for each 15-inch
increase in the height of the manhole sidewalls.
         (c)   Manhole frames shall not be finally set until the pavement
adjacent thereto has been completed. The manholes shall be left or lowered
sufficiently below grade so as not to interfere with or form an obstruction to
the preparation of the subbase, base, and pavement. The manhole openings shall
be temporarily covered by suitable means and the work constructed thereover.
Due care shall be exercised to prevent foreign material from entering the
manholes. After the pavement has been constructed, the necessary portions of
the subbase, base and pavement shall be neatly cut away, the manholes built up,
and the cover frames set to grade, following which any surrounding area from
which the pavement base or subbase has been so removed shall be backfilled with
concrete.
      (3)   Adjusting valve boxes. Adjustable cast iron boxes shall, if
possible, be brought to grade by adjustment of the upper movable section. It
may be necessary to provide an extension to lengthen the box enough to match
the required grade. An excavated area shall be filled with six inch concrete to
the level of the existing pavement, or as directed by the Town Engineer.
   (E)   Concrete curbs, gutters and sidewalks.
      (1)   General. The work covered by this section consists of portland
cement concrete curb and gutter, curbwalk and driveways complete in accordance

soft or other unsuitable material shall be removed to a depth of not less than
six inches below subgrade or, when necessary in the opinion of the Town
Engineer, to a greater depth and replaced with material satisfactory to the
Engineer. The finished subgrade under curb and gutter shall be compacted to 95%
of maximum density as determined by standard Proctor test.
      (4)   Placement. Concrete shall be placed on a compacted subgrade or
base. The concrete shall be properly graded with the forms securely set to
provide the section and surface elevations shown on the plans.
      (5)   Joints. Expansion joints and block joints shall be constructed
straight, plumb, and shall extend through the curb and gutter or curbwalk
section from top to bottom and from front to back. Expansion joint filler one-
half inch thick, preformed bituminous- treated fiberboard, conforming to AASHO
specification M59, shall be used to form transverse expansion joints. Expansion
joints shall be constructed at the intersection with the existing curb and
gutter, curbwalk and sidewalk, at all radius points and at 150 foot intervals
and/or as directed by the Town Engineer.
   (F)   Bituminous macadam surface.
      (1)   General.
         (a)   Areas. Areas to be allowed:
            1.   Streets in grandfather subdivisions;

      (3)   Materials.
         (a)   Mineral aggregates. Mineral aggregates for bituminous macadam
shall consist of clean, tough, durable fragments of broken stone, free from an
excess of flat, elongated, soft or disintegrated pieces, and free from stone
coated with dirt or other objectionable matter. The mineral aggregate shall be
uniformly graded within the limits specified below for stone chips.
         (b)   Stone chips. Stone chips shall be of such size that not less
than 90% shall pass a sieve having three-fourths inch square openings, and be
retained on a sieve having three-eighths inch square openings. Stone chips for
use in the seal coat shall be of such size that not less than 90% shall pass a
sieve having three-eighths inch square openings and be retained on a No. 4
sieve.
         (c)   Bituminous binder. Such binder shall be RC-800 or an approved
emulsified oil.
      (4)   Construction methods.
         (a)   Base. Finished base shall be one-half inch below the gutter edge
and thoroughly rolled with a steel wheel roller prior to the first application
of bituminous binder.
         (b)   First application of bituminous binder (with three-fourths inch
chips). The first application of bituminous binder shall be spread at the rate
of five-tenths to one gallon per square yard of surface. The bituminous binder
shall be allowed to penetrate into the roadway for not more than 24 hours and
the macadam covered by a layer of three-fourths inch chips and rolled. Care
must be exercised during the rolling to cover the bituminous surface in all
places so that the material will not adhere to the roller. Before the second
coat of bituminous binder is applied, all excess material shall be removed.
         (c)   Second application of bituminous binder (with three-fourths inch
chips). The second application of bituminous binder shall be spread at the rate
of one-fourth to one-half gallon per square yard of surface area, the quantity
between the limits mentioned to be determined by the Town Engineer. Three-
fourths inch chips shall then be uniformly spread over the entire surface in
quantity sufficient to prevent the asphaltic surface from adhering to the
rollers, after which the roadway shall be thoroughly rolled. The rolling shall
continue sufficiently to give a hard, smooth, finished surface. If the
bituminous binder shows through the surface, additional chips shall be spread
and rolled into the affected area.
         (d)   Final application of bituminous binder (with three-eighths inch
chips). After the road has been open to traffic for a period of two and not
more than four weeks, a final application of bituminous binder shall be spread
at the rate of from one-fourth to one-half gallons per square yards of the
surface area covered, as the Town Engineer shall determine. The area to be
covered shall be the entire area of finished surface course and portion of
shoulders as indicated on plans. Before applying this coat of bituminous
binder, the surface of the pavement and shoulders shall be thoroughly swept.
This coat of bituminous binder shall be covered with chips in sufficient
quantity to take up the bituminous binder. Every portion of the surface shall
then be rolled thoroughly.
         (e)   General requirements for rolling. All rolling shall be done with
self-propelled road rollers, steel wheel and rubber tire, weighing not less
than ten tons. All rolling shall commence at the outer edges and continue
toward the center. Under no circumstances shall the center of the road be
rolled first. Otherwise the time, extent and manner of rolling shall be subject
to the direction of the Town Engineer.
         (f)   General requirements for bituminous work.
            1.   Bituminous work shall be done only when the atmospheric
temperature is above 65°F and even then only during such periods as the sun is
shining. This rule may be suspended by the Town Engineer, when in his or her
opinion the same may not be detrimental to the work. No bituminous work will be
permitted when the surface to be covered is wet.
            2.   Bituminous binder shall be spread only after May 1 and before
October 1 except upon written consent of the Town Engineer, and no surfacing
shall be spread preparatory to oiling which cannot be completed before October
1.
            3.   Bituminous binder shall be sprayed upon the roadbed by means
of pressure spraying machines. The use of gravity distributors will not be
permitted. The distributors shall apply a uniform spread of oil over the width
covered by the sprayer. In order to ensure a uniform distribution of oil at the
junction of any two applications the distribution shall be promptly stopped
when a uniform flow of oil decreases, indicating that the tank is about empty.
If, in the application of oil, any spots are missed, oil shall be applied to
those spots by means which will ensure the application being made at the
specified rates. The uniform application of oil will be required and
distributors equipped with improperly spraying valves will not be allowed to
operate on the work.
            4.   The bituminous binder must be delivered at the point required
for spraying at a temperature not less than 300°F except for emulsion oil.
      (g)   Maintaining roadway. The contractor shall maintain the roadway
after it is opened to traffic until the final application of bituminous binder
is spread. All bituminous binder coming to the surface during that period shall
immediately be covered with chips. The pavement, when ready for final
acceptance, shall be thoroughly swept, compacted and the surface of the
pavement shall present a uniform bituminized appearance.

approved upon the findings that:
      (1)   The plat correction is in accordance with all applicable town

§ 14-3-2 OTHER REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Vehicular maneuverability. Parking required for each dwelling unit
must be independently accessible (i.e., required parking for one unit cannot
block access for parking for another unit on site).
   (B)   Surfacing. All parking areas shall be an improved paved surface.
Double track driveways are permitted.
   (C)   Heated drives. Any heated portion of the drive located within the
right-of-way must be in a separate zone. The four-foot concrete pan cannot be
heated.
   (D)   Snow storage. All required parking and access areas shall be designed
to accommodate on site snow storage (i.e., within boundaries of lot and not
within the right-of-way). Turf areas and other areas without trees may be
utilized for this purpose.
      (1)   Unheated drives. A minimum functional area equaling 30% of the
paved area shall be provided contiguous to the paved area and designed to
accommodate snow storage.
      (2)   Heated drives. A minimum functional area equaling 10% of the paved
area shall be provided contiguous to the paved area and designed to accommodate
snow storage.
   (E)   Guardrails. Steep slopes adjacent to vehicular accessways and/or
driveways without a proper shoulder may require the installation of a vehicular
guardrail. The design and type of vehicular guardrail for private properties
shall be designed by a registered Colorado professional engineer. Vehicular
guardrails on public roadways or protecting the travelling public shall meet
the standard of the Town of Vail.
   (F)   Location. Parking spaces, aisles and turning areas shall be entirely
within lot lines and shall not encroach on any public right-of-way. No parked
vehicle shall overhang any public right-of-way.
   (G)   Landscape and other improvements within or adjacent to the right-of-
way. All improvements and landscaping within or adjacent to the right-of-way
shall be subject to Town of Vail approval and shall require a revocable right-
of-way permit to be recorded with Eagle County. The improvements shall adhere

14-6-4 Construction fence
14-6-5 Erosion control
14-6-6 Floodplain standards
14-6-7 Retaining walls
14-6-8 Storm water quality permits
§ 14-6-1 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   (A)   This section provides a summary of grading standards within the Town
of Vail. All grading is subject to design review to determine compatibility
with existing topography, to review the extent of existing vegetation removal
and to preserve significant features on the site. The Administrator may require
grading plans to be stamped by a Colorado professional engineer (PE).
   (B)   All temporary grading shall be in compliance with currently adopted
OSHA standards. All permanent finished grades shall be at a maximum two to one
(2:1) (horizontal:vertical), unless otherwise approved by the Administrator and
providing that no grading exceeds one to one (1:1) and that any grading steeper
than two to one (2:1)(h:v) is designed and stamped by a Colorado professional
engineer.
(Ord. 27(2007) § 3)
§ 14-6-2 EXISTING VEGETATION.
   Grading around existing vegetation to be preserved on site shall be outside
the critical root zone, unless otherwise approved by the Design Review Board.
The critical root zone may be defined as a radius equal to one foot for each
inch of caliper measured one foot above the natural grade, or as defined by a
qualified arborist or landscape architect. A tree preservation plan developed
by a qualified arborist may be required by the Administrator.
(Ord. 27(2007) § 4)
§ 14-6-3 NATURAL FEATURES.
   Grading that is detrimental to existing natural features is discouraged.
Those areas of a site that are determined to remain in a natural state shall be
protected during construction. A site specific construction disturbance plan
shall be prepared, outlining the areas to be disturbed and the methods and
devices used to protect the remaining portions of the site.
(Ord., 9-21-1999)
§ 14-6-4 CONSTRUCTION FENCE.
   All areas to be protected shall have a nonremovable construction fence or
other approved device placed around the areas to be protected. Within the Vail
Village and Lionshead Core Areas, as defined by the Vail Village master plan
and Lionshead Redevelopment Master Plan, construction fence shall be six to
eight feet in height and constructed out of plywood (painted green) or
chainlink fence with green mesh windscreens. Decorative construction fences may
be allowed at the discretion of the Design Review Board.
(Ord., 9-21-1999; Ord. 29(2005) § 80)
§ 14-6-5 EROSION CONTROL.
   All sites with disturbances will need to provide erosion control measures
using best management practices. Sites greater than one acre or sites with
total disturbance greater than one-half acre shall provide an erosion control
plan prepared by a registered Colorado professional engineer.
(Ord., 9-21-1999)
§ 14-6-6 FLOODPLAIN STANDARDS.
   (A)   All modifications, grading or installation of proposed improvements
within the 100-year floodplain shall be in accordance with §
12-21-11 of this code.
   (B)   The floodplain line shall be determined by a registered professional
land surveyor by plotting the appropriate elevation of the floodplain on a
maximum one inch equals 20 feet topographic two foot-contour map using the
adopted Town of Vail flood profiles (the federal emergency management agency
flood insurance study). The topographic survey shall reveal the method for
determining the starting point and the starting elevation for the floodplain
delineation. A site specific study performed by a professional engineer per
FEMA guidelines and approved by the Town of Vail and FEMA may be required.
(Ord., 9-21-1999; Ord. 27(2007) § 5)
§ 14-6-7 RETAINING WALLS.
   (A)   General. All retaining walls are reviewed by the Design Review Board
or the Administrator to determine compatibility to the existing topography of
and the materials in use. Retaining walls shall not exceed an exposed face
height of six feet, except in the CH-1, CH-2, or CH-3 Districts, where
retaining walls shall not exceed an exposed face height of 15 feet. Within a
front setback, retaining walls shall not exceed an exposed face height of three
feet, unless related to access to or development of a structure on excessive
slopes (in excess of 30%). Retaining walls associated with a street located
within a public right-of-way or access to an underground covered parking
structure are exempt from these height limits but shall be approved by the
Design Review Board and shall meet the standards prescribed in §
14-10-3 .
   (B)   Height. 
      (1)   Retaining walls shall not exceed an exposed face height of six
feet, except in the H or H-2 Districts, where retaining walls shall not exceed
an exposed face height of 15 feet.
      (2)   In a front setback, retaining walls shall not exceed an exposed
face height of three feet, unless related to access to or development of a
structure on slopes in excess of 30%.
      (3)   Retaining walls associated with a street located in a public right-
of-way, or access to an underground covered parking structure are exempt from
these height limits.
      (4)   All retaining walls over four feet in height, measured from the
bottom of a footing to the top of wall as per the adopted Building Code, shall
be engineered and stamped by a licensed Colorado professional engineer, and
shall include engineered stamped plans, profiles, sections, details and
engineering analyses and calculations.
      (5)   All retaining walls in a public right-of-way over three feet in
height, measured from the bottom of a footing to the top of wall as per the
adopted Building Code, shall be engineered and stamped by a licensed Colorado
professional engineer, and shall include engineered stamped plans, profiles,
sections, details and engineering analyses and calculations.
      (6)   The height limit for retaining walls is based on the exposed height
of either a single or combined height of combination walls. If the batter
(slope of the face of the wall) is greater than one to one (1:1), the wall
shall be engineered and stamped by a licensed Colorado professional engineer,
and shall include engineered stamped plans, profiles, sections, details and
engineering analyses and calculations.
   (C)   Landscaping. To avoid excessive vertical expanses of retaining walls
and to provide visual relief in areas highly visible to the public, the Design
Review Board may require landscaping in front of walls and landscape benches
between walls.
   (D)   Location. Retaining walls shall be located at least two feet from
adjacent private property boundaries and at least ten feet from the edge of a
public street unless otherwise approved by the Design Review Board.
   (E)   Combination retaining walls. A retaining wall is considered a
combination wall if the upper wall falls within a prism defined as starting one
foot behind the face of the lower wall at the lowest finished grade line and
then back at a one and one-half to one (1.5:1) angle from the starting point.
The minimum bench of combination retaining walls shall be four feet. All
combination retaining walls shall be engineered and stamped by a licensed
Colorado professional engineer, and shall include engineered stamped plans,
profiles, sections, details and engineering analyses and calculations.

§ 14-6-8 STORM WATER QUALITY PERMITS.
   (A)   Purpose, intent and liability.
      (1)   Purpose. The preservation of wetland and water areas serves to
prevent water quality degradation of Gore Creek and its tributaries the natural
and several human-made ponds in the Town of Vail. Protection of ecosystems,
aquatic habitats and wildlife habitats, especially habitats for state or
federally designated threatened or endangered species, to preserve ground water
recharge functions, and preserve natural floodplain control.
      (2)   Intent. The intent of this chapter is to enhance the quality of
water in the town’s drainageways and subsequent receiving waters by
establishing requirements for storm water quality permits for construction and
development, to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation from leaving
construction activities within the town in order to protect the vital,
beneficial functions and values of wetlands, streams, riparian zones or areas
and water bodies within the town.
      (3)   Liability. Any person who undertakes or causes to be undertaken any
activity which involves disturbance of the land’s surface shall ensure that
soil erosion, sedimentation, increased pollutant loads and changed water flow
characteristics resulting from the activity are controlled so as to minimize
pollution of receiving waters. The requirements of this section are minimum
standards and a person’s compliance with the same shall not relieve such person
from the duty of enacting all measures necessary to minimize pollution of
receiving waters.
   (B)   Permit required.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful for any person to conduct any activity
resulting in the disturbance of any land areas within the riparian zone, or
resulting in a total disturbed area of at least one-half acre, without first
obtaining a storm water quality permit from the town. Total disturbed area
includes any land within a project that meets the definition of “disturbed
area”, whether or not such parcels are contiguous.
      (2)   Regardless of total disturbed area, the town may also require a
storm water quality permit in conjunction with the approval of a final
subdivision plat, conditional use permit, or development plan.
      (3)   The town may also require a storm water quality permit for a
disturbed area of less than one-half acre that is part of a larger common plan
of development.
      (4)   It shall be unlawful for any such person to fail to obtain a storm
water quality permit. Issuance of a permit by the Town of Vail does not exempt
the parties from obtaining any permits required by the State of Colorado or the
federal government.
   (C)   Permit application. Persons required to obtain a storm water quality
permit shall complete and file with the town an application on a form
prescribed by the town, in accordance with the requirements of this section
with the building permit application prior to the beginning of construction
activities.
      (1)   In support of the application, the applicant shall submit all
information required on the town’s form and any additional information
requested by the town.
      (2)   A separate application shall be required for each storm water
quality permit along with plans, specifications and timing schedules for all
earth disturbances.

      (14)   The bypass of treatment facilities is generally prohibited;
      (15)   Bulk storage structures for petroleum products and other chemicals
shall have protection so as to contain all spills and prevent any spilled
material from entering the MS4 or waters of the state;
      (16)   No chemicals are to be added to the discharge unless the State of
Colorado grants permissions for the use of a specific chemical and
documentation of which is presented to the town;
      (17)   Solids, sludge or other pollutants removed in the course of
treatment or control of wastewaters shall be properly disposed of in a manner
such as to prevent any pollutant from such materials from entering waters of
the state;
      (18)   All wastes composed of building materials must be removed from the
site for disposal in licensed disposal facilities. No building material wastes
or unused building materials shall be buried, dumped or discharged at the site;
      (19)   All discharges must comply with the lawful requirements of the
Town of Vail, and other agencies regarding any discharges of storm water to the
MS4 or waters of the state under their jurisdiction, including applicable
requirements; and
      (20)   Temporary soil erosion control facilities shall be removed upon
completion of all construction activities’ final stabilization, and earth
disturbance areas graded and stabilized with permanent soil erosion control
measures pursuant to the standards and specifications prescribed in the latest
revision of the storm water management plan guidance document prepared by the
CDPHE and in accordance with the permanent erosion control features shown on
the SWMP approved by the town.
   (I)   Site inspections. Inspections shall be completed on a form prescribed
by the town (e.g., CDOT’s inspection form as a template).
      (1)   Active sites. For sites where construction has not been completed,
the permittee and/or operator shall make a thorough inspection of their SWMP at
least every 14 days and after any precipitation or snowmelt event that causes
surface erosion.
         (a)   The construction site perimeter, disturbed areas and areas used
for material storage that are exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for
evidence of, or the potential for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWMP shall be observed
to ensure that they are operating correctly.
         (b)   Based on the results of the inspection, the description of
potential pollutant sources, and the pollution prevention and control measures
that are identified in the site’s SWMP shall be revised and modified as
appropriate as soon as practicable after such inspection. Maintenance and/or
modifications to control measures shall be completed in a timely manner, but in
no case more than seven calendar days after the inspection.
         (c)   The permittee and/or operator shall keep a record of inspections
on the project site at all times. Any incidence of noncompliance, such as
uncontrolled releases of mud or muddy water or measurable quantities of
sediment found off the site, shall be recorded with a brief explanation as to
the measures taken to prevent future violations, as well as any measures taken
to clean up the sediment that has left the site. After adequate measures have
been taken to correct any problems, or where a report does not identify any
incidents of noncompliance, the report shall contain a signed certification
indicating the site is in compliance. This record shall be made available to
the Town of Vail or State of Colorado upon request.
      (2)   Completed sites. For sites where all construction activities are
completed but final stabilization has not been achieved due to a vegetative
cover that has been planted but has not become established, the permittee and/
or operator shall make a thorough inspection of the SWMP at least once every
month. When site conditions make this schedule impractical, the permittee and/
or operator may petition the town to grant an alternate inspection schedule.
These inspections must be conducted in accordance with subsections (I)(1)(a),
(I)(1)(b) and (I)(1)(c) of this section.
      (3)   Winter conditions. Inspections, as described in subsection (I)(1)
(a) and (I)(1)(b) of this section, are not required at sites where snow cover
exists over the entire site for an extended period, and melting conditions do
not exist. The exemption is applicable only during the period where melting
conditions do not exist. Regular inspections, as described above, are required
at all other times.
   (J)   Reporting. No regular reporting requirements are included in this
section; however, the town reserves the right to request that a copy of the
inspection reports be submitted.
   (K)   Final stabilization.
      (1)   Final stabilization is reached when all soil disturbing activities
at the site have been completed, and uniform vegetation cover has been
established with a density of at least 70% of predisturbance levels, or
equivalent permanent, physical erosion reduction methods have been employed.
For purposes of this requirement, establishment of a vegetative cover capable
of providing erosion control equivalent to preexisting conditions at the site
can be considered final stabilization. The town may, after consultation with
the permittee and/or operator and upon good cause, amend the final
stabilization criteria for specific operations.
      (2)   Permanent soil erosion control measures for all slopes, channels,
ditches or any disturbed land area shall be completed within 14 calendar days
after final grading or the final earth disturbance has been completed. When it
is not possible to permanently stabilize a disturbed area after an earth
disturbance has been completed or where significant earth disturbance activity
ceases, temporary soil erosion control measures shall be implemented within 14
calendar days. All temporary soil erosion control measures shall be maintained
until permanent soil erosion measures are implemented.
   (L)   Retention of records.
      (1)   The permittee shall retain copies of the SWMP and all reports
required by this permit and records of all data used to complete the
application to be covered by this permit, for a period of at least three years
from the date that the site is finally stabilized; and
      (2)   The permittee shall retain a copy of the SWMP required by this
permit at the construction site from the date of project initiation to the date
of final stabilization, unless the town approves another location, specified by
the permittee.
   (M)   Change in discharge. The permittee shall inform the Town Engineer
within two weeks in writing of any intent to significantly change the
activities from those indicated in the permit application (this does not
include changes to the SWMP). Upon request, the permittee shall furnish the
town with such plans and specifications, which the town deems reasonably
necessary to evaluate the effect on the discharge and receiving water. The SWMP
shall be updated within 30 days of the changes. Any discharge to the waters of
the state from a point source other than specifically authorized in this
section is prohibited.
   (N)   Operation and maintenance requirements. The owner shall be responsible
for the maintenance of all permanent quality measures enacted pursuant to this
chapter. All temporary storm water quality control measures shall be removed
after work on the site has been completed and the measures are no longer
needed. Should any property owner fail to adequately maintain the permanent
storm water quality measures or remove the temporary measures, the town may,
after notifying the owner of the required maintenance and/or removal and the
owner failing to perform such maintenance and/or removal, enter the affected
property and perform or cause to be performed the required work and assess the
charge for such work against the property owner, in accordance with the
procedure set forth in subsections (Q)(1), (Q)(2), (Q)(3) and (Q)(4) of this
section, remedies for noncompliance.
   (O)   Transfer of permit. When the responsibility for storm water discharges
at a construction site changes from one owner to another, the permittee shall
submit a completed notice of transfer and acceptance of terms of a storm water
quality permit certification on a form prescribed by the town that is signed in
accordance with subsection (D)(1) of this section. If the new responsible party
will not complete the transfer form the permit may be inactivated and the new
owner shall obtain permit coverage separately.
   (P)   Inspections and right of entry. The permittee shall allow the Town
Engineer and/or an authorized representative:
      (1)   To enter upon the permittee’s premises where a regulated facility
or activity is located or in which any records are required to be kept under
the terms and conditions of the permit;
      (2)   At reasonable times to have access to and copy any records required
to be kept under the terms and conditions of this permit and to inspect any
monitoring equipment or monitoring method required in the permit; and
      (3)   To enter upon the permittee’s premises to investigate, within
reason, any actual suspected, or potential source of water pollution, or any
violation of the Colorado Water Quality Control Act. The investigation may
include, but is not limited to, the following: sampling of any discharge and/or
process waters; the taking of photographs; interviewing permittee staff on
alleged violations; and access to any and all facilities or areas within the
permittee’s premises that may have any effect on the discharge, permit or
alleged violation.
   (Q)   Remedies for noncompliance.
      (1)   Compliance orders. Whenever the town determines that any activity
is occurring which is not in compliance with a storm water quality permit and/
or the requirements of this title, the town may issue a written noncompliance
order to such person or permittee. The person or permittee shall submit a
written compliance schedule to the Town Engineer within five days. The schedule
shall contain specific actions the permittee/operator must complete, including
dates for the completion of the actions. It shall be unlawful for any person to
fail to comply with any compliance order requirement.
      (2)   Suspension and revocation of permit. The town may suspend or revoke
a storm water quality permit for violation of any provision of this section,
violation of the permit and/or misrepresentations by the permittee or the
permittee’s agents, employees, or independent contractors.
      (3)   Stop work orders. Whenever the town determines that any activity is
occurring which is not in compliance with an approved permit and/or the
requirements of this title, the town may order such activity stopped upon
service of written notice upon the permittee and/or operator responsible for or
conducting such activity. Such permittee and/or operator shall immediately stop
all activity until authorized in writing by the town to proceed. If the
appropriate permittee and/or operator cannot be located, the notice to stop
shall be posted in a conspicuous place upon the area where the activity is
occurring. The notice shall state the nature of the violation. The notice shall
not be removed until the violation has been cured or authorization to remove
the notice has been issued by the town. It shall be unlawful for any permittee
and/or operator to fail to comply with a stop work order.
      (4)   Civil proceedings. In case of any violation of any provision of
this title, or any amendment thereof, the Town of Vail may, at its discretion,
initiate civil proceedings, including injunction, mandamus, abatement,
declaratory judgment or other appropriate actions or proceedings, to prevent,
enjoin, abate, remove or otherwise correct any such unlawful condition. Civil
remedies provided for under this section are not exclusive and shall not
preclude prosecution for criminal violations under the provisions of this
section.
   (R)   Security requirements. As a condition for the issuance of a storm
water quality permit, applicants shall be required to provide security in the
form of cash escrow or an irrevocable letter of credit. The amount of the
security shall be based upon the estimated cost of the work required to ensure
compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit and requirements of this
section. In determining the cost of work, an administrative fee of 15% of the
escrow amount shall be included.
   (S)   Release of security. The security shall be released when the permit
has been inactivated upon the town’s determination that the permittee has
successfully completed all required work and met all other requirements of this
section.
   (T)   Assessment. If the permittee does not successfully complete all
required work or violates any requirement of the permit or this section, the
town may take corrective measures and charge the cost of such to the permittee.
Such costs shall include the actual cost of any work deemed necessary by the
town. If the total of such costs exceeds the security, the permittee shall be
responsible for payment of the remaining balance within 30 calendar days of
receipt of an accounting of such from the town.
   (U)   Establishment of fees. The Town Council shall, by resolution,
establish all fees and charges deemed necessary by the town to implement the
requirements of this section.
   (V)   Variances and exceptions. No permits shall be required for the
following:
      (1)   Agricultural use of land zoned rural residential;
      (2)   Grading or an excavation below finished grade for basements,
footings, retaining walls or other structures on plots of less than one-half
acre in size unless required otherwise under subsection (B)(3) of this section.
If ground water is encountered, the owner must contact the Town Engineer and
obtain a ground water discharge permit;
      (3)   Sites smaller than one-half acre which are not part of a larger
common plan of development or sale and which constitute an infill of an
established older development within the town;
      (4)   Where the applicant’s engineer or CPESC professional certifies in
writing that the planned work and the final structures or topographical changes
will not result in or contribute to soil erosion or sedimentation and will not
interfere with any existing drainage course in such a manner as to cause damage
to any adjacent property or result in the deposition of debris or sediment on
any public way, will not present any hazard to any persons or property and will
have no detrimental influence upon the public welfare or upon the total
development of the watershed; and
      (5)   Even though permits are not required under subsections (V)(1), (V)
(2), (V)(3) and (V)(4) of this section, those operations and construction
activities which are exempted from obtaining permits must comply with the rules
and regulations concerning grading and erosion specified in this section, and
shall provide appropriate controls to retain soil erosion on the construction
site.

§ 14-10-1 PURPOSE.
   This chapter provides the design review standards and guidelines for
development in the Town of Vail. Actions of the staff and the Design Review
Board shall be guided by the objectives prescribed herein, the Vail Village
Urban Design Considerations and Guide Plan and the Lionshead Redevelopment
Master Plan, and by all of the applicable ordinances of the town and by the
design guidelines in this chapter.
(Ord., 9-21-1999)
§ 14-10-2 GENERAL COMPATIBILITY.
   (A)   Structures shall be compatible with existing structures, their
surroundings, and with Vail’s environment. It is not to be inferred that
buildings must look alike to be compatible. Compatibility can be achieved
through the proper consideration of scale, proportions, site planning,
landscaping, materials and colors, and compliance with the guidelines herein
contained.
   (B)   Any building site in Vail is likely to have its own unique landforms
and features. Whenever possible, these existing features should be preserved
and reinforced by new construction. The objective is to fit the buildings to
their sites in a way that leaves the natural landforms and features intact,
treating the buildings as an integral part of the site, rather than as isolated
objects at odds with their surroundings.
(Ord., 9-21-1999)
§ 14-10-3 SITE PLANNING.
   (A)   The location and configuration of structures and accessways shall be
responsive to the existing topography of the site upon which they are to be
located. Grading requirements resulting from development shall be designed to
blend into the existing or natural landscape. Any cuts or fills shall be
sculptural in form and contoured to blend with the existing natural undisturbed
terrain within the property boundary.
   (B)   Building siting and access thereto shall be responsive to existing
features of terrain rock outcroppings, drainage patterns and vegetation.
   (C)   Removal of trees, shrubs and other native vegetation shall be limited
to removal of those essential for development of the site, those identified as
diseased, those essential for creating defensible space, and those found to
impact view corridors as further regulated by Title 12, Chapter 22 of this
code. Mitigation may be required for tree removal.
   (D)   All areas disturbed during construction shall be revegetated. All
landscaping within the identified limits of disturbance shall comply with §
14-10-8 of this code. If necessary, the Design Review Board may designate
allowable limits of construction activity and require physical barriers in
order to preserve significant natural features and vegetation upon a site and
adjacent sites during construction..

§ 14-10-4 ARCHITECTURAL PROJECTIONS, DECKS, BALCONIES, STEPS, BAY WINDOWS AND
THE LIKE.
   (A)   Architectural projections including eaves, roof overhangs, awnings,
louvers and similar shading features; sills, belt courses, cornices and similar
features; and flues and chimneys may project not more than four feet into a
required setback area or into a required distance between buildings.
   (B)   Porches, steps, decks or terraces or similar features located at
ground level or within five feet of ground level may project not more than ten
feet nor more than one-half the minimum required dimension into a required
setback area, or may project not more than five feet nor more than one-fourth
the minimum required dimension into a required distance between buildings.
Steps that form an exit discharge may project into a required setback area to
the degree necessary to conform with the adopted Building Code’s means of
egress standards, at the discretion of the Administrator.
   (C)   Balconies, decks, terraces and other similar unroofed features
projecting from a structure at a height of more than five feet above ground
level may project not more than five feet nor more than one-half the minimum
required dimension into a required setback area, or may project not more than
five feet nor more than one-fourth the minimum required dimension into a
required distance between buildings. A balcony or deck projecting from a higher
elevation may extend over a lower balcony or deck but in such case shall not be
deemed a roof for the lower balcony or deck.
   (D)   Fire escapes or exterior emergency exit stairways may project into any
required setback area or distance between buildings not more than four feet.
   (E)   Bay windows and similar features extending the interior enclosed space
of a structure may project not more than three feet into a required setback
area or a required distance between buildings, provided that the total of all
such projection does not exceed more than one-tenth the area of the wall
surface from which it projects or extends.
   (F)   Towers, spires, cupolas, chimneys, flagpoles and similar architectural
features not usable as habitable floor area may extend above the height limit a
distance of not more than 25% of the height limit nor more than 15 feet.
   (G)   A parapet or guardrail, transparent or otherwise, may exceed the
allowable building height by no more than 30 inches, subject to a finding of
the Design Review Board that the proposal meets the criteria enumerated in §
12-11-1.
(Ord., 9-21-1999; Ord. 29(2005) § 81; Ord. 8(2019) § 2)
§ 14-10-5 BUILDING MATERIALS AND DESIGN.
   (A)   Intent. The town is situated within the wildland urban interface where
community values intersect with the potential consequences of wildland fires.
Wildland fires both big and small have the potential to destroy homes and
neighborhoods within the town. The architecture and chosen materials of a
building greatly affect the survivability of that structure in the face of a
wildfire. The use of class A roof coverings and ignition resistant building
materials decrease the hazards to the individual structures as well as the
surrounding homes.
   (B)   Ignition resistant materials. The use of ignition resistant building
materials and designs intended to prevent the spread of fire are required. Vail
Fire and Emergency Services is available to provide more information on the use
of ignition resistant materials and designs. Predominantly natural building
materials shall be used in the town. The exterior use of wood, wood siding,
native stone, brick, concrete, stucco and EIFS may be permitted. Concrete
surfaces, when permitted, shall be treated with texture and color; however,
exposed aggregate is more acceptable than raw concrete. The exterior use of the
following siding materials is prohibited: stucco or EIFS with gross textures or
surface features that appear to imitate other materials, simulated stone,
simulated brick, plastic and vinyl.
      (1)   The exterior use of any building material, including those not
specifically identified by this section, shall only be permitted, unless
otherwise prohibited by this code, if the Design Review Board finds:
         (a)   That the proposed material is satisfactory in general
appearance, quality over time, architectural style, design, color, and texture;
         (b)   That the use of the proposed material complies with the intent
of this code; and
         (c)   That the use of the proposed material is compatible with the
structure, site, surrounding structures, and overall character of the town.
      (2)   This subsection of this section shall apply to the construction,
alteration, movement, repair, maintenance and use of any building, structure or
premises in the town, unless otherwise exempt by §
12-11-3(C)(5) of this code.
      (3)   Repair or replacement of 25% or less of a deck surface or support
structure is exempt from the ignition resistant requirements of this
subsection.
      (4)   Repair or replacement of twenty-five percent (25%) or less of a
building's exterior siding is exempt from the ignition-resistant requirements
of this subsection (B).
      (5)   Combustible siding, as defined in the town’s adopted Building Code,
may be used as long as it does not cover more than 33% of a given wall
(excluding windows, doors and other openings) and may not be within five (5)
feet of ground level. Combustible siding with a profile that may allow ember
intrusion such as wood shake or wood shingle is prohibited.
   (C)   Same or similar materials. The same or similar building materials and
colors shall be used on main structures and any accessory structures upon the
site. Translucent components of greenhouses shall be exempt from this
requirement.
   (D)   Colors. Exterior wall colors should be compatible with the site and
surrounding buildings. Natural colors (earth tones found within the Vail area)
should be utilized. Primary colors or other bright colors should be used only
as accents and then sparingly such as upon trim or railings. All exterior wall
materials shall be continued down to finished grade thereby eliminating
unfinished foundation walls. All exposed metal flashing, trim, flues and
rooftop mechanical equipment shall be anodized, painted or capable of
weathering so as to be nonreflective.
   (E)   Roof forms. The majority of roof forms within the town are gable roofs
with a pitch of at least four feet in 12 feet. However, other roof forms are
allowed. Consideration of environmental and climatic determinants such as snow
shedding, drainage, fire safety and solar exposure should be integral to the
roof design.
   (F)   Rooflines. Rooflines should be designed so as not to deposit snow on
parking areas, trash storage areas, stairways, decks and balconies, or
entryways. Secondary roofs, snow clips and snow guards should be utilized to
protect these areas from roof snow shedding if necessary.
   (G)   Regulations: All structures shall have Class A roof assemblies or
Class A roof covering materials, as defined by the Town's adopted building
code. The use of concrete tile, slate, metal, asphalt shingle, fiberglass
shingle, and built up tar and gravel roofing may be permitted. Metal roofing,
when permitted, shall not reflect direct sunlight onto an adjacent property and
shall be surfaced with a low gloss finish or be capable of weathering to a dull
finish. Metal roofing, when permitted, shall be of a heavy gauge and designed
to provide visual relief to the roof surface (including without limitation a
standing seam). Asphalt and fiberglass shingles, when permitted, shall be
designed to provide visual relief through texture, dimension and depth of
appearance. For purposes of this subsection (G), all parts of a mansard roof
are considered "roof" and shall comply with current roofing regulations. Wood
shake, wood shingles and rolled roofing are prohibited. Two-family dwellings
and multi-family dwellings shall have uniform roof covering materials, unless
the Design Review Board determines that the materials are compatible, are
integral to the architectural style of the structure, and different materials
do not share any ridges or planes, but may share a valley.
      (1)   Nonconforming structures. All structures that do not have a class A
roof assembly or class A roof covering material, or structures with wood shake
or wood shingles shall replace the roof covering as follows.
         (a)   Additions. All additions affecting roof area shall trigger
compliance of the roof structure of a single-family dwelling, a side of a two-
family dwelling, or the entire multiple-family dwelling, except for a onetime
exemption of up to 500 square feet of GRFA, occurring after February 6, 2007,
where any addition of roof area does not share a plane or ridge with the
nonconforming roof, and may only share a valley. The additional roof area shall
conform to roofing regulations, and shall be deemed compatible by the Design
Review Board.
         (b)   Two-family structures. Upon reroofing one side of a two-family
dwelling, the other side shall be required to be reroofed if the two sides have
roof systems that share ridges or planes. Different materials on each side of
the two-family dwelling may be permitted by the Design Review Board if the
materials are deemed compatible, integral to the architectural style of the
structure and share a valley or do not intersect.
         (c)   Developments with multiple structures. Upon reroofing a single
structure that is part of a multistructure project with conforming roof
covering materials that do not match existing materials, the conforming
materials shall be deemed compatible with the existing nonconforming materials
by the Design Review Board. Upon reroofing of additional structures in the
development, the materials shall match the approved conforming materials.
Should the matching material no longer be manufactured, a different material
may be permitted, should the materials be deemed compatible by the Design
Review Board.
      (2)   Applicability. The provisions of this subsection (G) shall apply to
new construction, reroofing, utilization of the 250 ordinance, per §
12-15-5 of this code, and all additions except those exempt, per §
12-11-3(C)(2) of this code.
      (3)   Roofing material. The use of any roofing material, including those
not specifically identified by this section, shall only be permitted, unless
otherwise prohibited by this code, where the Design Review Board finds:
         (a)   That the proposed material is satisfactory in general
appearance, quality over time, architectural style, design, color and texture;
         (b)   That the use of the proposed material complies with the intent
of the provisions of this code; and
         (c)   That the use of the proposed material is compatible with the
structure, site, surrounding structures, and overall character of the Town of
Vail.
   (H)   Rooftops. Rooftop heating and air conditioning equipment, large vent
stacks, elevator penthouses and similar features should be avoided; however, if
necessary, shall be designed to be compatible with the overall design of the
structure or screened from view of all adjacent properties. Rooftop antennas
shall not be permitted unless as allowed under a conditional use review as
specified within the zoning code.
   (I)   Solar energy devices.
      (1)   The intent of these regulations is to facilitate the installation
of alternative energy sources in Vail while minimizing visual impacts. Further,
these regulations are intended to limit the creation of an elevated perceived
roofline by solar energy devices.
      (2)   Solar energy devices should be installed on building facades and
roof planes and oriented for energy production, except as permitted by
subsection (I)(13) of this section. In Vail, optimal solar energy device
orientation for maximized energy production and adequate snow shed is typically
achieved by up to a 50 degree orientation.
      (3)   Solar energy devices shall be designed and placed in a manner
compatible and architecturally integrated into the overall design of the
building and site, with some flexibility granted for existing structures.
      (4)   Solar energy devices may be screened to minimize visual impact with
a false facade, roof plane or parapet walls integrated into the overall design
of the building.
      (5)   Solar energy devices may project not more than four feet into a
required setback area.
      (6)   Solar energy devices shall not be included in calculation of
building height.
      (7)   Solar energy devices should follow the slope direction of the roof
plane upon which it is mounted.
      (8)   Solar energy devices shall project no further from the building
facade or roof plane than the minimum distance necessary to achieve up to a 50
degree orientation. No portion of any solar energy device shall project more
than eight feet from the building facade or roof plane to which the solar
energy device is attached.
      (9)   When mounted to a roof plane with a pitch of three in 12 feet (3:
12) or steeper, solar energy devices shall extend no higher than one foot above
the ridgeline.
      (10)   When mounted to a roof plane, solar energy devices shall not
extend beyond the roof eave.
      (11)   Solar energy device framing, brackets and associated equipment
shall be black or a color that matches adjacent building surfaces. No
advertising shall be permitted on any solar energy device, framing, brackets
and associated equipment.
      (12)   Solar energy devices, framing, brackets and associated equipment
shall be maintained and kept in good repair, including repainting when
appropriate and other actions that contribute to attractive building
aesthetics.
      (13)   Solar energy devices may be ground mounted only when the Design
Review Board determines that the design or site planning of an existing
structure creates practical difficulties in mounting a solar energy device to a
building facade or roof plane to achieve energy production. Cost or
inconvenience to the applicant of strict or literal compliance with this
regulation shall not create a practical difficulty. Ground mounted solar energy
devices shall not be permitted in the required setback area. Ground mounted
solar energy devices shall count as site coverage. Site coverage is calculated
by measuring the footprint created by vertical projection from the energy
devices and associated hardware to the ground. Should ground mounted solar
energy devices be adjustable, site coverage shall be calculated for the
position that creates the greatest site coverage. Ground mounted solar energy
devices shall not exceed eight feet in height above grade. Ground mounted solar
energy devices shall be located and screened to minimize visual impact.
   (J)   Overhangs. Deep eaves, overhangs, canopies and other building features
that provide shelter from the elements are encouraged.
   (K)   Fenestration. Fenestration should be suitable for the climate and for
the orientation of the particular building elevation in which the fenestration
occurs. The use of both passive and active solar energy systems is strongly
encouraged.
   (L)   Duplexes. In no instance shall a duplex structure be so constructed as
to result in each half of the structure appearing substantially similar or
mirror image in design.
   (M)   Footings and foundation. Building footings and foundations shall be
designed in accordance with the minimum standards of the adopted Building Code.
Footings and foundations shall also be designed to be responsive to the natural
topography of the site, and shall be designed and constructed in such a manner
as to minimize the necessary amount of excavation and site disturbance.

§ 14-10-6 RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   The purpose of this section is to ensure that residential development
be designed in a manner that creates an architecturally integrated structure
with unified site development. Dwelling units and garages shall be designed
within a single structure, except as set forth in subsection (B) of this
section, with the use of unified architectural and landscape design. A single
structure shall have common roofs and building walls that create enclosed space
substantially above grade. Unified architectural and landscape design shall
include, but not be limited to, the use of compatible building materials,
architectural style, scale, roof forms, massing, architectural details, site
grading and landscape materials and features.
   (B)   The presence of significant site constraints may permit the physical
separation of units and garages on a site. The determination of whether or not
a lot has significant site constraints shall be made by the Design Review
Board. SIGNIFICANT SITE CONSTRAINTS shall be defined as natural features of a
lot such as stands of mature trees, natural drainages, stream courses and other
natural water features, rock outcroppings, wetlands, other natural features and
existing structures that may create practical difficulties in the site planning
and development of a lot. Slope may be considered a physical site constraint
that allows for the separation of a garage from a unit. It shall be the
applicant’s responsibility to request a determination from the Design Review
Board as to whether or not a site has significant site constraints before final
design work on the project is presented. This determination shall be made at a
conceptual review of the proposal based on review of the site, a detailed
survey of the lot and a preliminary site plan of the proposed structure(s).
   (C)   The residential development may be designed to accommodate the
development of dwelling units and garages in more than one structure if the
Design Review Board determines that significant site constraints exist on the
lot. The use of unified architectural and landscape design as outlined herein
shall be required for the development. In addition, the Design Review Board may
require that one or more of the following common design elements such as
fences, walls, patios, decks, retaining walls, walkways, landscape elements or
other architectural features be incorporated to create unified site
development.
   (D)   Exemption.
      (1)   Residential development meeting all the following criteria may be
exempt from the unified architectural and landscaping design requirement of
subsection (A):
         (a)   Existing separated duplexes (where two dwelling units share a
development lot but are not physically connected);
         (b)   That do not share a unified architectural and landscape design,
as determined by the Design Review Board; and
         (c)   That received Design Review Board approval prior to May 7, 2019.
      (2)   A registry of qualifying properties shall be kept by the Community
Development Department and made publically available.
      (3)   This section shall not exempt separated duplexes from any other
approval requirements of this code, including without limitation, §
12-11-3.

(Ord. 21(2008) § 1)
§ 14-10-8 LANDSCAPING, DRAINAGE AND EROSION CONTROL.
   (A)   (1)   Various natural vegetation zones exist within the Gore Valley as
a result of the form and aspects of the land itself. The north facing slopes
within the valley are typically heavily wooded with spruce, pine and aspen and
generally receive less direct sunlight than the drier south facing slopes which
typically consist of sage, aspen and other vegetation tolerant of drier
conditions. The valley floor which is adjacent to Gore Creek consists of a wide
variety of trees and shrubs adapted to the relatively fertile soil and natural
availability of water.
      (2)   The goal of any landscape plan should be to preserve and enhance
the natural landscape character of the area in which it is to be located and
serve as an aid in fire prevention and protection. The landscape scale and
overall landscape design shall be developed so that new vegetation is integral
with the natural landscape and the inherent form, line, color and texture of
the local plant communities. The major objective of the landscaping is to help
reduce the scale of new structures, to assist in the screening of structures,
to reduce the risk to life and structures from the intrusion of fire from
wildland fire exposure and fire exposures from adjacent structures, and to
mitigate structure fires from spreading to wildland fuels. The planting of
large-sized, well-spaced plant materials is encouraged. Fire wise plant
materials are required due to their ability to resist fire. Trees shall be
maintained through limbing and pruning in order to prevent limbs from being too
close to structures and other plant materials. Special care should be taken in
selecting the types of plants to use when designing a landscape plan. Final
selection should be based upon the soils and climate, ease of establishment,
suitability for the specific use desired, ability to deter the spread of fires
and the level of maintenance that can be provided. New planting shall use
plants that are indigenous to the Rocky Mountain alpine and subalpine zones or
are capable of being introduced into these zones.
      (3)   (a)   A recommended list of plant materials, some indigenous to the
Vail area, is on file with the Department of Community Development. Also
indicated on the list are fire wise plant materials which are suitable for
planting within the Vail area. The minimum sizes of landscape materials
acceptable are as follows:
         (b)   Required trees.
 
Deciduous       2 inch caliper
Conifers        6 foot
Required shrubs #5 gallon container Foundation shrubs shall have a minimum
                height of 18 inches at time of planting
 
   (B)   Landscape design shall be developed to locate new plantings in natural
looking groups and shall be designed and installed in conformance with the Vail
Fire and Emergency Services Fire-Resistant Landscaping guidelines, unless
exempted by §
12-11-3 of this code. Geometric plantings, evenly spaced rows of trees, and
other formal landscape patterns shall be avoided.
   (C)   Particular attention shall be given the landscape design of off-street
parking lots to reduce adverse impacts upon living areas within the proposed
development, upon adjacent properties, and upon public spaces with regard to
noise, lights, and visual impact.
   (D)   All landscaping shall be provided with a method of irrigation suitable
to ensure the continued maintenance of planted materials.
   (E)   Whenever possible, natural drainage patterns upon the site shall not
be modified. Negative drainage impacts upon adjacent sites shall not be
allowed.
   (F)   Runoff from impervious surfaces such as roofs and pavement areas shall
be directed to natural or improved drainage channels or dispersed into shallow
sloping vegetated areas.
   (G)   Slope of cut and fill banks shall be determined by soil
characteristics for the specific site to avoid erosion, and promote
revegetation opportunities, but in any case shall be limited to a maximum of
two to one (2:1) slope.
   (H)   Measures shall be taken to retain all eroded soil material on site
during construction, control both ground water and surface water runoff, and to
permanently stabilize all disturbed slopes and drainage features upon
completion of construction.
   (I)   All plants shall be planted in a good quality topsoil mix of a type
and amount recommended by the American Landscape Contractor Association and the
Colorado Nurseryman’s Association.
   (J)   All plantings must be mulched with materials as listed in the Vail
Fire and Emergency Services Fire-Resistant Landscaping guidelines, unless
otherwise exempt per §§
14-10-5(B),
12-11-3 of this code.
   (K)   Paving near a tree to be saved must contain a plan for a “tree vault”
in order to ensure the ability of the roots to receive air.
   (L)   Defensible space shall be created and maintained in an area extending
from the perimeter or projection of the building or structure to a radius of
100 feet or the lot lines, whichever is less. Defensible space and landscaping
shall comply with Vail Fire and Emergency Services Fire-Resistant Landscaping
guidelines.

§ 14-10-9 FENCES, HEDGES, WALLS AND SCREENING.
   (A)   Placement. The placement of walls and fences shall respect existing
landforms and fit into land massing rather than arbitrarily follow site
boundary lines. Fences shall not be encouraged except to screen trash areas,
utility equipment and the like.
   (B)   Design. Design of fences, walls, and other structural landscape
features shall be of materials compatible with the site and the materials of
the structures on the site. Retaining walls and cribbing should utilize natural
materials such as wood timbers, logs, rocks or textured, color tinted concrete.
No chainlink fences shall be allowed except as temporary construction fences or
as required for recreational facilities.
   (C)   Setbacks observed. All accessory uses and structures except fences,
hedges, walls and landscaping, or ground level site development such as walks,
driveways and terraces shall be located within the required minimum setback
lines on each site. Recreational amenities may be exempted by the Design Review
Board if it determines that their location is not detrimental environmentally
and/or aesthetically.
   (D)   Sight triangle. To minimize traffic hazards at street intersections by
improving visibility for drivers of converging vehicles in any district where
setbacks are required, no fence or structure over three feet in height shall be
permitted within the triangular portion of a corner lot measured from the point
of intersection of the lot lines abutting the streets a distance of 30 feet
along each lot line.
   (E)   Height limitations. Height limitations. Fences, hedges, walls and
landscaping screens shall not exceed three feet in height within any required
front setback area and shall not exceed six feet in height in any other portion
of the site, except in the Community Housing-1 (CH-1), Community Housing- 2
(CH-2), and Community Housing–3 (CH-3) Districts where retaining walls shall
not exceed an exposed face height of 15 feet. Higher fences, hedges, walls or
landscaping screens may be authorized by the Administrator when necessary to
screen public utility equipment. No barbed wire or electrically charged fence
shall be erected or maintained.

      (5)   Landscape plan (if applicable);
      (6)   An improvement location certificate and/or a preliminary title
report; and
      (7)   Elevations, perspectives or renderings if deemed applicable by the
staff of the Department of Community Development.
   (C)   Compliance with requirements.
      (1)   No more than one satellite dish antenna shall be allowed on any lot
as delineated on the official town zoning map.
      (2)   The temporary use and/or installation of a satellite dish antenna
shall be limited to a maximum period of one day. Only three temporary
installations shall be allowed per business or residence per year.
      (3)   The maximum height allowed for any satellite dish antenna, when
measured from the top of the satellite dish antenna down to existing or
finished grade, whichever is more restrictive, shall not exceed 15 feet.
      (4)   The maximum size of any satellite dish antenna installed for use by
a single residence or business shall be limited to nine feet in diameter.
Satellite dish antennas serving multi-family dwellings shall be limited to a
maximum of 12 feet in diameter.
      (5)   No advertising, logos or identification shall be allowed on any
satellite dish antenna.
      (6)   Satellite dish antennas shall comply with the existing setback
requirements of the zone district in which the satellite dish antenna is
installed. Satellite dish antennas shall be prohibited in easements and public
rights-of-way. No portion of a satellite dish antenna or its supporting
structure shall encroach into the vertical plane as drawn from an existing
easement or setback line.
      (7)   Issuance of a building permit from the Department of Community
Development shall be required prior to the installation of any satellite dish
antenna.
      (8)   Adjacent property owners and owners of dwelling units on the same
lot as the applicant shall be notified of any application for the installation
of a satellite dish antenna. Notification procedures shall be as outlined in §
12-14-19 of this code. Names and mailing addresses of adjacent property owners
and of owners of dwelling units on the same lot as the applicant shall be
provided to the Department of Community Development by the applicant.
      (9)   Due to the special aesthetic importance of the core areas of the
town, exterior installations of satellite dish antennas in Commercial Cores 1
and 2 and in Lionshead Mixed Use 1 and 2 shall be permitted only if screened by
some type of enclosing structure. Said structures required to enclose a
satellite dish antenna in these areas shall comply with all applicable zoning
regulations and shall be architecturally compatible with the existing
structure.
   (D)   Design guidelines. It is the purpose of these guidelines to ensure
that the visibility of a satellite dish antenna from any public right-of-way or
adjacent properties be reduced to the highest degree possible. It shall be the
burden of the applicant to demonstrate how the satellite dish antenna
installation complies with these guidelines. The following guidelines shall be
used by the Design Review Board in evaluating applications for satellite dish
antennas.
      (1)   All wiring and cable related to a satellite dish antenna shall be
installed underground.
      (2)   The use of mesh satellite dish antennas is highly encouraged
because of their ability to be more sensitively integrated on a site or
structure.
      (3)   The use of appropriate colors shall be required to provide for a
more sensitive installation when integrating a satellite dish antenna onto a
site or structure. Color selection for a satellite dish antenna should be made
with respect to specific characteristics on a site or structure. Unpainted
surfaces and satellite dish antennas with reflective surfaces shall not be
allowed.
      (4)   Locations of satellite dish antennas shall be made so as to ensure
that the satellite dish antenna is screened from view from any public right-of-
way or adjacent property to the highest degree possible. In addition to
effective site planning, screening a satellite dish antenna may be accomplished
through the use of landscaping materials, fencing, existing structures,
subgrade placements or other means that both screen the satellite dish antenna
and do not appear unnatural on the site.
      (5)   Satellite dish antennas on or attached to existing structures shall
be permitted provided the satellite dish antenna is architecturally integrated
into the structure. Effective use of color shall be required to ensure
compatibility between the satellite dish antenna and existing structure. The
use of a mesh material shall be strongly encouraged when attempting to
integrate a satellite dish antenna onto an existing structure.
      (6)   Landscaping or other site improvements intended to screen a
satellite dish antenna proposed on any application shall be completed prior to
the issuance of a building permit to install a satellite dish antenna. A letter
of credit equal to 125% of the costs of installing landscaping or site
improvements may be submitted to the town if seasonal weather conditions
prohibit the installation of landscaping or site improvements.
      (7)   All improvements required by the Design Review Board for the
purpose of reducing the visibility of satellite dish antennas shall remain in
place so long as the satellite dish antennas remain in place unless permission
to alter or remove said improvements is obtained from the Design Review Board.
All satellite dish antennas and all improvements required by the Design Review
Board to reduce the visibility of satellite dish antennas shall be adequately
maintained and repaired and shall not be allowed to become dilapidated or fall
into a state of disrepair.
