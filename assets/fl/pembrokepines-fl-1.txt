an original petition. If a petition or amended petition is certified sufficient
or if a petition or amended petition is certified insufficient and the
petitioners’ committee does not elect to amend or request Commission review
under subsection (b) of this section within the time required, the clerk or
other official designated by the Commission shall promptly present his
certificate to the Commission and the certificate shall then be a final
determination as to the sufficiency of the petition.
   (b)   Commission Review. If a petition has been certified insufficient and
the petitioners’ committee does not file notice of intention to amend it or if
an amended petition has been certified insufficient, the committee may, within
two (2) days after receiving the copy of such certificate, file a request that
it be reviewed by the Commission. The Commission shall review the certificate
at its next meeting following the filing of such request and approve or

for the vote. In order to overrule the Mayor, when calling for the vote or on

addressed by the City Commission which may require further consideration, as
well as those items tabled or awaiting Commission action.
   (B)   A City Commissioner may not reintroduce any discussion item that has
failed, due to lack of a second or lack of a majority vote, within the
subsequent six-month period, unless either an emergency exists and the public
business requires its reconsideration, or a City Commissioner who was on the
prevailing side of the prior City Commission vote, introduces the discussion
item for reconsideration. For purposes of this division, it shall take a 4/
5 majority vote to determine that an emergency exits which requires the
reconsideration of an item that has previously failed.
   (C)   The City Commission, by consensus or by majority vote, may suspend the
rules set forth in this section.
   (D)   The Mayor shall be subject to the same rules of procedure as the other

shall not interrupt other Commission members when they have the floor during
discussion and debate. Members of the City Commission may interrupt other
members to correct factual errors or mischaracterizations of a previously
presented viewpoint. When interrupting another member of the City Commission
pursuant to this division, the interrupting member shall request a "point of
clarification." Such a declaration shall cut off discussion and give the
interrupting Commissioner the floor for the limited purpose of correcting any
misstatements. Once such clarifications are presented, the floor shall
immediately return to the Commissioner who was interrupted.
   (F)   This section shall supersede Robert’s Rules of Order on any subjects
specifically addressed herein. On any matters not specifically addressed by
this section, Robert’s Rules of Order shall prevail.

circulation in the municipality. The notice of proposed enactment shall state

proposed ordinance.
   (D)   The City Commission may, by a two-thirds vote, enact an emergency
ordinance without complying with the requirements of division (C). However, no

rezone specific parcels of private real property or which substantially change
permitted use categories in zoning districts shall be enacted pursuant to the
following procedure:
      (1)   In cases in which the proposed rezoning or change in permitted use
involves less than 5% of the total land area of the municipality, the City
Commission shall direct the City Clerk to notify by mail each real property
owner whose land the municipality will rezone or whose land will be affected by
the change in permitted use by enactment of the ordinance and whose address is
known by reference to the latest ad valorem tax records. The notice shall state
the substance of the proposed ordinance as it affects that property owner and
shall set a time and place for one or more public hearings on such ordinance.
Notice shall be given at least 30 days prior to the date set for the public
hearing, and a copy of the notice shall be kept available for public inspection

Commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed ordinance and may, upon
the conclusion of the hearing, immediately adopt the ordinance.
      (2)   In cases in which the proposed ordinance deals with more than 5% of

public notice and hearings as follows:

pursuant to F.S. Chapter 50. Whenever possible, the advertisement should appear
in a newspaper that is published at least five days a week unless the only
newspaper in the community is published less than five days a week.
         (c)   The advertisement shall be in the following form:
      NOTICE OF ZONING (PERMITTED USE) CHANGE
   The         (name of local governmental unit) proposes to rezone (change the
permitted use of) the land within the area shown in the map in this
advertisement.

proposed ordinance and shall notify the person of the time, place, and location
of both public hearings on the proposed ordinance.
   (F)   A majority of the members of the City Commission shall constitute a
quorum. An affirmative vote of a majority of a quorum present is necessary to
enact any ordinance or adopt any resolution; however, two-thirds of the
membership of the Commission is required to enact an emergency ordinance. On
final passage, the vote of each member of the Commission voting shall be
entered on the official record of the meeting. All ordinances or resolutions
passed by the Commission shall become effective ten days after passage or as
otherwise provided therein.
   (G)   Every ordinance or resolution shall, upon its final passage, be
recorded in a book kept for that purpose and shall be signed by the Presiding
Officer and the City Clerk.
   (H)   The procedure as set forth herein shall constitute a uniform method
for the adoption and enactment of municipal ordinances and resolutions and
shall be taken as cumulative to other methods now provided by law for adoption
and enactment of municipal ordinances and resolutions. By future ordinance or
charter amendment, the city may specify additional requirements for the
adoption or enactment of ordinances or resolutions or prescribe procedures in
greater detail than contained herein. However, the city shall not have the
power or authority to lessen or reduce the requirements of this section or
other requirements as provided by general law.

APPOINTMENT PROCESS FOR CITY ADVISORY BOARDS AND COMMITTEES
§ 32.001 APPOINTMENT PROCESS.
   The City Commission shall follow the following process for the appointment
of regular members and alternate members to all city advisory boards and
committees other than the Charter Review Board, the Code Enforcement Board, the
city's Charter School Advisory Boards, the Police and Fire Pension Board, and
the River of Grass Arts Park Advisory Board. With respect to any advisory board
or committee created after the adoption of this section, the applicable
resolution or ordinance shall specify whether the processes as stated in this
section apply to the appointment of advisory board or committee members. (Ord.
1697, passed 9-7-11)
§ 32.002 COMPOSITION OF CITY ADVISORY BOARDS.
   Unless otherwise provided for in this chapter, all city advisory boards
shall be comprised of five voting members and two alternate members. The voting
members shall be appointed in accordance with the procedures set forth in §
32.004. The alternate members of all city advisory boards shall be appointed by
the Mayor. In the event of a vacancy on a city advisory board, the board's
alternate members shall not automatically fill the vacant position. The
Commission member from the district in which the vacancy occurred shall fill
the vacancy pursuant to this section. (Ord. 1697, passed 9-7-11)
§ 32.003 ELIGIBILITY OF CITY ADVISORY BOARD MEMBERS.
   Unless otherwise provided for in this code of ordinances or the Florida
Statutes, as may be amended from time to time, all members of the city's
advisory boards shall be residents of the City of Pembroke Pines. This section
shall not apply to the Economic Development Board. (Ord. 1697, passed 9-7-11)
§ 32.004 APPLICATION AND APPOINTMENT PROCESS.
   (A)   The City Commission shall request that individuals who meet the
qualification requirements for a specific advisory board and/or committee
submit an application for appointment to a specific advisory board. The City
Clerk shall provide notice of the request for applications for appointment to
the city's advisory boards and committees through notices posted at City Hall,
on the city's web site, on the city's cable television station, and in local
newspapers of general circulation. The form of the application shall be
approved by the City Commission by resolution, and be kept on file in the City
Clerk's office.
   (B)   Once all applications are submitted, the City Clerk shall provide
copies of all of the applications for each prospective member to the Mayor and
Commissioners for their review.
   (C)   The Mayor shall appoint one applicant to serve as a voting member of
each of the city's advisory boards. Each Commissioner shall appoint one
applicant who is a resident of their district to serve on each of the city's
advisory boards. If no applications are received from a particular district,
the Commissioner representing that district shall use reasonable efforts to
locate a resident within that district that is willing to serve. Such efforts
may include requesting the City Clerk to re-advertise the open position on a
particular advisory board. If no residents within a particular district are
willing or able to serve on a city advisory board, the Commissioner
representing that district may consider applicants from outside of the district
to fill the position on the advisory board.
   (D)   The Mayor and each City Commissioner shall provide the names of their
appointees to the city's advisory board to the City Clerk for placement on the
City Commission agenda. The Mayor and each City Commissioner shall announce
their appointees to the city's advisory boards at a public meeting of the City
Commission. No further action shall be required by the City Commission to
approve the Mayor or City Commissioners' appointees to the city's advisory
boards. (Ord. 1697, passed 9-7-11)
§ 32.005 TERMS OF APPOINTEES.
   Except where otherwise provided by, or inconsistent with, the City Charter,
general or special law, all appointees to advisory boards and committees shall
serve at the pleasure of the appointing member of the City Commission, or until
the appointing member of the City Commissioner vacates his or her office for
any reason.
   (A)   If the appointing member of the City Commission vacates his or her
office for any reason, the terms of the respective advisory board or committee
members appointed by the member of the City Commission shall terminate at the
time the new member of the City Commission appoints a replacement member to the
advisory board or committee.
   (B)   Upon certification of an election in which a new Mayor or City
Commissioner has been elected, the City Clerk shall notify all advisory board
and committee members appointed by the outgoing Mayor/ Commissioner of the
expiration of their terms.
   (C)   Best efforts shall be employed to ensure that membership of all city
advisory boards and committees will fairly represent the diverse population and
demographics of the city. (Ord. 1697, passed 9-7-11)

purposes of this section, an UNEXCUSED ABSENCE shall be defined as an absence
where the absentee board member did not notify the City Clerk, or his or her
designee, in advance of a meeting that they would not be able to attend the
meeting. If an advisory board member notifies the City Clerk, or his or her
designee, in advance of a meeting that they will not be in attendance, then the
absence shall be excused by the board. Each advisory board shall, at each
meeting, determine by majority vote whether a member's absence is excused or
unexcused.
   (B)   By virtue of this section any member of a board who is convicted of a
felony while a member of the board shall automatically forfeit their position.
Board members may also be removed for failing to meet the following attendance
requirements:

      (2)   Following the third unexcused absence, the secretary of the
respective board shall advise the City Clerk of the board member's third
unexcused absence. The City Clerk shall then advise the City Commission of the
board member's termination. No further action by the City Commission is
required in order for the board member's termination to become effective. As
soon as possible following the receipt of the notification from the City Clerk
that a vacancy exists on the respective board, the District Commissioner shall
appoint an individual to serve the remaining term of the terminated board
member.
      (3)   For the following city quasi-judicial advisory boards, a board

      (4)   Following the fourth unexcused absence, the secretary of the
respective board shall advise the City Clerk of the board member's fourth

board member's termination. No further action by the City Commission is
required in order for the board member's termination to become effective. As

appointments, and annually thereafter. A member of the board may be elected to
serve as an officer without restriction as to the number of terms served. The

§ 32.009 PROCEDURES; PUBLIC RECORDS, THE SUNSHINE LAW.

majority of the members of the Code Enforcement Board must vote in order for
the action to be official. The order shall include a notice that it must be
complied with by a specified date and that a fine may be imposed and, under the
conditions specified in F.S. § 162.09(1), all costs of repairs may be included
along with the fine if the order is not complied with by such date. Except when
such compliance is impracticable or impossible within a year, the order shall
provide that the date of such compliance be within one year of the date the
order is entered by the Code Enforcement Board. A certified copy of such order
may be recorded in the public records of the county and shall constitute notice
to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns if the
violation concerns real property, and the findings therein shall be binding
upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent
purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. If an order is recorded in the
public records pursuant to this subchapter and the order is complied with by
the date specified in the order, the Enforcement Board shall issue an order
acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the public records. A
hearing is not required to issue such order acknowledging compliance. (Ord.
668, passed 10-5-83; Am. Ord. 937, passed 11-7-90; Am. Ord. 1101, passed 10-2-
94; Am. Ord. 1173, passed 8-7-96; Am. Ord. 1697, passed 9-7-11)
§ 32.058 IMPOSITION OF FINE; LIENS.
   (A)   (1)   The Code Enforcement Board, upon notification by the Code
Inspector that an order of the Code Enforcement Board has not been complied
with by the set time or, upon finding that a repeat violation has been
committed may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this
section for each day the violation continues past the date set by the Code
Enforcement Board for compliance, or, in the case of a repeat violation, for
each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat
violation is found to have occurred by the Code Inspector. In addition, if the
violation is a violation described in F.S. § 162.06(4),(if the Code Enforcement
Officer has reason to believe that the violation presents a serious threat to
the public health, safety or welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or
irreversible), the Code Enforcement Board shall notify the local governing
body, which may make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the
property into compliance and charge the violator with all reasonable costs of
repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. If a finding of a
violation or a repeat violation has been made as provided in this section, a
hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine.
      (2)   (a)   A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed $250
per day for a first violation and shall not exceed $500 per day for a repeat
violation, and in addition, may include all costs of repairs pursuant to
subdivision (A)(1) above.
         (b)   In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the Enforcement
Board shall consider the following factors:
            1.   The gravity of the violation;
            2.   Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation;
and
            3.   Any previous violations committed by the violator.
         (c)   An Enforcement Board may reduce a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
      (3)   A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the
public records and there-after shall constitute a lien against the land on
which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned
by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court such order may be enforced
in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including
levy against the personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a
court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this
part shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until
judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this
section, whichever occurs first. After three months from the filing of any such
lien which remains unpaid, the Enforcement Board may authorize the City
Attorney to foreclose on the lien. No lien created pursuant to the provisions
of this section may be foreclosed on real property which is homestead under
Section 4, Article X of the State Constitution.
   (B)   No lien provided under this section, in accordance with F.S. Chapter
162, shall continue for a longer period than 20 years after the certified copy
of an order imposing a fine has been recorded, unless within that time an
action to foreclose on the lien is commenced in a court of competent
jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien, the prevailing party is
entitled to recover all costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that it
incurs in the foreclosure. The local governing body shall be entitled to
collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The
continuation of the lien effected by the commencement of the action shall not
be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration
without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded.
   (C)   A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in
favor of the local governing body, and the local governing body may execute a
satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section, as follows:
      (1)   Upon compliance with the Order of the Code Enforcement Board, and
payment in full of the amounts due to the city pursuant to a lien entered
pursuant to this section, the city shall provide a Release of Lien to the
property owner, which the property owner shall record at his or her expense.
      (2)   Should a Release of Lien Agreement provide for payment of a sum
that is less than the amount outstanding on the lien, such Agreement must be
approved by the City Manager prior to execution.
      (3)   The city’s Chief Code Enforcement Officer shall be permitted to
enter into a Release of Lien Agreement with a property owner prior to actual
compliance with an Order of the Code Enforcement Board to ensure proper
compliance with such Order.
         (a)   Any Release of Lien Agreement between the city and a property
owner pursuant to this section shall include, without limitation:
            1.   That any violations shall be corrected so as to comply with
the Order of Code Enforcement Board within a definite period of time;
            2.   That any amounts payable pursuant to the Agreement shall be
received by the city within a reasonable period of time after the violation is
corrected, but in no case shall such time exceed 30 days;
            3.   That any Release of Lien provided by the city shall be
recorded at the expense of the property owner; and,
            4.   That failure to comply with the terms of the Agreement
regarding the correction of violations and payment of sums due to the city
pursuant thereto shall render the Agreement null and void. (Ord. 668, passed

Act, as provided for in F.S. Chapter 162, amended, or by this subchapter, shall
prohibit the city from enforcing its code of ordinances and Charter by any
other means provided by law.
   (B)   The City Commission ratifies and embraces the legislative intention of

delivery by the Code Inspector.
   (B)   In the event notices are sent outside the geographical boundaries of

ALTERNATIVE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS
§ 32.063 COUNTY UNIFORM CODE CITATION FORM.
   The city hereby adopts the Broward County Uniform Code Citation Form,
attached to Ord. 1224 and hereby adopted by reference, which sets forth the
required data and information for each code enforcement officer of the city in
connection with those requirements imposed by F.S. § 162.21 (Part II) and known
as Supplemental County or Municipal Code or Ordinance Enforcement Procedures.
(Ord. 1224, passed 9-3-97; Am. Ord. 1697, passed 9-7-11)
§ 32.064 ALTERNATIVE CODE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM; SPECIAL MAGISTRATE.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. It is the purpose and intent of the City
Commission to establish special magistrate procedures for code enforcement
purposes, pursuant to F.S. Chapter 162, as amended from time to time. The
special magistrate(s) shall be selected by the city attorney and approved by
the City Commission. The special magistrate shall be a member in good standing
with the Florida Bar and engaged in the practice of law in Broward County.
   (B)   The city shall serve a notice of hearing to the violator in accordance
with the provisions of this article and F.S. Chapter 162, as amended from time
to time. No hearing shall be scheduled sooner than ten days from the date of
service unless there is a reason to believe that a violation presents a serious
threat to the public health, safety and welfare.
   (C)   F.S. Chapter 162, as amended from time to time, is hereby incorporated
herein by reference so that the provisions of that chapter, as amended from
time to time, shall be controlling with regard to the organization,
jurisdiction, procedures and powers of the special magistrate.
   (D)   At the conclusion of hearings, the special magistrate shall issue
findings of fact, based on evidence presented, and conclusions of law and shall
issue an order to include, but not be limited to, a specified compliance date
and a fine amount to be imposed if the order is not complied by the specified
date. In determining the amount of the fine, if any, special magistrate shall
consider the following factors:
      (1)   The gravity of the violation;
      (2)   Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and
      (3)   Any previous violations committed by the violator.
   (E)   A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the
public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which
the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the
violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in the
same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy
against the personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court
judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this part
shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until
judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this
section, whichever occurs first. After three months from the filing of any such
lien that remains unpaid, the special magistrate may authorize the local
governing body attorney to foreclose on the lien.
   (F)   Special magistrates are hereby authorized to conduct administrative
hearings, as required, for designated citations issued by code enforcement
officers.
   (G)   The city hereby adopts alternate code enforcement procedures pursuant
to F.S. §§ 162.03, 162.21 and 162.23, as amended from time to time, that
provide authority to code enforcement officers to issue citations and notices
to appear at a hearing conducted by a county court, and for code enforcement
officers to issue citations for administrative hearings to be heard by
designated special magistrates and assess fines against violators of the
respective codes and ordinances within the City of Pembroke Pines.
   (H)   Citations.
      (1)   Code enforcement officers and police officers shall have the
authority to initiate enforcement proceedings by issuing citations that may
require an appearance of the violator at an administrative hearing before a
special magistrate.
      (2)   A code enforcement officer who finds a violation of a code section,
pursuant to §
31.04, shall have the authority to serve a notice of violation to the violator
or property owner. Prior to issuing a citation, the code enforcement officer
shall provide a written notice to the person in violation or the property
owners that the person has committed a violation of a code or ordinance and
establish a reasonable period of time for the person to correct the violation.
Such time period shall be no more than 30 calendar days. If, upon personal
investigation, the code enforcement officer finds that the person has not
corrected the violation within the designated time period, the code enforcement
officer may issue a citation to the person who has committed the violation or
the property owner where the violation has occurred.
      (3)   The code enforcement officer is not required to provide the alleged
violator with a reasonable period of time to correct the violation prior to
issuing the citation if a repeat violation is found, or if the code enforcement
officer has reason to believe that the violation presents a serious threat to
the public health, safety or welfare, or that the violator is engaged in
violations of a itinerant or transient nature, or if the violation if
irreparable or irreversible. A repeat violation is a violation of a provision
of code or ordinance by a person who has been previously found in violation by
a code enforcement board, or any other quasi-judicial or judicial process, to
have violated, or who has admitted violating the same provision within five
years prior to the violation, notwithstanding the violations occur at different
locations.
      (4)   The citation form shall include, but not be limited to the
following:
         (a)   Date and time of issuance;
         (b)   Name of the code enforcement officer and jurisdiction;
         (c)   Name and address of the violator;
         (d)   Code section that has been violated;
         (e)   Brief description of the nature of the violation, including
location, date and time of violation;
         (f)   Amount of the applicable civil penalty;
         (g)   Procedure of the person to follow to pay the civil penalty, or
to contest the citation;
         (h)   Notice that if the person fails to pay the civil penalty within
the time allowed, and fails to appear in court (if assigned to County Court),
or if fails to request an administrative hearing within ten calendar days of
service (if case assigned to special magistrate), the person shall be deemed to
have waived their rights to contest the citation and that, in such case,
judgment may be entered up to the maximum civil penalty; and
         (i)   Notice that the person may be liable for reasonable costs of the
hearing should the violator be found guilty of the violation.
   (I)   Citation issued to appear before a special magistrate.
      (1)   The person who has been served with a citation to appear before a
special magistrate shall either correct the violation, and pay the civil
penalty in the manner indicated on the citation; or
      (2)   Request an administrative hearing before a special magistrate to
appeal the decision of the code enforcement officer. Said appeal shall be filed
not later than ten calendar days after the service of the citation.
      (3)   Failure of the violator to appeal the decision of the code
enforcement officer within ten calendar days shall constitute a waiver of the
violator’s right to an administrative hearing. A wavier of the right to an
administrative hearing may result in the imposition of a fine which may result
in a lien on the property where the violation occurred.
   (J)   The following table sets forth the code violation for which civil
penalties may be cited under this section. The descriptions of violations are
provided for purposes of general identification only. Where specific code
provisions apply, the same are indicated following the respective violation
description. Amendments affecting the numbering of the referenced sections
shall not affect the validity of the fines.

agreement with the city prior to the case being heard by the special
magistrate. Respondents found to be in compliance by the special magistrate

   (A)   As used in this subchapter, CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER means any
designated employee or agent of the city whose duty it is to enforce codes and
ordinances enacted by the city. For the purpose of this subchapter, the term
CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER shall be considered theequivalent of a code compliance
officer.
   (B)   The city may designate certain of its employees or agents as code
enforcement officers. The training and qualifications of the employees or
agents for such designation shall be determined by the city. Employees or
agents who may be designated as code enforcement officers may include but are
not limited to code inspectors, law enforcement officers, animal control
officers, park rangers, or fire safety inspectors.
Designation as a code enforcement officer does not provide the code enforcement
officer with the power to arrest or subject the code enforcement officer to the
provisions of F.S. §§ 943.085 through 943.255, as amended. Nothing in this
section amends, alters, or contravenes the provisions of any state-administered
retirement system or any state-supported retirement system established by
general law.
   (C)   (1)   A code enforcement officer is authorized to issue a citation to

provide notice to the person that the person has committed a violation of the
code or ordinance and shall establish a reasonable time period within which the
person must correct the violation. Such time period shall be no more than 30
days. If, upon personal investigation, a code enforcement officer finds that
the person has not corrected the violation within the time period, a code
enforcement officer may issue a citation to the person who has committed the
violation. A code enforcement officer does not have to provide the person with
a reasonable time period to correct the violation prior to issuing a citation
and may immediately issue a citation if the code enforcement officer has reason
to believe that the violation presents a serious threat to the public health,
safety, or welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible.
      (3)   A citation issued by a code enforcement officer shall be in a form
prescribed by the city and shall contain:
         (a)   The date and time of issuance.
         (b)   The name and address of the person to whom the citation is
issued.
         (c)   The date and time that the civil infraction was committed.
         (d)   The facts constituting reasonable cause.

penalty or to contest the citation.
         (h)   The applicable civil penalty if the person elects to contest the
citation.
         (i)   The applicable civil penalty if the person elects not to contest
the citation.
         (j)   A conspicuous statement that, if the person fails to pay the
civil penalty within the time allowed or fails to appear in court to contest
the citation, he shall be deemed to have waived his right to contest the
citation and that, in such case, judgment may be entered against the person for
an amount up to the maximum civil penalty.
   (D)   After issuing a citation to an alleged violator, a code enforcement
officer shall deposit the original citation and one copy of the citation with
the Broward County Court.
   (E)   The city is authorized to enforce its codes and ordinances under the
provisions of this section and by the enactment of this subchapter; the city
shall by this subchapter set forth procedures for the implementation of such
provisions, including a schedule of violations and penalties to be assessed by
code enforcement officers. If the city chooses to enforce codes or ordinances
under the provisions of this section, each code or ordinance or the ordinance
enacted by the city establishing procedures for implementation of this section
shall provide:
      (1)   That a violation of a code or an ordinance is a civil infraction.
      (2)   A maximum civil penalty not to exceed $500.
      (3)   A civil penalty of less than the maximum civil penalty if the
person who has committed the civil infraction does not contest the citation.
      (4)   For the issue of a citation by a code enforcement officer who has
reasonable cause to believe that a person has committed an act in violation of
a code or ordinance.
      (5)   For the contesting of a citation in county court.
      (6)   Such procedures and provisions as are necessary to provide for the
enforcement of a code or ordinance under the provisions of this section.

by a code enforcement officer shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second
degree, punishable as provided in F.S. §§ 775.082 or 775.083.
   (G)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to the enforcement
pursuant to F.S. §§ 553.79 and 553.80 of building codes adopted pursuant to
F.S. § 553.73, as they apply to construction, provided that a building permit
is either not required or has been issued by the city. For the purposes of this

   HARASSMENT. Often involving verbal abuse, including unwanted telephone
calls, involves acts or language by a party designed to damage or harm a second
party. Often this practice is initiated with the purpose of testing a person’s
“boundaries” but can evolve into more serious abuses. This behavior causes
emotional harm or distress to another.
   PHYSICAL ATTACKS. Unwanted or hostile physical contact with another person
such as shoving, pushing, hitting, fighting, throwing objects or worse, or any
other aggressive or unsolicited and unwanted contact occurring between two more
parties. By their nature, PHYSICAL ATTACKS often involve breaking criminal
laws.
   PROPERTY DAMAGE. Intentional damage to property, which includes property
owned by the city, employees, or others. Violent people sometimes express their
aggression in acts of property damage, crime, sabotage, theft, or destruction.
   THREATS. The expression of an intent to cause physical or mental harm
regardless of whether the person communicating the threat has the present
ability to carry out the threat and regardless of whether the threat is
contingent, conditional, or future. THREATS are significant because they may
precede actual acts of violence. By their nature threats, which include
incidents of stalking, often involve breaking criminal laws.
(Res. 2524, passed 12-10-97)
§ 33.72 PREVENTION OF WORKPLACE VIOLENCE.
   (A)   The city strongly subscribes to the concept of a safe work environment
and supports the prevention of workplace violence. Prevention efforts include
but are not limited to informing employees of this policy, instructing
employees regarding the dangers of workplace violence, communicating the
sanctions imposed for violating this policy, and providing a reporting
hierarchy within which to report incidents of violence, or threats of violence,
without fear of reprisal.
   (B)   The department head or his/her designee will orient all new employees
to department procedures regarding reporting incidents of violence, what to do

§ 33.73 REPORTING THREATS - INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL.
   (A)   Internal. Any employee who becomes aware of an incident of violent
behavior, whether the incident is committed by another employee or an external
individual such as a customer, vendor, or citizen must:
      (1)   Report such incident to the department head. Management will assess
and investigate the incident and determine the appropriate action to be taken.
Department heads will inform the personnel department of all reported incidents

family members, friends, or neighbors that can sometimes escalate to the point
that injunctions, restraining orders, and other court orders are sought. We,
therefore, request that employees include their work locations, as well as
their place of residence, in that court order. To provide for the safety of the
employee and others, we suggest that employees notify their supervisor and the
police department of the issuance of such a court order and provide a
description of the individual cited in the court order.
      (2)   In the case wherein an employee has not secured a court order but
fears for his/her safety, we ask the employee to notify his/her supervisor and
the Police Department as stated above in division (A).

investigate reported incidents and recommend to the City Manager any actions to
be taken as a result of the investigation.
   (B)   The Threat Management Team is responsible for establishing the
protocol in the event of a threat or violent incident that may include but is
not limited to:
      (1)   Evaluating potential violence problems.
      (2)   Assessing an employee’s fitness for duty through medical

      (7)   Assuring that immediate, within 24 hours, and on-going counseling
is available to traumatized individuals.

violent behavior will not be subject to any form of retaliation or harassment.
Any action of this type resulting from a report of violence must be reported to
the appropriate management staff for investigation and decision regarding
proper action.
(Res. 2524, passed 12-10-97)
§ 33.75 EARLY WARNING SIGNALS.

employee to keep any appointments with the EAP may result in disciplinary
action up to and including termination.

violence, the Threat Management Team or other authorized city management
representative may offer the services of the EAP to assist in coping with any

§ 34.04 EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FOR MARRIED COUPLES.
   The city shall provide equal employment benefits to all couples, regardless

of America or any other jurisdiction under which such marriage is legally
recognized. (Ord. 1778, passed 6-3-14)
§ 34.05 THE PEMBROKE PINES DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP ACT.
   (A)   The section may be cited as the “The Pembroke Pines Domestic
Partnership Act.”
   (B)   Findings and intent.
      (1)   The City Commission finds that there are many individuals who
establish and maintain a significant personal, emotional and economic
relationship with another individual but who choose not to marry. Individuals
forming such domestic partnerships often live in a committed family
relationship. Domestic partners are often denied public and private sector
benefits because there is no established system for such relationships to be
registered and/or recognized. In addition, because of the status of their
relationship, domestic partners in many cases are not extended certain
employment benefits that are otherwise made available to employees who have
entered into traditional, state-sanctioned marriages.
      (2)   The City Commission finds that the provision of domestic partner
benefits promotes employee recruitment, employee retention, and employee
loyalty.
      (3)   The provision of this section shall be liberally construed to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens,
residents and employees of the city. This act shall not be construed to
supersede any federal, state or city laws or regulations, nor shall this
section be interpreted to bring it into conflict with federal, state or city
laws. Any rules developed to implement the provisions of this section shall be
liberally construed to accomplish the policies and purposes stated in this
section.
   (C)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.

Pines employee benefit program.
      DEPARTMENT.  The City of Pembroke Pines Human Resources Department.

partners; it is not necessary that the legal right to possess the place of

return.

      (1)   A valid domestic partnership relationship may be registered by two
persons, one of whom is a city employee by filing a declaration of domestic
partnership with the Department, which declaration shall comply with all
requirements for establishing such domestic partnership. The director of the
Department, or his or her designee, shall file the declaration of domestic
partnership and issue a certificate reflecting the registration of the domestic
partnership relationship in city.
      (2)   A declaration of domestic partnership shall contain the name and
address of each domestic partner, the signature of each partner, and each

contract;
         (b)   Neither person is in a current marriage recognized by the State

      (1)   Either partner to a registered domestic partnership relationship
may terminate such relationship by filing a notarized declaration of
termination of domestic partnership relationship with the Department. The

of termination of domestic partnership relationship to each partner of the
former relationship. The termination shall become effective immediately from
the date the certificate of termination is issued.

cease as of the effective date of the marriage. The marrying domestic partner
shall file a declaration terminating the domestic partnership relationship
within five days after entering into a legal marriage that is recognized by the
State of Florida.
      (3)   The death of either domestic partner shall automatically terminate
the domestic partnership relationship. The surviving partner shall continue to
be entitled to receive all benefits otherwise provided to a surviving spouse.
   (F)   Maintenance of records. The Department shall, by administrative rule,
prescribe the form of all declarations, amendments, and certificates required
to be filed under this section. The Department shall maintain a record of all
declarations, amendments, and certificates filed pursuant to this act. The
records shall be maintained so that all declarations, amendments, and
certificates shall be filed with the registered domestic partnership to which
they apply.
   (G)   City employees; extension of benefits.

system of the city on account of employees of the Fire and Police Departments
who are eligible for membership in this system on February 19, 1981 and who
elect to become members according to the terms of this subchapter. The funds to
be transferred, together with interest thereon to the date of transfer, shall
be credited against the city’s liability for creditable service prior to
February 19, 1981 of persons who become members of the system created by this
subchapter.
   (B)   The city shall, in lieu of any other annual prior service payments set
forth, pay into this Fund, in payments no less than quarterly, the amount that
is actuarially determined to be necessary to amortize the unfunded prior
service liability for all benefits provided for under this subchapter, at a
uniform rate, over a period not exceeding 40 years. So long as this system is
in effect, the city shall make quarterly contributions for the year plus state
contributions for the year and the amount necessary for the year to maintain
the system on a sound actuarial basis as shown by the most recent actuarial
valuation report. The total cost of any year shall be defined as the total of
normal cost plus the additional amount sufficient to amortize the accrued past
service liability over a 40-year period on October 1, 1990.
   (C)   Member contributions shall be deposited to the Fund each pay period.
      (1)   The member contribution shall be equal to 10.4% of the annual
earning of the eligible employees.
      (2)   Effective October 1, 2015, the contribution for police officer
members hired on or after May 1, 2010 will be reduced from 10.4% to 7.0% of the
annual earnings of such eligible police officer members.
   (D)   Any monies received or receivable by reason of laws of the state, for
the purpose of providing for and funding of benefits for firefighters and
police officers of the city shall be deposited immediately and in no event more
than five days after receipt, in the Trust Fund comprising part of the system.
   (E)   There shall be an actuarial valuation prepared by the actuary at least
every three years. The city shall make adjustments in its contributions as
shall be shown to be required by obligations of this Pension Fund, over and
above the personal contributions forthcoming from the members, which are
declared to be the liability and obligation of the city.
   (F)   Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to prevent the City
Commission from appropriating monies from the General Funds or from any Special
Funds of the city. Furthermore, the city shall have the right and power to
designate the sources of revenue from the Pension Fund created by this
subchapter, including certain fines and forfeitures for violations of the city
ordinances. No monies raised by taxation or otherwise provided for the Pension
Fund shall be used other than for the purpose of this subchapter.
   (G)   The city and the unions that represent members have entered into
mutual agreements regarding the use of Insurance Premium Tax Revenue (“IPTR”)
as required by the Chapter No. 2015-39. Laws of Florida such that all IPTR,
whether base premium tax revenue or additional premium tax revenue, received by
the city will be used to reduce the city’s annual required contribution to the
City Pension Fund for Firefighters and Police Officers.

member with interest to date.
   (B)   Any other police officer or firefighter shall be eligible to become a

shall be permitted on a uniform, nondiscriminatory basis and on compliance with
the provisions of (B) above. In no circumstances shall re-entry of any member
result in duplication of benefits or rights.

uniform, nondiscriminatory basis.

§ 34.43 NORMAL RETIREMENT.
   (A)   Eligibility for retirement under this section shall be defined as
“Normal Retirement Status.” A member may elect to retire as follows:
      (1)   On the first day of any month if coincident with, following with,
or following the attainment of his or her fiftieth birthday and completion of
20 years of continuous service;
      (2)   Effective on or after March 12, 1999, on the first day of any month
coincident with or following the attainment of his or her fifty-fifth birthday
and completion of 10 years of continuous service;
      (3)   For an employee who is eligible to and becomes a member as of
February 19, 1981, on the attainment of his or her fifty-fifth birthday,
regardless of the number of years of continuous service;
      (4)   For a police officer member, after completion of 20 years of
continuous service regardless of age;
      (5)   Effective on or after October 1, 2000, for a police officer member,
on the attainment of his or her fiftieth birthday and completion of 10 years
continuous service;
      (6)   Effective on or after December 15, 1999, for a firefighter member,
after completion of 20 years of continuous service regardless of age;
      (7)   Effective on or after December 15, 1999, for firefighter members,
on the first day of any month coincident with or following the attainment of
his or her fiftieth birthday and completion of 10 years of continuous service.
      (8)   Effective March 17, 2004, a police officer member who has completed
16 years of service, but no more than 20 years of service, may purchase an
increase to the benefit multiplier to achieve a final retirement benefit not to
exceed 80% of his or her average monthly earnings. Payment for such increase in
the multiplier may be made, at the member’s option, by a lump sum payment,
direct in-service transfer from a member’s deferred compensation account
pursuant to Section 457(e)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code, or periodic
payments bearing interest at the Plan’s actuarially assumed rate of return made
according to an installment payment schedule approved by the Board of Trustees,
or a combination of the foregoing. Credit shall be awarded only for that
service purchased and only upon receipt of payment. Credit for purchased
service shall only be awarded upon the member’s vesting. If the member
separates from service with the city prior to vesting, all monies paid towards
the purchase of such service shall be refunded to the member.
   (B)   A member retiring hereunder on his normal retirement date shall
receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on his normal retirement date
and be continued thereafter during his lifetime. Effective only for
terminations on or after March 12, 1999, in the event that the member dies
after retirement but before receiving retirement benefits for a period of 120
months, 100% of the member’s benefit will be paid to his beneficiary for the
balance of the 120-month period. Upon his death, or, if applicable, expiration
of the 120-month guarantee period, the full retirement benefit shall be
continued to his spouse for one year and 50% of the amount continued thereafter
until spouse’s death.
   (C)   As of November 4, 1992, the amount of the benefit shall be 3% of
average monthly earnings for the highest two years of continuous service
multiplied by years of continuous service, subject in any event to a maximum of
80% of average monthly earnings for the highest two years of continuous
service. However, members as of February 19, 1981 shall receive at their normal
retirement date (age 55, regardless of years of continuous service) the greater
of the benefit provided by the formula above or 50% of average monthly earnings
for the highest two years of continuous service. In any event, effective as of
March 12, 1999, the benefit cannot be less than 2% of average monthly earnings
for each year of continuous service.
   (D)   (1)   As of October 1, 2000, the amount of the benefit multiplier for
all police officer members shall increase to 4% for every year after the
member's twentieth anniversary of participation in the pension system up to a
maximum benefit as provided in §
34.43(C) of the Code of Ordinances. For police officer members hired prior to
May 1, 2010, the benefit multiplier for all continuous service earned after
April 30, 2010 shall be 3.5% and the maximum benefit shall be 80% of the police
officer's average monthly earnings for the member's highest two years of
continuous service.
      (2)   For police officer members hired after April 30, 2010, the benefit
multiplier for all continuous service shall be 3% and the maximum benefit shall
be 80% of the police officer's average monthly earnings for the member's
highest two years of continuous service.
   (E)   Retired police officers, and those disabled police officers receiving
a benefit pursuant to §
34.46 prior to October 1, 2006, or their beneficiaries, may be eligible to
receive a supplemental pension distribution, the amount of which shall be
determined as of September 30 each year. For police officer members who retired
prior to October 1, 2003, the amount of the distribution shall be equal to the
actuarial present value of future pension payments to such police office
retirees, multiplied by the positive difference, if any, between the investment
rate of return and 8%, up to a maximum of 2%, divided equally among all police
officer retirees determined by their years of service. For police officer
retirees who retire on or after October 1, 2003 but before October 1, 2006, or
their beneficiaries, the amount of the distribution shall be equal to the
actuarial present value of future pension payments to such police officer
retirees multiplied by the positive difference, if any, between the investment
rate of return and 9%, up to a maximum of 2%, divided equally among all such
police officer retirees determined by their years of service. No supplemental
benefit shall be available for members who retire, enter the DROP or are
disabled on or after October 1, 2006 or their beneficiaries. The determination
of whether there may be a supplemental pension distribution shall be based upon
the following factors:
      (1)   The actuary for the Pension Fund shall determine the rate of
investment return earned on the pension fund assets during the 12 month period
ending each September 30 and shall be the rate reported in the most recent
actuarial report.
      (2)   The actuary for the Pension Fund shall, as of September 30,
determine the actuarial present value of future pension payments to current
police officers.
      (3)   The supplemental pension distribution amount shall not exceed
accumulated net actuarial experience from all pension liabilities and assets.
      (4)   If there shall be a supplemental distribution, the Board of
Trustees shall authorize a supplemental pension distribution, unless the
administrative expenses of distribution exceed the amount available for
distribution.
      (5)   The eligible persons to receive a supplemental distribution are
retired police officers, including retired police officers participating in the
DROP, and their beneficiaries.
      (6)   The supplemental pension distribution shall be allocated among
eligible persons, based upon years of service in the proportion that the
eligible person’s years of service bear to the aggregate amount of years of
service of all eligible persons.
      (7)   Each eligible person retired for less than a year is entitled to a
pro rata share of their supplemental pension distribution based on the number
of months retired. Such pensioner’s beneficiary is entitled to a pro rata share
of the deceased retiree’s supplemental pension distribution for that year based
on the number of months that the deceased retiree received a pension during the
year ending the September 30 prior to the retiree’s death.
      (8)   For members who participate in the DROP as provided in §
34.43, the supplemental pension distribution, if distributed, shall be
deposited in the member’s DROP account during their term of participation in
the DROP.
   (F)   Retired police officer members entitled to receive a supplemental
check pursuant to §
34.43(E) and who are not receiving a cost of living adjustment to their
retirement benefit as of October 1, 2006 shall have a one time opportunity to
make an irrevocable election to retain the right to continue to receive the
supplemental check pursuant to §
34.43(E) or an annual 2% cost of living increase to their retirement benefit in
lieu of such supplemental check. The election must be made by December 31,
2006. If the retired member elects the cost of living adjustment such election
shall apply retroactively to October 1, 2004.
   (G)   Police officer members who retired before October 1, 2006 or who are
DROP participants as of October 1, 2006, who are entitled to receive a
supplemental check pursuant to §
34.43(E) and an annual 1.5% cost of living adjustment to their retirement
benefit shall have a one time opportunity to make an irrevocable election to
either retain the right to receive the supplemental check pursuant to §
34.43(E) and the annual 1.5% cost of living adjustment to their retirement
benefit or elect the option of receiving an annual 2.5% cost of living
adjustment in lieu of the supplemental check and the annual 1.5% cost of living
adjustment. This election must be made by December 31, 2006. If the retired
member elects the increased annual cost of living adjustment in lieu of the
right to receive the supplemental check as provided in §
34.43(E), the cost of living adjustment shall apply retroactively to October 1,
2004.
   (H)   Effective April 1, 2005 and April 1 of each year thereafter,
firefighter retirees, their beneficiaries and DROP participants who were
receiving benefits or enrolled in the DROP on June 18, 2003 will receive either
a 2% increase to their retirement benefit or an adjustment equal to the total
percentage increase in base wages, excluding performance or merit adjustments,
provided in the collective bargaining agreement to bargaining unit members, for
the city fiscal year commencing the preceding October 1, whichever is greater.
This increase shall be applied to all monthly benefit payments for all
participants (including retirees and DROP participants) and beneficiaries who
were receiving benefits for at least one year prior to June 18, 2003. For those
receiving benefits for less than one year prior to June 18, 2003, the increase
shall be prorated. Members retiring or entering the DROP after June 18, 2003
will not receive annual adjustments to their benefits unless they elect the
optional benefit set forth in §
34.52(D).
   (I)   Effective October 1, 2009, and October first of each year thereafter,
police retirees who retired or entered the DROP on or after October 1, 2003, or
their beneficiaries, will receive a 1.5% increase to their retirement benefit.
Effective October 1, 2009, and October first of each year thereafter, police
retirees who retired or entered the DROP on or after October 1, 2006, or their
beneficiaries, will receive a 3.0% increase to their retirement benefit. This
increase shall be applied to all monthly benefit payments for all participants
(including retirees and DROP participants) and beneficiaries who were receiving
benefits for at least one year from March 17, 2004. For those receiving
benefits for less than one year from March 17, 2004, the annual increase shall
be prorated.
   (J)   All firefighter members hired on or after April 1, 2006 will have the
retirement benefit calculated to equal 4%, rather than the 3% set forth in
division (C) of this section for continuous service prior to May 1, 2010, of
average monthly earnings for the highest two years of continuous service
multiplied by years of continuous service, subject in any event to a maximum of
80% of average monthly earnings for the highest two years of continuous
service, but in no event shall the benefit exceed 98% of average monthly
regular wages.
   (K)   For all firefighter members, effective May 1, 2010:
      (1)   If a firefighter member was hired on or prior to June 18, 2003, the
benefit multiplier shall be 4% for each year of continuous service accrued
prior to May 1, 2010 and the benefit multiplier shall be 3.5% for each year of
continuous service accrued on or after May 1, 2010. The firefighter shall be
eligible to retire or enter the DROP, as set forth in §
34.52. upon reaching a benefit of 80% of average earnings; attainment of age 50
with a minimum of ten years of continuous service; or upon completion of 20
years of service regardless of age. If the firefighter's service with the city
terminates prior to the earlier of: (1) reaching age 50 with at least ten years
of continuous service, or (2) completion of 20 years of continuous service
regardless of age, the firefighter's benefit multiplier for each year of
creditable service shall be reduced to 3%, and the ten year vesting requirement
shall continue to apply. By way of example only, a firefighter member hired at
age 35 after June 18, 2003, would have been eligible to retire at age 50 with
15 years of credited service with a 4% multiplier resulting in a benefit equal
to 60% of earnings. The same employee would remain eligible for active
participation until such 60% benefit is achieved with the reduced multiplier of
3.5% for credited service earned after April 30, 2010.
      (2)   If a firefighter member is hired after June 18, 2003, and prior to
May 1, 2010, the benefit multiplier shall be 4% for each year of continuous
service accrued prior to May 1, 2010, and the benefit multiplier shall be 3.5%
for each year of continuous service accrued on or after May 1, 2010. The
firefighter shall remain eligible to be an active employee of the city until
such time as the firefighter's benefit equals the maximum benefit the
firefighter would have been entitled to under the provisions of the Plan in
effect prior to April 30, 2010. (By way of example only, a firefighter member
hired at age 35 after June 18, 2003 would have been eligible to retire at age
50 with 15 years of credited service with a 4% multiplier resulting in a
benefit equal to 60% of earnings. The same employee would remain eligible for
active participation until such 60% benefit is achieved with the reduced
multiplier of 3.5% for credited service earned after April 30, 2010.) The
firefighter is eligible to retire or enter the DROP upon reaching the maximum
benefit calculated in accordance with the preceding sentence or attainment of
age 50 with a minimum of ten years of continuous service. If the firefighter's
service with the city is terminated prior to reaching the earlier of: (1) age
50 with at least ten years of continuous service; or (2) completion of 20 years
of service regardless of age, the firefighter's benefit multiplier for each
year of creditable service shall be reduced to 3% and the ten-year vesting
requirement shall continue to apply.
      (3)   If a firefighter member is hired after April 30, 2010, the amount
of the benefit multiplier shall be 3% of average monthly earnings for the
highest two years of continuous service and the maximum benefit shall be 80% of
the firefighter's average monthly earnings for the highest two years of
continuous service.
   (L)   Police officers actively employed by the City on April 30, 2010, who
retire or enter the DROP on or after May 1, 2010, or their beneficiaries, shall
receive a 2% cost-of-living adjustment to their retirement benefit on October
1, 2010 and on each October 1 thereafter. Police officers hired on or after May
1, 2010 who retire or enter the DROP, or their beneficiaries, shall receive a
1.5% cost-of-living adjustment to their retirement benefit on October 1 of each
year. For those receiving benefits for less than one year, the increase shall

   (A)   Service-incurred. Any member who receives a service-connected injury,
disease, or disability, excluding alcohol and drug abuse, which injury,

monthly installments an amount equal to 3% of his average monthly earnings for
each year of continuous service, subject in any event to a maximum of 80% of

   (C)   Determination of disability. All questions relating to eligibility for
initial payment or continuance of disability benefits, including, without
limitation, whether a disability was service-incurred, shall be determined by
the Board, taking into consideration the recommendations of the medical board,
and based on the methods and procedures established by the Board. The
determination as to whether a disability is service-incurred shall be made
applying the presumptions of Section 185.34 or Section 175.231, as applicable,

permitted by law. Subsequent to said date such offsets shall be permitted only
to the extent allowed by the Florida Statutes.
   (E)   Service and nonservice disability shall have applicable to it the same
survivorship benefit percentages as for normal retirement. However, benefits
shall cease upon the determination of the Board, based on evidence that the
disabled employee is no longer eligible for benefit under this section.

distribution of up to $3,000 annually directly to a retiree medical plan or
long term care insurance on a pre-tax basis, so long as the public safety
officer separates from service either at the System’s normal retirement age or
due to his or her disability. Insurance premiums may be paid for the public
safety officer, his spouse or his dependents while he is alive, but once he is

175.195(1) or § 185.185(1), Florida Statutes, related to false, misleading, or
fraudulent statements made to obtain public retirement benefits, a member or
beneficiary may, in the discretion of the Board, be required to forfeit the
right to receive any or all benefits to which the person would otherwise be
entitled under this chapter. For purposes of this paragraph, “conviction” means
a determination of guilt that is the result of a plea or trial, regardless of
whether adjudication is withheld.

§ 34.49 INCOMPETENCE.
   If any participant or beneficiary is a minor or is, in the judgement of the
Board, otherwise incapable of personally receiving and giving valid receipt for
any payment due him under the plan, or the Board has reason to so believe, the
Board may, unless and until claims are made by a duly appointed guardian or
committee of the person, make a payment or any part thereof to the person’s
spouse, children, or other persons deemed by the Board to have incurred
expenses or assumed responsibility for the expenses of the person. In its sole
discretion, the Board may delay any such payment until the appointment of a
guardian by an appropriate court. Any payment so made shall be a complete
discharge of any liability under the plan for the payment.

§ 34.50 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
   (A)   If a member terminates his employment with the Police or Fire
Departments, either voluntarily or by lawful discharge, and is not eligible for
any other benefits under this system, he shall be entitled to the following:
      (1)   With less than ten years of continuous service, refund of the
member’s member contributions, plus simple interest, at the rate of 3% per
annum payable only upon a written request by the member in a form and manner
determined by the Board.
      (2)   With ten or more years of continuous service:
         (a)   Provided he does not elect to withdraw his member contributions,
the pension benefit accrued to his date of termination, payable commencing at
his otherwise earliest normal retirement date, or, effective as of March 12,
1999, his early retirement date with the appropriate early retirement reduction
calculated in accordance with §
34.44; or
         (b)   Refund of the member's member contributions, plus simple
interest, at the rate of 3% per annum payable only upon a written request by
the member in a form and manner determined by the Board.
   (B)   Any member of this system, who, for what- ever reason, has his
employment with the city as a police officer or firefighter terminated, but who
remains with or was previously employed by the city in some other capacity so
that his total period of employment with the city is ten years or more, shall
have all benefits accrued under this system preserved, provided he does not
elect to withdraw his member contributions. The accrued benefits shall be
payable at his otherwise normal retirement date, in accordance with the
provisions of this system. For purposes of determining normal retirement date
under this vesting provision, continuous service shall include all continuous
employment with the city as employee as defined in §
34.36, as well as the period of time subsequent to termination as a member of
this system. However, the benefits shall not be payable under this system
during any period of continued employment by the city. Any amounts attributable
to city contributions which are forfeited by reason of non-vested terminations
of employment shall remain in the Fund. Any member of this system as of April
15, 1988, who, for whatever reason, has his employment with the city as a
firefighter or police officer involuntarily terminated, and who withdraws his
member contributions from this fund, but is subsequently reinstated to his
position, shall be allowed re-entry into the system in accordance with §
34.38(E), provided that such member shall repay his withdrawn contributions
including the 3% interest paid to the member upon separation plus interest
thereon, at a rate equal to the interest assumption rate then in effect. Said
repayments with interest shall be made within four years of re-employment, but
in any event prior to retirement. If member does not buy back into the system
prior to retirement, he or she will be treated as a new member for purposes of
benefit calculation.
(‘69 Code, § 5-160) (Am. Ord. 1353, passed 9-20-00)
   (C)   Members entitled to a pension shall not forfeit it upon dismissal from
the Department, but shall be retired as prescribed by this subchapter.
   (D)   In the event a member who has been retired on a pension on account of
permanent and total incapacity regains his health and is found, by the medical
board designated by the Board of this system, to be in a physical and mental
condition to meet the requirements of the Personnel Department for service
acceptable to the city, the Board shall order his pension discontinued. He
shall then be ordered to resume active service in the Department from which he
was retired at the same or similar work as that at which he was employed prior
to his disability retirement, or at other work within the limits of the
physical or mental capabilities at the current rate of compensation for that
classification.
      (1)   Upon request of the City Manager, the Board shall review the
condition of any member receiving a pension for disability and shall submit to
the City Manager a report thereon.
      (2)   If there is substantial evidence that the retired member is capable
of performing service acceptable to other police and fire agencies, he shall be
ordered to resume active duties or his pension shall be discontinued.

§ 34.51 MILITARY SERVICE.
   (A)   Any member of the system created by this subchapter or any
probationary employee in the Fire or Police Department who enlists while the
United States is in any armed conflict whether by, or as a result of, a
declaration of war, or while the United States is in an active combatant under
the direction of the United Nations, or any member who is involuntarily called
into active military service with any branch of the Army of the United States,
the Coast Guard of the United States, the United States Navy, the United States
Air Force, the Merchant Marine, or the Marine Corps of the United States, shall
be entitled to preserve all retirement rights and privileges under this
subchapter.
   (B)   Differential wage payment. For years beginning after December 31,
2008, (i) an individual receiving a differential wage payment, as defined in
Section 3401(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, shall be treated as an
employee of the employer making the payment, (ii) the differential wage payment
shall be treated as compensation, and (iii) the plan shall not be treated as
failing to meet the requirements of any provision described in Section 414(u)
(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code by reasons of any contribution or benefit
which is based on the differential wage payment.
   (C)   Death during qualified military service. In the case of a death or
disability occurring on or after January 1, 2007, if a participant dies while
performing qualified military service (as defined in Section 414(u) of the
Internal Revenue Code), the survivors of the participant are entitled to any
additional benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of
qualified military service) provided under the plan as if the participant had
resumed and then terminated employment by the city on account of death.

§ 34.52 OPTIONAL BENEFITS.
   (A)   Each member entitled to a normal, early, or disability retirement
benefit shall have the right at any time prior to his retirement to elect to
have his benefit payable under any one of the options set forth below in lieu
of benefits otherwise provided herein, and to revoke those elections at any
time prior to actual retirement. The value of optional benefits shall be
actuarially equivalent to the value of benefits otherwise payable. The member
shall not be entitled to change a benefit option after the date of cashing or
depositing the first retirement check.
   (B)   The member shall make the election by written request to the Board the
request being retained in the Board’s file.
      (1)   Option 1: Joint and contingent survivor option. A retiring member
may elect to receive a retirement benefit during his lifetime and have the
retirement benefit (or a designated percentage of 25%, 50%, 66-2/3% or 75%
thereof) continued after his death to and during the lifetime of his designated
beneficiary. The election of Option 1 shall be null and void if the designated
beneficiary dies before the member’s retirement.
      (2)   Option 2: Ten years certain and life thereafter. A retiring member
may elect to receive a retirement benefit with 120 monthly payments guaranteed.
If, after retiring, the member should die before the 120 monthly payments are
made, benefits will continue to be paid to his beneficiary for the balance of
the 120-month period. After expiration of the 120 monthly payments guaranteed,
should the retired member be then alive, payments shall be continued during his
remaining lifetime. Effective for terminations on and after March 19, 1999,
this shall be the normal form of benefit.
      (3)   Option 3: Life-only annuity option. Effective as of March 12, 1999,
a retiring member may elect to receive a monthly retirement benefit during his
lifetime, with no survivor benefits payable.
      (4)   Option 4: Joint and last survivor option. Effective as of March 12,
1999, a retiring member may elect to receive a monthly retirement benefit
during the joint lifetime of the member and his designated beneficiary and,
following the death of either the member or his designated beneficiary, a
percentage (either 50%, 66-2/3%, 75% or 100%, as elected) of such monthly
benefit continued to the survivor for the life of the survivor.
      (5)   Option 5: Other. Retirement benefits may be paid in any form,
excluding lump sum, approved by the Board, so long as actuarial equivalence
with benefits otherwise payable is maintained.
   (C)   A deferred retirement option plan (“DROP”) is hereby created at no
cost and with no liability to the city. An employee who is a member of the
pension system and would be eligible to receive a service retirement pension
under the city’s retirement system and has attained “Normal Retirement Status,”
as specified in §
34.43 of this code, shall be eligible to participate in the Deferred Retirement
Option Plan (“DROP”). A member who elects to enter the DROP shall have no
recourse against the city for any claims with respect to the DROP payments or
the DROP plan. Upon entering the DROP plan, a member will be required to
provide to the city a letter of resignation dated the last day allowed by the
DROP ordinance.
      (1)   Election to participate in the DROP must be exercised within the
first five years of eligibility for the DROP for a maximum number of years as
specified in subsection (3) below. Election to participate must be made in
writing in a time and manner determined by the Board.
      (2)   A DROP account shall be created for each member who elects to
participate in the DROP. A DROP account shall consist of amounts transferred to
the DROP under §
34.52(C)(5) and earnings on those amounts, plus after-tax contributions to the
DROP by employees under §
34.52(C)(6) and earnings on those amounts. Amounts transferred to the
employee’s DROP accounts, under §
34.52(C)(5), shall be accounted for separately from amounts contributed to his
DROP account under §
34.52(C)(6).
      (3)   The duration and participation in the DROP shall be specified and
shall not exceed eight years from the first date of eligibility for normal
retirement, as chosen by the member, pursuant to §
34.43 of this subchapter. Firefighter members who attain eligibility for normal
retirement before reaching their 50th birthday may elect entry into the DROP no
later than the date of their 50th birthday in order to enjoy a full eight years
of participation in the DROP. For firefighter members employed as of the date
of this amendment, and who were hired after the attainment of their 30th
birthday, DROP entry for such members shall be no later than the date upon
which they have completed 20 years of eligible service in order to enjoy a full
participation in the DROP. For police officers employed as of the date of this
amendment and who were hired after the attainment of their 25th birthday, DROP
entry for such members shall be no later than the date upon which they have
completed 25 years of eligible service in order to enjoy a full participation
in the DROP.
         (a)   A member, who would be ineligible to participate in the DROP
because he/she exceeded the final date of participation based on subsection (3)
above, may nevertheless participate in the DROP for a maximum of two years if
he/she elects to participate in the DROP within one year of the adoption of
this section and incorporation of the DROP into the System.
         (b)   Notwithstanding subsection (3) above, employees who elect to
participate in the DROP within 30 calendar days of the adoption of this section
and would be entitled to participate in the DROP for more than two years, but
less than five years, the duration of their participation shall be calculated
as of October 1, 1996 for determining the eligible term of participation.
      (4)   Election to participate in the DROP shall preclude a member from
accruing additional benefits under the Pension Fund and shall cease the accrual
of the number of credited years of continuous service under the System, as of
the date of such election. For pension benefit purposes, all calculations for
average monthly earnings shall be based on the continuous years of credited
service preceding the commencement of participation in the DROP.
      (5)   Upon election to participate in the DROP, monthly retirement
benefits that would have been payable had the member terminated employment and
elected to receive monthly pension payments shall be made into the member's
DROP account. Payments to the member's DROP account shall be made on a monthly
basis for the term of a member's participation in the DROP, but shall not
exceed 60 months. DROP payments contributed to a member's DROP account shall,
as chosen by the member or upon election to participate in the DROP, which may
be changed annually during the month of September. A member's DROP account
shall earn or lose interest as follows:
         (a)   Members participating in the DROP on April 30, 2010, shall be
eligible to elect between earning at the same rate and frequency as in the
Pension Fund, less reasonable and necessary administrative expenses, or an
annual fixed interest rate of 8% on future payments to the member's DROP
account and on all or any portion of the member's DROP account balance.
         (b)   Members hired prior to May 1, 2010, and not currently
participating in the DROP on April 30, 2010, shall be eligible to elect between
earning at the same gross rate and frequency as the Pension Fund or guaranteed
return based upon the Pension Funds gross rate of return. The guaranteed return
shall be calculated as follows:
            1.   If the Pension Fund's gross rate of return is less than 5%,
then the member's DROP account shall earn 5%.
            2.   If the Pension Fund's gross rate of return is more than 8%,
then the member's DROP account shall earn 8%.
            3.   If the Pension Fund's gross rate of return is between 5% and
8%, then the member's DROP account shall earn the same as the Pension Fund's
gross rate of return.
         (c)   For members hired after April 30, 2010, the member's DROP
account shall earn or lose interest at the same gross rate of return and
frequency as the Pension Fund.
         During a member’s participation in the DROP, he or she shall not be
paid any amounts from the System, except as otherwise provided in §
34.52(C)(11) below.
      (6)   A member may make after-tax contributions to the DROP only during
the first calendar year of his/her participation in the DROP. After-tax
contribution shall be made in a time and manner determined by the Board.
      (7)   After-tax contributions made to the DROP shall be invested by the
Board. Such contributions shall be credited quarterly to the member’s DROP
account with the actual net investment return on the assets in which such
amounts are invested by the Board. After-tax contributions and the earning
thereon shall be accounted for separately from the contributions by the Pension
Fund to the DROP. Members or their beneficiaries may withdraw, at their
discretion, the amounts of the after-tax contributions, with earnings, any time
on or after termination of employment, but no later than the required beginning
date, as defined in §
34.64(E).
      (8)   Termination of participation in the DROP shall occur when a member
participating in the DROP:
         (a)   Elects in writing, in a time and manner determined by the Board,
to cease participation in the DROP. A member who elects to terminate his
participation in the DROP under this subsection shall not be permitted to again
become a participant in the DROP.
         (b)   Realizes the maximum participation period. If a member’s
employment is not terminated at the end of the maximum participation period,
authorized by this section, interest credits and DROP payments into the
member’s DROP account shall cease.
         (c)   Terminates his employment as a police officer or firefighter; or
         (d)   Dies. A member who dies prior the commencement of his/her
distribution of DROP payments shall be treated as a member who dies after
becoming vested prior to the commencement of retirement under the pension plan,
pursuant to §
34.47 of this subchapter. The Board may require and rely upon proof of death
and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive
the value of a deceased member’s DROP account as the Board may deem proper and
its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive
payment shall be conclusive.
      (9)   Upon termination of participation in the DROP, amounts shall cease
to be transferred from the Retirement System to the member’s DROP account. Upon
termination, a member of the DROP may choose to receive the balance of their
DROP account either immediately after such termination or to defer such payment
until the latest date permitted under 26 USC 401(a)(9), as may be amended from
time to time. Payments may not be made from the DROP until a member’s
employment is terminated. After termination of employment, members may obtain
DROP payments in the form of a lump sum, installment, or an annuity.
Distribution of a member’s DROP account shall begin as soon as administratively
practicable following the member’s termination of employment.
      (10)   The assets of the DROP shall be managed by the Board. The Board
may appoint a subcommittee with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt
such administrative procedures and regulations as they may deem desirable for
the conduct of the affairs and duties if under the DROP. A member of the Board
shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. The Board shall
maintain or cause to be maintained records showing the operations and
conditions of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in
each DROP account. The Board shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
distributed to employees participating in the DROP and other individuals or
filed with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all
necessary descriptions, reports, and date required to be distributed or filed
for the DROP pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, and any other applicable
laws. The Board may pay reasonable and necessary expenses of administering
DROP's assets, from funds of the DROP.
      (11)   DROP loans authorized. A DROP loan program is hereby approved for
members who are DROP participants and retirees at the maximum amount permitted
by IRS regulations. The DROP loan program shall be administered in accordance
with a loan policy adopted by the Board of Trustees. The loan policy shall
comply with all applicable IRS rules and regulations governing such loans. No
interest shall be earned or paid by the Plan on funds loaned from a DROP
account for the period of withdrawal until repaid. Members or retirees shall
pay interest as determined by the Plan on any outstanding loan balance amount.
      (12)   Compliance with Internal Revenue Code Sections 414(k) and 414(i).
To the extent required under the Internal Revenue Code, the DROP under the
System shall be treated as a defined contribution plan to the extent that the
member's benefits under the System are based on the member's DROP account. The
amount of "annual additions" (as such term is defined in Section 415(c)(2) of
the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations §1.415(c)-1(b)) which may be
allocated under the DROP to a member's DROP account for a "limitation year" may
not exceed the maximum permissible amount under Section 415(c)(1) of the
Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations §1.415(c)-1(a)(1) (the "Annual
Maximum Amount"). For purposes hereof, the term "limitation year" means the 12-
month period beginning on January 1. In addition, for purposes of determining a
member's Annual Maximum Amount, the member's compensation shall be determined
in compliance with Treasury Regulations §1.415(c)-2.
   (D)   Career Anniversary Pension Retirement Incentive Option.
      (1)   For police officer members who elect to retire or enter the DROP
upon, no earlier than attainment of age 50 with ten years of service and no
later than completion of 20 years of service regardless of age as set forth in
§
34.43, shall receive the benefits as set forth below.
      (2)   In order to receive the following benefits, firefighter members who
were members of the plan on June 18, 2003, when Ordinance No. 1443 took effect,
must retire or enter the DROP upon but not after attaining 20 years of service
unless they, before attaining 20 years of service, have attained age 50 with
ten years of service, in which case the member must retire or enter the DROP no
earlier than attainment of age 50 with ten years of service and no later than
attainment of 20 years of service. Firefighter members who entered the pension
fund after June 18, 2003 will receive the following benefits if they elect to
retire or enter the DROP upon, but not after, attaining the earlier of the
normal retirement age of 20 years of service or age 50 with ten years of
service as set forth in §
34.43.
         (a)   The amount of the benefit shall be 4%, rather than the 3% set
forth in §
34.43(C), of average monthly earnings for the highest two years of continuous
service multiplied by years of continuous service, subject in any event to a
maximum of 80% of average monthly earnings for the highest two years of
continuous service.
      For police officer members hired on or before April 30, 2010, the benefit
multiplier shall be 4% for continuous service accrued on or before April 30,
2010 and 3.5% for continuous service accrued after April 30, 2010.
      For police officer members hired after April 30, 2010, the benefit
multiplier shall be 3% for each year of continuous service and average final
compensation shall be the average of the highest two years of continuous
service, subject in any event to a maximum of 80% of average final
compensation.
      For firefighter members, effective April 30, 2010, the benefit multiplier
shall be 4% for service accrued on or before April 30, 2010. For any continuous
service accrued by a firefighter on or after May 1, 2010:
            1.   If a firefighter member was hired on or prior to June 18,
2003, the benefit multiplier shall be 4% for each year of continuous service
accrued prior to May 1, 2010 and the benefit multiplier shall be 3.5% for each
year of continuous service accrued on or after May 1, 2010. The firefighter
shall be eligible to retire or enter the DROP, as set forth in §
34.52, upon reaching a benefit of 80% of average earnings; attainment of age 50
with a minimum of ten years of continuous service; or upon completion of 20
years of service regardless of age. If the firefighter's service with the city
terminates prior to either: (1) reaching age 50 with at least ten years of
continuous service; or (2) completion of 20 years of continuous service
regardless of age, the firefighter's benefit multiplier for each year of
creditable service shall be reduced to 3%, and the ten-year vesting requirement
shall continue to apply.
            2.   If a firefighter member is hired after June 18, 2003, and
prior to May 1, 2010, the benefit multiplier shall be 4% for each year of
continuous service accrued prior to May 1, 2010, and the benefit multiplier
shall be 3.5% for each year of continuous service accrued on or after May 1,
2010. The firefighter shall remain eligible to be an active employee of the
city until such time as the firefighter's benefit equals the maximum benefit
the firefighter would have been entitled to under the provisions of the Plan in
effect on April 30, 2010. (By way of example only, a firefighter member hired
at age 35 after June 18, 2003 would have been eligible to retire at age 50 with
15 years of credited service with a 4% multiplier, resulting in a benefit equal
to 60% of earnings. The same employee would remain eligible for active
participation until such 60% benefit is achieved with the reduced multiplier of
3.5% for credited service earned after April 30, 2010.) The firefighter is
eligible to retire or enter the DROP upon reaching the maximum benefit
calculated in accordance with the preceding sentence or attainment of age 50
with a minimum of ten years of continuous service. If the firefighter's service
with the city terminates prior to either: (1) reaching age 50 with at least ten
years of continuous service; or (2) completion of 20 years of continuous
service regardless of age, the firefighter's benefit multiplier for each year
of creditable service shall be reduced to 3%, and the ten-year vesting
requirement shall continue to apply.
            3.   If a firefighter member is hired after April 30, 2010, the
amount of the benefit multiplier shall be 3% of average monthly earnings for
the highest two years of continuous service and the maximum benefit shall be
80% of the firefighter's average monthly earnings for the highest two years of
continuous service.
         (b)   For firefighter members hired on or after April 1, 2006 the
amount of the benefit shall be as calculated in division (D)(1)(a) of this
section and shall in no event exceed 98% of average monthly regular wages for
the same highest two years of continuous service selected above and as defined
in §
34.36(A)(4) and (18).
      (3)   Prior to May 1, 2010, "earnings," for purposes of calculating any
benefits pursuant to the Career Anniversary Pension Retirement Incentive Option
set forth in this section, shall include paymentfor up to 1,000 hours of
accrued unused leave as set forth in "earnings" as defined in §
34.36(A)(10). Effective May 1, 2010, accrued leave earned by a member on or
after May 1, 2010 shall not be included as part of the member's "earnings" for
purposed of calculating the member's benefit under the system.
      (4)   Negotiated Adjustment to Pension Income.
         (a)   For firefighter retirees:
            1.   Effective April 1, 2005, and April 1st of each year
thereafter, retirees, their beneficiaries and DROP participants will receive
either a 2% increase to their retirement benefit or an adjustment equal to the
total percentage increase in base wages, excluding performance or merit
adjustments provided in the collective bargaining agreement to bargaining unit
members, for the city fiscal year commencing the preceding October 1st,
whichever is greater. This increase shall be applied to all monthly benefit
payments for all participants (including retirees and DROP participants) and
beneficiaries who were receiving benefits for at least one year from June 18,
2003.
            2.   Upon retirement, firefighter members who were hired on or
after April 1, 2006 shall receive a fixed 3% increase to their monthly
retirement benefit on April 1 of each year following retirement. Effective May
1, 2010, firefighters who were hired prior to May 1, 2010 and retire or enter
the DROP after April 30, 2010, or their beneficiaries, shall receive a 2% cost-
of-living adjustment on April 1 of each year following retirement. Firefighters
hired on or after May 1, 2010, and retire or enter the DROP, or their
beneficiaries, shall receive a 1.5% cost-of-living adjustment on April 1 of
each year following retirement.
            3.   Firefighter members who were hired prior to April 1, 2006 and
retirees and DROP participants who were hired prior to April 1, 2006 shall
within 60 days from the effective date of this section irrevocably elect to
receive the negotiated adjustment to pension income as set forth in either
division (D)(3)(a) or (b) of this section.
         (b)   For police officer retirees:
            1.   Effective October 1, 2009, and October 1 of each year
thereafter, retirees who retired on or after October 1, 2003, or are
participating in the DROP on or after October 1, 2003, or their beneficiaries,
will receive a 1.5% increase to their retirement benefit. This increase shall
be applied to all monthly benefit payments for all participants (including
retirees and DROP participants) and beneficiaries who were receiving benefits
for at least one year from March 17, 2003. For those receiving benefits for
less than one year from the first cost of living adjustment, the increase shall
be prorated.
            2.   Effective October 1, 2009, and October 1st of each year
thereafter, retirees who retired or entered the DROP on or after October 1,
2006 or their beneficiaries will receive a 3% increase to their retirement
benefit. This increase shall be applied to all monthly benefit payments for all
participants (including retirees and DROP participants) and beneficiaries who
were receiving benefits for at least one year from October 1, 2008. Effective
May 1, 2010, police officers who were hired prior to May 1, 2010, and retire or
enter the DROP after April 30, 2010, and their beneficiaries, shall receive a
2% cost-of-living adjustment on October 1 each year following retirement.
Police officers hired on or after May 1, 2010, who retire or enter the DROP,
and their beneficiaries, shall receive a 1.5% cost-of-living adjustment on
October 1 of each year following retirement.
         (c)   For those firefighter and police officer retirees receiving
benefits for less than one year from the first cost of living adjustment, the
annual increase shall be prorated.
      (5)   Enhanced benefit incentive.
         (a)   Firefighter members who, as of June 18, 2003, have already
attained the normal retirement age set forth in §
34.43(A)(6) shall have 60 days from June 18, 2003 to irrevocably elect the
incentive set forth in divisions (D)(1) through (D)(3) above. Firefighter
members who, as of June 18, 2003, have attained the normal retirement age set
forth in §
34.43(A)(7) but have not yet attained 20 continuous years of service shall have
the option of electing this incentive any time between June 18, 2003 and
attaining the normal retirement age set forth in §
34.43(A)(6). Election of the incentive shall be irrevocable and require a
firefighter member with more than 20 continuous years of service, at his or her
option, to participate in the DROP retroactively to normal retirement age or
five years, whichever is less. This will result in the immediate retirement
(termination of fire department employment) of those firefighter members who,
upon June 18, 2003, elect this incentive and have 25 or more continuous years
of service. In the event a firefighter member who has already attained the
normal retirement age set forth in §
34.43(A)(6) decides not to elect this incentive, then retirement benefits shall
remain as set forth prior to this amendment.
         (b)   Police officer members who, as of March 17, 2004, have already
attained the normal retirement age of 20 years of service or 50 years of age
and ten years of service shall have 30 days from March 17, 2004 to irrevocably
elect the incentive set forth in subsections (D)(1) through (3) above. Police
officer members who, as of March 17, 2004, have attained the normal retirement
age of 50 years of age and ten years of service, but have not yet attained 20
continuous years of service shall have the option of electing this incentive
any time between March 17, normal retirement age of 20 years of service.
Election of the incentive shall be irrevocable and require a police officer
member with more than 20 continuous years of service, at his or her option, to
participate in the DROP retroactively to normal retirement age or five years,
whichever is less. This will result in the immediate retirement (termination of
police department employment) of those police officer members who, upon March
17, 2004, elect this incentive and have 25 or more continuous years of service.
In the event a police officer member who has already attained the normal
retirement age decides not to elect this incentive, then retirement benefits
shall remain as set forth prior to this amendment.
      (6)   Firefighter members enrolled in the DROP as of June 18, 2003 shall
have the option, within 60 days of that date, and police officer members
enrolled in the DROP as of March 17, 2004 shall have the option within 30 days
of March 17, 2004, to elect this incentive, excluding §
34.52(D)(2), retroactively to their attainment of normal retirement age or five
years, whichever is less (including the period of DROP participation). In the
event a current DROP participant decides not to elect this incentive, then the
member's retirement benefits and DROP terms shall remain unchanged.
      (7)   Firefighter members who did not contribute 10.4% as of October 1,
2002, shall have the option to receive the incentive above if they make an
irrevocable election in writing within ten days of March 19, 2003 to
retroactively pay contributions at the net rate of 10.4% plus interest at 8%,
compounded annually. The payment must be made in a lump sum by certified check
or trustee to trustee transfer received by the system within 30 days following
notification of amount due. If the member has reached normal retirement age set
forth in §
34.43(A)(6), the incentive will be applied retroactively. This will result in
the immediate retirement (termination of fire department employment) of those
firefighter members who, upon June 18, 2003, elect this incentive and have 25
or more years of credited service.
      (8)   For purposes of this division (D) only, “termination of fire
department employment” shall mean termination of fire department employment
from a bargaining unit position and thereafter not being rehired, retained,
engaged, employed or contracted by the city to perform duties that were
previously performed by the member or by other firefighter members while the
member was employed by the city in said bargaining unit covered position.
      (9)   For purposes of this division (D) only, “Termination of Police
Department Employment” shall mean termination of Police Department employment
and thereafter not being rehired, retained, engaged, employed or contracted
with the city to perform duties that were previously performed by the police
officer member or by other police officer members while the police officer
member was employed by the city.
   (E)   In service distribution. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Code of Ordinances to the contrary:
      (1)   A retired member who has terminated employment with the city may be
re-employed by the city in a “non-bargaining unit position”, provided the
retired member has satisfied the conditions for full retirement under §
34.43 (“normal retirement age”) based solely on satisfaction of one of the
service requirements set forth therein (e.g. 20 years of continuous service
regardless of age) and is re-employed by the city after such retirement in a
non-bargaining unit position. In such an event, the re-employed member shall
continue to receive retirement benefits from this Plan and continued earnings
on the member’s DROP account, and may also elect to receive payments from the
member’s DROP account.
      (2)   In the event that any such re-employed member shall be returned to
employment as a certified police officer or firefighter as defined in F.S. Ch.
175 and Ch. 185 in a position requiring more than 30 hours of work per week and
52 weeks of schedules work per year, the re-employed member shall continue to
receive retirement benefits from this Plan as provided in division (E)(1)
above, shall again become a contributing member of the Plan for the period of
re-employment. Upon separation from the city following the period of re-
employment, the benefits earned during the period of re-employment shall be
calculated separately and shall be in addition to the benefits earned during
the initial period of employment. No benefits earned during any period of full
time re-employment shall affect the level of benefits earned during the initial
period of employment.
      (3)   A member shall become 100% vested in his or her benefits provided
by the system upon attaining normal retirement age.
   (F)   (1)   The City, effective April 1, 2018, will offer an eight year DROP
to a Police Officer Member who has not already entered DROP or those currently
in DROP. The DROP account balance, for the first five years of the DROP
("Bucket 1") would be based on your date of hire (hires prior to May 1, 2010,
may elect either):
         (a)   The range of 5% to 8% based on gross market return guaranteed;
or
         (b)   Gross market return; or for hires on or after May 1, 2010, gross
market return).
      (2)   For years six and beyond, the rate would be gross market return
("Bucket 2"). All Police Officer DROP participants hired prior to May 1, 2010,
who do not elect to participate beyond the initial 60 month plan, may elect
either:
         (a)   The range of 5% to 8% based on gross market return guaranteed;
or
         (b)   Gross market return as currently included in the city's pension
plan.
      (3)   All Police Officer DROP participants hired prior to May 1, 2010,
who elect to participate beyond the initial 60 month plan, may elect either:
         (a)   The range of 5% to 8% based on gross market return guaranteed;
or
         (b)   Gross market return on Bucket 1 and shall be eligible to elect
between earning at the same gross rate and frequency as the Pension Fund or
guaranteed return based upon the Pension Funds gross rate of return, until the
tenth anniversary of separation of service from the city.
      (4)   For those Police Officer members who elect to participate in the
DROP program beyond 60 months, shall either withdraw all DROP funds from their
plan by the tenth anniversary of separation of service from the city, or have
the option to leave the DROP balance in the city pension plan and receive the
net plan rate of return (market rate of return - gross investment return less
investment/administrative expenses) (all DROP funds remaining within the Plan
would move to “Bucket 2”). By the tenth anniversary of separation of service,
members will make the decision regarding how much, if any, DROP funds remain
within the plan.
      (5)   For those Police Officer members who elect to participate in the
DROP program beyond 60 months, a new pension contract would have to be executed
by the city and the member. Members must notify the city a minimum of three
months prior to close of the 60 month DROP period, if they elect to extend
their DROP participation beyond the initial 60 month DROP period.
   (G)   A 401(a) Retirement Plan for the city’s police officer and firefighter
members is hereby established pursuant to F.S. §§ 175.351 and 185.35. The city
and the applicable collective bargaining groups have agreed that the city shall
be allowed to utilize all premium tax revenues to offset the city’s funding of
its annual required contribution of the Plan, thus no funds will be deposited
into the 401(a) Plan unless mutually agreed to by the city and each of the
collective bargaining units. To the extent the city and the respective
collective bargaining groups agree that any premium insurance tax revenues are
to be deposited in the 401 (a) Plan in accordance with F.S. § 175.351(6) and
F.S. § 185.35(6), the city and the respective collective bargaining groups will
determine the terms of distribution, investment, and vesting in such funds. At
all times, the 401(a) Plan shall be administered in compliance with all state
and federal laws, rules, and regulations applicable to such plans, including
but not limited to the Internal Revenue Code, the U.S. Department of Labor, or
other such applicable regulatory agencies.

§ 34.53 CONTRIBUTIONS.
   (A)   There shall be three kinds of contributions to the system:
      (1)   Member contributions. For certified firefighters members of the
retirement system shall make regular contributions to the Pension Fund as a
rate equal to the greater of 10.4% of their respective annual earnings or the
actuarially determined amount for buyback. For certified police officer members
of the retirement system shall make regular contributions to the Pension Fund
at a rate equal to 10.4% of their respective annual earnings as of April 1,
1991. The contributions attributable to the period from April 1, 1991 to
October 1, 1992 shall be paid to the pension fund in accordance with the
payment schedule approved by the Pension Board, provided, however, repayment
shall be completed within 24 months from the effective date of this section.
All eligible employees, as a condition of membership, shall agree in writing on
becoming a member to make the member contributions specified herein. These
contributions shall be deducted from earnings before the earnings are paid,
until the member had completed 26 and 2/3 years of continuous service, at which
time payments stop. Member contributions shall be deposited into the fund each
pay period.
      (2)   State contributions. Any monies received or receivable by reason of
the laws of the state for the express purpose of funding and paying for
retirement benefits for police officers and firefighters of the city shall be
deposited, immediately and in no event more than five days after receipt, in
the Pension fund comprising part of this system.
      (3)   City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city
shall make an annual contribution to the Pension Fund in an amount equal to the
difference in each year as between the total of aggregate member contributions
for the year plus state contributions for the year, and the total cost for the
year as shown by the most recent actuarial valuation and report for the system,
such contributions shall be deposited into the fund in accordance with §
34.37(B) herein. The total cost for any year shall be defined as the total
normal cost for and expenses of the Board, plus the additional amount
sufficient to amortize the unfunded accrued past service liability over not
more than a 40-year period commencing with the effective date of this system,
and not more than a 30-year period for additional (new) benefits. The City
Commission and the Board will undertake a study of funding alternatives that
will reduce the cost to the city.
   (B)   Buyback. Subject to the limitations of Internal Revenue Code Section
415(n), a member shall be provided with credit for periods of service not
otherwise taken into account under the plan if the member voluntarily
contributes to the plan in an amount (as determined by the Board, in its sole
discretion) equal to the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to
such period of service reduced by any city contribution with respect to such
service. Buyback shall be permitted only with respect to periods of service
with the city during which time the member was not permitted to participate in
the plan because he/she had attained age 36. To receive credit for such
service, the member must submit a written election indicating his intent to do
so, along with the payment representing the appropriate amount of the required
contribution. Service shall not become effective prior to full payment of such
contribution.
   (C)   All retirement, death, and disability benefits payable under this
system are in lieu of a refund of member contributions. In any event, however,
each member shall be guaranteed the payment of benefits at least equal in total
amount to his accumulated member contributions plus 3% simple interest.
   (D)   All monies which have been funded by member contributions and the
city’s contributions, and monies from all outside sources such as private
contributions or those contributions made by the state or any other firms,
corporations, or companies invested into any basic or secondary pension plan
for the retirement of any employee who shall be included in the Pension Fund,
including any interest gathered by these monies, shall be transferred into the
Pension Fund to be known more fully as the Pembroke Pines Firefighter’s and
Police Officer’s Retirement Fund. All beneficiaries and retired members
presently receiving benefits from Bankers Life shall continue to receive these
benefits under this system.

§ 34.54 RETIREE BENEFIT RE-COMPUTATIONS.
   (A)   Any person who is receiving a retirement, death, or disability payment
under the terms of this system and who had not begun receiving retirement,
death, or disability benefits from any city-sponsored pension program before
February 19, 1981, will have his benefits recalculated with such recalculated
benefits to commence as of the payment due on the first day of the month on or
after the effective date of this section.
   (B)   The recalculation will be performed using the same benefit formula,
continuous service, and earnings as applied when payments under this system
commenced; however, average monthly earnings used will be equal to one-twelfth
of the arithmetic average of annual earnings for the highest two years of
continuous service preceding the actual retirement or termination date of the
person. In addition, if the benefit payment is as a result of service-incurred
total and permanent disability, the recalculation will be performed using a 66-
2/3% factor instead of a 40% factor.

§ 34.55 PENSIONS NOT ASSIGNABLE, SUBJECT TO GARNISHMENT, OR THE LIKE.
   (A)   No pension provided for in this subchapter shall be assignable or
subject part of the corpus or income of the Pension Fund be used for, or
diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of members and their
beneficiaries and until those liabilities are satisfied, all city contributions
will remain in the Fund for the benefit of the members or beneficiaries in the
event the system is terminated or city contributions cease.
   (B)   Upon the termination of the system or on the complete discontinuance
of contributions under the system, each member shall have nonforfeitable, 100%

of a transfer, merger, or consolidation of governmental units, services, or
functions as provided in Chapter 121, Florida Statutes, or upon written notice
by the city to the Board that contributions under the system are being
permanently discontinued, the rights of all members to benefits accrued to the
date of such termination and the amounts credited to the members' accounts are
nonforfeitable. The Fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following
procedures:
      (1)   The Board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset
value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into
account the expenses of such distribution. The Board shall inform the city if
additional assets are required. in which event the city shall continue to
financially support the system until all nonforfeitable benefits have been
funded.
      (2)   The Board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset
value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of
another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or
otherwise, for each member entitled to benefits under the system as specified
in division (3) below.
      (3)   The Board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of
termination in the manner set forth in this division, on the basis that the
amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially
computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method
of distribution determined under division (2) above involves the purchase of an
insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is
the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may
not be less than the member's accumulated contributions to the system, with
interest if provided by the system, less the value of any system benefits
previously paid to the member.
      (4)   If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution
specified in division (3) above, and after the payment of any expenses incurred
with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the city, less return
to the state of the state's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less
than the total contributions made by the city and the state to date of
termination of the system, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the
total contributions made by the city and the state.
      (5)   The Board shall distribute, in accordance with division (2) above,
the amounts determined under division (3) above.
   (B)   If, after 24 months after the date the system terminated or the date
the Board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being

fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the
Department of Management Services shall effect the termination of the fund in
accordance with this section.

specified in Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).
   (B)   The city shall solely for the purpose of compliance with Sections 125,
457, and 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code, pick up the members’
contributions required to be made by employees on earnings paid with respect to
payroll periods upon this section becoming effective. The member contributions
so picked up shall be designated as employer contributions in determining tax
treatment under the Internal Revenue Code. Member contributions picked up by
the city pursuant to this subsection shall be treated for all other purposes of
this and other laws of the city in the same manner and to the same extent as
member contributions made prior to the effective date of this division (B). No
employee shall have the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts
directly instead of having them paid by the city to the System.
   (C)   This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1,

otherwise limit a distributee’s election under this section, a distributee may
elect, at any time and in any manner prescribed by the plan administrator, to

eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. For

specified by the distributee. Effective as of January 1, 2008, a non-spouse
beneficiary may make a direct rollover only to an “inherited” individual

receives a distribution from the plan, the distribution is not eligible for a
60-day (non-direct) rollover.
      DISTRIBUTEE. An employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's
or former employee's surviving spouse is a distributee with regard to the
interest of the spouse. Effective as of January 1, 2008, an employee's or
former employee's non-spouse beneficiary is a distributee with regard to the
interest of the employee or former employee.
      ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLAN. An individual retirement account described in §
408(a) of the IRC, an individual retirement annuity account described in § 403
(a) of the IRC, or a qualified trust described in § 401(a) of the IRC, that
accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution.
      Effective for distributions made after December 31, 2001, an eligible
retirement plan shall also mean an annuity contract described in IRC § 403(b)
and an eligible plan under IRC § 457(b) which is maintained by a state,
political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state
or political subdivision of a state, and which agrees to separately account for
amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan.
      ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBU- TION. Any distribution of all or any portion
of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible
rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is one of a series
of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) of
the distributee and the distributee’s designated beneficiary, for a specified
period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution
is required under § 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended
(IRC); and, the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross
income.

DRUG FREE WORKPLACE
§ 34.89 POLICY STATEMENT.
   (A)   The city is committed to provide a safe work environment for its
employees, community, and society. Substance abuse is a national problem which
impairs the health and safety of employees, promotes crime, and harms our
community. The city is addressing this problem by instituting a drug free
workplace program.
   (B)   Substance abuse is a complex yet treatable disease. The ultimate goal
of this policy is to balance our respect for individual privacy with our need
to keep a safe, productive, drug free environment. Our intention is to prevent
and treat substance abuse. We would like to encourage those who use drugs or
abuse alcohol to seek help in overcoming their problem. The city considers
substance abuse to be an unsafe and counter-productive work practice.
   (C)   The city’s policy is in accordance with the state drug free workplace
program, as provided in F.S. § 440.102 and Rule 38F-9.001 of the Florida
Administrative Code.
   (D)   To ensure a work place free from the influence of illegal drugs and
alcohol abuse, the following policy has been established.
   (E)   It is the policy of the city that an employee found with the presence
of alcohol or illegal drugs in his/her system, or in possession of, using,
selling, trading, or offering for sale illegal drugs or alcohol during working
hours, may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
(City-sponsored activities which may include the service of alcoholic beverages
are not included in this provision).
   (F)   An employee reporting for work visibly impaired is unable to properly
perform required duties and will not be allowed to work. If possible, the
supervisor should first seek another supervisor’s opinion of the employee’s
status. Then the supervisor should consult privately with the employee with the
observation, to rule out any problems that may have been caused by prescription
drugs.
   (G)   If, in the opinion of the supervisor, the employee is considered
impaired, the employee should be sent home, after drug testing by a medical
facility, by taxi or other safe transportation alternative, depending on the
determination of the observed im-pairment, accompanied by the supervisor or
another employee, if necessary. An impaired employee should not be allowed to
drive. The prescribed test direction form shall be completed by the supervisor.
   (H)   Prescription drugs prescribed by the employee’s physician may be taken
during working hours. The employee shall notify the supervisor if the use of
properly prescribed drugs will affect the employee’s work performance. Abuse of
prescription drugs will not be tolerated.
   (I)   It is the responsibility of the city’s super- visors to counsel with
an employee whenever they see changes in performance that suggest an employee
problem. The supervisor may suggest that the employee voluntarily seek help
from the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) or decide that the severity of the
observed problem is such that a formal referral to the EAP should be made.

§ 34.92 POLICY REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Conditions of pre-employment. The city will conduct pre-employment
screening examinations designed to prevent hiring individuals who use drugs.
      (1)   To determine the suitability of employees to work for the city, the
following pre-employment conditions are established:
         (a)   All job applicants will be tested prior to employment for drug
use and alcohol use. Any job offer which a job applicant may receive from the
city is contingent upon successfully completing a required physical
examination.
         (b)   Any job applicant who refuses to submit to drug and alcohol
testing as part of the pre-employment testing process will be refused
employment.
         (c)   Any job applicant who tests positive for drugs or alcohol use
will be refused employment at that time.
      (2)   Confidentiality will be maintained pursuant to this policy.
      (3)   The city will not discriminate against applications for employment
because of the past abuse of drugs or alcohol. It is the current abuse of drugs
or alcohol that the city will not tolerate.
   (B)   Current employee drug and alcohol abuse screening. The city will
maintain screening practices to identify employees who use illegal drug or
abuse alcohol. It shall be a condition of continued employment for all
employees to submit to drug screening under the following conditions:
      (1)   Reasonable suspicion. All employees who are determined to be under
reasonable suspicion of drug or alcohol use (as defined herein) are required to
take a drug and alcohol test.
      (2)   Fitness for duty. All employees who are subject to routine fitness
for duty medical examinations are required to take a drug and alcohol test as
part of their medical examination.
      (3)   Follow-up. All employees who have been referred to an employee

annual, or annual basis for two years after returning to work.

provides help to employees and their families who suffer from alcohol or drug
abuse. (Refer to EAP Policy)
      (2)   It is the responsibility of each employee to seek assistance before
drugs and alcohol lead to disciplinary problems.
      (3)   Once a violation of this policy occurs, subsequent use of the
employee assistance program, on a voluntary basis, will not affect the
determination of appropriate disciplinary action.
      (4)   (a)   An employee’s decision to seek assistance from the Employee
Assistance Program on a voluntary basis prior to an incident warranting
disciplinary action will not be used as the basis for disciplinary action or in
any disciplinary proceeding.
         (b)   On the other hand, using the EAP will not be a defense to the
imposition of disciplinary action where facts, providing violation of this
policy, are obtained outside of the EAP. Accordingly, the purpose and practices
of this policy and the EAP are not in conflict but are distinctly separate in
their applications.
      (5)   Through the EAP, the city will provide appropriate assessment,
referral to treatment, and treatment of drug and alcohol abuse (subject to the
provisions of the city’s health insurance plan). Such employees may be granted
leave with a conditional return to work depending on successful completion of
the agreed-upon appropriate treatment regimen and in accordance with the career
services rules and regulations and any departmental rules and regulations.
      (6)   Upon successful completion of a drug and/or alcohol treatment
program, an employee may be released to resume work but will be subject to drug
testing on a random, periodic basis, at least quarterly, for at least two years
thereafter as a condition of continued employment.
      (7)   An individual’s participation in the program will not be made part
of any personnel records and will remain confidential, except to the extent
necessary to comply with this policy. Medical and insurance records, if any,
will be preserved in the same confidential manner as all other medical records
and be retained in a separate file as provided by law.
   (D)   Management’s responsibility.
      (1)   Supervisors are responsible for implementing the drug and alcohol
free work place policy. It is the responsibility of the supervisors to observe
the behavior of employees on the job as a precaution against unstable or
unreliable behavior which could threaten the safety and well-being of employees
and the community.
      (2)   Supervisors are responsible for maintaining a safe work environment
by determining the fitness for duty of employees.
      (3)   In the event a supervisor has a reasonable suspicion that an
employee may be affected by drugs or alcohol, the employee must be sent for
drug testing. A form for reporting the reason(s) for drug testing is available
from the city.
      (4)   In all cases when an employee is being removed from duty for drug
testing, the supervisor should notify his or her superior at the earliest
possible time.
   (E)   Employees responsibility.

reporting for work and to inform his or her supervisor if the employee is under
prescription or non-prescription medication which may affect job performance.
      (2)   In the event an employee observes behavior which raises a doubt as
to the ability of a co-worker to work in a safe, reliable, and trustworthy
manner, the employee should report this behavior to his supervisor.
      (3)   Employees who voluntarily enter a drug or alcohol treatment and/or
rehabilitation program at the request or insistence of the city or, as a
condition of continued employment, enter a drug or alcohol treatment and/or
rehabilitation program are required to participate and complete recommended
treatment. Any employee who enters a drug or alcohol treatment and/or
rehabilitation program will be responsible for payment of the treatment and/or
program. If the employee fails to comply with the treatment and/or the program,
the employee will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination.
   (F)   Medical Review Officer’s (MRO) responsibilities.
      (1)   The MRO will review all information from the testing laboratory in
the event of a positive, confirmed test. The MRO will review any information
from the employee or job applicant regarding the use of medication or other
relevant medical information set forth in the form submitted prior to drug
testing.
      (2)   The MRO may request that the testing laboratory provide
quantification of test results.
      (3)   The MRO will provide his or her interpretation of positive,

DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY FOR SAFETY SENSITIVE EMPLOYEES
§ 34.95 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   On April 30, 2001, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) introduced
a new regulation on drug and alcohol testing. This regulation effectively
superseded and combined into a single instruction its drug and alcohol testing
rules which were previously published in two separate directives. At the same
time, some of the included provisions were rewritten to be more consistent with
similar requirements imposed by other U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)
agencies.
   (B)   The new regulation, published as 49 CFR Part 655, “Prevention of
Prohibited Drug Use and Alcohol Misuse in Transit Operations,” requires each
employer receiving FTA funding assistance or who performs certain functions for
or on behalf of such a recipient to establish and implement an anti-drug and
alcohol testing program that must include the following elements:
      (1)   A statement describing the employer’s policy on prohibited drug use
and alcohol misuse in the workplace, including consequences associated with
prohibited drug else and alcohol misuse.
      (2)   An educational and training program, which includes the display and
distribution of informational materials and a community service hotline
telephone number, if available.
      (3)   A testing program that meets the requirements outlined in 49 CFR
Part 655 and DOT regulation 49 CFR Part 40, “Procedures for Transportation
Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Procedures.”
      (4)   Procedures for referring a covered employee who has a verified
positive drug or alcohol test result to a substance abuse professional.
   (C)   This drug and alcohol testing policy and procedures subchapter is
provided to help employees n their representative better understand the
requirements. A copy of this policy shall be distributed to all current safety-
sensitive transit employees, posted on division bulletin boards, available on-
line via request, and issued to each new safety-sensitive employee as part of a
general orientation procedure.
   (D)   The policy and testing program described has been updated to include
all FTA and DOT rule changes, interpretations, and clarifications published
through September 30, 2001.
   (E)   The city is dedicated to assuring equitable application of this
policy. Therefore, supervisors and mangers are required to use and apply all
aspects of this policy in an unbiased and impartial manner. Any supervisor/
manager who knowingly disregards the requirements, or is found to deliberately
misuse the policy in regard to employees, will be subject to disciplinary
action, up to an including termination.
   (F)   The FTA regulation requires each employer to give each employee
subject to this policy at least 60 minutes of training on the effects and
consequences of prohibited drug use on his or her personal health, safety, and
the work environment, and the signs and symptoms that may indicate prohibited
drug use. Additionally, each employer must provide to ever supervisor who may
make reasonable suspicion determinations at least 60 minutes of training on the
physical, behavioral and performance indicators of probable drug use and at
least 60 minutes of training on the physical, behavioral, speech, and
performance indications of alcohol misuse.

(Ord. 1399, passed 3-20-02)
§ 34.97 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   This policy applies to all safety-sensitive employees, volunteers and
contractors, and other employees when they are on transit property or
performing transit-related business. This policy applies to off-site lunch
periods or breaks when the employee is scheduled to return to duty. A safety-
sensitive function is any duty related to the safe operation of transportation
services including the operation, dispatch, and maintenance or repair of a
revenue service vehicle, whether or not the vehicle is in revenue service, and
other employees whose job functions require they hold a commercial driver’s
license or provide armed security.
   (B)   Listed below are the city positions determined to be safety-sensitive.

   (C)   Employees included in the above-listed labor classifications must
participate in a drug and alcohol testing program as a condition of employment.
   (D)   This policy is effective upon receipt and continues in effect until
superseded or canceled by competent authority.
(Ord. 1399, passed 3-20-02)
§ 34.98 PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES.
   (A)   Illegally used controlled substances and drugs. Controlled substances
are any illegal drug or substance identified in Schedules I through V of
Section 202 of the Controlled Substance Act (21 USC 8121), and as further
defined in 21 CFR 1300. These substances include, but are not limited to,
marijuana, amphetamines, opiates, phencyclidine, and cocaine, as well as any
drug not approved for medical use by the Drug Enforcement Administration or the
Food and Drug Administration. Illegal use includes use of illegally-obtained
prescription drugs.
   (B)   Legal drugs. The use of legally-prescribed drugs or nonprescription
medications is not prohibited. A legally-prescribed drug means that the
individual has a prescription or other written approval from a physician for
the use of the drug in the course of medical treatment. It must include the
patient’s name, the substance, quantity/amount to be taken, and the period of
authorized use. However, the use of any substance that carries a warning label
that mental functioning, motor skill or judgment may be affected adversely
should be reported to supervisory personnel, and medical advice should be
sought, as applicable, before performing work-related duties. The misuse or
abuse of legal drugs while performing transit business is prohibited.
   (C)   Alcohol. The use of products containing alcohol or substances
including any medication, mouthwash, food, candy, or any other substance such
that alcohol is present in the body while performing transit business is
prohibited.
(Ord. 1399, passed 3-20-02)
§ 34.99 PROHIBITED CONDUCT.
   (A)   No person covered by this policy shall engage in the manufacture,
distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of prohibited substances on
transit property, in transit vehicles, in uniform, or while on transit
business. Law enforcement officials shall be notified when criminal activity is
suspected.
   (B)   Employees found to be under the influence of a prohibited substance or
who test positive for a prohibited drug or alcohol concentration shall be
immediately removed from duty. Any safety-sensitive employee who is reasonably
suspected of being intoxicated, impaired, under the influence of a prohibited
substance, or not fit for duty shall be removed from duty pending verification
of condition.
   (C)   A drug or alcohol lost is considered positive if the individual is
found to have a quantifiable presence of a prohibited substance in the body
above minimum thresholds defined in 49 CFR Part 40.
   (D)   No safety-sensitive emp1oyee should report for duty or remain on duty
when his or her ability to function could be adversely affected by alcohol. No
employee shall be permitted to perform assigned safety- sensitive duties when
his or her breath alcohol concentration is 0.02 or greater. No safety-sensitive
employee shall use alcohol within four hours of reporting for duty, while on
call, or while on duty.
   (E)   All safety-sensitive employees will be subject to urine drug testing
and breath alcohol testing at any time while on duty. Any safety-sensitive
employee who refuses to comply with request for testing, who provides false
information in connection with a test, or who attempts to falsify results
through tampering, contamination, adulteration, or substitution shall be
immediately removed from duty. Refusal can include an inability to provide a
urine specimen or breath sample without valid medical explanation, as well as a
verbal declaration, obstructive behavior, or physical absence resulting in an
inability to conduct a test. Such refusal constitutes a positive result.
   (F)   Pursuant to the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, employees must notify
the transit system within five days of a criminal drug statute conviction.
Failure to comply constitutes a violation of this policy.
(Ord. 1399, passed 3-20-02)
§ 34.100 TESTING FOR PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES.
   (A)   The specific drugs that will be tested for are marijuana, cocaine,
opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine. An initial drug screen using
immunoassay techniques will be conducted in each specimen. For those specimens
which indicate one or more prohibited substances present, a confirmatory gas
chromatography/mass spectronomy (GC/MS) test will be performed. The test will
be considered positive if the amount present is equal or above the minimum
threshold established in 49 CFR Part40.
   (B)   Alcohol testing will be conducted using a National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA)-approved evidential breath testing (EBT) device
operated by a trained alcohol breath technician (BAT). Breath alcohol
concentration (BAC) is expressed in terms of grams of alcohol per 210 liters of
breath. If any initial test indicates a BAC of 0.02 or greater, a second test
will be performed to confirm the result. It is city policy that any employee
whose BAC is confirmed at 0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04, will be
suspended from duty for the remainder of his or her shift, which period shall
be not less than eight hours. A BAC of 0.04 or greater will be considered a
positive alcohol test result.
   (C)   The testing described in this policy will be independent and separate
from all other testing performed on behalf of the city and/or prevailing
federal, state and local requirements. All covered employees are subject to
testing for prohibited drug use and misuse of alcohol in the following
situations and/or circumstances:
      (1)   Pre-employment.
         (a)   All applicants for employment must first pass a pre-employment
drug test before being permitted to perform any safety-sensitive job function.
Also, an employee absent 90 consecutive days or longer, regardless of reason,
who has not been subject to random testing during that time will be required to
undergo pre-employment drug testing prior to resuming safety-sensitive duties.
         (b)   Employees or applicants must undergo pre-employment drug testing
before assignment to any position which requires the performance of safety-
sensitive duties. Only urine drug testing is required, and the result of pre-
employment drug testing must be a verified negative. Failure of a pre-
employment drug test will disqualify the applicant for employment or transfer.
Evidence of the absence of dependency from an accredited substance abuse
professional is required prior to further consideration for possible employment
in a safety-sensitive position.
         (c)   Applicants to safety-sensitive positions will be asked if they
have failed or refused to submit to pre-employment testing at any other DOT-
regulated employer in the past two years, regardless of hiring action, and will
be required to authorize the release of information regarding past drug and
alcohol testing during the past two years.
      (2)   Random.
         (a)   All safety-sensitive employees are subject to random drug and/or
alcohol testing at any time they are on duty and during all time periods that
safety-sensitive functions are being performed. Testing must be unannounced and
unpredictable. Once notified of a random testing requirement the employee must
proceed directly to the testing site.
         (b)   At least 50% of the total number of covered employees must be
tested each year for the use of prohibited drugs, and at least 10% tested for
alcohol. To satisfy this quota, all city safety-sensitive employees are
enrolled in a random testing pool, which may include a number of contractor
employees who perform safety-sensitive functions for or on behalf of the city.
         (c)   The frequency of testing is based upon the number of employees
in the pool and spread throughout the year, The odds of being selected in any
given selection cycle for a random drug and/or alcohol test are equal to the
number of employees enrolled in the pool at the time.
         (d)   An Occu-Med computer configured with a random number generator
selects employees for testing. It is possible that an employee could be
selected more than once during the year or even in consecutive selection
cycles.
      (3)   Reasonable suspicion. All safety-sensitive employees are subject to
drug and/or alcohol testing when there is reason to believe that drug or
alcohol use is adversely affecting job performance. Such determination will be
made on the basis of specific, contemporaneous, articulable observation
concerning the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odor of a covered
employee. The referral determination will be made by a supervisor trained to
detect the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol use and who reasonably
concludes than the employee may be adversely affected or impaired in his or her
work performance due to prohibited drug use or alcohol misuse.
      (4)   Post-accident testing.
         (a)   The operator of a transit vehicle is required to undergo drug
and alcohol testing if involved in any “occurrence” associated with the
operation of the vehicle, whether or not the vehicle is in revenue service that
results in the loss of human life. Testing shall also be required for other
safety-sensitive employees on duty in the vehicle at the time as well as any
other employee whose performance of duty could have contributed to the
accident.
         (b)   Post-accident testing also must be conducted if any non-fatal
accident results in injuries requiring a person or persons being transported to
a medical treatment facility or if one or more vehicles incurs disabling damage
that requires towing from the site, unless the employee’s performance can be
completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident. Employees
tested under this provision include not only the vehicle operator, but any
other covered employee whose performance could be a contributing factor, as
determined by the city and upon review and approval of the Director or his or
her designee.
         (c)   Post-accident testing must be conducted as soon as possible for
alcohol within (2 hours of the time of accident not to exceed 8 hours), and
within 32 hours for drugs.
         (d)   Any safety-sensitive employee involved in an accident must
refrain from alcohol use for eight hours following the accident or until
completion of a post-accident test or upon release by a supervisor. A safety
sensitive employee who leaves the scene of an accident without justifiable
explanation prior to submitting to drug and alcohol testing or who fails to
report to the collection facility within a reasonable time frame will be
considered to have refused to test.
(Ord. 1399, passed 3-20-02)
§ 34.101 SAFEGUARDS AND ASSURANCES.
   (A)   Testing shall be conducted in such a manner to assure the highest
degree of accuracy and reliability, and using techniques, equipment, and
laboratory facilities certified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services(DHHS). All testing will be conducted consistent with the procedures
set forth in DOT regulation 49 CFR Part 40.
   (B)   All test results for prohibited drugs must be verified by a Medical
Review Officer (MRO). The MRO is a licensed physician functioning independent
of the city, whose qualifications include a demonstrated knowledge of substance
abuse disorders and who has appropriate medical training to interpret and
evaluate an individual’s confirmed positive drug result together with his or
her medical history and any other relevant biomedical information. All test
results must be verified by a qualified breath alcohol technician (BAT).
   (C)   Any employee may request that a representative be present in certain
activities related to the collection of specimens and during administrative
review and/or counseling, subject to the conditions imposed by 49 CFR Part 40.
The absence of such representations does not, by itself, negate or mitigate the
requirement to provide specimens and/or attend such review and counsel in
response to required drug and alcohol testing.
   (D)   Federal regulations impose strict procedural controls and accounting
mechanisms upon the collection site processing laboratory, the MRO, and the
transit system with respect to testing for prohibited drugs and alcohol. These
procedures require the use of tamper-proof specimen containers for urine
samples, employee certification of “ownership,” use of chain-of-custody
documentation, regimented quality control standards, including blank-air
testing for EBT devices and blind samples for urine testing, equipment
calibration testing, and specific certification and training standards.
   (E)   Only confirmatory tests will be used as evidence of prohibited drug
use or alcohol misuse. Testing which does not follow criteria outlined in 49
CFR Part 40 must be invalidated, or canceled, and reported as a negative
result. As a matter of policy, any urine specimen reported to the MRO as a
negative dilute will necessitate a retest. As a further safeguard, an employee
who questions a positive result of a required drug test tray request the MRO to
perform a second. separate test of the original specimen. The test must be
conducted at a different DHHS-certified laboratory and must utilize a split
sample that was provided at the same time as the original specimen. All costs
for such testing are paid by the employee unless the second test produces a
negative result. Inability to pay the cost of split specimen testing will not,
however, deny anyone the right to request such testing.
   (F)   The employee’s request for split specimen testing must be made in
writing within 72 hours of notice of the initial test result. Requests after 72
hours will be accepted if the delay was beyond the control of the employee and
reason for such delay is acceptable to the MRO.
   (G)   All test results are treated as confidential medical information. and
are handled only by designated personnel within the city who have a specific
need to know. Test results are not releaseable except as authorized by the
employee concerned, as required by the National Transportation Safety Board
during an accident investigation, as directed by the U.S. Department of
Transportation or a DOT agency with regulatory authority over the city, or to
the decision maker in a lawsuit, grievance, or other proceeding initiated by pr
on behalf of the employee.
   (H)   The employee has the right to review his or her alcohol testing
records, provide information to dispute the results, and shall have access to
any pertinent record such as equipment calibration records and records of
laboratory certifications. Copies of these records shall be made available to
the employee upon his or her written request.
   (I)   The application of this policy with respect to drug and alcohol
testing does not abridge anything included in a labor agreement, nor does it
infringe upon the employee’s right to redress under grievance, administrative,
or judicial proceedings.
(Ord. 1399, passed 3-20-02)
§ 34.102   EMPLOYEE ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   Any safety-sensitive employee who tests positive for the presence of a
prohibited drug or alcohol must be evaluated by a substance abuse professional
(SAP) before returning to duty. A SAP is a licensed or certified physician,
psychologist, social worker, employee assistance professional, or addiction
counselor with knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and
treatment of drug and/or alcohol related disorders. The SAP will evaluate each
employee to determine what assistance, if any, the employee needs in resolving
associated problems. Assessment by a SAP does not shield an employee from
disciplinary action or guarantee employment or reinstatement with the city.
   (B)   If after a positive test result a safety-sensitive employee is allowed
to return to duty, the employee must properly follow the rehabilitation program
prescribed by the SAP, pass a return-to-duty drug and alcohol test, and agree
to be subject to a minimum of 6 unannounced follow-up tests for a period of at
least 12 months, and up to 5 years, from date of return to duty.
   (C)   If unavailable for follow-up testing due to approved leave of absence,
seasonal layoff, out or reassigned for worker’s compensation, temporary
assignment to non safety-sensitive duties or combination thereof for 30
consecutive days or longer, the employee shall be reevaluated by the SAP to
determine if the requirement/term of treatment and return to work agreement
shall be extended accordingly. The cost of treatment or rehabilitation services
is the responsibility of the employee or insurance provider.
   (D)   No employee who has tested positive may reenter the workforce without
agreeing to a last chance/rehabilitation regiment. However, such an agreement
is not an entitlement. This agreement may include, but is not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   A release to work statement from the substance abuse professional,
together with satisfactory evidence, of a verified negative test for drugs and/
or alcohol;
      (2)   A statement of agreement to comply with federal and city
requirements for treatment, aftercare and specified follow-up testing;
      (3)   A statement of expected work-related behaviors; and/or
      (4)   The agreement that any violation of the last chance/rehabilitation
agreement will result in a separation from employment.
(Ord. 1399, passed 3-20-02)
§ 34.103 CONSEQUENCES, PENALTIES AND SANCTIONS.
   (A)   Irrespective of possible criminal and/or civil proceedings which may
arise as a result of prohibited drug use or alcohol misuse, the city reserves
the right to apply administrative penalties and sanctions against an employee
who violates any rule encompassed by this policy.
   (B)   Minimum associated consequences of prohibited drug use and/or alcohol
misuse are as follows:
      (1)   Removal from duty. (remainder of the day or work shift for a
minimum of eight consecutive hours):
         (a)   Reporting for or remaining on duty with a BAC(breath alcohol
concentration) of 0.02 or greater; or
         (b)   Consumption of alcohol within four hours of reporting or
returning to duty.
      (2)   Referral to a SAP. A positive test result for a prohibited drug or
a BAC of 0.04 or greater; or
      (3)   Dismissal. Violation under one or more of the following
circumstances or conditions constitutes a severe affront to the safety and
well-being of other employees and the general public, and is punishable as a
major infraction of policy under “due cause proceedings.”
         (a)   Engaging in the manufacture, distribution, dispensing,
possession, and/or use of a prohibited substance on transit division property,
in transit vehicles, in uniform, or while on transit division business;
         (b)   Refusal to submit to drug alcohol testing, including the
inability to provide an adequate specimen or breath sample without valid
medical explanation;
         (c)   Leaving the scene of an accident without proper authority,
resulting in the inability to conduct drug and/or alcohol testing;
         (d)   Obstructive behavior, providing false information in connection
with a test, or attempting, to falsify test results through tampering,
contamination, adulteration, or substitution of specimen samples;
         (e)   Failure to comply with transit system requirement for treatment
or with a prescribed aftercare program; and/or
         (f)   Failure to notify the city within five days of any criminal drug
statute conviction.
(Ord. 1399, passed 3-20-02)

   (B)   Process.
      (1)   Competitive bid. For bid evaluation purposes, vendors that meet the
definition of local Pembroke Pines vendor, as defined herein, shall be given a

submits a bid/quote that is within 5% of the lowest price submitted by any
vendor, the local Pembroke Pines vendor shall have an option to submit another
bid which is at least 1% lower than the lowest responsive bid/quote. If the
local Pembroke Pines vendor submits a bid which is at least 1% lower than that
lowest responsive bid/quote, then the award will go to the local Pembroke Pines
vendor. If not, the award will be made to the vendor that submits the lowest
responsive bid/quote. If the lowest responsive and responsible bidder IS a
local Pembroke Pines vendor, the award will be made to that vendor and no other
bidders will be given an opportunity to submit additional bids as described
herein.
      (2)   For bid evaluation purposes, vendors that meet the definition of
local Broward County vendor, as detailed herein, shall be given a 2.5%
evaluation credit. This shall mean that if a local Broward County vendor
submits a bid/quote that is within 2.5% of the lowest price submitted by any
vendor, the local Broward County vendor shall have an option to submit another
bid which is at least 1% lower than the lowest responsive bid/quote. If the
local Broward County vendor submits a bid which is at least 1% lower than that
lowest responsive bid/quote, then the award will go to the local Broward County
vendor. If not, the award will be made to the vendor that submits the lowest
responsive bid/quote. If the lowest responsive and responsible bidder is a
local Pembroke Pines vendor, the award will be made to that vendor and no other
bidders will be given an opportunity to submit additional bids as described
herein.
      (3)   If there is a local Pembroke Pines vendor and a local Broward
County vendor participating in the same bid solicitation and both vendors
qualify to submit a second bid as detailed above, the local Pembroke Pines
vendor will be given first option. If the local Pembroke Pines vendor cannot
beat the lowest bid received by at least 1%, an opportunity will be given to
the local Broward County vendor. If the local Broward County vendor cannot beat
the lowest bid by at least 1%, then the bid will be awarded to the lowest
bidder regardless of geographic location of the business.
      (4)   If multiple local Pembroke Pines vendors submit bids/quotes which
are within 5% of the lowest bid/quote, then all vendors will be asked to submit
a best and final offer (BAFO). The award will be made to the local Pembroke
Pines vendor submitting the lowest BAFO providing that that BAFO is at least 1%
lower than the lowest bid/quote received in the original solicitation. If no
local Pembroke Pines vendor can beat the lowest bid/quote by at least 1 %, then
the process will be repeated with all local Broward County vendors who have
submitted a bid/quote which is within 2.5% of the lowest bid/quote. If no local
Pembroke Pines vendor and no local Broward County vendor can submit a BAFO that
is at least 1% lower than the lowest bid/quote submitted in the original

responsive bid/quote. If the lowest responsive and responsible bidder IS a

§
35.36 of this Code, entitled "Local Vendor Preference", then the award will be
made to that vendor and no other bidders will be given an opportunity to submit
additional bids as described herein.
      (2)   If there is a local Pembroke Pines vendor, a local Broward County
vendor, and a veteran owned small business participating in the same bid

protest is denied, the entire bond amount shall be forfeited to the city.

the Purchasing Manager shall stay the award of the purchase order or contract
until the protest is resolved, unless the Purchasing Manager determines in
writing that compelling circumstances exist which require that the award be
processed without further delay, in order to protect the city’s interest or for
the purpose of avoiding an immediate and serious danger to the public health,
safety or welfare.
   (G)   After receipt of the timely filed and complete written protest, and
upon the protester’s request, the Purchasing Manager shall meet with the
protester to discuss the allegations and to attempt to resolve the matter. The

three business days of issuance of the Purchasing Manager’s decision. The
appeal must be in writing and must include a full explanation of the basis of
disagreement with the decision rendered by the Purchasing Manager, as well as
the relief sought. The City Manager shall overturn the selection if the
protester proves that the selection did not comply in material respects with
the requirements contained in the invitation to bid, request for proposal,
request for qualifications or request for letters of interest; with this
procurement code, or with Florida law. The decision of the City Manager shall
be final. The City Manager’s decision shall be e-mailed to the protester on the
date of issuance unless otherwise directed by the protester.
   (I)   Failure by a bidder to comply with the timelines and requirements set
forth herein shall result in an immediate invalidation and termination of the
protest and a waiver of the right to seek further redress or to appeal the
alleged adverse action in a court of law.

protest pursuant to this section shall be the sole responsibility of the
protesting party.

made reasonable efforts to provide such benefits. The affidavit shall state the
efforts taken to provide such benefits and the amount of the cash equivalent.

bidder does not comply with the requirements of this section.
         (b)   Where more than one solicitation response is received, but the
responses demonstrate that none of the proposers can comply with the

would not have been listed as a requirement in the solicitation specifications.
         (c)   Where the bid price or proposal price as submitted by the lowest
responsive bidder which complies with the requirements of this section is at

designating the nature of the work; the location of the work; the part or
portion of the cost to be paid by special assessment; the manner in which
special assessments shall be made; when such assessments are to be paid, and

improvement cost, which assessment plat, preliminary plans and specifications,
and estimate shall be open to the inspection of the public.

bids for construction of the improvement in a newspaper of general circulation
in the municipality and include in such advertisement the Intent Resolution
number and title, except in cases where the work will be performed pursuant to
an agreement with another public agency or a publicly regulated utility agency.
All such bids shall conform to the city bid procedures then in effect.

§ 36.14 LEVYING OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   Upon completion of the Preliminary Assessment Roll, the city shall by

improvement, and the amount to be assessed against each property so improved.
The City Clerk shall provide written notice of such hearing to each of the
property owners whose property is subject to being assessed. Such notice shall
be provided by first class U.S. mail, postage prepaid, certified with return

publications approximately one week apart in a newspaper of general circulation
in the municipality; the last publication shall appear not less than one week

improved, and advise persons interested that the description of individual
properties to be assessed and the amount of the assessment can be ascertained

of any special assessment levied pursuant to this division shall commence, and
the frequency and amount of any scheduled collections of such assessments upon
determination of the confirmed assessment roll.
   (E)   Upon completion of the improvement, any excess in the special
assessment as originally made, approved and confirmed over the actual cost of
the improvement to be paid by such special assessment, shall be credited
proportionately against each special assessment against each parcel in the
manner set forth in the Assessment Resolution, or used for any lawful purpose.
(Ord. 1094, passed 9-8-94)
§ 36.15. COLLECTION OF PAYMENTS; INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS; CERTIFICATE OF
INDEBTEDNESS.
   (A)   Notice of assessment; collection. Promptly after adoption of the
Assessment Resolution, a statement of the confirmed assessment shall be
provided to each property owner listed on the confirmed roll. The special
assessments shall bear interest and be payable at the time and in the manner
stipulated in the Assessment Resolution, and shall remain liens, co-equal with
the lien of all state, county, district, and municipal taxes, other non-ad
valorem assessments which are duly levied and collected pursuant to the Uniform
Method, superior in dignity to all other liens, titles, and claims, until paid.
The city may elect to either collect its own assessment or to utilize the
Uniform Method.
   (B)   Installment payments. The assessment, subject to the interest provided
in this section, may be satisfied through weekly, monthly or annual
installments as provided for in the Assessment Resolution with such installment
payment period to run not more than ten years from the completion date of the
improvement or such other period as determined in the Assessment Resolution.
Such assessment, together with interest accrued thereon, may be paid in full at
any time and the property owner shall not incur any penalty for prepayment.
   (C)   Certificate issued for failure to pay assessment. In the event the
city elects to collect its own assessments rather than utilize the Uniform
Method whenever assessments are not paid within the time provided in the
Assessment Resolution, a certificate of indebtedness shall be issued for each
assessed lot or parcel. The certificate shall contain a description of the lot
or parcel, the amount of the assessment, a description of the improvement, and
shall identify the Assessment Resolution under which the assessment was made.
Such certificate shall be recorded in the public records of Broward County and
shall constitute a lien co-equal with the lien of all state, county, district
and other municipal taxes, superior in dignity to all other liens, titles and
claims, until paid, and shall bear interest at a rate to be set forth in the
Assessment Resolution.
   (D)   Enforcement of certificate. Upon failure of the property owner to pay
any assessment installment due, any part thereof, or any interest, the
procedures and remedies of the Uniform Method shall apply; or if the city has
opted not to utilize the Uniform Method, then the city may cause the necessary
proceedings to be brought to enforce payment of either the assessment or the
certificate issued under §
36.15(C), together with all accrued interest. As a part of such proceeding, the
city shall be entitled to recover all cost and a reasonable attorney’s fee.
Default in the payment of any installment of the assessment or accrued interest
shall result in the entire assessment plus interest becoming immediately due.
Such foreclosure proceeding shall be instituted and prosecuted under Florida
Statues, Chapters 43 and 173.
   (E)   Validity. In no event shall the amount or validity of the lien or
certificate of indebtedness as provided for by this division be questioned in
any direct or collateral proceeding instituted more than 30 days after the
issuance of such certificate of indebtedness by the city, or such shorter time
as may result from the filing of bond validation proceedings.

§ 36.16 ISSUANCE OF BONDS.
   The city may at any time without an election being held therefor borrow
money and issue bonds therefor in anticipation of the collection of unpaid
special assessments levied or to be levied for the purpose of paying the cost
of special assessment improvements.
(Ord. 1094, passed 9-8-94)
§ 36.17 CONCURRENCY OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   Before paving or otherwise surfacing or resurfacing any street of the city,
the city may, but need not, determine a time certain within which sewer, water,
gas or other underground utility connection must be constructed or not at all,
and shall give notice thereof to the person required to make the connection. If
any person fails to make connection when so required, no permission to make
such connection shall thereafter be granted after the completion of any street
improvement for a period of five years, unless for special reasons approved by
the city. During that period of time, no permits to open or cut the street or
alley shall be issued without such special approval. Required connections
during this period shall be accomplished so as to leave the street improvement
unaffected, using such construction methods as jack and bore. Connections made
shall be subject to the general provisions of this division if they otherwise
meet the definitions and intent of the policy on special assessment
improvements.

§ 36.18 STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Power to improve streets. The city shall have the power to construct,
reconstruct, pave, repair, resurface, widen, provide drainage and gutters and
otherwise upgrade all paved and unpaved streets and alleys within its corporate

by the city for the total cost of such improvement of such city streets and
alleys to standard or for any portion of the cost of such improvement, as
determined by the city.
   (B)   Conditions for improving streets; street paving. All unpaved or
substandard streets that are paved or rebuilt or otherwise improved must be
constructed to city standards and specifications to include curbs and drainage.
The cost of paving unpaved streets will be assessed to and shared between
abutting property owners. If an existing paved street does not have curbs and
drainage, the cost of bringing that street up to standard will be equitably
shared between the city and abutting property owners on either side of the
street, as determined by the city. If an existing paved street requires
widening, whether it has curbs and drainage or not, the cost of standardizing
the street will be shared equitably between the abutting property owners, as
determined by the city.
(Ord. 1094, passed 9-8-94)
§ 36.19 SIDEWALK IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Power to install and improve sidewalks. The city shall have the power

      (2)   Requested by at least 50% of the property owners in a geographic
area.
   (C)   Exception to improvement procedure. Where an existing sidewalk is
broken, raised or otherwise damaged by means other than as a result of a
construction project, then the abutting property shall be assessed only the
cost of materials to repair the sidewalk. The city shall supply the labor to
effect such repair. The cost of repairs for damage caused by construction
projects shall be charged to the person causing such damage.

systems may be installed or improved whenever:
      (1)   The city shall decide for reasons of public health, safety and
welfare that it is in the best interests of the city that storm drainage
systems be installed or improved at any location within the city;
      (2)   The city receives a petition signed by the property owners to be
affected by such storm drainage improvements.
(Ord. 1094, passed 9-8-94)

INTRODUCTION; DEFINITIONS
§ 38.001 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   The employer previously established a defined benefit plan on October
1, 1973.
   (B)   Entry into the Plan was frozen effective January 31, 2010 for
employees who are covered under a collective bargaining agreement with the
employer. After that date, no such employee shall become an active participant,
and no such inactive participant or such former participant shall again become
an active participant, except as stated in this chapter. All employees who are
active participants in the Plan as of such date shall continue to participate
in the Plan including any employee who is hired or rehired as a non-
collectively bargained employee after such date as stated in this chapter. In
addition, any employee promoted to a non-collectively bargained position may
again enter the Plan as an active participant after such date as described
herein.
   (C)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, entry into the Plan is frozen effective
October 1, 2014 for non-collectively bargained employees. After that date, no
such employee shall become an active participant, and no such inactive
participant or such former participant shall again become an active
participant. In addition, no employee who is promoted to a non-collectively
bargained position may again enter the Plan as an active participant after such
date.
   (D)   The accrued benefit for a participant who is covered under a
collective bargaining agreement with the employer was frozen effective June 30,
2010 and no additional benefits shall accrue after such date.
   (E)   The plan is being restated, effective October 1, 2014, and is set
forth in this chapter which is substituted in lieu of the prior chapter with
the exception of any interim amendment and any model amendment that have not
been incorporated into this restatement. Such amendment(s) apply to this
restated Plan until such provisions are integrated into the Plan or such
amendment(s) are superseded by another amendment.
   (F)   It is intended that the restated Plan qualify as a governmental
defined benefit plan under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including any
later amendments to the Code. The employer agrees to operate the Plan according
to the terms, provisions, and conditions set forth in this chapter.
   (G)   The restated Plan continues to be for the exclusive benefit of
employees of the employer. All persons covered under the Plan before the
effective date of this restatement shall continue to be covered under the
restated Plan with no loss of benefits. However, the employer may sponsor other
plans such as a 457 plan or a 401 plan for inactive participants.
   (H)   The Plan includes the statutory, regulatory, and guidance changes
specified in the 2012 Cumulative List of Changes in Plan Qualification
Requirements (2012 Cumulative List) contained in Internal Revenue Service
Notice 2012-76 and the qualification requirements and guidance published before
the issuance of such list. The provisions of this Plan apply as of the
effective date of the restatement unless otherwise specified.
   (I)   According to the provisions of §§
38.070 and
38.090 may amend, change, or terminate the Plan at its option at any time. The
Plan is not a contract and/or a guarantee of employment. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-
7-15)
§ 38.002 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates otherwise
   ACCRUAL SERVICE. The total of an employee's continuous service. This total
is expressed in whole years and fractional parts of a year (counting a complete
month as a fractional part of a year). However, accrual service is modified as
follows:
      (1)   Service after a date excluded: For an employee who is covered under
a collective bargaining agreement with the employer, continuous service accrued
after the date the accrued benefit is frozen (as stated in § 38.001), is
excluded.
      (2)   Service while not an eligible employee excluded: Service while an
employee was not an eligible employee is excluded.
      (3)   Voluntary discontinuance service excluded: Prior to October 1,
1998, service while an employee failed or refused to make a contribution
required under the prior plan is excluded. This provision also applies to an
employee's service while contributions were not made because he failed or
refused to complete a written agreement to make such contributions.
      (4)   Other service excluded:
         (a)   Service for an employee who has a severance from employment and
who is 0% vested in his accrued benefit resulting from employer contributions
other than salary reduction contributions on such date shall be excluded if he
receives a distribution of his required contribution account. Such service
shall not be reinstated in the event he is later reemployed by the employer.
         (b)   Also, service for any participant who was covered under a
collective bargaining agreement with the employer on June 30, 2010, who was
zero percent vested in his accrued benefit resulting from employer
contributions other than salary reduction contributions on such date, and who
is later promoted to a non-collectively bargained position shall be excluded if
he received a distribution of his required contribution account. Such service
shall not be reinstated in the event he again becomes an active participant as
described in §§
38.001 and
38.005.
      (5)   Period of military duty included: A period of military duty shall
be included as service with the employer to the extent it has not already been
credited. Such service shall be deemed to be service as an eligible employee
only if an employee was an eligible employee on the day immediately preceding
the period of military duty.
   ACCRUED BENEFIT. On any date, the amount of monthly retirement benefit under
the normal form accrued by an active participant as of any date and payable at
normal retirement date, or such date, if later. See §
38.025.
   ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM. A form executed by an employee, in which he
acknowledges that he has been informed by the employer that, as a condition of
his employment, the employer will deduct from the employee's compensation, by
regular payroll deductions, an amount equal to 7.25% of his compensation and
pay that amount to the Plan as a contribution by the employee. These
contributions shall be classified as "picked up" by the employer pursuant to
Code Section 414(h) and treated as an employer contribution. Any employee who
participates in this Plan shall be deemed to have entered into this
acknowledgement form. Notwithstanding, after June 30, 2010, for an employee who
is covered under a collective bargaining agreement with the employer, the
percentage of compensation shall be 0%.
   ACTIVE PARTICIPANT. An eligible employee who is actively participating in
the Pan according to the provisions in §
38.005.
   ACTUARIAL EQUIVALENT. Equality in the value of the aggregate amount expected
to be received for benefits payable at different times or under different forms
of distributions.
      (1)   For purposes of determining the amount of a distribution other than
an annual benefit that is nondecreasing for the life of the participant or, in
the case of a preretirement survivor annuity, the life of the participant's
spouse; or that decreases during the life of the participant merely because of
the death of the surviving annuitant (but only if the reduction is to a level
not below 50% of the annual benefit payable before the death of the surviving
annuitant) or merely because of the cessation or reduction of Social Security
supplements or qualified disability payments, actuarial equivalent shall be
determined on the basis of the interest on 30-year Treasury securities for the
look-back month for the stability period and the 1994 Group Annuity Reserve
(GAR) Mortality Table. The look-back month applicable to the stability period
is the second calendar month preceding the first day of the stability period.
The stability period is the successive period of one calendar month that
contains the annuity starting date for the distribution, and for which the
interest rate remains constant.
      (2)   For purposes of determining benefits not described in division (1)
of this definition, actuarial equivalent for benefits shall be determined on
the basis of 7.5% interest and the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table as set
forth in Revenue Ruling 95-6, 1995-1 C.B. 80.
      (3)   In any event, the preceding divisions (1) and (2) of this
definition shall not apply to the extent they would cause the Plan to fail to
satisfy the requirements of §§
38.026 and
38.027.
      (4)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan to the contrary,
effective for distributions with Annuity Starting Dates on or after December
31, 2002, but prior to January 1, 2008, the Applicable Mortality Table used for
purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation under Code sections 415(b)(2)
(B), (C), or (D) is the table prescribed in Revenue Ruling 2001-62.
   AFFILIATED SERVICE GROUP. Any group of corporations, partnerships or other
organizations of which the employer is a part and that is affiliated within the
meaning of Code Section 414(m) and the regulations thereunder. The term
CONTROLLED GROUP, as it is used in this Plan, shall include the term AFFILIATED
SERVICE GROUP.
   ALTERNATE PAYEE. Any spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a
participant who is recognized by a qualified domestic relations order as having
a right to receive all, or a portion of, the benefits payable under the Plan
with respect to such participant.
   ANNUITY CONTRACT. The annuity contract or contracts into which the employer
enters with the insurer for guaranteed benefits, for the investment of
contributions in separate accounts, and for the payment of benefits under this
Plan.
   ANNUITY STARTING DATE.  
      (1)   The first day of the first period for which an amount is payable to
the participant as an annuity or any other form.
      (2)   The annuity starting date for disability benefits shall be the date
such benefits commence if the disability benefit is not an auxiliary benefit.
An auxiliary benefit is a disability benefit that does not reduce the benefit
payable at normal retirement date.
   APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE. On any given date, the rate of interest set forth
in Code Section 417(e)(3).
      (1)   The applicable interest rate shall be the adjusted first, second,
and third segment rates applied under Code Section 430(h)(2)(C) (without the
24-month averaging under Code Section 430(h)(2)(D) and determined without
regard to the adjustment for the 25-year average segment rates provided in Code
Section 30(h)(2)(C)(iv)) for the look-back month before the first day of the
stability period, or such other time as the Secretary may by regulations
prescribe. The look-back month and stability period are defined in the
definition of actuarial equivalent. For this purpose, the first, second, and
third segment rates are the first, second, and third segment rates which would
be determined under Code Section 430(h)(2)(C) if:
         (a)   Code Section 430(h)(2)(D) were applied by substituting the
average yields for the month described above for the average yields for the 24-
month period described in such section;
         (b)   Code Section 430(h)(2)(G)(i)(II) were applied by substituting
"Section 417(e)(3)(A)(ii)(II)" for "Section 412(b)(5)(B)(ii)(II)"; and
         (c)   The applicable percentage under Code Section 430(h)(2)(G) is
treated as being 20% in 2008, 40% in 2009, 60% in 2010, and 80% in 2011.
      (2)   A plan amendment that changes the date for determining the
applicable interest rate (including an indirect change such as the result of a
change in Plan year when the stability period is the Plan year), shall not be
given effect with respect to any distribution during the period ending one year
after the later of the amendment's effective date or adoption date, if, during
such period and as a result of such amendment, the participant's distribution
would be reduced.
   APPLICABLE MORTALITY TABLE. On any date, the table according to the method
set forth in Code Section 417(e)(3).
   AVERAGE COMPENSATION.  
      (1)   On any given date, the average of an employee's monthly
compensation for those two highest compensation years (all compensation years,
if less than two) ending before such given date.
      (2)   However, the average compensation for an employee who is covered
under a collective bargaining agreement with the employer shall be his frozen
average compensation determined as of the date the accrued benefit is frozen as
stated in §
38.001. In determining such employee's frozen average compensation as of the
date the accrued benefit is frozen, compensation years ending after that date
shall be disregarded.
   BENEFICIARY. The person or persons named by a participant to receive any
benefits under the Plan when the participant dies. See §
38.095.
   CODE. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
   COMPENSATION. A participant's wages, regular longevity pay, auto allowance,
and overtime income before contributions are deducted due to taxes, voluntary
contributions, or deferred compensation plans.
      (1)   Compensation shall also include differential wage payments.
      (2)   Except as provided herein, compensation for a specified period is
the compensation actually paid or made available (or if earlier, includible in
gross income) during such period.
      (3)   Compensation for a Plan year shall also include compensation paid
by the later of two and one-half months after an employee's severance from
employment with the employer maintaining the Plan or the end of the Plan year
that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment with the
employer maintaining the Plan, if the payment is regular compensation for
services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for
services outside the employee’s regular working hours (such as overtime or
shift differential), commissions, bonuses, or other similar payments, and,
absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the
employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer.
      (4)   Any payments not described above shall not be considered
compensation if paid after severance from employment, even if they are paid by
the later of two and one-half months after the date of severance from
employment or the end of the Plan year that includes the date of severance from
employment.
      (5)   Back pay, within the meaning of section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8) of the
regulations, shall be treated as compensation for the Plan year to which the
back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation
that would otherwise be included in this definition.
      (6)   Compensation paid or made available during a specified period shall
include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation, but for an
election under Code Section 125(a), 132(f)(4), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k),
or 457(b). Compensation shall also include employee contributions "picked up"
by a governmental entity and, pursuant to Code Section 414(h)(2), treated as
employer contributions.
      (7)   Compensation shall exclude any lump sum payments for accrued sick
leave or vacation made as of the date he has a severance from employment or the
date he retires.
      (8)   The annual compensation of each participant taken into account in
determining contributions and benefits for any determination period (the period
over which compensation is determined) shall not exceed $200,000, as adjusted
for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). The
cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any
determination period beginning with or within such calendar year.
      (9)   Provided, however, with respect to an eligible participant, the
reduced dollar limitation in the preceding division (8) of this definition does
not apply to the extent that the amount of compensation allowed to be taken
into account under the Plan is reduced below the amount that was allowed to be
taken into account under the Plan in effect on July 1, 1993. For this purpose,
"eligible participant" means an individual who first became a participant in
the Plan during a Plan year beginning before the first yearly date in 1996.
      (10)   If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the
annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual
compensation limit multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is
the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of
the fraction is 12.
      (11)   If compensation for any prior determination period is taken into
account in determining a participant's contributions or benefits for the
current Plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is
subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that
determination period. For this purpose, in determining contributions and
benefits in Plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, the annual
compensation limit in effect for determination periods beginning before that
date is $150,000 for any determination period beginning in 1996 or earlier;
$160,000 for any determination period beginning in 1997, 1998, or 1999; and
$170,000 for any determination period beginning in 2000 or 2001, for a
participant who is not an "eligible participant" (as defined above).
      (12)   For this purpose, in determining contributions or benefits in Plan
years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, the annual compensation limit in
effect for determination periods beginning before January 1, 1990 is $200,000
for a participant who is an "eligible participant" (as defined above).
   COMPENSATION YEAR. The period used to determine compensation. The
compensation year is the one-year period ending on each September 30.
   CONTINGENT ANNUITANT. An individual named by the participant to receive a
life time benefit after the participant's death in accordance with a
survivorship life annuity.
   CONTINUOUS SERVICE. For an employee, any period of uninterrupted service
with the employer. However, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise,
continuous service means his latest period of uninterrupted service.
      (1)   For purposes of this definition, no interruption in service will
occur because of approved periods of absence from the employer due to temporary
lay-off; leave of absence (not to exceed one year), a temporary absence due to
illness or injury, pregnancy, or disability.
      (2)   When necessary, the employer shall use uniform, nondiscriminatory
guidelines for determining an approved leave of absence.
   CONTRIBUTIONS. Employer contributions, salary reduction contributions, and
participant contributions as set out in §§
38.015 through
38.018, unless the context clearly indicates only specific contributions are
meant.
   CONTROLLED GROUP. Any group of corporations, trades, or businesses of which
the employer is a part that is under common control. A controlled group
includes any group of corporations, trades, or businesses, whether or not
incorporated, that is either a parent-subsidiary group, a brother-sister group,
or a combined group within the meaning of Code Section 414(b), Code Section 414
(c) and the regulations thereunder and, for purposes of determining benefit
limitations under §
38.027, as modified by Code Section 415(h). The term CONTROLLED GROUP, as it is
used in this Plan, shall include the term affiliated service group and any
other employer required to be aggregated with the employer under Code Section
414(o) and the regulations thereunder.
   DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PLAN. The optional program of transferring
accrued retirement benefits to a separate account within the Plan on a deferred
basis while remaining in the active employment of the employer.
   DESIGNATED BENEFICIARY. The individual who is designated by the participant
(or the participant's surviving spouse) as the beneficiary of the participant's
interest under the Plan and who is the designated beneficiary under Code
Section 401(a)(9) and Section 1.401(a)(9)-4 of the regulations.
   DIFFERENTIAL WAGE PAYMENTS. Any payments that are made by an employer to an
individual with respect to any period during which the individual is performing
qualified military service while on active duty for a period of more than 30
days. Such payments shall be made in accordance with Code Section 3401(h) and
represent all or a portion of the wages the individual would have received from
the employer if the individual were performing service for the employer.
   DIRECT ROLLOVER. A payment by the Plan to the eligible retirement plan

relations order, as defined in Code Section 414(p), are distributees with
regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. A distributee includes
the employee's (or former employee's) nonspouse designated beneficiary, in
which case, the distribution can only be transferred to a traditional IRA or
Roth IRA established on behalf of the nonspouse designated beneficiary and that
will be treated as an inherited IRA pursuant to the provisions of Code Section
402(c)(11).
   DOMESTIC PARTNER. One of the two adults who are considered to be "domestic
partners" by the employer (i.e. the City of Pembroke Pines) pursuant to

Section 410(b)(6)(C) transaction, that employee shall not be an eligible
employee during the period beginning on the date of the transaction and ending
on the last day of the first Plan year beginning after the date of the
transaction. This period is called the transition period. The transition period
may end earlier if there is a significant change in the coverage under the Plan
or if the employer chooses to cover all similarly situated employees as of an
earlier date. A Code Section 410(b)(6)(C) transaction is an asset or stock
acquisition, merger, or similar transaction involving a change in the employer
of the employees of a trade or business.
   ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLAN. An eligible plan under Code Section 457(b) that is
maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or

traditional IRA, a Roth IRA, an annuity plan described in Code Section 403(a),
an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), or a qualified plan
described in Code Section 401(a), that accepts the distributee's eligible
rollover distribution. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also
apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or

order, as defined in Code Section 414(p).
   ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTION.  
      (1)   Any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit
of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not
include: (i) any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal
periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or
life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life
expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary,
or for a specified period of ten years or more; (ii) any distribution to the
extent such distribution is required under Code Section 401(a)(9); (iii) the

with respect to employer securities); and (iv) any other distribution(s) that
is reasonably expected to total less than $200 during a year.
      (2)   A portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible
rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee
contributions that are not includible in gross income. However, such portion
may be transferred only to (i) a traditional individual retirement account or
annuity described in Code Section 408(a) or (b) (a "traditional IRA"); (ii) a

separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible
in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so
includible.

who is an employee on the date he becomes disabled shall be 100%. The vesting
percentage for a participant who becomes disabled while performing qualified

percentage is changed, the new schedule shall not apply to a participant unless
he is credited with an hour of service with the employer on or after the date

collective bargaining agreement with the employer on June 30, 2010, who was 0%
vested in his accrued benefit resulting from employer contributions other than

reinstated in the event he again becomes an active participant as described in
§§
38.001 and
38.005.

than salary reduction contributions, his salary reduction contributions, plus
interest at the rate in effect on June 30, 2010, shall be returned to such
participant. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-15)

subject to the modifications below, will be equal to the following:
      (1)   An amount equal to 2.85% of his average compensation for each year
of his accrual service. Such amount shall not exceed 80% of his average
compensation.
   (B)   Notwithstanding the above, for a participant who retired or was an
inactive participant prior to October 1, 1998, his monthly accrued benefit as
of any date is an amount equal to the sum of divisions (B)(1), (B)(2), and (B)
(3) below:
      (1)   Two percent of his average compensation multiplied by his accrual
service before October 1, 1980.
      (2)   The product of divisions (B)(2)(a) and (B)(2)(b) below:
         (a)   An amount equal to division (B)(2)(a)1. or (B)(2)(a)2. below:
            1.   Two percent of his average compensation, for a participant
making required contributions of 2%.
            2.   Two and one-half percent of his average compensation, for a
participant making required contributions of 5%.
         (b)   His accrual service on and after October 1, 1980 and before
October 1, 1982.
      (3)   The product of divisions (B)(3)(a) and (B)(3)(b) below:

      (1)   An active participant's monthly accrued benefit shall be reduced by
the amount of deferred monthly retirement benefit under the normal form
beginning on his normal retirement date in lieu of which he has received a
single sum payment under the Plan.
      (2)   After the date the accrued benefit is frozen (as stated in §
38.001), no additional benefits shall accrue under the Plan.
      (3)   In no event shall an employee who retires from employment with the
employer, who receives a retirement benefit from such employment, and who is
rehired by the employer be deemed to be an eligible employee for purposes of
participating in this Plan to receive an increased or second benefit under this
Plan.
      (4)   If the employer rehires a participant after the participant's
retirement date, any monthly retirement benefits he is receiving shall continue
unchanged. If he also becomes an active participant, there shall be no
duplication of benefits for him under this Plan. See §
38.030.
      (5)   The participant's accrued benefit resulting from employer
contributions is equal to the participant's total accrued benefit reduced by
his required contribution accrued benefit. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-15)
§ 38.026 REQUIRED CONTRIBUTION ACCRUED BENEFIT.
   An active participant's required contribution accrued benefit is the accrued
monthly benefit derived from his required contributions. On any date, his
required contribution accrued benefit shall be determined as follows:
   (A)   Step one. Determine the amount of the participant's required
contribution account on such date.
   (B)   Step two. Add to the amount determined in step one, interest
compounded annually at the interest rate used to determine present value for
the period beginning with the determination date and ending on the date on
which the participant reaches his normal retirement date. Convert the amount
thus accumulated to a monthly retirement benefit under the normal form using
the interest rate and mortality table used to determine present value. (Ord.
1806, passed 1-7- 15)
§ 38.027 BENEFIT LIMITATION.
   Benefits under the Plan shall be limited in accordance with Code Section 415
and the regulations thereunder. The limitations of this section shall apply in
limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, except as otherwise
provided herein.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of determining the benefit limitation set
forth in this section, the following terms are defined:
      ANNUAL BENEFIT.  
         (a)   A benefit that is payable annually in the form of a straight
life annuity. Except as provided below, where a benefit is payable in a form
other than a straight life annuity, the benefit shall be adjusted to an
actuarially equivalent straight life annuity that begins at the same time as
such other form of benefit and is payable on the first day of each month,
before applying the limitations of this section. For a participant who has or
will have distributions commencing at more than one annuity starting date, the
annual benefit shall be determined as of each such annuity starting date (and
shall satisfy the limitations of this section as of each such date),
actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing
at the other annuity starting dates. For this purpose, the determination of
whether a new starting date has occurred shall be made without regard to
Section 1.401(a)-20, Q&A 10(d), and with regard to Section 1.415(b)-1(b)(1)
(iii)(B) and (C) of the regulations.
         (b)   No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for (i)
survivor benefits payable to a surviving spouse under a qualified joint and
survivor annuity to the extent such benefits would not be payable if the
participant's benefit were paid in another form; (ii) benefits that are not
directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability
benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and post-retirement medical
benefits); or (iii) the inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic
benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to Code
Section 417(e)(3) and would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this section,
and the Plan provides that the amount payable under the form of benefit in any
limitation year shall not exceed the limits of this section applicable at the
annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code
Section 415(d). For this purpose, an automatic benefit increase feature is
included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for automatic
periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form.
         (c)   The determination of the annual benefit shall take into account
Social Security supplements described in Code Section 411(a)(9) and benefits
transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers of
distributable benefits pursuant to Section 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c), of the
regulations, but shall disregard benefits attributable to employee
contributions or rollover contributions.
         (d)   Effective for distributions in Plan years beginning after
December 31, 2003, the determination of actuarial equivalence of forms of
benefit other than a straight life annuity shall be made in accordance with
divisions (d)1. or (d)2. of this definition of ANNUAL BENEFIT:
            1.   Benefit forms not subject to Code Section 417(e)(3). The
straight life annuity that is actuarially equivalent to the participant's form
of benefit shall be determined under this division 1. if the form of the
participant's benefit is either (i) a nondecreasing annuity (other than a
straight life annuity) payable for a period of not less than the life of the
participant (or, in the case of a qualified preretirement survivor annuity, the
life of the surviving spouse), or (ii) an annuity that decreases during the
life of the participant merely because of (a) the death of the survivor
annuitant (but only if the reduction is not below 50% of the benefit payable
before the death of the survivor annuitant), or (b) the cessation or reduction
of Social Security supplements or qualified disability payments (as defined in
Code Section 401(a)(11)).
               a.    Limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007. For
limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007, the actuarially equivalent
straight life annuity is equal to the annual amount of the straight life
annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same
actuarial present value as the participant's form of benefit computed using
whichever of the following produces the greater annual amount:
                  i.    The interest rate and the mortality table (or other
tabular factor) specified in the Plan for adjusting benefits in the same form;
and
                  ii.    A 5% interest rate assumption and the applicable
mortality table for that annuity starting date.
               b.    Limitation years beginning on and after July 1, 2007. For
limitation years beginning on and after July 1, 2007, the actuarially
equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the greater of:
                  i.    The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any)
payable to the participant under the Plan commencing at the same annuity
starting date as the participant's form of benefit; and
                  ii.    The annual amount of the straight life annuity
commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial
present value as the participant's form of benefit, computed using a 5%
interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table for that annuity
starting date.
            2.   Benefit forms subject to Code Section 417(e)(3). The straight
life annuity that is actuarially equivalent to the participant's form of
benefit shall be determined under this division 2. if the form of the
participant's benefit is other than a benefit form described in division 1.
above. In this case, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity shall be
determined as follows:
               a.    Annuity starting date in Plan years beginning after 2005.
If the annuity starting date of the participant's benefit occurs during a Plan
year beginning after 2005, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is
equal to the greatest of:
                  i.    The annual amount of the straight life annuity
commending at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial
present value as the participant's form of benefit, computed using the interest
rate and the mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the Plan
for adjusting benefits in the same form;
                  ii.    The annual amount of the straight life annuity
commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial
present value as the participant's form of benefit, computed using a 5.5%
interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table; and
                  iii.    The annual amount of the straight life annuity
commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial
present value as the participant's form of benefit, computed using the
applicable interest rate and the applicable mortality table, divided by 1.05.
However, for an employer that is an eligible employer as defined in Code
Section 408(p)(2)(C)(i), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is
equal to the greater of divisions i. or ii. above.
               b.    Annuity starting date in Plan years beginning in 2004 and
2005. If the annuity starting date of the participant's form of benefit is in a
Plan year beginning in 2004 or 2005, the actuarially equivalent straight life
annuity is equal to the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing
at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as
the participant's form of benefit, computed using whichever of the following
produces the greater annual amount:
                  i.    The interest rate and the mortality table (or other
tabular factor) specified in the Plan for adjusting benefits in the same form;
and
                  ii.    A 5.5% interest rate assumption and the applicable
mortality table. If the annuity starting date of the participant's benefit is
on or after the first day of the first Plan year beginning in 2004 and before
December 31, 2004, the application of this division (d)2.b. shall not cause the
amount payable under the participant’s form of benefit to be less than the
benefit calculated under the Plan taking into account the limitations of this
section, except that the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal
to the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same
annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the
participant's form of benefit, computed using whichever of the following
produces the greatest annual amount:
                  iii.    The interest rate and the mortality table (or other
tabular factor) specified in the Plan for adjusting benefits in the same form
(as provided under the terms of the Plan in effect as of the date of
distribution);
                  iv.    The applicable interest rate and the applicable
mortality table (as provided under the terms of the Plan in effect as of the
date of distribution); and
                  v.    The applicable interest rate (as in effect on the last
day of the last Plan year beginning before January 1, 2004, under the
provisions of the Plan then adopted and in effect) and the applicable mortality
table.
      DEFINED BENEFIT DOLLAR LIMITATION. Effective for limitation years ending
after December 31, 2001, $160,000, automatically adjusted under Code Section
415(d), effective January 1 of each year, as published in the Internal Revenue
Bulletin, and payable in the form of a straight life annuity. The new
limitation shall apply to limitation years ending with or within the calendar
year of the date of the adjustment, but a participant's benefits shall not
reflect the adjusted limit prior to January 1 of that  calendar year. The
automatic annual adjustment of the defined benefit dollar limitation under Code
Section 415(d) shall not apply to participants who have had a severance from
employment.
      EMPLOYER. The employer that adopts this Plan, and all members of a
controlled group of corporations (as defined in Code Section 414(b), as
modified by Code Section 415(h)), all commonly controlled trades or businesses
(as defined in Code Section 414(c), as modified, except in the case of a
brother-sister group of trades or businesses under common control, by Code
Section 415(h)), or affiliated service groups (as defined in Code Section 414
(m)) of which the adopting employer is a part, and any other entity required to
be aggregated with the employer pursuant to Code Section 414(o).
      FORMERLY AFFILIATED PLAN. A plan that, immediately prior to the cessation
of affiliation, was actually maintained by the employer and immediately after
the cessation of affiliation, is not actually maintained by the employer. For
this purpose, cessation of affiliation means the event that causes an entity to
no longer be considered the employer, such as the sale of a member of a
controlled group of corporations, as defined in Code Section 414(b), as
modified by Code Section 415(h), to an unrelated corporation, or that causes a
plan to not actually be maintained by the employer, such as a transfer of plan
sponsorship outside a controlled group.
      LIMITATION YEAR. The consecutive 12-month period ending on the last day
of each Plan year, including corresponding consecutive 12-month periods before
the effective date of the Plan. All qualified plans maintained by the employer
must use the same limitation year. If the limitation year is other than a
calendar year, execution of this Plan (or any amendment to this Plan changing
the limitation year) constitutes the employer's adoption of a written
resolution electing the limitation year. If the limitation year is amended to a
different consecutive 12-month period, the new limitation year must begin on a
date within the limitation year in which the amendment is made.
      MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE BENEFIT. The defined benefit dollar limitation
(adjusted where required, as provided below).
         (a)   Adjustment for less than ten years of participation.
            1.   If the participant has less than ten years of participation in
the Plan, the defined benefit dollar limitation shall be multiplied by a
fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the number of years of participation
(or part thereof, but not less than one year) in the Plan, and (ii) the
denominator of which is ten.
            2.   The adjustments of this division (a) shall not apply to
survivor and disability benefits as provided in Code Section 415(b)(2)(I).
         (b)   Adjustment of defined benefit dollar limitation for benefit
commencement before age 62 or after age 65. Effective for benefits commencing
in limitation years ending after December 31, 2001, the defined benefit dollar
limitation shall be adjusted if the annuity starting date of the participant's
benefit is before age 62 or after age 65. If the annuity starting date is
before age 62, the defined benefit dollar limitation shall be adjusted under
division (b)1. below, as modified by division (b)3. below. If the annuity
starting date is after age 65, the defined benefit dollar limitation shall be
adjusted under division (b)2. below, as modified by division (b)3. below.
            1.   Adjustment of defined benefit dollar limitation for benefit
commencement before age 62:
               a.    Limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007. If the
annuity starting date for the participant's benefit is prior to age 62 and
occurs in a limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007, the defined benefit
dollar limitation for the participant's annuity starting date is the annual
amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing
at the participant's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of
the defined benefit dollar limitation (adjusted under division (a) above for
years of participation less than ten, if required) with actuarial equivalence
computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount:
(i) the interest rate and the mortality table (or other tabular factor)
specified in the Plan for purposes of determining actuarial equivalence for
early retirement benefits; or (ii) a 5% interest rate assumption and the
applicable mortality table. To the extent the Plan does not specify an interest
rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) or for ages for which no
tabular factor is specified, a 5% interest rate and the applicable mortality
table shall be used to determine actuarial equivalence.
               b.    Limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007.
                  i.    Plan does not have immediately commencing straight life
annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement. If the
annuity starting date for the participant's benefit is prior to age 62 and
occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan
does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both
age 62 and the age of benefit commencement, the defined benefit dollar
limitation for the participant's annuity starting date is the annual amount of
a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the
participant's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the
defined benefit dollar limitation (adjusted under division (a) above for years
of participation less than ten, if required) with actuarial equivalence
computed using a 5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table
for the annuity starting date (and expressing the participant's age based on
completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date).
                  ii.    Plan has immediately commencing straight life annuity
payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement. If the annuity
starting date for the participant's benefit is prior to age 62 and occurs in a
limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan has an
immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 62 and the age
of benefit commencement, the defined benefit dollar limitation for the
participant's annuity starting date is the lesser of the limitation determined
under division (b)1.b.i. above and the defined benefit dollar limitation
(adjusted under division (a) above for years of participation less than ten, if
required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the immediately
commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at the participant's annuity
starting date to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life
annuity under the Plan at age 62, both determined without applying the
limitations of this section.
               c.   The adjustments in this division 1. do not apply in the
case of a participant who is a qualified participant (as defined in Code
Section 415(b)(H)). The adjustments in this division (b)1. do not apply to
survivor and disability benefits as provided in Code Section 415(b)(2)(I).
               d.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this division
(b)1., the age adjusted defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to a
participant does not decrease on account of an increase in age or the
performance of additional service.
            2.   Adjustment of defined benefit dollar limitation for benefit
commencement after age 65.
               a.    Limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007. If the
annuity starting date for the participant's benefit is after age 65 and occurs
in a limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007, the defined benefit dollar
limitation for the participant's annuity starting date is the annual amount of
a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the
participant's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the
defined benefit dollar limitation (adjusted under division (b)1. above for
years of participation less than ten, if required) with actuarial equivalence
computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount:
(i) the interest rate and the mortality table (or other tabular factor)
specified in the Plan for purposes of determining actuarial equivalence for
late retirement benefits; or (ii) a 5% interest rate assumption and the
applicable mortality table.
               b.    Limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007.
                  i.    Plan does not have immediately commencing straight life
annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement. If the
annuity starting date for the participant's benefit is after age 65 and occurs
in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan does not
have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and
the age of benefit commencement, the defined benefit dollar limitation at the
participant's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable
in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the participant's annuity
starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar
limitation (adjusted under division (b)1. above for years of participation less
than ten, if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using a 5% interest
rate assumption and the applicable mortality table for that annuity starting
date (and expressing the participant's age based on completed calendar months
as of the annuity starting date).
                  ii.    Plan has immediately commencing straight life annuity
payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement. If the annuity
starting date for the participant's benefit is after age 65 and occurs in a
limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan has an
immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age
of benefit commencement, the defined benefit dollar limitation at the
participant's annuity starting date is the lesser of the limitation determined
under division (b)2.b.i. above and the defined benefit dollar limitation
(adjusted under division (b)1. above for years of participation less than ten,
if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted
immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at the
participant's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted
immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at age 65, both
determined without applying the limitations of this section. For this purpose,
the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at the
participant's annuity starting date is the annual amount of such annuity
payable to the participant, computed disregarding the participant's accruals
after age 65 but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial
adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately
commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at age 65 is the annual amount
of such annuity that would be payable under the Plan to a hypothetical
participant who is age 65 and has the same accrued benefit as the participant.
            3.    Notwithstanding the other requirements of this division (b),
no adjustment shall be made to the defined benefit dollar limitation to reflect
the probability of a participant's death between the annuity starting date and
age 62, or between age 65 and the annuity starting date, as applicable, if
benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the participant prior to the
annuity starting date. To the extent benefits are forfeited upon death before
the annuity starting date, such an adjustment shall be made. For this purpose,
no forfeiture shall be treated as occurring upon the participant's death if the
Plan does not charge participants for providing a qualified joint and survivor
annuity, as defined in Code Section 417(c), upon the participant's death.
         (c)   Minimum benefits permitted. Notwithstanding anything else in
this definition to the contrary, the benefit otherwise accrued or payable to a
participant under this Plan shall be deemed not to exceed the maximum
permissible benefit if:
            1.   The retirement benefits payable for a limitation year under
any form of benefit with respect to such participant under this Plan and under
all other defined benefit plans (without regard to whether a plan has been
terminated) ever maintained by the employer do not exceed $10,000 multiplied by
a fraction, (1) the numerator of which is the participant's number of years of
service (or part thereof, but not less than one year) with the employer (not to
exceed ten), and (2) the denominator of which is ten; and
            2.   The employer (or a predecessor employer) has not at any time
maintained a defined contribution plan in which the participant participated
(for this purpose, mandatory employee contributions under a defined benefit
plan are not considered a separate defined contribution plan).
The amount in division (c)1. above shall be equal to $10,000 when determining
the minimum benefit for survivor and disability benefits as provided in Code
Section 415(b)(2)(I).
      PREDECESSOR EMPLOYER. With respect to a participant, a former employer if
the employer maintains a plan that provides a benefit which the participant
accrued while performing services for the former employer. Predecessor employer
also means, with respect to a participant, a former entity that antedates the
employer if, under the facts and circumstances, the employer constitutes a
continuation of all or a portion of the trade or business of the former entity.
      SEVERANCE FROM EMPLOYMENT. An employee has ceased to be an employee of
the employer maintaining the plan.
      STRAIGHT LIFE ANNUITY. An annuity payable in equal installments for the
life of the participant that terminates upon the participant's death.
      YEAR OF PARTICIPATION. One year (computed to fractional parts of a year)
for each Plan year for which the following conditions are met:
         (a)   The participant is credited with continuous service for benefit
accrual purposes, and
         (b)   The participant is included as a participant under the
eligibility provisions of the Plan for at least one day of the Plan year.
If these two conditions are met, the portion of a year of participation
credited to the participant shall equal the amount of accrual service credited
to the participant for such Plan year. A participant who is totally and
permanently disabled within the meaning of Code Section 415(c)(3)(C)(i) for a
Plan year shall receive a year of participation with respect to that period. In
addition, for a participant to receive a year of participation (or part
thereof) for a Plan year, the Plan must be established no later than the last
day of such Plan year. In no event will more than one year of participation be
credited for any 12-month period.
      YEAR OF SERVICE. For purposes of the definition of MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE
BENEFIT, one year (computed to fractional parts of a year) for each Plan year
for which the participant is credited with continuous service for benefit
accrual purposes, taking into account only service with the employer or a
predecessor employer.
   (B)   The annual benefit otherwise payable to a participant at any time will
not exceed the maximum permissible benefit.
   (C)   If the participant is, or has ever been, a participant in another
qualified defined benefit plan (without regard to whether the plan has been
terminated) maintained by the employer or a predecessor employer, the sum of
the participant's annual benefits from all such plans may not exceed the
maximum permissible benefit. Where the participant's employer-provided benefits
under all such defined benefit plans (determined as of the same age) would
exceed the maximum permissible benefit applicable at that age, the benefit
shall be limited (or the rate of accrual reduced) in the plan most recently
established to the extent necessary so that the sum of the participant's annual
benefits from all such plan(s) does not exceed the maximum permissible benefit.
   (D)   The application of the provisions of this section shall not cause the
maximum permissible benefit for any participant to be less than the
participant's accrued benefit under all the defined benefit plans of the
employer or a predecessor employer as of the end of the last limitation year
beginning before July 1, 2007 under the provisions of the plans that were both
adopted and in effect before April 5, 2007. The preceding sentence applies only
if the provisions of such defined benefit plans that were both adopted and in
effect before April 5, 2007 satisfied the applicable requirements of statutory
provisions, regulations, and other published guidance relating to Code Section
415 in effect as of the end of the last limitation year beginning before July
1, 2007, as described in section 1.415(a)-1 (g)(4) of the regulations.
   (E)   The limitations of this section shall be determined and applied taking
into account the rules in division (F) below.
   (F)   Other rules.
      (1)   Benefits under terminated plans. If a defined benefit plan
maintained by the employer has terminated with sufficient assets for the
payment of benefit liabilities of all plan participants and a participant in
the plan has not yet commenced benefits under the plan, the benefits provided
pursuant to the annuities purchased to provide the participant's benefits under
the terminated plan at each possible annuity starting date shall be taken into
account in applying the limitations of this section. If there are not
sufficient assets for the payment of all participants' benefit liabilities, the
benefits taken into account shall be the benefits that are actually provided to
the participant under the terminated plan.
      (2)   Benefits transferred from the plan. If a participant's benefits
under a defined benefit plan maintained by the employer are transferred to
another defined benefit plan maintained by the employer and the transfer is not
a transfer of distributable benefits pursuant to section 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c)
of the regulations, the transferred benefits are not treated as being provided
under the transferor plan (but are taken into account as benefits provided
under the transferee plan). If a participant's benefits under a defined benefit
plan maintained by the employer are transferred to another defined benefit plan
that is not maintained by the employer and the transfer is not a transfer of
distributable benefits pursuant to section 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c), of the
regulations, the transferred benefits are treated by the employer's plan as if
such benefits were provided under annuities purchased to provide benefits under
a plan maintained by the employer that terminated immediately prior to the
transfer with sufficient assets to pay all participants' benefit liabilities
under the plan. If a participant's benefits under a defined benefit plan
maintained by the employer are transferred to another defined benefit plan in a
transfer of distributable benefits pursuant to section 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c), of
the regulations, the amount transferred is treated as a benefit paid from the
transferor plan.
      (3)   Formerly affiliated plans of the employer. A formerly affiliated
plan of the employer shall be treated as a plan maintained by the employer, but
the formerly affiliated plan shall be treated as if it had terminated
immediately prior to the cessation of affiliation with sufficient assets to pay
participants' benefit liabilities under the plan and had purchased annuities to
provide benefits.
      (4)   Plans of a predecessor employer. If the employer maintains a
defined benefit plan that provides benefits accrued by a participant while
performing services for a predecessor employer, the participant's benefits
under a plan maintained by a predecessor employer shall be treated as provided
under a plan maintained by the employer. However, for this purpose, the plan of
the predecessor employer shall be treated as if it had terminated immediately
prior to the event giving rise to the predecessor employer relationship with
sufficient assets to pay participants' benefit liabilities under the plan, and
had purchased annuities to provide benefits; the employer and the predecessor
employer shall be treated as if they were a single employer immediately prior
to such event and as unrelated employers immediately after the event; and if
the event giving rise to the predecessor relationship is a benefit transfer,
the transferred benefits shall be excluded in determining the benefits provided
under the plan of the predecessor employer.
      (5)   Special rules. The limitations of this section shall be determined
and applied taking into account the rules in section 1.415(f)-1(d), (e), and
(h) of the regulations.
      (6)   Aggregation with multiemployer plans.
         (a)   If the employer maintains a multiemployer plan, as defined in
Code Section 414(f), and the multiemployer plan so provides, only the benefits
under the multiemployer plan that are provided by the employer shall be treated
as benefits provided under a plan maintained by the employer for purposes of
this section.
         (b)   Effective for limitation years ending after December 31, 2001, a
multiemployer plan shall be disregarded for purposes of division (a) of the
MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE BENEFIT definition in this section to a plan which is not a
multiemployer plan. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-15)
§ 38.028 EXCESS BENEFIT PLAN.
   (A)   In the event that the retirement benefits of a participant exceed the
amount permitted by the Internal Revenue Code Section 415, an excess benefit
plan is hereby created. The payment of benefits to such participant shall be as
follows:
      (1)   The participant shall first receive the maximum amount payable by
the Retirement Income Plan for General Employees of the City of Pembroke Pines
(the Retirement Income Plan); and
      (2)   Thereafter, benefits shall be paid from the Excess Benefit Plan,
funded by the employer and which shall be paid annually, concurrently with the
employer's annual contribution to normal pension costs, which may cause the
employer to realize a reduction in normal pension costs; and
      (3)   Which sums are deposited in separate accounts for each respective
plan to receive the employer's excess retirement benefit contributions, which
accounts shall be separate and apart from the accounts established to receive
the employer's normal pension contributions for each retirement fund.
   (B)   The actuaries for the Retirement Income Plan shall calculate the
amounts necessary to fund the defined benefit plans giving effect to the
reductions caused by implementation of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue
Code.
   (C)   The excess benefits shall be paid to each eligible participant of the
Plan on a monthly basis in an amount equal to the difference between the
allowable pension to be paid under the Internal Revenue Code and the amount of
the defined benefit granted eligible participants pursuant to the provisions
set forth in the Plan.
   (D)   Should additional retirements occur during the year where the eligible
participant's retirement benefit exceeds the Section 415 limits, the actuaries
shall calculate the additional excess benefit amount required for the remainder
of the fiscal year and should such amount exceed the amount available from the
funds provided for the fiscal year, the actuaries shall notify the employer of
the additional funds required.
   (E)   Upon the employer's receipt of notice of additional funds required,
the employer shall forward the additional funds required. The requirement for
additional funds paid by the employer to fund the Excess Benefit Plan shall be
reflected as a reduction in the employer's annual contribution of normal
pension costs for the following year where applicable.
   (F)   No employee hired or rehired on or after October 1, 2013 shall become
eligible for this Excess Benefit Plan. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-15)
§ 38.029 AMOUNT OF BENEFIT AT RETIREMENT.
   (A)   The amount of retirement benefit to be provided under the normal form
for an active participant on his retirement date shall be determined according
to the provisions of this section.
      (1)   Normal retirement date. An active participant's retirement benefit
on his normal retirement date shall be equal to his accrued benefit on such
date.
      (2)   Early retirement date.
         (a)   An active participant's retirement benefit on his early
retirement date shall be equal to his accrued benefit on such date, multiplied
by the factor shown below corresponding to the number of years his early
retirement date precedes his normal retirement date.
 
Number of Years Early Retirement Date Precedes Normal Retirement Date Factor
1                                                                     .9333
2                                                                     .8667
3                                                                     .8000
4                                                                     .7333
5                                                                     .6667
 
         (b)   The above factors shall be prorated for a partial year (counting
a partial month as a complete month).
      (3)   Late retirement date. An active participant's retirement benefit on
his late retirement date shall be equal to the greater of divisions (A)(3)(a)
or (A)(3)(b) below:
         (a)   His accrued benefit on his late retirement date.
         (b)   His accrued benefit on his normal retirement date, multiplied by
the factor shown below corresponding to the number of years his late retirement
date follows his normal retirement date.
Number of Years Late Retirement Date Follows Normal Retirement Date Factor
Number of Years Late Retirement Date Follows Normal Retirement Date Factor
1                                                                   1.0600
2                                                                   1.1200
3                                                                   1.1900
4                                                                   1.2600
5                                                                   1.3400
6                                                                   1.4200
7                                                                   1.5000
8                                                                   1.5900
9                                                                   1.6900
10                                                                  1.7900
 
The above factors shall be prorated for a partial year (counting a partial
month as a complete month). Factors for years beyond ten shall be determined
using a consistently applied reasonable actuarially equivalent method.
   (B)   In any event, an active participant's retirement benefit under the
normal form on his retirement date will not be less than the greater of his
required contribution accrued benefit on his retirement date, reduced in the
same manner as his accrued benefit is reduced at early retirement date if his
retirement date is an early retirement date, or the monthly benefit under the
normal form that is the actuarial equivalent of his required contribution
account on such date.
   (C)   The participant's retirement benefits shall be distributed to the
participant according to the distribution of benefits provisions of §§
38.050 through
38.053 and the small amounts provisions of § 38.098. The amount of payment
under any form (other than the normal form) shall be determined as provided
under §
38.052. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-15)
§ 38.030 BENEFITS UPON EMPLOYMENT AFTER RETIREMENT DATE.
   (A)   If a participant is employed by the employer after his retirement
date, any monthly retirement benefit payment he is receiving shall continue
unchanged.
   (B)   If such participant continues to be or again becomes an active
participant after his retirement date, his benefits under this Plan shall not
be duplicated. The retirement benefit from the accrued benefit resulting from
such additional period of accrual service shall be payable according to the
provisions of §§
38.025 through
38.032 and §§
38.050 through
38.053. Any death benefit from the accrued benefit he accrued during his latest
period as an active participant shall be determined as provided in §
38.040. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-15)
§ 38.031 DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PLAN.
   (A)   An active participant and any employee who is covered under a
collective bargaining agreement whose accrued benefit is frozen as of June 30,
2010 shall become eligible for participation in the Deferred Retirement Option
Plan (DROP) on the first day of the month on or after his normal retirement
date.
   (B)   At the time of a participant's entry into the DROP, the participant's
accrual service, accrued benefit and average compensation shall be calculated
as if the participant had actually retired from service. No additional accrual
service shall be earned after entry into the DROP. Any changes in plan benefits
shall not apply to participants in the DROP, unless otherwise applicable to
retired participants of the plan.
   (C)   The active participant shall select the retirement option from the
list available in §
38.052, and shall designate any beneficiary. In the absence of a beneficiary
designation, or should the designated beneficiary predecease the participant,
the participant's estate shall be the contingent beneficiary.
   (D)   The maximum period of DROP participation shall be eight years (five
years for a participant who entered the DROP prior to December 1, 2017).
   (E)   An election to participate in the DROP shall constitute an irrevocable
election to resign from the service of the employer not later than 96 months
(60 months for a participant who entered the DROP prior to December 1, 2017)
after commencement of DROP participation. Consistent with the provisions of the
Older Workers' Benefits Protection Act, 29 U.S.C 626(f), as amended from time
to time, all participants in the DROP shall be given 45 days in which to
consider the terms of the DROP agreement and, after election to participate in
the DROP, shall have seven calendar days following the execution of such
agreement to revoke said agreement to receive the full eight years (five years
for a participant who entered the DROP prior to December 1, 2017) of
participation.
   (F)   Election to participate in the DROP must be exercised within the first
eight years (five years for a participant who entered the DROP prior to
December 1, 2017) of eligibility for the DROP for a maximum number of years as
specified below. Election to participate must be made in writing in a time and
manner determined by the employer.
   (G)   The duration and participation in the DROP shall be specified and
shall not exceed eight years (five years for a participant who entered the DROP
prior to December 1, 2017) from the first day of eligibility for normal
retirement date, as chosen by the participant.
   (H)   Upon entry into the DROP, an amount equal to the participant's monthly
retirement benefit shall be transferred to an account designated by the
participant for investment. Participants may direct their DROP money to any of
the investment options approved by the Employer for the DROP. Participants
shall self-direct the value of their DROP account in investment options
selected by the employer for the DROP. The only permissible investment options
shall be "regulated investment companies" as defined in Code Section 851 or
similar entities (e.g., mutual funds, etc.) set forth on Appendix "A" (which is
incorporated into the terms of the Plan by this reference). The value of each
participant's DROP account at any particular time shall equal the sum of the
value(s) of his selected investment options (which shall be valued on a daily
basis). If the employer desires to alter the available investment options or
the manner of investing participant DROP accounts or the methodology for
allocating investment experience to participant DROP accounts, such changes
shall be set forth on Appendix “A” in a manner that satisfies the definitely
determinable benefit requirements contained in Code Section 401(a)(25) and
1.401-1(b)(1)(i) of the regulations.
   (I)   There shall be no guaranteed rate of investment return on DROP
deposits. Upon the direct transfer of the DROP money to the account designated
by the participant, neither the employer nor the retirement fund shall have any
obligation to the participant concerning investment gains or losses. Transfers
between accounts shall be in accordance with the rules of the deferred
compensation program.
   (J)   The decision to participate in the DROP is irrevocable.
   (K)   Upon entry into the DROP, a participant shall no longer be eligible
for death or disability benefits under the plan. In the event of a disability
or death, the participant shall be presumed to have retired on a normal
retirement on the day before his disability or death. Distribution from the
DROP account shall be made to the participant, or in the case of his death, to
his designated beneficiary.
   (L)   No participant may receive a distribution from the DROP until actual
separation from service with the employer. Distribution may be in a lump sum,
periodic payments, an annuity, or a combination thereof. A participant may also
elect to rollover the DROP account to another qualified retirement plan,
including an individual retirement account. Distribution must commence not
later than provided in Code Section 401(a)(9). It is the intent of the employer
that this plan at all times be a qualified plan as determined by Code Section
401(a).
   (M)   During DROP participation, a participant shall be considered a retiree
with deferred receipt of benefits for all plan purposes. For all other
purposes, the participant shall be considered an active employee of the
employer entitled to all rights of employment.
   (N)   The employer shall be empowered to promulgate uniform rules for the
administration of the DROP, provided the rules are not inconsistent with the
provisions of the plan.
   (O)   Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, a
participant who entered the DROP prior to December 1, 2017 shall be provided a
one-time option to elect, in writing, to change the duration of his
participation in the DROP from five years to eight years. Such election must
occur within 30 days of the adoption of this amendment.
(Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-15; Am. Ord. 1844, passed 4-6-16; Am. Ord. 1894, passed
2-7-18)
§ 38.032 COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT.
   (A)   Each participant who meets the following requirements shall be
entitled to receive a cost of living adjustment to his retirement benefit:
      (1)   He is a participant in the DROP program, as provided in §
38.031; or
      (2)   He begins to receive retirement or disability benefits from the
Plan on or after October 1, 2001.
   (B)   (1)   Each yearly date on and after October 1, 2004, such
participant's monthly retirement benefit payments shall be increased as
follows:
         (a)   Three percent, if he is receiving monthly retirement benefit
payments or is participating in the DROP before February 1, 2010.
         (b)   Three percent, if he attained normal retirement date on or
before February 1, 2010, and he is still actively employed on February 1, 2010
and is not participating in the DROP.
         (c)   Two percent, if he attained normal retirement date or became a
participant in the DROP after February 1, 2010.
      (2)   An amount of monthly retirement benefit will be provided for him
under the annuity contract in the amount of such increase with payments being
made as to the monthly retirement annuity provided under the annuity contract
on the participant's retirement date or his entry into the DROP.
   (C)   On and after the effective date of termination of the Plan pursuant to
§
38.070, no further changes in monthly retirement benefit payments will be made
in accordance with this section.
   (D)   Notwithstanding the above, any participant who is covered under a
collective bargaining agreement with the employer who is an employee of the
employer and who meets the requirements for normal retirement date on or before
July 1, 2010, will continue to be eligible for benefits under this section.
However, any participant who is covered under a collective bargaining agreement
with the employer who has not met the requirements for normal retirement date
on or before July 1, 2010, and has not commenced receiving his monthly
retirement benefit as of July 1, 2010, shall not be eligible for the cost of
living adjustment. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-15)
OTHER BENEFITS
§ 38.040 DEATH BENEFITS.
   (A)   If a participant dies before his annuity starting date, death benefits
shall be determined under divisions (A)(1) and (A)(2) of this section. The
distribution of death benefits shall be subject to the distribution of benefits
provisions of §§
38.050 through
38.053 and the provisions of §
38.098.
      (1)   Preretirement survivor annuity.
         (a)   A preretirement survivor annuity shall be payable if the
following requirements are met:
            1.   The participant is survived by a spouse to whom he was
continuously married throughout the one-year period ending on the date he dies
or the participant is survived by his domestic partner that has continuously
been his domestic partner throughout the one-year period ending on the date he
dies.
            2.   The participant dies while he is an employee.
            3.   The participant had met the requirements for early retirement
date, or reached normal retirement date, if earlier.
         (b)   If the requirements above are met on the date the participant
dies, a preretirement survivor annuity shall be payable on the earliest date on
or after the date of his death on which he could have elected to retire if he
had a severance from employment on the date of his death (the date he last had
a severance from employment, if earlier) and survived to retire. The spouse or
domestic partner may elect to start benefits on any later first day of the
month. If the spouse or domestic partner chooses to start benefits later, the
preretirement survivor annuity shall be the actuarial equivalent of the
preretirement survivor annuity that would have been payable on the date the
preretirement survivor annuity would otherwise have been payable. Benefits must
start to a surviving spouse by the date the participant would have been age 70-
1/2. Benefits must start to a domestic partner by December 31st of the calendar
year following the calendar year in which the participant dies. If the spouse
or domestic partner dies before the preretirement survivor annuity starts, the
only death benefit payable from the participant's accrued benefit is that
provided in division (A)(2) below.
         (c)   If a single sum death benefit would otherwise be payable in
division (A)(2) below, the monthly benefit payable to the spouse or domestic
partner under the preretirement survivor annuity on the date the preretirement
survivor annuity first becomes payable shall not be less than the preretirement
survivor annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the single sum death
benefit on that date.
         (d)   If the participant waives the preretirement survivor annuity,
according to the provisions of §
38.053, by electing to have the single sum death benefit in division (A)(2)
below paid to his beneficiary after the requirements above are met or if the
spouse or domestic partner waives the preretirement survivor annuity, according
to §
38.053, by electing to have the single sum death benefit in division (A)(2)
below paid to himself as beneficiary after the requirements above are met, the
preretirement survivor annuity on the date the preretirement survivor annuity
first becomes payable shall be reduced. The amount of the reduction shall be
equal to the preretirement survivor annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of
what would have been the single sum death benefit on that date.
      (2)   Single sum death benefit.
         (a)   If the requirements of division (A)(1) above have not been met
on the date a participant dies, a single sum death benefit equal to his
required contribution account on the date he died shall be payable to the
participant's beneficiary. If the requirements of division (A)(1) above have
been met on the date such participant dies and the preretirement survivor
annuity has not been waived, but the participant's spouse or domestic partner
dies before the preretirement survivor annuity starts, this single sum death
benefit, determined as of the date of the spouse's or domestic partner's death,
shall be paid to the spouse's or domestic partner's beneficiary.
         (b)   Before a single sum death benefit will be paid on account of the
death of a participant who would have met all the requirements in division (A)
(1) above if he had a spouse to whom he had been continuously married
throughout the one-year period ending on the date of his death, it must be
established to the satisfaction of a plan representative that there is no
spouse or that the participant had not been continuously married throughout the
one-year period ending on the date of his death. Likewise, before a single sum
death benefit will be paid on account of the death of a participant who would
have met all the requirements in division (A)(1) above if he had a domestic
partner that had continuously been his domestic partner throughout the one-year
period ending on the date of his death, it must be established to the
satisfaction of the plan representative that there is no domestic partner or
that he had not continuously been the participant's domestic partner throughout
the one-year period ending on the date of the participant's death.
   (B)   If a participant dies on or after his normal retirement date and
before his annuity starting date and such participant is survived by a spouse
to whom he was continuously married throughout the one-year period ending on
the date of his death (or is survived by a domestic partner that has been his
domestic partner throughout the one-year period ending on the date of his
death), the death benefit shall be payable in like manner as provided under
divisions (A)(1) and (A)(2) above, unless such participant is an active
participant who has waived the preretirement survivor annuity, according to §
38.053, by electing the preservation of retirement options death benefit.
   (C)   If an active participant dies on or after his normal retirement date
and before his annuity starting date and such participant is not survived by a
spouse to whom he was continuously married throughout the one-year period
ending on the date of his death (or is not survived by a domestic partner that
has been his domestic partner throughout the one-year period ending on the date
of his death), the provisions of divisions (A)(1) and (A)(2) above shall not
apply. Instead, the death benefit shall be the preservation of retirement
option death benefit. This death benefit is the death benefit that would have
been payable to such participant's beneficiary or contingent annuitant if the
participant's retirement date had occurred on the date he died. The optional
form of distribution elected according to the provisions of §
38.053 before such participant's death is the form in effect for determining
the death benefit. The automatic form of distribution for retirement benefits
under §
38.051 shall be in effect if an election has not been made or an election is
revoked without a subsequent election according to the provisions of §
38.053. Any death benefit payable shall be subject to the distribution
limitations of §
38.062.
   (D)   If, after any death benefit above is distributed in a single sum, the
present value of the remaining preretirement survivor annuity payable under
division (A)(1) above is $5,000 or less, the spouse or domestic partner may
receive such present value in a single sum payment in lieu of the preretirement
survivor annuity. It will be distributed only if the spouse or domestic partner
so elects. This election shall be subject to the requirements in §
38.053 for an election of a death benefit payable in a form other than a
preretirement survivor annuity.
   (E)   Any death benefit after a participant's annuity starting date will be
determined by the form of retirement benefit in effect on such date. (Ord.
1806, passed 1-7-15)
§ 38.041 VESTED BENEFITS.
   (A)   A participant who becomes an inactive participant before retirement or
death (and, if applicable, before the date a disability payment begins under §
38.042) will be entitled to one of the following vested benefits whichever is
applicable. Any distribution of vested benefits shall be a retirement benefit
and shall be subject to the distribution of benefits provisions of §§
38.050 through
38.053 and the provisions of §
38.098, except as otherwise specifically provided bellow:
      (1)   A deferred monthly retirement benefit under the normal form to
begin on his normal retirement date. The deferred retirement benefit will be
equal to the sum of divisions (A)(1)(a) and (A)(1)(b) below:
         (a)   The participant's required contribution accrued benefit as of
the date of determination (the date the participant's required contribution
account is paid in a single sum, if earlier).
         (b)   The product of divisions (A)(1)(b)1. and (A)(1)(b)2. below:
            1.   The excess of the participant's accrued benefit on the day
before he became an inactive participant over the amount determined under
division (A)(1)(a) above.
            2.   The participant's vesting percentage on the date he has a
severance from employment or his voluntary discontinuance date.
      (2)   A deferred monthly retirement benefit under the normal form to
begin on his early retirement date. The deferred retirement benefit shall be
equal to the amount under division (A)(1) above multiplied by the applicable
early retirement factor in §
38.029.
      (3)   A deferred monthly retirement benefit under the normal form to
begin on his late retirement date. The deferred retirement benefit shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)   For a participant who became an inactive participant on or
before his normal retirement date, an amount equal to the amount under division
(A)(1) above multiplied by the late retirement factor in §
38.029 that corresponds to the number of years his late retirement date follows
his normal retirement date.
         (b)   For a participant who became an inactive participant after his
normal retirement date, an amount equal to the greater of division (A)(3)(b)1.
or (A)(3)(b)2. below:
            1.   The participant's accrued benefit on the day before the date
he became an inactive participant.
            2.   His accrued benefit on his normal retirement date multiplied
by the late retirement factor in §
38.029 that corresponds to the number of years his late retirement date follows
his normal retirement date.
      (4)   The inactive participant may receive his required contribution
account in a single sum payment at any time after he has a severance from
employment and before his retirement date, provided he has not again become an
employee. If such amount is not payable under the provisions of §
38.098, it will be distributed only if the participant so elects. Such payment
shall result in a portion of his accrued benefit under division (A)(1)(a) of
this section being disregarded.
      (5)   The inactive participant may receive his required contribution
account in a single lump sum payment at any time after he is transferred to a
position with the city where he is eligible to join the city's Firefighters and
Police Officers Pension System.
   (B)   The deferred retirement benefit for the participant on his retirement
date shall not be less than the monthly benefit that is the actuarial
equivalent of his required contribution account on such date.
   (C)   The amount of payment under any form (other than the normal form)
shall be determined as provided under §
38.052.
   (D)   The participant may receive his required contribution account in a
single sum payment at any time after he has a severance from employment and
before his retirement date, provided he has not again become an employee. If
such amount is not payable under the provisions of §
38.098, it will be distributed only if the participant so elects. The
participant's election shall be subject to the requirements in §
38.053. Such payment shall be in lieu of his required contribution accrued
benefit.
   (E)   If, after any single-sum distribution above which occurs before a
participant's retirement date, the present value of the participant's remaining
vested accrued benefit payable at normal retirement date is $5,000 or less, the
participant may receive such present value in a single-sum payment, provided he
has not again become an employee. Such amount will be distributed only if the
participant so elects. The participant's election shall be subject to the
requirements in §
38.053. Such payment shall be in lieu of all other benefits under the Plan.
   (F)   If the participant dies before his annuity starting date, death
benefits shall be distributed according to the provisions of § 38.040. (Ord.
1806, passed 1-7-15)
§ 38.042 DISABILITY BENEFITS.
   (A)   If an active participant becomes disabled (and such disability is
determined to meet the definition of totally and permanently disabled) before
his retirement date (normal retirement date, if earlier), an immediate monthly
disability benefit shall be payable to him as follows:
      (1)   If the participant's disability is not service related, and he has
completed ten years of vesting service, the disability benefit shall be equal
to his accrued benefit on the day before his monthly disability benefit begins.
      (2)   If the participant's disability is service related, the disability
benefit shall be equal to the greater of (i) his accrued benefit on the day
before his monthly disability benefit begins; or (ii) 40% of his current
monthly compensation on such date.
   (B)   Monthly disability benefit payments shall begin on the earliest first
day of the month on or after the date the participant meets the requirements
under this section. Such payments shall continue through the last monthly
payment made before the earliest of his retirement date (normal retirement
date, if earlier), the date of his death, or the day following the date he is
no longer totally and permanently disabled.
   (C)   If the payments continue through the month immediately preceding the
participant's retirement date (normal retirement date, if earlier), retirement
benefits shall be provided for him on his retirement date under the provisions
of §§
38.025 through
38.032 as if he were an active participant. His accrued benefit shall be equal
to his accrued benefit as of the day before the disability benefit began.
However, such accrued benefit shall not be less than the amount of monthly
disability payment paid to him under this section. If, before the participant's
retirement date (normal retirement date, if earlier), he recovers and returns
to active work, for the employer within one month of his recovery, the payments
shall stop and he shall again become an active participant under §
38.005. If, before the participant's retirement date (normal retirement date,
if earlier), he recovers and does not return to active work for the employer
within one month of his recovery, the payments shall stop and his benefits
shall be redetermined, on the date he had a severance from employment, under §
38.041. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-15)
WHEN BENEFITS START AND DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS
§ 38.050 WHEN BENEFITS START.
   (A)   The participant may elect to have benefits begin after the later of
his normal retirement date or the date he has a severance from employment,
subject to the following provisions of this section. The participant shall make
the election in writing. Such election must be made before his normal
retirement date or the date he has a severance from employment, if later. The
participant shall not elect a date for beginning benefits or a form of
distribution that would result in a benefit payable when he dies which would be
more than incidental within the meaning of governmental regulations.
   (B)   Benefits shall begin as provided in the Plan. For example, the
participant's retirement date or required beginning date, as defined in §
38.061. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-15)
§ 38.051 AUTOMATIC FORMS OF DISTRIBUTION.
   Unless an optional form of benefit is selected pursuant to an election
within the election period (see §
38.053), the automatic form of benefit payable to or on behalf of a participant
is determined as follows:
   (A)   Retirement benefits. The automatic form of retirement benefit for a
participant who does not die before his annuity starting date shall be the
normal form.
   (B)   Death benefits. The automatic form of death benefit for a participant
who dies before his annuity starting date is determined according to the
provisions of §
38.040. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-15)
§ 38.052 OPTIONAL FORMS OF DISTRIBUTION.
   (A)   Retirement benefits.
      (1)   The optional forms of retirement benefit shall be the following:
(i) a straight life annuity; (ii) single life annuities with certain periods of
5, 10, or 15 years; (iii) a single life annuity with modified cash refund of
the participant's required contribution account; and (iv) survivorship life
annuities with survivorship percentages of 50%, 66-2/3%, 75%, or 100%.
      (2)   The benefit payable under any optional form available above (other
than the normal form) shall be the actuarial equivalent of the benefit that
would otherwise be payable to the participant under the normal form on his
retirement date. If the participant's retirement date is before his normal
retirement date, the benefit payable under any optional form other than (i) a
nondecreasing annuity payable for a period of not less than the life of the
participant or (ii) an annuity that decreases during the life of the
participant merely because of (a) the death of the survivor annuitant (but only
if the reduction is not below 50% of the benefit payable before the death of
the survivor annuitant), or (b) the cessation or reduction of Social Security
supplements or qualified disability payments (as defined in Code Section 401(a)
(11)), shall not be less than the actuarial equivalent of the benefit that
would otherwise be payable to the participant under the normal form on his
normal retirement date.
      (3)   Election of an optional form is subject to the election provisions
of §
38.053 and the distribution requirements of §§
38.060 through 38.063.
      (4)   Any annuity contract distributed shall be nontransferable.
   (B)   Death benefits.
      (1)   The optional forms of death benefit are any of the optional forms
of retirement benefit stated in division (A) above that are not survivorship
life annuities.
      (2)   Election of an optional form is subject to the election provisions
of §
38.053 and the distribution requirements of §§
38.060 through
38.063. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-7- 15)
§ 38.053 ELECTION PROCEDURES.
   The participant, beneficiary, or spouse shall make any election under this
section in writing. The Plan Administrator may require such individual to
complete and sign any necessary documents as to the provisions to be made. Any
election permitted under divisions (A) and (B) below shall be subject to the
election provisions of division (C) below.
   (A)   Retirement benefits. A participant may elect his beneficiary or
contingent annuitant and may elect to have retirement benefits distributed
under any of the optional forms of retirement benefit available in §
38.052.
   (B)   Death benefits.  
      (1)   An active participant may waive the preretirement survivor annuity
by electing not to have the provisions of §
38.040(A)(1) and (2) continue to apply on and after his normal retirement date.
If such participant makes this election and dies on or after his normal
retirement date, the preservation of retirement option death benefit shall be
paid as if he had not been survived by a spouse or domestic partner.
      (2)   A participant may elect his beneficiary for any single sum death
benefits and may elect to have such death benefits distributed under any of the
optional forms of death benefit available in §
38.052.
      (3)   If the participant has not elected an optional form of distribution
for the death benefit payable to his beneficiary, the beneficiary may, for his
own benefit, elect the form of distribution, in like manner as a participant.
      (4)   The participant may waive the preretirement survivor annuity by
electing not to have the single sum death benefit used to provide a minimum
preretirement survivor annuity as described in §
38.040. If the participant makes this election, the single sum death benefit
shall be paid as if the requirements of §
38.040(A)(1) had not been met.
      (5)   The spouse or domestic partner may waive the preretirement survivor
annuity by electing not to have the single sum death benefit used to provide a
minimum preretirement survivor annuity as described in §
38.040. If the spouse or domestic partner makes this election, the single sum
death benefit shall be paid as if the requirements of §
38.040(A)(1) had not been met and the participant had named his spouse or
domestic partner as beneficiary.
      (6)   In lieu of the preretirement survivor annuity described in §
38.040, the spouse or domestic partner may, for his own benefit, waive the
preretirement survivor annuity by electing to have the benefit distributed
under any of the optional forms of death benefit available in §
38.052.
   (C)   Election. The participant, beneficiary, spouse or domestic partner may
make an election at any time during the election period. The participant,
beneficiary, spouse or domestic partner may revoke the election made (or make a
new election) at any time and any number of times during the election period.
      (1)   Election period for retirement benefits. A participant may make an
election as to retirement benefits at any time before the annuity starting
date.
      (2)   Election period for death benefits. A participant may make an
election as to death benefits at any time before he dies. The spouse's election
period begins on the date the participant dies and ends on the date benefits
begin. The beneficiary's election period begins on the date the participant
dies and ends on the date benefits begin. If an active participant has a spouse
or domestic partner who is entitled to a preretirement survivor annuity his
election period as to the preservation of retirement option death benefit
begins 90 days before the first day of the Plan year in which such participant
reaches his normal retirement date. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-15)
REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS
§ 38.060 APPLICATION.
   The optional forms of distribution are only those provided in §§
38.050 through
38.053. An optional form of distribution shall not be permitted unless it meets
the requirements of this subchapter. The timing of any distribution must meet
the requirements of this subchapter. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-15)
§ 38.061 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this subchapter, the following terms are defined:
   ACTUARIAL GAIN. The difference between an amount determined using the
actuarial assumptions (i.e., investment return, mortality, expense, and other
similar assumptions) used to calculate the initial payments before adjustment
for any increases and the amount determined under the actual experience with
respect to those factors. ACTUARIAL GAIN also includes differences between the
amount determined using actuarial assumptions when an annuity was purchased or
commenced and such amount determined using actuarial assumptions used in
calculating payments at the time the actuarial gain is determined.
   DISTRIBUTION CALENDAR YEAR. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution
is required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the
first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the
calendar year that contains the participant's required beginning date. For
distributions beginning after the participant's death, the first distribution
calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin
under §
38.062(B)(2).
   ELIGIBLE COST-OF-LIVING INDEX. An index described in paragraph (b)(2), (b)
(3), or (b)(4) in Q&A-14 in section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the regulations.
   LIFE EXPECTANCY. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table
in Q&A-1 in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the regulations.
   REQUIRED BEGINNING DATE. For a participant, April 1 of the calendar year
following the later of the calendar year in which he attains age 70-1/2 or the
calendar year in which he retires. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-15)
§ 38.062 REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS.
   (A)   General rules.
      (1)   Precedence. The requirements of this subchapter shall apply to any
distribution of a participant's interest and will take precedence over any
inconsistent provisions of this Plan.
      (2)   Requirements of regulations incorporated. All distributions
required under this subchapter shall be determined and made in accordance with
Code Section 401(a)(9), including the incidental death benefit requirement in
Code Section 401(a)(9)(G), and the regulations thereunder. Any annuity
distribution option provided under the terms of the Plan as in effect on April
17, 2002 will not fail to satisfy Code Section 401(a)(9), provided the
distribution option satisfies Code Section 401(a)(9) based on a reasonable and
good faith interpretation of the provisions of Code Section 401(a)(9).
   (B)   Time and manner of distribution.
      (1)   Required beginning date. The participant's entire interest will be
distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than the participant's
required beginning date.
      (2)   Death of participant before distributions begin.
         (a)   If the participant dies before distributions begin, the
participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed,
no later than as follows:
            1.   If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's
sole designated beneficiary, distributions to the surviving spouse will begin
by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in
which the participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the
participant would have attained age 70-1/2, if later, except to the extent that
an election is made to receive distributions in accordance with the five-year
rule under division (F) of this section. Under the five-year rule, the
participant's entire interest will be distributed to the designated beneficiary
by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the
participant's death.
            2.   If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's
sole designated beneficiary, distributions to the designated beneficiary will
begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar
year in which the participant died, except to the extent that an election is
made to receive distributions in accordance with the five-year rule under
division (F) of this section. Under the five-year rule, the participant's
entire interest will be distributed to the designated beneficiary by December
31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's
death.
            3.   If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of
the year following the year of the participant's death, the participant's
entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year
containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death.
            4.   If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's
sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the participant
but before distributions to the surviving spouse are required to begin, this
division (B)(2), other than (B)(2)(a)1., will apply as if the surviving spouse
were the participant.
         (b)   For purposes of this division (B)(2) and division (E) below,
unless division (B)(2)(a)4. above applies, distributions are considered to
begin on the participant's required beginning date. If division (B)(2)(a)4.
above applies, distributions are considered to begin on the date distributions
are required to begin to the surviving spouse under division (B)(2)(a)1. above.
If distributions under an annuity meeting the requirements of this subchapter
commence to the participant before the participant's required beginning date
(or to the participant's surviving spouse before the date distributions are
required to begin to the surviving spouse under division (B)(2)(a)1. above),
the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions
actually commence.
      (3)   Forms of distribution. Unless the participant's interest is
distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in
a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first
distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with
divisions (C), (D), and (E) below. If the participant's interest is distributed
in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions
thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 401
(a)(9) and section 1.401(a)(9) of the regulations. Any part of the
participant's interest that is in the form of an individual account described
in Code Section 414(k) will be distributed in a manner satisfying the
requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and section 1.401(a)(9) of the
regulations that apply to individual accounts.
   (C)   Determination of amount to be distributed each year.
      (1)   General annuity requirements. If the participant's interest is paid
in the form of annuity distributions under the Plan, payments under the annuity
shall satisfy the following requirements:
         (a)   The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made
at uniform intervals not longer than one year;
         (b)   The distribution period will be over the life (or lives) or over
a period certain not longer than the period described in division (D) or (E)
below;
         (c)   Once payments have begun over a period, the period may only be
changed in accordance with division (G) below;
         (d)   Payments will either be nonincreasing or increase only as
follows:
            1.   By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the
percentage increase in an eligible cost-of-living index for a 12-month period
ending in the year during which the increase occurs or a prior year;
            2.   By a percentage increase that occurs at specified times and
does not exceed the cumulative total of annual percentage increases in an
eligible cost- of-living index since the annuity starting date, or if later,
the recent percentage increase;
            3.   By a constant percentage of less than 5% per year, applied not
less frequently than annual;
            4.   As a result of dividend or other payments resulting from
actuarial gains provided:
               a.    Actuarial gain is measured not less frequently than
annually,
               b.   The resulting dividend or other payments are either paid no
later than the year following the year for which the actuarial experience is
measured or paid in the same form as the payment of the annuity over the
remaining period of the annuity (beginning no later than the year following the
year for which the actuarial experience is measured),
               c.   The actuarial gain taken into account is limited to
actuarial gain from investment experience,
               d.   The assumed interest rate used to calculate such actuarial
gains is not less than 3%, and
               e.   The annuity payments are not increased by a constant
percentage as described in division (C)(1)(d)3. above;
            5.   To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the
participant's payments to provide for a survivor benefit, but only if there is
no longer a survivor benefit because the beneficiary whose life was being used
to determine the distribution period described in division (D) below dies or is
no longer the participant's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic
relations order within the meaning of Code Section 414(p);
            6.   To provide a final payment upon the participant's death not
greater than the excess of the actuarial present value of the participant's
accrued benefit (within the meaning of Code Section 411(a)(7)) calculated is of
the annuity starting date using the applicable interest rate and the applicable
mortality table (or if greater, the total amount of employee contributions)
over the total payments before the participant's death;
            7.   To allow a beneficiary to convert the survivor portion of a
joint and survivor annuity into a single sum distribution upon the
participant's death; or
            8.   To pay increased benefits resulting from a plan amendment.
      (2)   Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date and
later payment intervals. The amount that must be distributed on or before the
participant's required beginning date (or, if the participant dies before
distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under
division (B)(2)(a)1. or 2. above) is the payment that is required for one
payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next
payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year.
All of the participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first
distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of
the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the participant's
required beginning date.
      (3)   Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any
additional benefits accruing to the participant in a calendar year after the
first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first
payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar
year in which such amount accrues.
   (D)   Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during
participant's lifetime.
      (1)   Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the participant's
spouse. If the participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a
joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a
nonspouse beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the
participant's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the
participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of
the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the
participant, using the table set forth in Q&A-2(c)(2), in the manner described
in Q&A-2(c)(1), in section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the regulations, to determine the
applicable percentage. If the form of distribution combines a joint and
survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspouse
beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding
sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the designated
beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain.
      (2)   Period certain annuities. Unless the participant's spouse is the
sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain
and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing
during the participant's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution
period for the participant under the uniform lifetime table set forth in Q&A-
2 in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the regulations for the calendar year that
contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes the
year in which the participant reaches age 70, the applicable distribution
period for the participant is the distribution period for age 70 under the
uniform lifetime table set forth in Q&A-2 in section 1.401 (a)(9)-9 of the
regulations plus the excess of 70 over the age of the participant as of the
participant's birthday in the year that contains the annuity starting date. If
the participant's spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary and
the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period
certain may not exceed the longer of the participant's applicable distribution
period, as determined under this division (D)(2), or the joint life and last
survivor expectancy of the participant and the participant's spouse as
determined under the joint and last survivor table set forth in Q&A-3 in
section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the regulations, using the participant's and spouse's
attained ages as of the participant's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar
year that contains the annuity starting date.
   (E)   Requirements for minimum distributions after the participant's death.
      (1)   Death after distributions begin. If the participant dies after
distribution of his interest begins in the form of an annuity meeting the
requirements of this subchapter, the remaining portion of the participant's
interest will continue to be distributed over the remaining period over which
distributions commenced.
      (2)   Death before distributions begin.
         (a)   Participant survived by designated beneficiary. Except to the
extent that an election is made to receive distributions in accordance with the
five-year rule under division (F) below, if the participant dies before the
date distribution of his interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary,
the participant's entire interest will be distributed, beginning no later than
the time described in division (B)(2)(a)1. or 2. above, over the life of the
designated beneficiary or over a period certain) not exceeding:
            1.   Unless the annuity starting date is before the first
distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary
determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the
calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the participant's
death; or
            2.   If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution
calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined
using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar
year that contains the annuity starting date.
Under the five-year rule, the participant's entire interest will be distributed
to the designated beneficiary by December 31 of the calendar year containing
the fifth anniversary of the participant's death.
         (b)   No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the
date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September
30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, distribution of
the participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the
calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death.
         (c)   Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving
spouse begin. If the participant dies before the date distribution of his
interest begins the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole
designated beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before distributions to
the surviving spouse begin, this division (E) will apply as if the surviving
spouse were the participant, except that the time by which distributions must
begin will be determined without regard to division (B)(2)(a)1. above.
   (F)   Election of five-year rule. Participants or beneficiaries may elect on
an individual basis whether the five-year rule in divisions (B)(2) and (E)
above applies to distributions after the death of a participant who has a
designated beneficiary. The election must be made no later than the earlier of
September 30 of the calendar year in which the distribution would be required
to begin under division (B)(2) above if no such election is made, or by
September 30 of the calendar year which contains the fifth anniversary of the
participant's (or, if applicable, surviving spouse's) death.
   (G)   Changes to annuity payment period.
      (1)   Permitted changes. An annuity payment period may be changed only in
association with an annuity payment increase described in division (C)(1)(d)
above or in accordance with division (G)(2) below.
      (2)   Reannuitization. An annuity payment may be changed and the annuity
payments modified in accordance with that change if the conditions in division
(G)(3) below are satisfied and:
         (a)   The modification occurs when the participant retires or in
connection with a plan termination;
         (b)   The payment period prior to modification is a period certain
without life contingencies; or
         (c)   The annuity payments after modification are paid under a
qualified joint and survivor annuity over the joint lives of the participant
and a designated beneficiary, the participant's spouse is the sole designated
beneficiary, and the modification occurs in connection with the participant's
becoming married to such spouse.
      (3)   Conditions. The conditions in this division (G)(3) are satisfied
if:
         (a)   The future payments after the modification satisfy the
requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9), section 1.401(a)(9) of the regulations,
and this subchapter (determined by treating the date of the change as a new
annuity starting date and the actuarial present value of the remaining payments
prior to modification as the entire interest of the participant);
         (b)   For purposes of Code Sections 415 and 417, the modification is
treated as a new annuity starting date;
         (c)   After taking into account the modification, the annuity
(including all past and future payments) satisfies Code Section 415 (determined
at the original annuity starting date, using the interest rates and mortality
tables applicable to such date); and
         (d)   The end point of the period certain, if any, for any modified
payment period is not later than the end point available to the participant at
the original annuity starting date under Code Section 401(a)(9) and this
subchapter.
   (H)   Payments to a surviving child.
      (1)   Special rule. For purposes of this subchapter, payments made to a
participant's surviving child until the child reaches the age of majority (or
dies, if earlier) shall be treated as if such payments were made to the
surviving spouse to the extent the payments become payable to the surviving
spouse upon cessation of the payments to the child.
      (2)   Age of majority. For purposes of this division (H), a child shall
be treated as having not reached the age of majority if the child has not
completed a specified course of education and is under the age of 26. In
addition, a child who is disabled within the meaning of Code Section 72(m)(7)
when the child reaches the age of majority shall be treated as having not
reached the age of majority so long as the child continues to be disabled.
(Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-15)
§ 38.063 TEFRA SECTION 242(b)(2) ELECTIONS.
   (A)   Notwithstanding the other requirements of this subchapter,
distribution on behalf of any participant who has made a designation under
section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (a section
242(b)(2) election) may be made in accordance with all of the following
requirements (regardless of when such distribution commences):
      (1)   The distribution by the Plan is one that would not have
disqualified such Plan under Code Section 401(a)(9) as in effect prior to
amendment by the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984.
      (2)   The distribution is in accordance with a method of distribution
designated by the participant whose interest in the Plan is being distributed
or, if the participant is deceased, by a beneficiary of such participant.
      (3)   Such designation was in writing, was signed by the participant or
the beneficiary, and was made before January 1, 1984.
      (4)   The participant had accrued a benefit under the Plan as of December
31, 1983.
      (5)   The method of distribution designated by the participant or the
beneficiary specifies the time at which distribution will commence, the period
over which distributions will be made, and in the case of any distribution upon
the participant's death, the beneficiaries of the participant listed in order
of priority.
   (B)   A distribution upon death will not be covered by this transitional
rule unless the information in the designation contains the required
information described above with respect to the distributions to be made upon
the death of the participant.
   (C)   For any distribution that commences before January 1, 1984, but
continues after December 31, 1983, the participant, or the beneficiary, to whom
such distribution is being made, will be presumed to have designated the method
of distribution under which the distribution is being made if the method of
distribution was specified in writing and the distribution satisfies the
requirements in divisions (A)(1) and (A)(5) above.
   (D)   If a designation is revoked, any subsequent distribution must satisfy
the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder. If a
designation is revoked subsequent to the date distributions are required to
begin, the Plan must distribute by the end of the calendar year following the
calendar year in which the revocation occurs the total amount not yet
distributed that would have been required to have been distributed to satisfy
Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder, but for the section 242
(b)(2) election. For calendar years beginning after December 31, 1988, such
distributions must meet the minimum distribution incidental benefit
requirements. Any changes in the designation will be considered to be a
revocation of the designation. However, the mere substitution or addition of
another beneficiary (one not named in the designation) under the designation
will not be considered to be a revocation of the designation, so long as such
substitution or addition does not alter the period over which distributions are
to be made under the designation, directly or indirectly (for example, by
altering the relevant measuring life).
   (E)   In the case in which an amount is transferred or rolled over from one
plan to another plan, the rules in Q&A-14 and Q&A-15 in section 1.401(a)(9)-
8 of the regulations shall apply. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-15)
TERMINATION OF THE PLAN
§ 35.070 TERMINATION AND LIMITATION.
   (A)   The employer expects to continue the Plan indefinitely but reserves
the right to terminate the Plan in whole or in part at any time upon giving
written notice to all parties concerned.
   (B)   In the event of the complete termination of this Plan, the rights of
all affected participants to benefits accrued as of the date of such
termination shall be nonforfeitable. Upon complete termination of the Plan, no
further employees shall become participants, and no further contributions shall
be made except as required by any governmental agency to which the Plan's
termination is subject.
   (C)   This Plan is not subject to Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Benefits shall not be insured by the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the participant's recourse towards
satisfaction of his right to his nonforfeitable accrued benefit will be limited
to the Plan assets. However, the assets of the Plan that are available to
provide benefits shall be allocated and applied as of the effective date of
termination of the Plan according to the classifications and order of
precedence provided under Title IV of ERISA and under any rules, regulations,
interpretations or opinions implementing said Title IV or any other equitable
method as determined by the Plan Administrator and agreed upon by the insurer.
   (D)   No part of the Plan assets shall be paid to the employer at any time,
except that, after the satisfaction of all liabilities under the Plan, any
assets remaining shall be paid to the employer. No payment shall be made to the
employer if it would contravene any provision of law. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-
15)
ADMINISTRATION OF PLAN
§ 38.080 ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Subject to the provisions of this subchapter, the Plan Administrator
has complete control of the administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator
has all the powers necessary for it to properly carry out its administrative
duties. Not in limitation, but in amplification of the foregoing, the Plan
Administrator has complete discretion to construe or interpret the provisions
of the Plan, including ambiguous provisions, if any, and to determine all
questions that may arise under the Plan, including all questions relating to
the eligibility of employees to participate in the Plan and the amount of
benefit to which any participant, beneficiary, spouse, or contingent annuitant
may become entitled. The Plan Administrator's decisions upon all matters within
the scope of its authority shall be final.
   (B)   Unless otherwise set out in the Plan or annuity contract, the Plan
Administrator may delegate recordkeeping and other duties that are necessary to
assist it with the administration of the Plan to any person or firm which
agrees to accept such duties. The Plan Administrator shall be entitled to rely
upon all tables, valuations, certificates and reports furnished by the
consultant or actuary appointed by the Plan Administrator and upon all opinions
given by any counsel selected or approved by the Plan Administrator.
   (C)   The Plan Administrator shall receive all claims for benefits by
participants, former participants, beneficiaries, spouses, and contingent
annuitants. The Plan Administrator shall determine all facts necessary to
establish the right of any claimant to benefits and the amount of those
benefits under the provisions of the Plan. The Plan Administrator may establish
rules and procedures to be followed by claimants in filing claims for benefits,
in furnishing and verifying proofs necessary to determine age, and in any other
matters required to administer the Plan. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-15)
§ 38.081 EXPENSES.

is consistent with any law to which the Plan is subject. Expenses of the Plan
will be paid in accordance with the most recent service and expense agreement
or such other documents duly entered into by or with regard to the Plan that
govern such matters. Such expenses include, but are not limited to, expenses
for recordkeeping and other administrative services; fees and expenses of the

microfilming, magnetic impulse, mechanical or electrical recording, or other
forms of data compilation shall be acceptable means of keeping records. (Ord.

§ 38.083 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY.
   All or any part of the administrative duties and responsibilities under this
subchapter may be delegated by the Plan Administrator to a retirement

set out in a separate written agreement. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-15)
§ 38.084 EXERCISE OF DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY.
   The employer, Plan Administrator, and any other person or entity who has
authority with respect to the management, administration, or investment of the
Plan may exercise that authority in its/his full discretion, subject only to
the duties imposed under any laws to which the Plan is subject. This
discretionary authority includes, but is not limited to, the authority to make

§ 38.091 DIRECT ROLLOVERS.
   (A)   Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that would
otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may
elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator, to
have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid, directly to an
eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
   (B)   In the event of a mandatory distribution of an eligible rollover
distribution greater than $1,000 in accordance with §
38.098, if the participant does not elect to have such distribution paid

direct rollover or to receive the distribution directly, the Plan Administrator
will pay the distribution in a direct rollover to an individual retirement plan
designated by the Plan Administrator.
   (C)   In the event of any other eligible rollover distribution to a
distributee in accordance with §
38.098, if the distributee does not elect to have such distribution paid
directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a
direct rollover or to receive the distribution directly, the Plan Administrator
will pay the distribution to the distributee.
   (D)   In the event of an eligible rollover distribution to a distributee, in
accordance with § 38.098, if the distributee does not elect to have such
distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the

§ 38.092 PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE INSURER.
   (A)   The obligations of an insurer shall be governed solely by the

contract. Each annuity contract when purchased shall comply with the Plan. See
§
38.096.
   (B)   The insurer is not a party to the Plan, nor bound in any way by the
Plan provisions. It shall not be required to look to the terms of this Plan,

authority to act in any particular manner or to make any contract or agreement.
   (C)   Until notice of any amendment or termination of this Plan has been
received by the insurer at its home office, the insurer is and shall be fully

§ 38.094 RIGHTS TO PLAN ASSETS.
   (A)   An employee shall not have any right to or interest in any assets of

§ 38.095 BENEFICIARY.
   (A)   Each participant may name a beneficiary to receive any death benefit
(other than any income payable to a contingent annuitant) that may arise out of
his participation in the Plan. The participant may change his beneficiary from
time to time. The participant's beneficiary designation and any change of
beneficiary shall be subject to the provisions of §
38.053.
   (B)   It is the responsibility of the participant to give written notice to
the Plan Administrator of the name of the beneficiary on a form furnished for
that purpose. The Plan Administrator shall maintain records of beneficiary
designations for participants before their retirement dates. However, the Plan
Administrator may delegate to another party the responsibility of maintaining
records of beneficiary designations. In that event, the written designations
made by participants shall be filed with such other party. If a party other
than the insurer maintains the records of beneficiary designations and a
participant dies before his retirement date, such other party shall certify to
the insurer the beneficiary designation on its records for the participant.
   (C)   If there is no beneficiary named or surviving when a participant dies,
the participant's beneficiary shall be the participant's surviving spouse or
domestic partner, or where there is no surviving spouse or domestic partner,
the executor or administrator of the participant's estate. (Ord. 1806, passed
1-7-15)
§ 38.096 CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   The validity of the Plan or any of its provisions is determined under
and construed according to federal law and, to the extent permissible,
according to the laws of the state in which the employer has its principal
office. In case any provision of this Plan is held illegal or invalid for any
reason, such determination shall not affect the remaining provisions of this
Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid
provision had never been included.
   (B)   In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Plan and
the terms of an annuity contract issued hereunder, the provisions of the Plan
control. (Ord. 1806, passed 1-7-15)
§ 38.097 LEGAL ACTIONS.
   No person employed by the employer; no participant, former participant, or
their beneficiaries; nor any other person having or claiming to have an
interest in the Plan is entitled to any notice of process. A final judgment
entered in any such action or proceeding shall be binding and conclusive on all
persons having or claiming to have an interest in the Plan. (Ord. 1806, passed
1-7-15)
§ 38.098 SMALL AMOUNTS.
   (A)   If the present value of the participant's vested accrued benefit does
not exceed $5,000, and the participant has not had an annuity starting date
with respect to any portion of such vested accrued benefit, the present value
of the participant's entire vested accrued benefit shall be distributed as of
the earliest of his retirement date or the date he has a severance from
employment for any reason other than death (the date the employer provides
notice to the record keeper of the Plan of such event, if later). For purposes
of this section, if the present value of the participant's vested accrued
benefit is zero, the participant shall be deemed to have received a
distribution of such present value. This is a small amounts payment. Such small
amounts payment is in full settlement of all benefits otherwise payable.
   (B)   In the event a participant has a severance from employment (for any
reason other than death or retirement) and does not elect to have a small
amounts payment paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the
participant in a direct rollover or to receive the distribution directly and
the present value of his vested accrued benefit is greater than $1,000, a
mandatory distribution will be made in accordance with §
38.091. If the present value of his vested accrued benefit is $1,000 or less,
the present value of the participant's entire vested accrued benefit shall be
paid directly to him.
   (C)   If the present value of the preretirement survivor annuity derived
from the participant's accrued benefit does not exceed $5,000, on the date of
the participant's death, the present value of the preretirement survivor
annuity shall be distributed as of the date the participant dies. If the single
sum death benefit payable to a beneficiary does not exceed $5,000, on the date
of the participant's death, such death benefit shall be distributed in a single
sum as of the date the participant dies. This is a small amounts payment. Such
small amounts payment shall be made to the participant's beneficiary (spouse if
the death benefit is payable to the spouse or domestic partner if the death
benefit is payable to the domestic partner).
   (D)   A small amounts payment is in full settlement of the death benefit
otherwise payable. No other small amounts payments shall be made. (Ord. 1806,
passed 1-7-15)

qualified military service is treated as having resumed and then terminated
employment on account of death, in accordance wth Code Section 401(a)(37) and

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 50.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. Words and
terms used in this chapter which are not included in this section shall be
interpreted in accordance with standard reference books, such as dictionaries
and engineering texts and technical papers, as expanded by accepted local
usage. In the event of conflict between any portion of a definition in this
section and any other reference, the definition herein shall govern insofar as
interpretations and applications of the provisions of this chapter are
concerned.
   BOD. Biochemical Oxygen Demand of a liquid sample. The BOD of the sample is
the concentration, in parts per million, of oxygen which will be utilized in
the biochemical oxidation of organic matter in the sample, when subjected to a
standard laboratory procedure test for five days at a temperature of 200° C.
   BUSINESS UNIT. A physically separated, identifiable non-dwelling unit
serviced by one water meter.
   CITY. City of Pembroke Pines, Broward County, Florida.
   COMMERCIAL CUSTOMER. A non-governmental customer that is neither a
residential customer nor an industrial customer.
   CONNECTION CHARGE. A charge which a developer shall be required to pay for
the privilege of connecting to an overall city utility system. There shall be a
separate connection charge for each system, as described in the appropriate
article of this chapter. The connection charge is not a revenue of the system.
It is a reimbursement to the city of the developer’s share of the costs
incurred by the city in providing the major portions of the overall system, as
identified by a master plan for the system. Connection charges shall be paid at
the time a property first connects to the city’s utility systems. In most
cases, these will be one-time charges. However, if a property owner
subsequently applies for a Building Permit for new or revised construction on
his property, there may be additional connection charges. At the time of
application for the new building permit, the city shall compute what the total
connection charges would be if the revised property were applying for initial
connections to the systems. If the computed charges are higher than the total
connection charges previously paid, then the property owner shall be required
to pay new connection charges, equal to the difference. If the computed charges
are equal to, or less than, those previously paid, there will be no requirement
for new charges, or a refund.
   CONSTRUCTION CHARGE. A one-time charge which a developer might be required
to pay for the privilege of connecting to a sub-portion of a city utility
system, located between the owner’s property and the portion of the system
identified in a city master plan. When required, a construction charge shall be
intended as reimbursement of the developer’s share of the costs  of
constructing the applicable sub-portion of the utility system. In each case,
the magnitude and distribution of the construction charge shall have been
previously established in one or more developer’s agreement between the city
and a previous developer, who paid the costs of constructing the sub-portion.
Construction charges received by the city from the future developers are used
by the city to reimburse the original developer for that portion of the
construction costs considered to be for oversized facilities, as defined in
this section.
   CUSTOMER. The owner of the property or an individual or corporate entity
authorized by the owner to open the utility account.
   DEVELOPER. Owner of a development, as defined in this section. If an agent
of the owner has the full legal authority to negotiate with the city for
connection to the city’s utility services, then the agent shall be considered
as the developer.
   DEVELOPER’S AGREEMENT. A written agreement entered into between the city and
a developer, if funding of the construction of some of the mains of a utility
service to serve a development entails the use of special procedures. If used,
it shall be negotiated between the developer and the City Manager, or his
representative, and shall be accepted by the city by resolution of the City
Commission. As a minimum, a developer’s agreement shall be required whenever
all of the following conditions apply:
      (1)   The development cannot proceed unless there is some construction of
new mains for a public utility system.
   (B)   The developer is to contribute some or all of the cost of the
construction of those mains, either by constructing them himself and then
giving title to the city, or by paying some or all of the construction costs
incurred by others.
   (C)   The mains being constructed:
      (1)   Either are in a portion of the system identified in a master plan,
and the value of the developer’s contribution to construction costs will be
larger than the required connection charge;
      (2)   Or include one or more oversized facilities in a sub-portion of the
utility system to be situated between the individual lots of the development
and the portion of the system identified in the master plan.
   (D)   The city has determined that future developments will benefit from the
current construction and, because of the current developer’s excess
contribution, he will be entitled to some reimbursement from the future
developments, either from their required connection charges or from special
construction charges established in the developer’s agreement.
   DEVELOPMENT. A parcel of land, regardless of size or location, which is
proposed for development to the extent that utility services will be required,
and for which one or more of the proposed lots will not be able to receive
adequate utility service unless one or more new utility mains and/or service
laterals are constructed.
   DWELLING UNIT. Any collection of one or more rooms which includes at least
one bathroom and which normally either is used to provide overnight lodging for
only the owner and his immediate family, or is offered as a unit for overnight
lodging of others. If a collection of rooms is capable of being offered to the
public both as a single unit and as several individual units, then each of the
individual units shall be considered a dwelling unit.
   ENGINEER. For purposes of this chapter, ENGINEER shall mean either the
consulting engineering firm engaged by the city for engineering services
related to utilities, or an employee of that firm who is registered to practice
engineering in the state.
   EPA. The United States Environmental Protection Agency, a federal agency
responsible for regulation of sewage treatment and disposal, and for issuance
of federal grants to aid in construction of sewage facilities.
   EPA INDUSTRIAL USER. An industrial customer of the city’s sewer system
meeting one of the following criteria, as defined in Federal Regulations 40 CFR
35.905;
      (1)   Any non-governmental, non-residential customer meeting both of the
following:
         (a)   Performs an activity identified in the Federal Standard
Classification Manual, 1972, OMB (as amended and supplemented) in either
Division A, Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing; or Division B, Mining; or Division
D, Manufacturing; or Division E, Transportation, Communications, Electric, Gas,
Sanitary Services; or Division I, Services.
         (b)   Discharges into the city’s system non-domestic/ non-sanitary
sewage either which exceed 25,000 gallons per day (gpd) of total flow, or which
contain an equivalent weight of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) or Suspended
Solids (SS) in excess of the BOD or SS found in 25,000 gpd of sanitary wastes
containing 300 PPM of BOD and 300 PPM of SS.
      (2)   Any non-governmental customer that discharges into the city’s
system sewage which contain toxics or poisonous solids, liquids, or gases in
sufficient quantity (either singly or by interaction with other wastes) to
contaminate the sludge of any municipal systems or to injure or interfere with
any sewage treatment process; or which constitutes a hazard to humans or
animals, or creates a public nuisance, or creates any hazard in or has an
adverse effect on the waters receiving any discharge from the city’s system.
      (3)   Non-applicable.
   EPA MAJOR CONTRIBUTING INDUSTRY. A customer of the city’s sewer system that
is an “EPA Industrial User” and that meets one of the following additional
criteria, as defined in Federal Regulations 40 CFR 128.124:
      (1)   Average work day discharge equal to or greater than 50,000 gpd.

in standards issued under Section 307(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act Amendments of 1972 (PL 92-500).
   EQUIVALENT RESIDENTIAL CONNECTION (ERC). A unit of measure used to identify
the annual average water consumption or sewer generation for an average
customer in each of the various categories of customer of the city’s utilities.
One ERC is defined to be 300 gallons per day.  ERC values for various
structures shall be calculated based on the design flow established by the
Broward County Code of Ordinance Chapter 27 Article V, Section 201(a)(3), as
may be amended from time to time. The design flow for sewer generation shall be
considered equal to water consumption. ERC values for industrial customers
shall be determined by the city on a case-by-case basis.
   FIRE FLOW. The rate of flow and pressure necessary to provide an adequate
capability to fight a fire. Wherever possible there should be two or more
primary feeders from a point of supply which may be tapped with a line size
capable of delivering the fire flow needed to that specific area of the city
wherein the outlet is located. The magnitudes required for an adequate
capability are dependent upon many factors. It is the intention that the city’s
water distribution system be capable of delivering a fire flow equal to the
flow calculated in accordance with the “Fire Suppression Rating Schedule”, by
insurance service office in effect at the time of installation.
   FIXTURE UNIT. A measure of the instantaneous rate of flow normally required
by a particular type of plumbing fixture. The sum of the fixture units of all
plumbing fixtures in a building is a measure of the total water used by that
building. From time to time, the city will analyze available consumption data
and establish a list of fixture unit values for various types of plumbing
fixtures. The current values authorized for use in connection with this chapter
are:

property line at that right-of-way is composed only of one or more straight
lines, then the total length of the abutting property line is the frontage of
the property. If a portion of the abutting property line is composed of an arc,
then  the frontage of that portion shall be measured along lines tangent to the
arc. If a parcel abuts two different rights-of-way, then the frontage shall be

to rights-of-way is defined to be equal to the square root of the total square
foot area of the parcel.
   GPD. Gallons per day.
   GPM. Gallons per minute.
   INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMER. A customer that obtains a utility service for the
purpose of manufacturing, producing, assembling or processing one or more
products, and; either the average quantity of service required for that purpose
exceeds 20,000 gallons per day; or the type of sewage generated by that
purpose, prior to any pretreatment, is such that without pretreatment the
conditions of division (2) of EPA INDUSTRIAL USER, as defined herein, would be
applicable.
   LINE. See MAIN.
   MAIN. The terms MAIN, LINE and PIPE shall be used interchangeably. The
following are some of the types referred to in this chapter:
      (1)   Gravity Main: A pipe in a sewer system in which flow is caused by
force of gravity.
      (2)   Force Main: A pipe in a sewer system in which flow is caused by the
force of one or more pumps.
      (3)   Distribution Main: Any pipe in a water system by which water is
carried from the treatment plant to one or more water service laterals.
      (4)   Looped Main: A water distribution main which has both of its ends
connected to one or more other distribution mains.
   MASTER PLAN. A planning document adopted by the city as a guide to expansion
of the major portions of a utility system, in order to satisfy projected future
needs for service. The city water and sewer systems each have a separate master
plan.
   (A)   The water master plan depicts the sizes and locations of existing and
proposed supply and treatment facilities and the approximate sizes and
locations of a looped grid of major distribution mains, approximately a mile
apart in each direction. Although not depicted in the master plan, it is
intended that the city water system also include a system of looped smaller
distribution mains interior to each loop depicted in the master plan.
   (B)   The City of Pembroke Pines has an agreement with the City of Hollywood
whereby Pembroke Pines pays Hollywood to receive, treat, and dispose of all
Pembroke Pines sewage. The Pembroke Pines Sewer Master Plan depicts a network
of major pumping stations and force mains for transmission of sewage to
Hollywood. Although not depicted in the master plan, it is intended that the
city sewer system also include subsystems of gravity sewers and small pumps and
force mains, with each subsystem collecting the sewage from approximately a
square mile, and introducing it into the transmission system depicted in the
master plan.
   METER CHARGE. A charge paid to the city by a developer or property owner as
reimbursement to the city for the costs of furnishing and installing the meter
and all other facilities at a water service connection, either at the time of
initial installation or whenever a change in size or capacity is performed. If
the city authorizes a developer to construct a service connection, then
acceptance by the city of the completed work shall constitute payment in full
of the meter charge, without regard to the magnitude of actual costs incurred
by the developer or published schedules of charges.
   MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL UNIT. A residential customer that pays a single
monthly service charge but provides utilities to two or more residential
dwelling units.
   OVERSIZED FACILITY. A pipe or pumping facility which satisfies all of the
following:
      (1)   It is constructed in order to serve a new development and is
located in a sub-portion of a city utility system which connects the individual
lots of the development to a portion of the system indicated in the master
plan.
      (2)   The developer has contributed to its construction, either by
constructing it himself or by making total or partial reimbursement of the
costs of construction by others.
      (3)   The city has determined that adequate service to future nearby
developments will not be
possible unless the current facility is constructed larger than would be
required to serve only the current development. In determining the size that
would be required to service only the current development, the city shall use
generally accepted design criteria and shall apply all of the provisions of
this chapter, such as required minimums, looped distribution mains, fire flows,
and the like.
   pH. A number, determined by standard laboratory test, which serves as a
measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a liquid.
   PLAN REVIEW CHARGES. Charges paid by a developer to defray costs incurred by
the city in reviewing utility plans submitted by the developer. Construction
plans for all water and sewer facilities to be constructed by the developer
between the service connections of his individual lots and the existing city
water and sewer mains must be submitted with the application for connection to
the city’s utility systems. At that time, the developer shall pay a plan review
charge as provided in Ordinance No. 1111, as amended from time to time, as his
share of all “normal” plan review costs incurred by the city. “Normal” plan
review costs are defined to be all costs associated with: pre-submittal
meetings with the city staff and the engineer, the first review of the final
plans submitted with the application, the preparation of a letter to the
developer itemizing any required plan modifications identified in the first
review, and the inspection of a first resubmittal, to verify that the
previously identified modifications have been made. “Abnormal” review costs are
defined to be any and all review costs that are incurred by the city subsequent
to a determination that the first resubmittal has not complied with all
requirements identified during the initial plan review. If the city incurs any
abnormal plan review costs, the developer shall be required to pay an
additional plan review charge in an amount equal to the one-for-one
reimbursement of the actual abnormal costs incurred by the city. The additional
plan review charge shall be due and payable at the time a final set of
construction plans is approved.
   PLUMBING. All piping, fittings, and appurtenances on the property owner’s
side of the service connection, not including the service connection. All
plumbing is to be constructed, owned and maintained by the property owner.
   PRE-TREATMENT. Any chemical, biological or physical treatment (other than
use of a grease trap) applied to sewage by a customer in order to  reduce an
actual or potential adverse impact upon the sewer system or public health and
safety.
   RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER. A customer that utilizes utility services for one or
more dwelling units.
   SANITARY SEWAGE. That type of sewage normally originating from dwelling
units. That is, sewage generated by bathrooms, preparation and serving of food
for family consumption, and laundry in family-size loads. Sewage introduced
into the city sewer system by a commercial or industrial customer shall be
considered to be sanitary sewage only if its potential as a hazard to public
health and safety or as an adverse impact upon the sewer system and/or the
sewer treatment processes is similar to, or less severe than that caused by
sewage normally originating from dwelling units. The following are some, but
not necessarily all, of the criteria which shall be used in identifying
sanitary sewage. If any one of these criteria is exceeded, then the sewage in
question automatically shall be considered as not being sanitary sewage. The
potential as a hazard or adverse impact of any characteristic not listed herein
shall be determined by the city on a case-by-case basis.
Characteristics Maximum (or Minimum) For Sanitary Sewage (ppm)
Characteristics                        Maximum (or Minimum) For Sanitary Sewage

   SECURITY DEPOSIT. A deposit which must be made by each customer to receive
any utility service. The purpose of the deposit is to ensure payment of the
final bill charges on the account, and/or penalties and payment of any
reimbursements to the city for the cost of any repairs to city-owned property
which are determined by the city to be the responsibility of the  customer.
Whenever any such amounts are due to the city and have not been paid within the
prescribed time, service will be shut-off until all amounts due are paid. The
required security deposit will be applied towards the final bill charges when
the account is closed.
   SERVICE CONNECTION. A point at or near the property line at which the
property owner’s plumbing is connected to the city’s service lateral. The term
SERVICE CONNECTION also includes all city-owned fittings and appurtenances at
the point of connection. A water service connection includes the city-owned
meter box or vault, together with all of its contents, and any valve and valve
box installed immediately adjacent to the public side of the meter box or
vault. A sewer service connection includes the fitting to which the owner’s
plumbing is connected, the clean-out and plug, and any markings or devices
installed as an aid to locating the service connection.
   SERVICE LATERAL. A pipe which connects a service connection to a water
distribution main or sewer main.
   SEWAGE. Liquid wastes and waterborne solid wastes originating from
residential commercial or industrial establishments, together with such ground
water, surface water or storm drainage as may unintentionally enter into the
sewer system.
   SEWER OR SEWER SYSTEM. A network of gravity mains, pump stations and force
mains used to transport sewage from points of origin to a treatment/disposal
plant.
   SEWER RESERVED CAPACITY CHARGE. A one-time charge which a developer or
property owner shall be required to pay when a property first is connected to
the city’s sewer system, in addition to the required sewer connection charge
and the sewer construction charge, if required. Commencing in 1975, the city
has been required to pay to the city annual “Capital Charges” to reimburse
Hollywood for Pembroke Pines’ share of costs to construct Hollywood’s sewer
transmission and treatment facilities. The “Capital Charge” includes payment
for facilities sufficient to provide the city not only with the then  current
needs of the city, but also projected future needs. The sewer reserve capacity
charge paid to the city by developers and property owners is intended to
reimburse the city for their share of the city’s capital charges payments to
Hollywood during the period from January 1, 1975, to the date the property
begins to receive city sewer services. The amount of the sewer reserve capacity
charge is defined to be: (Number of Months from January 1, 1975, to the date
service begins) times (Number of ERC’s in the Development, as defined herein)
times (1.75).
   SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENCE. A detached single-family home. Also, each one of
several single family homes which are attached to each other, or are in the
same structure, but which each are billed individually for utility services.
   SS or SUSPENDED SOLIDS. Solid particles floating or suspended in a liquid
that are removable by laboratory filtration.
   STORM DRAIN OR STORM DRAINAGE SYSTEM. A system of conduits, open channels
and/or sloped ground intended to restrict and/or direct the flow of run-off
resulting from rainfall. All run-off from any source, including building roofs
and surfaces, shall be directed to a storm drain. There shall be no intentional
connections between any storm drain and any sewer, and both type systems shall
be designed, constructed and maintained in such a manner as to minimize the
likelihood of any unintentional introduction of run-off or ground water into a
sewer, and vice versa.
   TAPPING CHARGE. A charge paid to the city by a developer or property owner
as reimbursement to the city for the costs of furnishing and installing a water
or sewer service lateral, and the necessary fittings and valves at the main,
either at the time of initial installation or whenever a change in size or
capacity is performed. If the city authorizes a developer to construct a
service lateral, then acceptance by the city of the completed work shall
constitute payment in full of the tapping charge, without regard to the
magnitude of actual costs incurred by the developer or published schedules of
charges.

§ 50.02 REQUIRED CONNECTIONS TO CITY UTILITIES; POLICY.
   It shall be the policy of the city that if a city utility service is
available to any facility requiring that type of service, then the city utility
system shall be extended to a service connection and the plumbing of the
facility shall be connected to the service connection. Availability shall be
determined as follows:
   (A)   Facility in Existence as of Time This Chapter Adopted. The city shall
issue written notice whenever the utility does become available. Within 45 days
of the date of notification, the property owner shall have entered into a
contract with the city for connection to the utility.
   (B)   Developments Authorized Subsequent To Adoption Of This Chapter.
      (1)   If a utility main exists in any right-of-way abutting the property,
then that utility shall be considered available. Prior to receipt of a permit
for any construction, the developer shall have entered into a contract with the
city for the connection.
      (2)   Zoning, platting and development ordinances and regulations of the
city and county establish criteria as to what public facilities and services
must be available before a new development can be constructed. If those
criteria require availability of either a public water system or a public sewer
system, then approval of the development by the city will be contingent upon
mutual agreement between the developer and the city as to how and when the city
utility system will be extended to the development.
      (3)   If a new development is approved without a utility being available,
then the provisions of §
50.02(A) shall apply to future connection of that utility.
   (C)   Unless otherwise provided for herein, all utility accounts with the
city shall be opened by the property owner, in accordance with the application
provided by the city's Utilities division.
(Ord. 641, passed 12-15-82; Am. Ord. 1754, passed 6-19-13; Am. Ord. 1978,
passed 11-17-21)
§ 50.03 EXTENSION OF CITY SYSTEMS.
   Requirements related to extensions of utility systems vary depending upon
whether the extension: includes only service laterals and/or service
connections, or includes new mains located between one or more service laterals
and a portion of the system depicted in the master plan, or includes a portion
of the system depicted in the master plan.
   (A)   Service Laterals and Service Connections.
      (1)   If a main already exists in a right-of-way abutting a property
line, but there is no service lateral, or a replacement lateral is necessary,
then the city shall construct the service lateral and service connection, and
the developer or property owner shall pay a meter charge (water only) and a
tapping charge. If only a new or replacement water service connection is
required, then the city shall do the work and a meter charge shall be paid.
      (2)   If a new main also is required, then both the main and the service
lateral shall be constructed at the same time as the new main. A water service
connection may, at the discretion of the city, be constructed either at the
same time as the lateral or subsequently. If either one is constructed by the
developer, title to the completed product shall be transferred to the city. In
that event, payment of the tapping and/or meter charge corresponding to the
transferred work shall not be required and this fact shall be stated in the
connection contract. The relationship between actual costs incurred by the
developer and standard tapping and/or meter charges shall be immaterial, and no
credits for any differences shall accrue to either the city or the developer.
If either the lateral or the water service connection is constructed by the
city, then the corresponding charge shall be paid.
   (B)   New Mains Not in Master Plan.
      (1)   In general, any new facilities between those depicted in a master
plan and the service laterals for a development shall be constructed by the
developer, at his own expense. Drawings and specifications shall be submitted
to the City Utility Director for review. Assisted as he sees fit by
recommendations of the engineer, the revision and resubmittal. If the director
determines that any portion of the work must be an oversized facility, then the
developer shall obtain two cost estimates for the portion designated to be
oversized - one if built oversized and one if built to the size required to
serve only the development, where both sizes are as approved by the utility
director. The director also shall obtain two such estimates. The developer and
the director then shall negotiate both a contract for the utility connection,
which will indicate whether the oversized facility is to be built by the
developer or by the city, and a developer’s agreement, which will indicate: the
amount of reimbursement from future construction charges to which the developer
will be entitled because of the oversizing, the specific properties that are
considered to be the future beneficiaries of the oversizing, and the specific
formula to be used in calculating the construction charges to be paid to the
city by the owners when those properties are connected to the system. If the
city is to construct the oversized facilities, the developer shall be required
to fully reimburse the city for all costs actually incurred, including any
costs for engineering services during design and construction. That full
reimbursement shall be due and payable at the same time as payment of the
required connection charge. Any reimbursements back to the developer for
oversizing shall not be made until the city has received construction charges
from future beneficiaries of the oversizing, as stipulated in the developer’s
agreement.
      (2)   If mutually agreeable, the contract for the connection might
stipulate that the city shall construct not only the oversized facility but
also all other new facilities needed to serve the development. In this case,
the developer shall reimburse the city for all costs for design and
construction of all work done by the city, but he shall not receive any
subsequent reimbursement from future users for the portions not considered to
be oversized.
   (C)   Master Plan Facilities. In general, all facilities depicted in a
master plan are to be built by the city, using funds already available to the
city and without immediate one-for-one reimbursement from a specific developer.
However, it is intended that connection charges shall reimburse the city for
those costs. It shall be the policy of the city that the costs of master plan
facilities needed for future developments shall be borne primarily by
reimbursements to the city from those developments, and that connection charges
paid by those developments shall serve as an equitable means of accomplishing
the reimbursements. Accordingly, at a frequency of every two to three years the
city will review projected future developments, connection charges to be paid
by those developments, and projected costs of existing and new master plan
facilities needed to serve those developments. After each such review, the
required connection charges will be adjusted in an attempt to ensure:
      (1)   Approximate equality between the then current projected total
connection charges to be received from future developments and the then current
projected costs of master plan facilities constructed to serve those
developments.
      (2)   The ratio of any one connection charge to projected total
connection charges from new developments approximately equal to the ratio of
the utility services that development is expected to receive from new master
plan facilities and the total services to be provided by those facilities.
      (3)   (a)   It may occur that some of the facilities shown in a master
plan will be needed to serve a proposed development, but the then current city
construction program will not ensure that those facilities will be available at
the time the developer desires to start his construction. In such a case, the
developer may, if he wishes, request that he be allowed to assist in
accelerating the construction of those master plan facilities needed to serve
his development. Upon receipt of such a request, the city will attempt to
negotiate mutually agreeable terms concerning: whether the needed master plan
facilities will be built by the developer or by the city; who shall pay the
costs of the construction; and how much, if any, of the master plan costs paid
by the developer will be returned to him in the future. The amount of any such
reimbursement will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis, and shall be
determined in a manner similar to that described for reimbursement of costs for
“Oversized” non-master plan facilities, in §
50.03(B).
         (b)   Regardless of the size of the agreed upon reimbursement for a
developer’s payment of the costs of master plan facilities, that reimbursement
shall be made from future connection charges. The reimbursement initially shall
serve as a direct credit against the connection charges which the developer
will be required to pay, as established in this chapter. In the event the
agreed upon reimbursement exceeds his own connection charges, then the
remainder of the reimbursement will be made from future connection charges, as
they are received by the city from other developments.
         (c)   Details of the reimbursement shall be stipulated in a negotiated
developer’s agreement, which will indicate: the amount of the reimbursement the
developer is to receive, the period of reimbursement, whether reimbursement
shall be from all connection charges collected in that period or only from
those collected from specified geographical locations, and whether all or only
a specified fraction of each eligible connection charge shall be used for
reimbursement.

§ 50.04 PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Prior to preparing any detailed plans for either water or sewer
facilities to serve a new development, the developer shall submit to the City
Utility Director written notification of intention to connect to a city
utility. Included with the notification should be a preliminary layout of the
proposed development, including general location and proposed size of all
proposed utility mains, both interior to the development and those necessary to
connect to the existing system. He also should submit data as to projected
water requirements, both for daily use and fire flow, and projected sewer
requirements, both flow rates and type sewage. Unless otherwise indicated, it
will be assumed that the developer intends to perform construction of all
indicated new mains, without regard to location but subject to any future
reimbursement to which he might be entitled.
   (B)   After allowing two weeks for review of his submittal by the city and
the engineer, the developer shall make telephone contact with the engineer to
schedule a meeting with the Utility Director and the engineer. The purpose of
the meeting will be to reach tentative agreement as to design criteria, who
will be performing the work, and if there will be a need for any oversizing
and/or special construction of any master plan facilities. At the same time,
the developer should request information as to whether his development will be
subject to any construction charges because of any previous oversizing that had
been considered as beneficial to his development.
   (C)   Subsequently, the developer will submit to the Utility Director a
formal application for connection to the city utility, using forms furnished by
the Utility Department. Included with the application will be final
construction drawings and specifications, signed and sealed by a Professional
Engineer registered in Florida, for all public facilities to be constructed by
the developer and the required plan review charge. Upon review and approval of
the application, the connection contract and developer’s agreement, if
required, will be executed.
   (D)   If it has been agreed that the city is to perform any of the work,
then prior to the city beginning to prepare the design and construction
documents for that work, the developer will make a deposit cash or check with
the city equal to 5% of the estimated total costs to be incurred by the city.
The deposit shall be made at the same time as submittal of the application for
connection to the city system. As soon as the city receives bids for its
construction work, the developer shall deposit with the city an amount which,
when added to the previous deposit, equals 110% of the total city costs, as
then estimated. This deposit shall be in the form of cash, a check, or a letter
of credit. Upon completion of the work, a final accounting shall be made, with
the developer making a formal payment to the city equal to actual final total
costs incurred, and any unused deposit being returned to the developer.
   (E)   Any connection charges, construction charges, sewer reserve capacity
charges, tapping charges, or meter charges which are due on each structure in a
development shall be due and payable no later than issuance of a certificate of
occupancy for the structure, and evidence of full payment of those charges
shall be a prerequisite of issuance of the certificate of occupancy.
   (F)   In addition to the above requirements, the developer shall be
responsible for accomplishing the following prior to receipt of a certificate
of occupancy:
      (1)   Designing and constructing all water and sewer plumbing on the
property owner’s side of each service connection. Application for permits, and
payment of associated permit fees, for construction of this work shall be in
accordance with ordinances and regulations for building permits and
certificates of occupancy, as administered by the City Building Department.
However, in addition to any review done by the Building Department, the
portions of plumbing between buildings and service connections also shall be
reviewed by the Engineering Department. Therefore, whenever application is made
to the Building Department for a permit which includes plumbing to a service
connection, a copy shall be submitted to the Engineering Department by the
developer. It shall be the responsibility of the Engineering and Building
Departments to ensure that review and comment by the Engineering Department are
taken into consideration by the Building Department.
      (2)   Obtaining all permits required by the Building Department and the
City Engineer for any work to be done by the developer in city rights-of-ways
or easements. Application and payment of fees shall be as required in
ordinances and regulations administered by those departments.
      (3)   Obtaining all permits required by county and state regulatory
authorities for any mains to be constructed by the developer. Application and
payment of fees shall be as required by those agencies.
      (4)   Submitting to the City Engineer the following for any service
connections, service laterals, mains, or other portions of the city’s utility
systems that have been constructed by the developer.
         (a)   Three prints of "as-built" drawings, as signed and sealed by the
engineer of record, one electronic copy in PDF and AutoCAD format.
         (b)   A legal document providing transfer of title to the city for all
such property, using forms and/or samples as prepared or approved by the City
Attorney.
         (c)   A one-year maintenance guarantee bond in the amount of 20% of
the construction costs. For one year subsequent to approval of the work by the
City Engineer, any repairs or replacements required by the work either shall be
performed by the developer, or the bond shall be used to reimburse the city for
costs incurred by the city in correcting the work.
         (d)   The developer shall provide one emergency generator and/or one
emergency by-pass pump at the city’s discretion for each new lift station
constructed or upgraded.
         (e)   When required by the city, the developer shall provide a
revision to the city's water and/or sewer hydraulic model(s) by retaining a
Florida Registered Engineer to providing model output as a result of the
subject development. When model output results indicate the subject development
will negatively impact the city's facilities, the developer shall enter into a
developer's agreement for the necessary improvement as determined by the model
output and approved by the city.

§ 50.05 GUARANTEE OF DEVELOPER AGREEMENT REIMBURSEMENTS.
   (A)   Section
50.03(B) and (C) describe conditions under which a developer shall be entitled
to reimbursement for certain portions of his contribution to construction of
extensions of city utility systems. Those divisions also stipulate that the
money for said reimbursement shall be obtained by the city from construction
and/or connection charges to be paid by future developers. It shall be the
policy of the city that a developer is entitled to receive at least 50% of the
agreed reimbursement by no later than five years after the agreement, and the
full amount of the agreed reimbursement by no later than ten years. During the
first five years, the city will make payments to the developer only when
charges from future developers are received by the city in accordance with the
formulas established in the developer’s agreement. At the end of the first five
years, if the total payments made to the developer up to then are less than 50%
of the total agreed reimbursement, the city shall use other available city
funds to make a payment to the developer in an amount to bring the total to
50%. In the second five years, payments from received construction and/or
connection charges again will be made as received, until the total payments to
the developer, including adjustments by the city, reach 100% of the agreed
reimbursement. Any construction and/or connection charges received by the city
subsequent to payment of 100% of the agreed reimbursement shall be retained by
the city.
   (B)   Total to-date payments also will be reviewed annually at the end of
the sixth through tenth years. If totals are less than 60% through 100%,
respectively, the city again will use other funds to make a payment in an
amount needed to bring the total up to the applicable percentage of the agreed
reimbursement.

§ 50.06 PUBLIC UTILITIES TO BE IN PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY EASEMENTS.
   It shall be the policy of the city that subsequent to adoption of this
chapter all new city utility facilities shall be located either in a public
right-of-way or in an easement formally dedicated to public use. Easements
shall be used only if specifically approved by the city, and approval shall be
made only if it is demonstrated the restriction to locations in rights-of-way
will result in undue hardship upon the developer. When used, easements shall be
a minimum of 15 feet wide, with all utilities located at least five feet inside
the easement.
(Ord. 641, passed 12-15-82; Am. Ord. 1978, passed 11-17-21)
§ 50.07 MONTHLY SERVICE CHARGES; POLICY
   It shall be the policy of the city that monthly charges for use of the
city’s water and sewer systems shall be sufficient to recover: all
administrative costs associated with the systems; all operation and maintenance
costs of the systems (including cost to renew and/or replace existing
facilities); and all bond debt service associated with the system. It shall be
the responsibility of the City Utility Department and the City Finance
Department to maintain detailed records of actual expenses incurred by the city
in providing water and sewer services, and a breakdown of those expenses at
least into the following categories:
   (A)   Administrative Costs of the Combined Water and Sewer System. For
identification purposes, such costs shall be deemed to be essentially the same
categories of expenses as are identified under “Customer Accounts Expenses”
(Accts 901-905) and “Administrative and General Expenses” (Accts 920-932) in
the Uniform System of Accounts for Class A and B Water Utilities published by
the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. For accounting
purposes, it shall be assumed that one-half of the combined administrative
costs are incurred by the water system, and one-half by the wastewater system.
   (B)   Separate Costs for Water System Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Costs
and Sewer O&M Costs. Included therein shall be the costs of providing for
replacement of worn or obsolete facilities. Also included shall be all charges
to the city by the city which have been identified by Hollywood as charges to
cover O&M costs of Hollywood’s sewer system.
   (C)   Original Construction Costs, Including Associated Debt Service. As in
the case of O&M costs, original construction costs shall be separated into
those incurred by the water system and those incurred by the wastewater system.
   (D)   It shall be the policy of the city that administrative costs shall be
borne equally by all customers, without regard to gallons of service received.
Accordingly, the City Commission shall establish a minimum monthly water charge
and a minimum monthly sewer charge. It shall be the policy of the city that
payment of the established minimum monthly charges shall entitle each customer
to receive the specified minimum amount of water and sewer services during that
month.
   (E)   It shall be the policy of the city that all users of the city’s water
and sewer systems shall ensure that all water obtained from the city’s water
system passes through a city-owned water meter. Each customer shall have one
service connection designated as its principal connection, at which one or more
meters shall measure all water for which any significant portion ultimately can
be introduced into the city sewer system. If a customer desires water for a use
in which no significant portion can enter the sewer systems, and if the
customer’s distribution system for that use has no cross-connections either
with the distribution system for another use or the city’s sewer system, then
that user may, at his option and expense, receive water for that use through a
separate secondary service connection. No user of the city’s sewer system
shall, without the city’s explicit consent, introduce into that system any
water which has not been measured through that owner’s principal service
connection. One prerequisite of such city consent shall be the installation, at
the user’s expense, of a properly designed sewage flow meter which measures all
flows, regardless of origin, introduced into the city sewer system by that
user.
   (F)   It shall be the policy of the city that monthly service charges for
use of its sewer system shall be based on: either the water flow measured
through the customer’s principal service connection or the wastewater flow
measured by a meter which measures the customer’s total wastewater flows.
Monthly service charges based on a wastewater flow meter shall be allowed only
if the wastewater meter has been installed in connection with the city’s
explicit consent of the introduction into the sewer system of water originating
from some source other than the city’s water system. In either event, monthly
service charges for use of the sewer system shall be computed by multiplying a
rate per 1000 gallons times the metered flow (minus any initial amount which
has been designated by the City Commission as being associated with the minimum
monthly sewer charge). The same rate shall be used for all customers that
discharge the same type of sewage, without regard to whether the meter used is
the principal water meter or an authorized wastewater meter, and without regard
to how many gallons are being billed.
   (G)   It shall be the policy of the city that all O & M costs of its water
and sewer systems shall be recovered by the monthly water and sewer service
charges, respectively. If authorized by the City Commission, the monthly
service charges may be established sufficiently high as to be used to recover
not only O & M costs but also other costs, but they shall not be reduced below
that necessary to recover O & M costs.
   (H)   It shall be the policy of the city that monthly service charges for
water, sewer and sanitation may be suspended for individual accounts under
extenuating circumstances and as approved by the City Manager or his designee.
(Ord. 641, passed 12-15-82; Am. Ord. 1978, passed 11-17-21)
§ 50.08 PROCEDURES.
   (A)   At the time the plumbing of a lot first is connected to a service
connection, the property owner shall open an account with the city for payment
of monthly service charges, including payment of required security deposits and
fee in accordance with §
50.08(B) for opening the account. The property shall be added to the applicable
monthly billing cycle and, effective with the next scheduled billing date for
that cycle, the property owner shall begin receiving bills for monthly service
charges, in amounts as established in §§
50.31 through
50.59. Specified minimum monthly charges shall be due and payable, and billed
to the customer of record, for each and every month thereafter, without regard
to whether the water service has been shut off for any reason.
   (B)   Effective October 1, 2021, deposits and other fees required for the
use of city water and sewer facilities shall be as set forth in the document
Customer Service Fee Schedule, prepared by the Utility Department and approved
by the City Manager, for the purposes of recovering city costs. The deposits
and fees will be annually adjusted each October 1, and effective that same date
for the subsequent year, using the change in the Consumer Price Index for all
urban consumers in the United States – Water and Sewerage Maintenance Series
published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12 months ending April of
each year or 3% or actual costs, whichever is greater, effective annually as of
October 1. It is the city's intent to recover its actual costs and adjust the
fees accordingly. Therefore, adjustments due to changes in city costs may be
issued by the City Manager on an as-needed basis. Upon approval by the City
Manager, the Customer Service Fee Schedule, and any amendments or adjustments
thereto, shall be reported to the City Commission and absent objection will
take effect on the dates provided in the schedule.
   (C)   The original property owner shall remain as the customer of record
until the account is closed and the security deposit has been applied to the
final bill. The account will not be closed until the department is notified
that ownership of the property has changed, sold or otherwise transferred.
   (D)   Each time that a new utility account is opened, either upon addition
of a new service connection or upon changing the customer of record for an
existing service connection, the new customer shall pay a fee in accordance
with § 50.08(B) to defray the administrative costs involved.
   (E)   Each bill for water and sewer monthly service charges, plus any other
water and sewer charges which are due, shall be due and payable when rendered.
If the city has not received payment in full within 20 days after the date of
mailing of a utility bill, that bill shall be deemed delinquent. The monthly
bill immediately following a delinquent bill shall have a penalty fee added to
it. The penalty fee shall be equal to 10% of the total of all previous water
and sewer billings which had not been received by the city.
   (F)   If a customer believes that a billed monthly service charge is
incorrect, he must submit a written protest to the Utility Department within 20
days of the date of the bill. Any bill not protested within 20 days shall be
presumed to be correct as billed, without further recourse. Without regard to
whether protested or not, all bills are due and payable as received. All timely
protests will be reviewed by the city. If the protest is determined to be
valid, the excess amount paid will be credited against future billings.
   (G)   Utility services are billed monthly. If a customer does not pay
delinquent balances within 60 days of the past-due date, service will be
discontinued and additional charges incurred.

§ 50.09 TEMPORARY TURN-OFF OF SERVICES.
   If a customer desires a temporary turn-off of utility services for a period
of one month or more, he may make request to do so. Once turned off, a request
for resumption of services prior to one month later will be honored only if
accompanied by written documentation of the changes in circumstances that have
occurred subsequent to the request for turn-off. The turn-off of services will
not relieve the customer of payment of all minimum monthly charges during the
turn-off period. The turn-off serves only to assist the customer in attempting
to avoid damage or unintended consumption due to leaks or unauthorized uses
during his absence. The first billing subsequent to the turn- off shall include
a fee to reimburse the city for costs incurred. A similar fee shall be paid
when service is turned back on.

§ 50.10 CITY COMMISSION APPROVAL FOR CONNECTION TO A CITY UTILITY.
   (A)   Within City Limits. All new and existing developments located within
the city limits, either as established at the time of adoption of this chapter
or as amended in the future, shall be required to connect to the city’s utility
systems when they are available. Such connections shall be made without any
action by the City Commission, except as follows:
      (1)   If a developer’s agreement is required, then the developer’s
agreement shall be accepted by resolution of the City Commission, prior to
execution of the connection contract between the developer and the city.
      (2)   The city utility systems are designed and constructed primarily for
use by residential and commercial customers. No industrial customer shall
connect to a city utility system unless the connection is specifically
authorized in advance by the City Commission.
      (3)   The City Commission has determined that as of the adoption of this
chapter, no existing or presently proposed user of the city’s sewer system is
an “EPA Industrial User,” as defined herein. Further, it has been determined
that existing zoning regulations make it highly unlikely that a prospective
user shall be an EPA Industrial User. However, it shall be the policy of the
city that an EPA Industrial User shall not be permitted to connect to the
city’s sewer system unless, and until, the city shall have amended this Code so
as to incorporate an EPA approvable “Industrial Cost Recovery System,” as
defined in Federal Regulations 40 CFR 35.
   (B)   Outside City Limits. The City of Pembroke Pines has not established a
service area outside of its municipal boundaries. With one exception, property
located outside the city limits shall not be allowed to connect to a city
utility system unless the connection is authorized by the City Commission. The
one exception is that Commission approval shall not be required for any
connection in that area covered by the developer’s agreements identified in
Exhibit “H”, Agreement for Sale and Purchase, September 27, 1962, between the
city and the West Hollywood Water Company and the West Hollywood Utility
Company. The city shall not provide water or sewer service to property outside
of its boundaries when the City Commission has determined that the proposed
uses on such property are contrary to the best interests of the city or adverse
to the health, safety, and welfare of the city's residents. (Ord. 641, passed

§ 50.11 PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON SECURITY DEPOSIT; RETURN OF SECURITY DEPOSIT.
   Customers with utility accounts for which the city is holding a security
deposit as specified in the City Code shall earn interest as set forth herein.
The city shall pay interest on such deposits based on the average rate of
return earned for the 12 months ended August 31, less an amount equal to an
administrative fee of 30 basis points. Interest will be prorated for the
portion of the year that the deposit was held. The interest earned shall be
shown on the customer’s account statement for the month of October of each
fiscal year. Unless the customer specifically requests a refund of the interest
earned, it shall be credited to his next due statement.

the city water system, for any use including the use of potable water for
irrigation, or introduce any liquid or solid substance into the city sewer
system, or make a connection to any utility system shall make restitution to
the city for any costs incurred by the city resulting from the unauthorized
use. In addition, the unauthorized use shall be punishable by a fine in
accordance with §
50.08(B) and/or as provided by §
10.99 of the City Code or by other lawful method provided in the City Code,
including but not limited to Code Enforcement penalties authorized by law.

   If the capacity of an existing service lateral or an existing service
connection is inadequate to provide the quantity of service needed by a
customer, the modification will be performed by the city, and the property
owner shall reimburse the city for all costs actually incurred by the city. At
the same time, all security deposits and schedules of charges for the customer
shall be adjusted to correspond to the changed capacities.

   (B)   The water and sewer service charges and basic minimum charges for
subsequent years will be increased administratively using the change in the
Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers in the United States - Water and
Sewerage Maintenance Series as published by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics
for the 12 months ending April of each year. These adjustments will be
effective on the following October 1 and will be pro-rated as required by the
applicable account billing cycle.
   (C)   In addition to the above, monthly billings shall include any of the
following charges which are applicable:
      (1)   Water rate surcharge.  In order to encourage water conservation
during periods of mandated water restrictions by the South Florida Water
Management District (SFWMD), the following surcharge shall automatically be
instituted as an adjustment to the monthly water service charge:
         (a)   During a Phase I Restriction issued by SFWMD, a 25% surcharge
will be added to the water service charge. During a Phase II Restriction issued
by SFWMD, a 50% surcharge will be added to the water service charge.
         (b)   The surcharge will be based on a user’s average monthly
consumption. The user’s monthly consumption shall be based upon the user’s
water consumption during the 12 months prior to the South Florida Water
Management District’s declaration of either Phase I or Phase II Water Use
Restrictions. For residential users, the surcharge shall apply to consumption
which exceeds 70% of the user’s average monthly consumption. For commercial
users, the surcharge shall apply to consumption which exceeds 90% of the user’s
average monthly consumption. In no instances shall the surcharge be applied to
the water service of any user who consumes 5,000 gallons or less during any
billing period.
      (2)   Delinquent turn-on/turn-off recovery charges.  When the city incurs
time and expense to secure collection of a delinquent utility account, there
shall be assessed a turn-off and turn-on recovery charge in accordance with §
50.08(B). This fee shall not preclude the assessment to disconnect or re-
connect-charges, as delineated in division (3) below.
      (3)   Disconnect or reconnect recovery charges. When the city makes a
disconnect or reconnect, irrespective of cause, there may be assessed a cost
recovery charge in accordance with §
50.08(B).
      (4)   Meter testing charge.  If a customer believes that his or her meter
is producing erroneous results, this should be reported to the Utility
Department. If an in-place inspection reveals that the meter is malfunctioning,
the meter will be replaced. Otherwise, no action shall be taken unless the
customer requests that the meter be removed and tested. If this is done, and
the test indicates that the meter is operating within the accuracies published
by the meter manufacturer, then the customer shall pay a meter testing charge
equal to the actual costs incurred by the city in conducting the test.
Otherwise, there shall be no charge for the test.
      (5)   Meter replacement.  If a meter has to be replaced due to damage for
which the customer is responsible, charges for replacement shall be in
accordance with § 50.08(B), Water meter charge.

connections, backflow by backpressure and backsiphonage by isolating within the
premises or private property contamination or pollution that has occurred or
may occur because of same undiscovered or unauthorized cross-connection on the
premises or private property.
      (2)   To protect the water supply system within the premise or private
property against actual or potential cross-connections, backflow by
backpressure and backsiphonage by requiring such air gaps, vacuum breakers,
backflow preventers, special devices as required by this Program, or other
applicable regulations.
      (3)   To eliminate cross-connections, backflow by backpressure and
backsiphonage on any other source of water or process water used for any
purpose whatsoever which may jeopardize the safety of the water supply or which
may endanger the health and welfare of the general public.

program that includes provisions for inspection and maintenance to ensure
compliance.
   (B)   Responsibilities.
      (1)   Director of Utilities. The Director of the Utilities System, or
their designee, shall be responsible for the protection of the public potable
water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to backflow of
contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. If, in the
judgment of said Director, or their designee, an approved backflow prevention
assembly is required, at the city's water service connection to any customer's
premises, for the safety of the water system, the Director, or his designated
agent, shall give notice in writing to said customer to install such an
approved backflow prevention assembly at each service connection to his
premises. The customer shall immediately install such approved device, or
devices, or assemblies at his own expense; and, failure, refusal, or inability
on the part of the customer to install said device, or assemblies, immediately
shall constitute a ground for discontinuing water service to the premises until
such device, or assemblies, have been properly installed. Cross-connection
control devices or assemblies shall comply with Florida Administrative Code
(FAC) 62-555.360. The Director, at the Director's discretion, may assume the
maintenance requirements for backflow prevention assemblies and backflow
prevention program and pass along the cost to the customer.
Enforcement of this Program shall be administered by the Director, or his
designee.
      (2)   Water Purveyor (City of Pembroke Pines). Except as otherwise
provided herein, the water purveyor's (City of Pembroke Pines) responsibility
to ensure a safe water supply begins at the source and includes all of the
public water distribution system, including the service connection, and ends at
the point of delivery to the consumer's water system(s).
      (3)   Consumer. The consumer has the primary responsibility of preventing
pollutants and contaminants from entering the consumer's potable water systems
or the public potable water system. It is the responsibility of the consumer
and/or his designee to determine the size of the backflow prevention assembly.
The consumer's responsibility starts at the point of delivery from the public
potable water system and includes all of the property's water system(s).
The consumer, at their own expense, shall install, operate, test, and maintain
approved backflow prevention assemblies as set forth in this manual, unless
otherwise stated in this manual. Prior to installation, replacement or
relocation of a backflow prevention assembly, the consumer must apply for all
necessary permits through the Building Department. The Building Department must
be notified and provided copies of required testing reports upon completion of
the installation of a backflow prevention device. Subsequent tests shall be
maintained and performed at the customer's expense by a plumbing contractor
licensed in the State of Florida. The consumer shall maintain accurate records
of tests and repairs made by the consumer to backflow prevention assemblies and
shall maintain such records for a minimum period of five years. The records
shall be on a test form approved by the city and shall include the list of
materials or replacement parts used. Following any repairs, overhaul, re-piping
or relocation of an assembly the consumer shall have it tested to insure that
it is in good operating condition and will prevent backflow. Tests, maintenance
and repairs of backflow prevention assemblies shall be made by a Certified
Plumbing Contractor that is a Certified Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester or
a certified Backflow Prevention Assembly Repair and Maintenance Technician,
whichever is applicable.
      (4)   Building Department. The Building Department of the City of
Pembroke Pines has the responsibility to not only review building plans and
inspect plumbing as it is installed; but they have the explicit responsibility
of preventing cross connections from being designed and built into the plumbing
system within their jurisdiction. Where the review of building plans suggests
or detects the potential for cross connections being made as an integral part
of the plumbing system, the plumbing inspector has the responsibility, under
the Florida Building Code, for requiring that such cross connections be either
eliminated or provided with backflow prevention equipment approved by the
Florida Building Code.
The plumbing inspector's responsibility, with respect to backflow prevention,
begins at the point of delivery and continues throughout the entire length of
the consumer's water system. The plans inspector should inquire about the
intended use of water at any point where it is suspected that a cross
connection might be made or where one is actually called for by the plans. When
such is discovered, it shall be mandatory that a suitable, approved backflow
prevention assembly/device be required by the plans and be properly installed.

his designee, as meeting an applicable specification stated or cited in this
Program, or as suitable for the proposed use.
      AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY. Any water supply on or available to the premises
other than the purveyor's approved public potable water supply. These auxiliary
waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or
any natural source(s) such as well, spring, lake, pond, canal, river, stream,
etc., or "used waters" or "industrial fluids". These waters may be polluted or
contaminated or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water
source over which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control.
      BACKFLOW. The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances
under pressure into the  distributing pipes of a potable water supply system
from any source or sources other than its intended source.
      BACKFLOW PREVENTER. A device, assembly or means designed to prevent
backflow. These devices or assemblies are described below:
         (a)   AIR-GAP. A physical separation between the free-flowing
discharge end of a potable water supply pipeline and an open or non-pressure
receiving vessel. An "approved air gap separation" shall be at least double the
diameter of the supply pipe measured vertically above the top of the rim of the
vessel. In no case shall it be less than one inch. When an air-gap is used at
the service connection to prevent the contamination or pollution of the public

valves, together with an automatically operating pressure differential relief
valve located between the two check valves. The first check valve reduces the
supply pressure a predetermined amount so that during normal flow and at
cessation of normal flow the pressure between the checks shall be less than the
supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the differential
relief valve, by discharging to the atmosphere, shall operate to maintain the
pressure between the checks less than the supply pressure. The unit shall
include tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the device, and
each device shall be fitted with properly located test cocks. The entire
assembly shall meet the design and performance specifications and approval of a
recognized and city-approved testing agency for backflow prevention assemblies.
To be approved, these assemblies must be readily accessible for in-line
maintenance and testing and be installed in a location where no part of the
assembly will be submerged.
         (h)    REDUCED-PRESSURE DETECTOR ASSEMBLY (RPDA). A RPDA shall consist
of a main-line RP with a bypass (detector) arrangement around the main-line RP
that shall contain a bypass water meter and a bypass RP. The  RPDA shall be

through the spread of disease.
      CROSS-CONNECTION. Any physical connection or arrangement of piping or
fixtures between two otherwise separate piping systems one of which contains
potable water and the other non-potable water or industrial fluids of
questionable safety, through which, or because of which, backflow by
backpressure or backsiphonage may occur into the potable water system. A water
service connection between a public potable water distribution system and a
customer's water distribution system which is cross-connection to a
contaminated fixture, industrial fluid system or with a potentially
contaminated supply or auxiliary water system, constitutes one type of cross-
connection. Other types of cross-connections include connectors such as swing

safe for human consumption.
      WATER PURVEYOR. The term water purveyor shall mean the owner or operator
of the public potable water system supplying an approved water supply to the
public. As used herein, the terms water purveyor and City of Pembroke Pines may
be used synonymously.
      WATER SERVICE CONNECTIONS. The terminal end of a service connection from
the public potable water system, i.e., where the water purveyor loses
jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to
the customer's water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service
connection, then the service connection shall mean the downstream end of the
meter. There should be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of
any meter or backflow prevention assembly located at the point of delivery to
the customer's water system. Service connection shall also include water
service connection from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency
water service connections from the public water system.
      WATER–USED. Any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public potable
water system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point
of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary control of the water purveyor.
   (D)   Policy.
      (1)   All new water service connections shall cause the service line to
be fitted by the customer with the following minimum backflow prevention
devices or those prescribed by FAC Table 62-555.360-2, whichever is more
stringent:
         (a)   Residential Service Connection - DuC Minimum (owned and
installed by city personnel when setting the meter) (refurbished or replaced

      (3)   Whenever the customer's premises is altered under a building permit
in a manner that could change the backflow protection required, a backflow
prevention device shall be installed by the customer.
      (4)   No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or
maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as
required by Chapter 62-555.360 of the Florida Administrative Code (FAC) and
this Program. Service of water to any premises may be discontinued by the water
purveyor if a backflow prevention assembly required by this Program is not
installed, tested and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow prevention
device or any water assembly has been removed, by-passed, or if an unprotected
cross-connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until
such conditions or defects are corrected.
      (5)   The customer's system shall be open for inspection at all
reasonable times to authorized representatives of the City of Pembroke Pines to
determine whether cross-connections or other structural or sanitary hazards,
including violations of these regulations, exist. Water service may be
discontinued after reasonable notice to the consumer if a violation of this
Program exists on the premises, and such other precautionary measures may be
taken as are deemed necessary to eliminate any danger to the potable water.
Water service shall not be restored until the danger had been eliminated in
compliance with the provisions of this Program. If inspection access is not
granted, the connection shall be fitted with an RP assembly by the customer.
      (6)   An approved backflow-prevention assembly shall be installed by the
customer on each service line to a customer's water system at or near the
property line or immediately inside the building being served; but in all
cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the
following conditions exist:
         (a)   In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which
is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is
not acceptable as an additional source by the Director, or his designee, the
public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by
installing a backflow prevention assembly or device in the service line
appropriate to the degree of hazard.
         (b)   In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any
other objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an
actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall
be protected against backflow from the premises by installing a backflow
prevention assembly in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard.
This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from
the utility system which have been subject to deterioration in quality.
         (c)   In the case of premises having (1) internal cross-connections
that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or (2) intricate plumbing
and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not
readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or
impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the
public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by
installing a backflow prevention device assembly in the service line.
      (7)   The type of protection assemblies in division (C)(8) of this
section shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists as follows:
         (a)   In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water
supply as stated in division (C)(2) of this section and it is not subject to
any of the following rules, the public water system shall be protected by an
approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention assembly.
         (b)   In the case of any premises where there is water or substance
that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the
public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved
dual or double check valve assembly as determined by the Director.
         (c)   In the case of any premises where there is any material
dangerous to health which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual
or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall
be protected by an approved air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention assembly. Example of premises where these
conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping station,
chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and plating plants.
         (d)   In the case of any problems where there are "un-controlled"
cross-connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be
protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention assembly at the service connection.
         (e)   In case of any premises where, because of security requirements
or other prohibitions or restrictions it is impossible or impractical to make a
complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the public water system shall be
protected against backflow by backpressure or backsiphonage from the premises
device in the service line. In this case, maximum protection will be required;
that is, an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention assembly shall be installed in each service to
the premises.
      (8)   The minimum backflow protection to be provided and the different
categories of facilities that require backflow preventers, as required by the
city, are listed in Table 62-555.360-2 of the Florida Administrative Code, as
may be amended from time to time.
      (9)   Any backflow prevention assembly required herein shall be of a
model and size approved by the Director of Utilities or his or her designee.
The term “Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly" shall mean a device that has
been manufactured in full conformance with the standards established by the
American Water Works Association entitled: 1.) AWWA C510-97 - Double Check
Valve Backflow Prevention Assembly and 2.) AWWA C511-97 Reduced Pressure
Principle and Double Check Valve Backflow Prevention Assembly, as may be
amended from time to time, as well as the standards set forth by the Foundation
for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research of the University of
Southern California for all devices, as may be amended from time to time.
      (10)   All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies which do
not meet the requirements of this section but were approved assemblies for the
purposes described herein at the time of installation and which have been
properly maintained and tested yearly, may be excluded from the requirements of
these rules so long as the Director of Utilities is assured that they will
satisfactorily protect the utility system. Whenever the existing assembly is
moved from the present location or requires more than minimum maintenance or
when the Director, or his designee, finds that the maintenance constitutes a
hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by a backflow prevention assembly
meeting the requirements of this section.
      (11)   The Public Services Department shall evaluate the customer's
premises at an existing, i.e., previously constructed, service connection
whenever the customer connects to a reclaimed water distribution system,
whenever an auxiliary water system is discovered on the customer's premises,
whenever a prohibited or inappropriately protected cross-connection is
discovered on the customer's premises, or whenever the customer's premises is
altered in a manner that could change the backflow protection required at or
for a service connection to the customer.
         (a)   The owner/consumer or authorized representative shall accompany
the utilities representative during the inspection of the premise(s).
         (b)   A letter of notification shall be sent to the owner/consumer or
authorized representative indicating what corrective measures must be taken,
type of device or assembly that needs to be installed and time limit for the
installation to be completed.
         (c)   A questionnaire may be used to evaluate customers' premises.
Also, reviews of construction plans or pertinent records, on-site inspections,
or any combination thereof may be used for evaluations.
      (12)   A consumer must immediately notify the Public Services Department
if the consumer's potable water system is or has potentially been contaminated
or if there is a reason to believe that backflow has occurred from the
consumer's private water system to the public potable water system.
      (13)   No water will be supplied to any newly constructed service
connection with a backflow preventer that requires testing before the Public
Services Department receives a satisfactory test report.
   (E)   Testing and repair.
      (1)   It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premises where
backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have certified inspections and
operational tests made at the required intervals. However, the Utilities
Director may provide testing and repair services to relieve the burden of the
consumer's responsibility and charge back to the consumer all fees associated
with the testing and repair of backflow prevention assemblies. In those
instances where the Director of Utilities, or his designee, deems the hazard to
be great enough, he may require testing and inspections at more frequent
intervals. These inspections and tests shall be performed by a certified
individual approved by the Director of Utilities, or his designee. It shall be
the duty of the Director, or his designee, to see that these timely tests are
made. The customer-user shall notify the Director, or his designee, in advance
when the tests are to be undertaken by the customer user so that the Director
or the Director’s designee may witness the tests if it is so desired. These
assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the expense of the
customer-user whenever said assemblies are found to be defective. Records of
such tests, repairs, and overhaul conducted by the consumer shall be kept by
the consumer for five years and copies of such tests, repairs, and overhaul
shall be sent to the Public Service Department Environmental Services Division
within ten business days after the completion of any testing and/or repair
work. This testing is not required on city installed dual check devices on
single family residential service connections.
      (2)   Any time that repairs to backflow prevention assemblies are deemed
necessary, whether through annual or required testing or routine inspection by
the owner or by the Department of Public Utilities, these repairs must be
completed within a specified time in accordance with the degree of hazard. In
no case shall this time period exceed: 15 days for Hazard– Health and 30 days
for Hazard–Plumbing/Pollution degrees of hazard.
      (3)   Nothing herein shall relieve the consumer of the responsibility for
conducting, or causing to be conducted, periodic surveys of water use practices
on his premises to determine where there are actual or potential cross-
connections in the consumer's water system through which contaminants or
pollutants could flow back into a public water system or potable consumer's
water system.
      (4)   It shall be unlawful for any customer or certified tester/repairer
to submit any record to the Public Services Department that is false or
incomplete in any material respect. It shall be unlawful for any customer or
certified tester to fail to submit to the Public Services Department any record
which is required by this Program. Such violations may result in any of the
enforcement actions outlined in “Penalty for Non-compliance” section (division
(G) of this section).
      (5)   A courtesy notice will be sent to the owner/consumer of record
prior to the testing or replacement due date as an advance notice of backflow
testing requirements. Lack of notice by the city does not relieve the owner/
consumer of the testing requirement. A subsequent notice will be sent if the
consumer fails to test the assembly by the required test due date. In the event
that the assembly is not tested or replaced after the second notice a final
notice will be sent and will require compliance within 30 days. Failure to
comply with the final notice shall be a violation of this Program and deemed to

*Rates not shown shall be as determined by the City Utilities Division on a
case-by-case basis, based upon factors that include comparable uses in other
jurisdictions, industry standards and other reliable sources of information.
Adjustments.
   (A)   Pool Credit - In accordance with §
50.55(B), water required to fill a completely drained swimming pool shall not
be discharged into the city sewer system. Therefore, water used in filling a
completely drained swimming pool shall not be included as the basis for a
monthly sewer service charge. The city shall calculate the volume of water used
for filling the pool. The sewer service charge for that month shall be based
upon the volume of the pool minus the average of the previous six-month water
consumption.
   (B)   Partial Sewer Credit - Metered water which is leaked to the ground may
be eligible for a sewer credit. The customer shall supply a copy of a plumbers
repair bill within 60 days of the discovery of the leak. The city may issue a
credit based on the difference between the previous six-month water consumption
and the consumption during the month of the leak.
   (C)   In addition to the above, monthly billings shall include any of the
following charges which are applicable.
      (1)   Penalty Charges. See §
50.08.
      (2)   Excess Pollutants Surcharge. An excess pollutants surcharge shall
be added to a residential or commercial customer’s monthly service charge if
that customer’s sewage contains either more than 300 ppm of BOD or more than
300 ppm of SS. A surcharge will be added in any month during which any analysis
of the user’s sewage, either scheduled or unscheduled, indicates a
concentration of greater than 300 ppm for either pollutant. Once established, a
surcharge will be added for each succeeding month, and shall continue until
analysis of samples of the user’s sewage taken in each of three consecutive
months indicate average concentrations of less than 300 ppm for each pollutant.
(See Note, following.)
The surcharge shall be computed for each month by the following formulas:
XPS =      (MTG) x (XPR) x (XBD + XSS)
XPS =      Excess Pollutants Surcharge
MTG =   User’s Metered Thousand Gallons for the month = Same as for base
monthly service charge
XPR =      Excess Pollutants Rate = (Total O & M costs of city sewer system for
preceding fiscal year) divided by (Total Thousands of Gallons of sewage billed
to customers by the city during the preceding fiscal year) divided by (300 ppm,
maximum concentration in sanitary sewage).
XBD =      Excess BOD Concentration = (ppm of BOD in Customer’s Sewage) minus
300. See Note, below.
XSS =      Excess SS Concentration = (ppm of SS in Customer’s Sewage) minus
300. See Note, below.
NOTE:   For the first month that an XPS is added, the ppm of pollutants used in
computing XBD and XSS shall be the largest concentration determined in any
analysis conducted during that month. The same values shall be continued in
succeeding months, unless any subsequent analysis is higher, or analyses taken
in each of three consecutive months indicate an average concentration that is
more than 5% below the current value. Nothing in these provisions shall be
construed as a requirement that analyses must be conducted monthly. A three-
month series of analyses shall be initiated only if specifically desired by
either the city or the customer.

sewers, with no particle having any one dimension greater than one-half inch.
   (H)   Any wastes containing at any one time more than 100 ppm of any grease,
oil, or oily substance; or a daily average concentration of said substances at
over 25 ppm.
   (I)   Any waters or wastes containing any toxic or poisonous or corrosive
substance in sufficient quantities as either to constitute a hazard to humans
or animals, either during transportation or treatment of the sewage or in the
receiving waters of the sewage treatment plant discharge, or to interfere with
proper operation and maintenance of the sewage transportation and treatment
facilities. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, prohibiting any
of the following substances in concentrations greater than the maximums shown:

§ 50.57 PERMITS REQUIRED FOR SOME COMMERCIAL SEWER CUSTOMERS AND ALL INDUSTRIAL
SEWER CUSTOMERS.
   The city sewer system is designed and constructed primarily for collection
and transmission of sanitary sewage. Therefore, it is the policy of the city
that any customer engaged in any business that generates liquid wastes which
can be expected to have, prior to any pretreatment, one or more characteristics
exceeding the limits listed in the §
50.01 definition of sanitary sewage shall:
   (A)   Include pretreatment process and/or facilities into the design and
operation of his business. Unless issued a specific permit to do otherwise, the
pretreatment shall ensure that sewage discharged into the city sewer system
meets or exceeds the criteria defined in this section for sanitary sewage.
   (B)   At the time of application for connection to the sewer system, also
apply for a permit to operate the pretreatment processes. The application shall
include a description of the waste characteristics prior to pretreatment, a
description of the proposed pretreatment to be applied, and a description of
the sewage characteristics proposed for discharge into the sewer system. The
permit will be issued only if:
      (1)   The discharge will meet or exceed the criteria for sanitary sewage.
      (2)   Or, meeting those criteria is not economically feasible, the
proposed characteristics are as close to sanitary sewage as is economically
feasible, and the proposed characteristics will not produce an unacceptable
potential hazard to public health and safety, or potential adverse impact upon
the sewer system or treatment processes.
   (C)   Upon receipt of the permit, pay a permit fee in accordance with §
50.08(B).
   (D)   The permit shall stipulate the specific conditions which the operation
shall satisfy, and the period for which the permit shall be effective. In
general, if the permit allows discharges exceeding the sanitary sewage
criteria, then the permit shall stipulate a one year period of effectiveness,
and require that the property owner construct and maintain facilities suitable
for monitoring and metering the sewage prior to discharge into the sewer
system. Prior to the end of the effective period, the property owner shall
apply for a new permit. That application shall include analyses of actual
characteristics of the wastes before and after pretreatment, performed within
ten days of the date of application. Each new permit shall require payment of a
new permit fee in accordance with §
50.08(B).
   (E)   If the permit is for discharges meeting the sanitary sewage criteria,
then no special monitoring facilities shall be required. However, the owner
shall submit annual analyses of his sewage before and after pretreatment, and
the city shall randomly require submittal of unscheduled analyses. The permit
shall have an indefinite effective period. However, it shall be canceled at any
time that the owner fails to take timely action to correct any violations of
the terms of the permit.
   (F)   If, at any time in the future, the City Commission authorizes
connection to the city’s sewer system by an “EPA Contributing Industry”, as
defined herein, then a permit issued to that customer shall require compliance
with “Pretreatment Standards for Incompatible Pollutants” as described in
Federal Regulations 40 CFR 128.133, and any other regulations as shall be
established from time to time by appropriate governmental regulating agencies.

§ 50.58 CONTROL OF INFILTRATION AND INFLOW INTO SEWER SYSTEM.
   The intentional introduction into the sewer system of groundwater
infiltration or surface inflow of storm waters shall not be allowed. However,
it is realized that it cannot be totally prevented. Plumbing to connect to the
city sewer system shall be designed, constructed and maintained in such a
manner as to minimize such occurrences. If analysis by the city indicates that
excessive infiltration or inflow is entering the system through privately owned
plumbing, the customer shall be requested to repair or modify his plumbing so
as to reduce the infiltration/inflow to acceptable limits. Failure to comply
shall result in a surcharge being added to the customer’s monthly service
charge. The surcharge shall be equal to the then existing rate per thousand
gallons times the city’s estimate of thousands of gallons of infiltration/
inflow entering the system through the customer’s plumbing.
(Ord. 641, passed 12-15-82; Am. Ord. 1978, passed 11-17-21)
§ 50.59 CLOSE OUT OF SEPTIC TANKS.
   Whenever a property being served by a septic tank is connected to the city
sewer system, the septic tank shall be abandoned in accordance with the laws of
the State of Florida including, but not limited to, completely emptied, pumped
out and disposed of by a contractor licensed for such disposal. In particular,
the contents shall not be drained into the adjoining ground, nor discharged
into the sewer system. After the tank has been emptied, a hole shall be punched
in the bottom of the tank, and the tank shall be filled with sand.

§ 52.22 PURPOSE OF SWALES.
   The swale area is intended to be utilized for draining surface waters from
adjacent roadways and private property by percolation of the water through the
soil. The swales lying within the city’s boundaries, when properly constructed
and maintained, effectively control the drainage of surface waters where there
is an absence of other methods of drainage. The interference with the
prescribed contours, the planting of trees or plants, and the use of materials
which hinder the percolation of water through the swales seriously affect the
drainage function of the swale areas, are a traffic hazard and health hazard,
and cause damage to the road adjacent to the swales.

Department. The person or firm seeking such a permit shall first submit plans
and specifications to the Building and Zoning Department and shall comply with
the conditions prescribed by the Department.

§ 70.02 CITATION APPEAL PROCESS; FAILURE TO PAY PARKING VIOLATION CITATION.
   (A)   It shall be a separate violation of this section to fail to pay any
citation issued for the violation of an ordinance contained in this title
relating to the parking of vehicles within the city.
   (B)   (1)   Any person who receives a parking citation issued pursuant to
any city parking ordinance may contest such citation by giving written request
for an administrative hearing to the Clerk of Courts within ten days of the
date the citation was issued. All citations not paid within ten days of the
date the citation was issued or a request for an administrative hearing filed
with the Clerk of Courts within said ten days shall result in a $12 late fee
being charged and collected by the Clerk of the Court. The Clerk shall set the
hearing within 30 days of the date the citation was issued, giving the person
issued the citation at least seven days notice excluding Saturdays, Sundays,
and legal holidays.
      (2)   Said notice shall be sent to the address of the registered owner of
the vehicle as per issued citation or, in the event that the driver of the
vehicle is not the owner, to the driver’s address if he or she requests a
hearing.
   (C)   (1)   The person issued the citation may:
         (a)   Be represented by counsel;
         (b)   Call and examine witnesses;
         (c)   Introduce exhibits;
         (d)   Examine opposing witnesses on any relevant matter, even though
the matter was not covered under direct examination;
         (e)   Impeach any witness, regardless of which party first called him
or her to testify.
      (2)   All hearings shall be conducted insofar as practical in accordance
with the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure and the Florida Evidence Code.
However, the general nature of the hearing shall be conducted in an informal
manner.
      (3)   All irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence shall be
excluded; but all other evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonable
prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs shall be admissible whether or
not such evidence would be admissible in a trial in the courts of Florida. Any
part of the evidence may be received in written form and all testimony of
parties and witnesses shall be made under oath. Hearsay evidence may be used
for the purpose of supplementing or explaining other evidence but it shall not
be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over
objection in civil actions.
      (4)   Any interested party or person may make application and upon good
cause shown may be allowed by the hearing officer in his or her discretion to
intervene and appear in a proceeding pending before the hearing officer.
   (D)   (1)   Those persons who receive a parking citation but who reside in
Palm Beach, Broward, or Dade County may contest the citation in writing, thus
avoiding the necessity of appearing for a hearing.
      (2)   Such person must submit his or her written request to contest the
citation by mail, along with all evidence within ten days of the date the
citation was issued.
      (3)   The written request to contest the citation by mail and evidence
must be sent to the Clerk of Courts. The Clerk shall present the evidence to
the hearing officer within 30 days of the date the citation was issued.
      (4)   The evidence presented must include a sworn statement by the person
cited. The statement must identify the citation at issue by its number and date
of issuance. It must set forth the name and current address of the person
cited. The statement may contain argument in defense against the citation. The
hearing officer will not consider unsworn statements.
      (5)   The evidence submitted may include sworn statements of witnesses.
Such statements must include the name and address of the witness as well as the
basis of the witness's knowledge about the facts asserted in the statement. The
evidence submitted may also include such documents as are relevant and material
to the disposition of the citation. All evidence submitted is subject to the
evidentiary rules set forth above.
   (E)   (1)   Pursuant to F.S. § 316.1967, any person who elects to appear
before the hearing officer or to contest a citation by mail shall be deemed to
have waived his or her right to pay the civil penalty amount set forth on the
citation.
      (2)   After a hearing or consideration of mailed-in admissible evidence,
the hearing officer shall make a determination based on the greater weight of
the evidence as to whether a parking violation has been committed and shall
issue an order imposing a civil penalty not to exceed $250 for violations of
disabled parking ordinances and $100 for violations of all other county parking
ordinances. The hearing officer may, in his or her discretion, grant additional
time to pay the civil penalty amount. All orders shall be in writing, signed
and dated by the hearing officer, and shall contain findings of fact supporting
the order and conclusions of law.
      (3)   If, at the conclusion of a hearing or consideration of mailed-in
admissible evidence, the hearing officer orders a dismissal of the citation and
finds no violation, the hearing officer shall so state and issue his or her
order of dismissal in writing, signed and dated by the hearing officer and
containing findings of fact supporting the order. Hearings shall be scheduled
within 30 days of request and decided within 30 days thereafter. An order,
decision or opinion of the hearing officer may be appealed by the filing of a
petition for Writ of Certiorari in the Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial
Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida, by any party receiving an adverse
ruling.

§ 70.17 RECOVERY OF COSTS AND EXPENSES.
   If any person shall operate a motor vehicle or have actual physical control
of the motor vehicle within the city while under the influence of alcoholic
beverages or controlled substances or a combination of alcoholic beverages and
controlled substances, to the extent that his or her normal faculties are
impaired or to the extent that he or she is deprived of full possession of his
or her normal faculties, and if such person shall proximately cause an accident
or is a substantial causative factor of an accident resulting in the need for
the city to provide emergency medical, fire or police responses or services,
such person shall be liable to the city for all costs and expenses of such
emergency responses and services.
(Ord. 890, passed 5-3-89)
§ 70.18 STANDARD OF IMPAIRMENT; TESTING METHODS.
   (A)   In any trial of any civil action or proceeding with respect to the
enforcement hereof alleging that any person is liable hereunder because such
person was the cause of or was a substantial causative factor of an accident
requiring emergency medical, fire or police responses while such person
was driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the
influence of alcoholic beverages or controlled substances, or a combination of
alcoholic beverages and controlled substances, to the extent that his or her
normal faculties were impaired, or to the extent that he or she was deprived of
full possession of his or her normal faculties the results of any test
administered in accordance with F.S. § 316.1932 or 316.1933 or 316.1934, shall
be admissible into evidence when otherwise admissible, and the amount of
alcohol or controlled substance in the person's blood at the time alleged, as
shown by chemical analysis of the person's blood or breath or urine, shall give
rise to the following presumptions:
      (1)   If there was, at the time, 0.05% or less by weight of alcohol in
the person's blood, and if there was no evidence of a controlled substance in
such person's blood, it shall be presumed that the person was not under the
influence of alcoholic beverages or controlled substances or any combination
thereof, to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired.
      (2)   If there was, at the time, in excess of 0.05% but less than 0.10%
by weight or alcohol in the person's blood such facts shall not give rise to
any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of alcoholic
beverages or controlled substances or a combination thereof, to the extent that
his or her normal faculties were impaired, but such fact may be considered with
other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the
influence of alcoholic beverages or controlled substances or any combination
thereof to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired.
      (3)   If there was, at the time, 0.10% or more by weight of alcohol in
the person's blood, even if there was no evidence of a controlled substance in
such person's blood, that fact shall be prima facie evidence that the person
was under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her
normal faculties were impaired.
      (4)   If there was, at the time, in excess of 0.05% by weight of alcohol
in the person's blood and if there was evidence of a controlled substance in
the person's blood, those facts shall be prima facie evidence that the person
was under the influence of a combination of alcoholic beverages and controlled
substances, to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired.
   (B)   The percent by either of alcohol in the blood shall be based upon
grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood.
   (C)   The foregoing provisions of this section shall not be construed as
limiting the introduction of other competent evidence bearing upon the question
of whether the person was under the influence of alcoholic beverages or
controlled substances, or a combination of alcoholic beverages and controlled
substances, to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired or to
the extent that he or she was deprived of full possession of his or her normal
faculties, or that such impairment was the proximate cause or substantially
causative of the accident giving rise to the need for emergency medical, police
or fire services.
   (D)   A chemical analysis of a person's blood to determine alcoholic content
or a chemical analysis of a person's breath, or a chemical analysis of a
person's urine, in order to be considered valid under the provisions of this
section, must have been performed substantially in accordance with the method
approved by the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services of the State
of Florida and by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the
Department for this purpose. Any insubstantial differences between approved
techniques and actual testing procedures in any individual case shall not
render the test or test results invalid. Any technique or method approved by
the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services of the State of Florida
with respect to such analysis shall be deemed acceptable. Any person who shall
be deemed qualified and competent to conduct such analysis by the Department of
Health and Rehabilitative Services of the state of Florida, as indicated by the
possession of a valid permit therefor shall be deemed competent to conduct such
analysis.
(Ord. 890, passed 5-3-89)
§ 70.19 PRESUMPTION WITH RESPECT TO CAUSAL CONNECTION.
   In any trial of any civil action or proceeding with respect to the
enforcement hereof alleging that any person is liable hereunder because such
person was the cause of or was a substantial causative factor of an accident
requiring emergency medical, fire or police responses while such person was
driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of
alcoholic beverages or controlled substances, to the extent that his or her
normal faculties were impaired, or to the extent that he or she was deprived of
full possession of his or her normal faculties, it shall be presumed that a
person under the influence of alcoholic beverages and/or controlled substances
to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired, or to the extent
that he or she was deprived of full possession of his or her normal faculties
was the proximate cause or was a substantial causative factor of the accident
giving rise to the need for emergency medical, police and fire services.
(Ord. 890, passed 5-3-89)
§ 70.20 ADDITIONAL PRESUMPTION OF IMPAIRMENT.
   In any trial of any civil action or proceeding with respect to the
enforcement hereof alleging that any person is liable hereunder because such
person was the cause of or was a substantial causative factor of an accident
requiring emergency medical, fire or police responses while such person was
driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of
alcoholic beverages or controlled substances, or a combination of alcoholic
beverages and controlled substances, to the extent that his or her normal
faculties were impaired, or to the extent that he or she was deprived of full
possession of his or her normal faculties, it shall be presumed that such
person's normal faculties were impaired or that such person was deprived of
full possession of his or her normal faculties, if such person shall plead
nolle contendere or guilty to or shall have been found guilty in trial of a
violation of F.S. § 316.193 or 316.1934, or if such person refuses an officer's
request to submit to any breath, blood or urine test provided in F.S. §
316.1932, and such officer shall have submitted a sworn statement that he had
reasonable cause to believe the person had been driving or had been in actual
physical control of a motor vehicle within the city while under the influence
of alcoholic or controlled substances or a combination of alcoholic beverages
and controlled substances, and that such person had refused to submit to the
test or tests after being requested to do so by the officer.

where signs shall be posted as provided for in subsection (E) of this section.
   (D)   Considerations and guidelines. The City Commission may establish a no-
thru-truck zone if one or more of the following conditions exists; however, a

city, specifically identifying the dog as covered by the policy, in the amount
of no less than $300,000 issued by an insurer authorized to do business within
the State of Florida, payable to any person injured in malice by the dangerous
dog. Proof of financial responsibility shall be a condition precedent to the
city approving the dog's registration. Financial responsibility shall be
evidenced by filing with the City Clerk a certificate of insurance from an
insurance company authorized to do business in the state, valid for the one-
year registration period. The city will be a certificate holder such that the
city will be notified if the insurance coverages expire or terminate.
            2.   As an alternative to maintaining the insurance otherwise
required, proof of financial responsibility may also be evidenced by
establishing a security escrow where the city holds securities (and stock or
other powers appropriate to liquidate such securities) as an escrow agent. The
value of the escrow of cash and securities shall at all times be maintained in
the minimum amount of $300,000. In the event at any time the escrow is reduced,
as provided herein, it shall be a requirement that the value of the escrow be
restored to its required minimum amount. In the event there is no violation of
this division (C) and there is no police report during the registration period
for which the escrow is maintained that the dog bit or injured a human or
animal, then the escrow shall be continued to be maintained. In the event of a
police report that a dog for which the escrow is maintained bit a human or
injured an animal, the city shall notify the victim (or parent, guardian, or
owner of the victim if the victim is a minor or animal) and may use the cash or
liquidate the securities and use the net proceeds thereof to reimburse the
human (or parents or legal guardian of the human if the injured human is a
minor) for any unpaid hospital or medical or rehabilitation treatment, or for
any veterinary care or treatment provided to the animal. In the event of a
violation of this division (C), the city may use the amount in escrow to pay
for any enforcement action the city may take, including but not limited to,
seeking an order requiring the dog involved to be placed by the city in a
location outside the city and prohibited from the city at anytime in the
future. This subsection shall be supplemental to other methods of enforcing the
city's laws that are available to the city. The registrant shall reimburse the
city for any legal costs incurred by the city in establishing, monitoring, or
performing the escrow. Finally, in the event of a cash escrow, the city may
commingle the funds with other city funds, may keep any investment return
thereon, will only be required to account for the principal thereof, and only
the principal thereof will be used to determine the minimum amount of such
escrow for maintenance purposes.
         (f)   A dangerous dog is required to wear a dangerous dog license tag.
         (g)   The owner or keeper shall, on or before the effective date of
such registration for which application is being made, have an enclosure for
the dangerous dog on the property where the dangerous dog will be kept or
maintained.
      (4)   The owner or keeper of a dangerous dog shall:
         (a)   At all times ensure that the dog is securely confined indoors,
or confined in an enclosure as defined herein. At any time that a dangerous dog
is not so confined, the dog shall be muzzled with a "basket"-type muzzle and in
such a manner as to prevent it from biting or injuring any person or animal,
and kept on a leash with the owner or custodian in attendance except for while
the dog is being transported within the cab or passenger portion of any motor
vehicle, provided the vehicle has a roof, and the dog cannot escape through an
open window.
         (b)   Notify the city's Code Enforcement Manager immediately if a
dangerous dog is on the loose, is unconfined, has attacked another animal or
has attacked a human being, or has died or has been sold or given away. If the
dangerous dog has been sold or given away, the owner or keeper shall also
provide to the city the name, address and telephone number of the new owner of
the dangerous dog.
         (c)   At all times ensure that the dog's vaccinations, including, but
not limited to, rabies vaccines, are current.
      (5)   Any dangerous dog without a valid dangerous dog license tag as
required in this division (C), or which is not maintained on property with an
enclosure, or which shall be outside of the dwelling of the owner or keeper, or
outside of an enclosure except as provided in division (C)(4)(a), may be
impounded at the city's direction by animal control or through some other
means, placed in quarantine, if necessary, for the proper length of time, or
placed by animal control in a location outside the city and prohibited from the
city at anytime in the future, after the expiration of 14 calendar days from
the date written notice is provided to the owner that such dog has been
confiscated. Notice shall be effected by registered mail, certified hand
delivery, or service of process in conformance with F.S. Ch. 48. The 14-day
time period shall allow the owner or keeper to request a hearing under this
division (C). In the event a dangerous dog is impounded, the owner shall pay a
dangerous dog impound fee, as set forth in this section.
      (6)   In the event that the owner or keeper of a dangerous dog is a
minor, the parent or guardian of such minor shall be responsible for complying
with the provisions of this section. No dangerous dog license shall be issued
to any person under the age of 18 years.
   (D)   Fees.

exceeds the limits set forth for the receiving land use designation in Table 1
when measured at or within the property line of the receiving land use
designation.
   (B)   Such a sound source would constitute a noise disturbance. For the
purposes of this chapter, the L50 shall be the sound, which exceeded for more
than 50% of any measurement period which shall be not less than ten minutes
when measured at or within the boundary of a property within the receiving land
use district and as a result of a source of sound being located on some other
property.
   (C)   For the purposes of this chapter, the L50 may be established by
recording the instantaneous A-weighted sound level using the slow meter
response at equal intervals of ten seconds. The resulting sound level sample
that exceeds half the samples will be taken as the L50. Equally, for the
purposes of this chapter, unless otherwise established by measurements, if the
Leq is measured instead of the L50, the L50 shall be taken to be two decibels
less than the measured equivalent sound level of Leq.

   DROP. The cable or cables that connect the subscribers of the system to the
distribution system.
   EQUITABLE PRICE. The fair market value adjusted downward to account for harm
to the city or subscribers, if any, resulting from a franchisee's breach of its
franchise or violation of this chapter, and as further adjusted to account for
other equitable factors that may be considered consistent with the Cable Act,
47 USC 547.
   FAIR MARKET VALUE. The price that a willing buyer would pay to a willing
seller for a cable system or open video system valued as a going concern but
with no value allocated to the franchise itself.
   FCC. The Federal Communications Commission, or any successor governmental

ways, or easements within the city. The term does not include any local
business tax receipt or permit that may be required by this subchapter or other
laws, ordinances or regulations of the city for the privilege of transacting
and carrying on a business within the city or for construction or carrying out

any source whatsoever arising from, attributable to, or in any way derived from
the operation of the cable system to provide cable services within the city. By
way of illustration, gross revenues include, but are not limited to, fees
charged for basic service; fees charged for any optional, premium, or any tier
of service other than basic service; installation, disconnection, reconnection
and change-in-service fees; late fees; leased access fees; revenue from cable
internet service (unless the FCC determines in a final binding order that such
service is not a cable service), payments or other consideration from
programmers for carriage of programming on the system including, but not
limited to, infomercials (excluding marketing support provided for the launch
of new services on the system to the extent such funds are not considered
revenue under GAAP); net launch fees, revenue from converter, remote, modem or
any other equipment rentals or sales; revenues from studio and studio equipment
rental; revenues from leases of cable or fiber optic lines and other
transmission devices and equipment; revenues from transmission of data;
revenues from consumer products including, but not limited to, cable guides;
and advertising revenues allocable to the city based on a percentage of

determine the allocable gross revenue  stemming from advertising; revenues from
home shopping channels or other sources allocable to the city, provided that
where certain home shopping channel or other such revenue is allocable to more
than one franchise authority due to common zip codes, the franchisee will
allocate the percentage of revenue to the city which is equivalent to the
percentage of the city's population divided by the total population for the
allocable franchise areas in question. GROSS REVENUES shall be the basis for
computing the franchise fee imposed pursuant to this subchapter. GROSS REVENUES
shall not include any taxes on services furnished by the franchisee which are
imposed upon any subscriber or user by the state, city or other governmental
unit and collected by the franchisee on behalf of said governmental unit and
which the franchisee passes on in full to the applicable tax authority or
authorities. However, it is hereby expressly provided that unless otherwise
prohibited by applicable law, franchise fees shall be included in the
calculation of gross revenues. The definition of GROSS REVENUES contained
herein is subject to state and federal law, and shall only apply if the city is
able to charge and collect franchise fees pursuant to this chapter and a
franchise agreement.

amended from time-to- time.
   OVERBUILD. A cable system or OVS constructed to serve subscribers already
served by an existing cable system or OVS.
   PERSON. Any individual, corporation, partnership, association, joint

performance, channel capacity, equipment, components and service equivalent to
that which has been developed and demonstrated to be at least as modern as
generally accepted and used in the cable industry in the state. In no event
shall a system having a bandwidth of less then 750 MHz be considered state of
the art unless the city, in its sole discretion, determines that a cable system
operating at less than 750 MHz is state of the art; and offers a level of
production facilities, technical performance, channel capacity, and service
equivalent to a system operating at a bandwidth of no less than 750 MHz.
   SUBSCRIBER. Any person who lawfully receives cable service delivered over a
cable system or OVS. However, notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
SUBSCRIBER shall not mean any homeowner or condominium association or other

home (e.g., in a multiple family dwelling, a unit will be defined as each
subscriber unit within the structure) included within a contract as one
subscriber. The franchisee shall not use any equivalency measures except as may
be required by FCC rules.
   TRANSFER. Any transaction in which:
      (1)   An ownership or other interest in a franchisee is transferred from

      (4)   The rights and/or obligations held by a franchisee under a
franchise agreement are transferred or assigned to another person or group of
persons.
A transfer shall be considered “pro forma” when it involves a transfer to a
person or group of persons wholly owned by the franchisee or the same legal
entity with controlling interest in the franchisee, and will not result in a
change in the control or ultimate ownership of the franchisee.
   TWO-WAY CAPABILITY. The incorporation into a cable system or OVS of all
appropriate design and engineering characteristics and features so that two-
way transmission, including, but not limited to, addressability, can be

all cable franchises in existence as of the effective date of this subchapter,
to the full extent permitted by law.
   (B)   Any franchisee whose franchise agreement predates the effective date
of this subchapter shall continue to operate pursuant to the franchise
agreement and shall notify the city in writing within 45 calendar days of the
passage of this subchapter, or any subsequent amendment thereof, of:

reason of the pre-existing franchise agreement; and
      (2)   The reason for each such claim of non-applicability.
   (C)   Failure to notify the city as provided in division (B) above shall
constitute a waiver of any right to object.

the effective date of this chapter to file an application for a franchise or
local business tax receipt.

be subject to this subchapter. A person with a pending application shall be
provided 30 calendar days from the effective date of this subchapter to amend
the application if necessary to comply with the requirements of this chapter.
   (F)   Nothing herein requires the city to apply the provisions of this
chapter to a government entity if the city determines that it is not in the
public interest to do so. Nothing in this subchapter shall require a government
entity to comply with this chapter to the extent that the city cannot enforce
the provisions of this chapter with respect to the government entity under
applicable law.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02; Am. Ord. 1576, passed 4-18-07)
§ 112.05 RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.
   (A)   The city reserves the right to amend this subchapter as it shall find
necessary in the lawful exercise of its police powers.
   (B)   Any additional regulations adopted by the city shall be incorporated
into this subchapter and complied with by all franchisees within 60 days of the
date of adoption of such additional regulations unless imposition of such
regulations would be otherwise prohibited by applicable law, or the city
extends the time for such compliance.
   (C)   The city reserves the right to exercise the power of eminent domain to
acquire the property of a franchisee's cable system or open video system,
consistent with law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this section
shall not enlarge or restrict the city's exercise of eminent domain except to
the extent provided by law.
   (D)   To the full extent permitted by law, the city reserves the right to
acquire, construct, own, and/or operate a cable system or open video system.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.06 FRANCHISE REQUIRED.
   (A)   The city may grant one or more non-exclusive franchises in accordance
with this subchapter.
   (B)   Unless expressly permitted by applicable law, no person may construct
or operate a cable system, OVS, or communications transmission facilities using
the city's public rights-of-way without a franchise or applicable authorization
granted by the city, and no person may be granted a franchise without having
entered into a franchise agreement with the city pursuant to this subchapter.
   (C)   Unless otherwise authorized by law, any franchise granted pursuant to
this subchapter is solely for the provision of cable service and shall not be
construed to authorize the provision of telephone, non- cable video, or other
communications service.
   (D)   Any person who operates a cable system, open video system, or provides
cable service in the city without a franchise or other appropriate authority
may be subject to penalties as provided herein and other sanctions as provided
by applicable law. Such violations may be punishable as provided in §
10.99 this code, as well as other appropriate sanctions under applicable law.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.07 CHARACTERISTICS OF A FRANCHISE.
   (A)   A franchise authorizes use of the public rights-of-way for installing
cables, wires, optical fiber, underground conduit, ducts, conductors,
amplifiers, vaults and other facilities as necessary and pertinent to operate a
cable system or open video system to serve subscribers within the city. A
franchise does not authorize, expressly or implicitly, a franchisee to provide
service to, or install cables, wires, lines, underground conduit, or any other
equipment or facilities upon other property of the city or upon private
property without owner consent (except for use of compatible casements pursuant
to Section 621 of the Cable Act, 47 USC 541(a)(2)), or to use publicly or
privately owned conduits without a separate agreement with the owners.
   (B)   Any franchise granted pursuant to this subchapter shall be
nonexclusive, and will not preclude, expressly or implicitly, the issuance of
other franchises within the city, or affect the city's right to authorize use
of public rights-of-way to other persons to operate cable systems or open video
systems or for other purposes as it determines appropriate. All privileges
prescribed by a franchise shall be subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy of
the public rights-of-way, and the city reserves the right to designate where a
franchisee's facilities are to be placed within the public rights-of- way. A
franchise does not convey any title, equitable or legal, in the public rights-
of-way.
   (C)   A franchise shall be a personal privilege that is in the public trust.
No transfer of a franchise shall occur without the prior consent of the city
and unless application is made by the franchisee, and the city approval
obtained, pursuant to this subchapter and a franchise agreement.
   (D)   A franchise granted pursuant to this subchapter to construct, operate
and maintain a cable system or OVS within the city shall be deemed to
constitute both a right and an obligation on the part of the franchisee to
provide the services and facilities of a cable system or OV S as required by
the provisions of this subchapter and the franchise. The franchise agreement
shall incorporate by reference all of the provisions of the franchisee's
application for the franchise that are finally negotiated and agreed upon by
the city and franchisee. All of a franchisee's application and all written and
oral representations and/or material made or provided by the franchisee in its
application, public hearing, or in any correspondence by the city and
franchisee or the franchisee and any other person shall be deemed to be
material and made for the purpose of inducing the city to grant the franchise
in the form accepted.
   (E)   In the event that a franchisee or it's affiliate elects to offer to
subscribers video programming services through any means or method not included
within the definition of a cable system, including, but not limited to, an open
video system, the franchisee shall remain subject to all terms and conditions
of the franchise granted pursuant to this subchapter to the extent permitted by
applicable law.
   (F)   Unless a franchise agreement specifically provides otherwise, all
franchises granted pursuant to this subchapter shall apply to the entire
territorial area of the city. A franchise agreement may provide that a
franchisee must provide a certain level of service to a particular area of the
city, before a franchisee may extend service to other areas of the city.
   (G)   The city may waive the requirement of a franchise for the construction
of a cable system or OVS that is not constructed to provide service within the
city and that does not provide such services within the city. For the
construction of such facilities, pursuant to other code provisions of the city
and state law, the city may grant a local business tax receipt for a term no
longer than five years and providing for reasonable compensation to the city
for use of its public rights-of- way. A local business tax receipt shall be
revocable at the will of the City Commission. Except as to matters specifically
addressed in the license, the terms of this subchapter will apply to a
licensee. If a person granted a license provides cable services within the
city, the person shall comply with the requirements of this subchapter.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02; Am. Ord. 1576, passed 4-18-07)
§ 112.08 FRANCHISEE SUBJECT TO OTHER LAWS, POLICE POWER.
   (A)   A franchisee shall at all times be subject to and shall comply with
all applicable law. A franchisee shall at all times be subject to all lawful
exercise of the police power of the city.
   (B)   Subject to applicable law, except as may be provided specifically in
this subchapter or under the terms of a franchise agreement and subject to the
Cable Act, the failure of the city, upon one or more occasions, to exercise a
right or to require compliance or performance under this subchapter or a
franchise agreement shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of such right or
a waiver of compliance or performance.
   (C)   The provisions of this subchapter shall be applied to franchisees in
addition to the terms of any franchise agreement, and shall apply to a
franchise agreement as if fully set forth in the franchise agreement. It is the
intent of the city not to impair existing franchise agreements in violation of
applicable law. The express terms of this subchapter will prevail over
conflicting or inconsistent provisions in a franchise agreement unless such
franchise agreement expresses an explicit intent to waive a requirement of this
subchapter.
   (D)   Except as to matters that are governed by federal law or regulation, a
franchise agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the state.
   (E)   In the event of any change in law which would require the city to
amend this subchapter, the city and a franchisee may modify an existing
franchise in a mutually agreed upon manner.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)

request for proposals. If the city elects to issue a request for proposals upon
receipt of an unsolicited application, the applicant may submit an amended
application in response to the request for proposals, or may inform the city
that its unsolicited application should be considered in response to the
request for proposals, or may withdraw its unsolicited application. An

minimum, the following information:
      (1)   The name and address of the applicant and identification of the

has, or has had, a cable franchise or local business tax receipt or controlling
interest therein. If an applicant has no other franchises in the state, the
applicant shall provide this information for other states with respect to
franchises or local business tax receipts that have expired or will expire
within two years of the date of its application;
         (c)   A description and location of the physical facilities proposed
and proposed channel capacity, performance characteristics, headend and access
facilities, and institutional network facilities; and upon request, the
applicant shall make information on technical design available for inspection;
and
         (d)   Where applicable, a description of the method of construction of
the proposed system, including an estimate of plant mileage and location, the
proposed construction schedule, a description, where appropriate, of how
services will be converted from existing facilities to new facilities, and
information on the availability of space in conduits including, where
appropriate, an estimate of the cost of any necessary rearrangement of existing
facilities.
      (3)   A demonstration of the applicant's financial qualifications,

         (c)   Pro forma financial projections for five years including a
statement of projected income, and a schedule of planned capital additions,
with all significant assumptions explained in notes or supporting schedules.
      (4)   To the extent that the applicant is relying on the financial or
technical resources of another person, including an affiliate, the proofs
required pursuant to divisions (2) and (3) above should be provided for that
person;
      (5)   A demonstration that the applicant is legally qualified, including:
         (a)   Whether the applicant or any person controlling the applicant,
or any officer, director or person with 50% or more ownership interest in the
applicant, has been adjudged bankrupt, had a cable franchise or local business
tax receipt revoked, has been fined by a franchise authority, or been found by
any court or administrative agency to have violated any law; and, if so,
identification of any such person and a full explanation of the circumstances;
         (b)   Whether the applicant has received, or is in a position to
receive, necessary authorizations from state and federal authorities;
         (c)   Whether the applicant has engaged in conduct (fraud,
racketeering, or violation of antitrust, consumer protection, or similar laws)
that would lead the city to conclude the applicant cannot be relied upon to
comply with requirements of a franchise or provisions of this subchapter;
         (d)   Whether the applicant is a convicted vendor pursuant to F.S.

community in light of the costs thereof, within 36 months of the application;
and
         (h)   Whether the applicant has a pending application for an OVS
franchise.
      (6)   An applicant may provide information that it would be inappropriate
to deny it a franchise for any information submitted pursuant to division (5)
above, by virtue of the particular circumstances surrounding the matter and the
steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent
their recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals, or the
remoteness of the matter from the operation of a cable system;
      (7)   A demonstration of how the applicant's proposal will reasonably
meet the future cable-related needs and interests of the community, including a
description of how the proposal will meet the needs described in any recent
community needs assessment conducted by or for the city;

application requirements, unless the requirements are determined to be a
requirement of applicable law.
   (G)   An application for modification of a franchise agreement shall
include, at a minimum, the following information:
      (1)   The specific modification requested;
      (2)   The justification for the requested modification, including the
impact of the requested modification on subscribers and others, and the
financial impact on the applicant if the modification is approved or
disapproved;
      (3)   A statement whether the modification is sought pursuant to Section
625 of the Cable Act, 47 USC 545, and, if so, a demonstration that the
requested modification meets the standards set forth in 47 USC 545;
      (4)   Any other reasonable information requested by the city to make an
informed determination on the application for modification; and
      (5)   An affidavit or declaration of the applicant or authorized officer
certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the application, and

Commission by resolution, which may be amended from time to time, shall
accompany every application, including, but not limited to, divisions (A)(1)
through (A)(5) above.
      (2)   The purpose of the filing fee is to defray a portion of the city's
cost in processing an application. The fee may be credited against amounts due
under §
112.10. The filing fee is therefore intended to be a charge incidental to the
awarding or enforcing of a franchise within the meaning of Section 622(g)(2)(D)
of the Cable Act, 47 USC 542(g)(2)(D), and may not be deducted from the
franchise fee imposed in a franchise agreement, unless required by federal law.
To the extent federal law authorizes the deduction of filing fees from
franchise fees, the franchisee shall deduct the fees over the entire term of
the franchise.

this subchapter conditioned upon the completion of construction, upgrades or
rebuilds of a cable system or OVS within a reasonably prescribed time or upon
the performance of other specific obligations which are to be set forth in the
franchise agreement, specifying that failure to comply with the condition may
cause the franchise to be terminated or may require the franchisee to pay
liquidated damages to the city as specified in the franchise agreement.
   (C)   In evaluating an application for a franchise, the city may consider,
among other things, the following factors: the applicant's technical,
financial, and legal qualifications to construct and operate the proposed
system; the adequacy of the proposed construction methods, facilities,
equipment, and services based on the public convenience, safety, and welfare;
the applicant's experience in constructing and operating cable systems and
providing cable service in other communities, if any; the ability of public
rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed system; the potential disruption to
users of the public rights-of-way and any resultant inconvenience to the
public; the applicant's service under any existing franchise or prior
experience with the city; whether approval may reduce competition in the
delivery of cable service in the city; and whether the proposal will meet
reasonably anticipated needs, including adequate public, educational and
government access channels and support, channel capacity, and will serve the
public interest. Evaluation by the city shall not be based on the programming
the applicant proposes to provide.
   (D)   The City Commission shall hold one or more public hearings to consider
any application. The applicant shall be notified of the hearing and shall be
given an opportunity to be heard. Based upon the application, the testimony
presented at the public hearing, any recommendations of the city or staff, and
any other information relevant to the application, the city shall decide by
resolution whether to grant or deny a franchise application and decide the
terms and conditions of any franchise granted. If the City Commission denies a
franchise, it shall issue a written decision setting forth its reasons. Upon
the grant of a franchise, the franchisee's application shall become an integral
part of the franchise, and the franchisee shall be bound by the representations
therein made.
   (E)   After complying with the above requirements, the City Commission shall
approve or disapprove the proposed franchise agreement by resolution.
   (F)   The franchisee shall reimburse the city for all reasonable expenses
incurred by the city in considering and processing the application, including,
but not limited to, consulting and legal costs, less only the amount of the
application fee. The city shall bill the franchisee for the amount of the
processing fee and describe its method of calculation, and the applicant shall
pay the processing fee within 30 days of the date of the bill. If the fee is
not received by the city within 30 days of the date of the bill, the city shall
notify such franchisee and the franchisee shall pay a late fee at the rate of
18% per annum of the amount of the unpaid or underpaid fee, provided, however,
that such rate does not exceed the maximum amount allowed under applicable law.
If the city does not receive the fee in total within 60 days of the date of the
bill, the city shall notify such franchisee and the city may revoke the
franchise or pursue other remedies as appropriate. This processing fee is
intended to be a charge incidental to the awarding or enforcing of a franchise
within the meaning of Section 622(g)(2)(D) of the Cable Act, 47 USC 542(g)(2)
(D), and may not be deducted from the franchise fee imposed in a franchise
agreement and, to the extent consistent with applicable law, shall not be
passed through to subscribers. To the extent federal law authorizes a
franchisee to deduct the processing fee from franchise fees, a franchisee shall
deduct such over the entire term of the franchise.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.11 FRANCHISE FEES.
   (A)   This section, and any franchise fee provision in a franchise
agreement, shall not apply during such time as state law prohibits the city
from collecting franchise fees or similar compensation. During the period state
law prohibits the city from collecting franchise fees, a franchisee shall pay
the tax required by state law to the state. If the city is legally entitled to
charge franchise fees or similar fees, a franchisee will pay the highest fee
legally authorized.
   (B)   A franchisee, as compensation for the privilege granted under a
franchise for use of the public rights-of-way to construct and operate a cable
system, shall pay to the city a franchise fee:
      (1)   In an amount up to a maximum of either 5% of the franchisee's gross
revenues during the term of its franchise; or
      (2)   In the event the Cable Act or other applicable law is amended to
permit the city to assess a fee of a greater amount or on a broader revenue
basis than that specified in division (1) above, the franchisee agrees to pay
to the city the new amount after a public hearing in which the public and the
franchisee are given an opportunity to comment on the impact of the higher fee.
   (C)   To the extent that an OVS is used to provide cable service, an
operator of an OVS shall pay the city a fee in lieu of a franchise fee. This
fee will be based on the Gross Revenues derived from the operation of the open
video system to provide cable services. To prevent evasion of franchise fees,
any revenues from activities performed by an affiliate that could have been
performed by the franchisee of the OVS, including but not limited to selling
advertisements and selling services to subscribers, will be treated as revenues
of the operator. The amount of the fee shall be equal to the percentage rate of
the franchise fee imposed on franchisees of cable systems pursuant to this
section.
   (D)   (1)   A franchisee shall pay fees due to the city on a calendar-year,
quarterly basis. Payment for each quarter shall be made to the city not later
than 30 calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter.
      (2)   A franchisee shall file with the city, on a quarterly basis with
the payment of the franchise fee, a financial statement setting forth the
computation of gross revenues used to calculate the fee for the preceding
quarter and a detailed explanation of the method of computation.
      (3)   The statement shall be certified by a certified public accountant
or the franchisee's chief financial or other duly authorized officer. The
franchisee will bear the cost of the preparation of the financial statements.
      (4)   Subject to applicable law, no acceptance by the city of any fee or
payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the
correct amount, nor shall the acceptance of payment be construed as a release
of any claim the city may have for additional sums payable.
      (5)   The franchise fee or other fee payment is not a payment in lieu of
any other tax, fee, or assessment, except as specifically provided in this
section. By way of example and not limitation, the city does not waive and may
still require permit fees and business taxes that may be established from time
to time by the city. Nothing in this section shall alter the effect of any
election the city has made with respect to permit fees and taxes pursuant to
state law.
      (6)   Within 90 calendar days following the end of the calendar year, a
franchisee shall submit a statement, attested to by a certified public
accountant or chief financial officer, setting forth the gross revenues of the
cable or OVS for the previous calendar year and describing what revenues were
included and what revenues, if any, derived from the operation of the system,
were excluded in the fee calculation, and any adjustments made to gross
revenues.
   (E)   Unless prohibited by applicable law, the city may, from time to time,
but not more frequently than annually, upon reasonable notice, inspect and
audit any and all books and records of a franchisee relevant to the
determination of gross revenues and the computation of franchise fees due, and
may recompute any amounts determined to be payable under the franchise, subject
to the applicable statute of limitations. The cost of the audit will be borne
by the franchisee if, as a result of the audit, the city determines that the
franchisee has underpaid the franchise fees owed in an amount equal to or
exceeding 3% of the franchise fees actually paid. A franchisee shall make all
books and records necessary to perform the audit readily available to the
auditors in the city, for inspection and copying or, in the alternative, the
franchisee shall pay all costs necessary for the city to perform the audit at a
location outside of the city.
   (F)   In the event that a franchise fee or other payment required by this
section is not received by the city on or before the due date set forth herein,
or is underpaid, the franchisee will pay a late charge of $5,000 per 30 day
period that the fee is not paid in full, or the maximum amount allowed under
state law. Any interest and/or late charges paid by the franchisee is intended
to be a charge incidental to the enforcing of a franchise within the meaning of
Section 622 (g)(2)(D) of the Cable Act, 47 USC 542(g)(2)(D), and may not be
deducted from the fee imposed by this subchapter or any franchise agreement.
   (G)   When a franchise terminates for any reason, the franchisee shall file
with the city, within 90 calendar days of the date on which its operations in
the city cease, a financial statement, certified by a certified public
accountant or the franchisee's chief financial officer, showing the gross
revenues received by the franchisee since the end of the previous fiscal year.
Adjustments will be made at that time for franchise fees due to the date that
the franchisee's operations ceased.
   (H)   The payment of a fee pursuant to this section on cable service
provided over a cable or open video system does not excuse an operator from any
requirements that may exist to pay fees or other payments on services other
than cable services provided over the facilities. As an example and not as a
limitation of the foregoing, a cable operator that pays a franchise fee on
revenues derived from the provision of cable services must pay the fees imposed
upon providers of communications services to the extent that it provides such
services.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02; Am. Ord. 1576, passed 4-18-07)
§ 112.12 RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   Renewal shall be conducted in a manner consistent with Section 626 of
the Cable Act, 47 USC 546.
   (B)   To the extent such additional requirements are not prohibited by
applicable law, the following requirements shall apply:
      (1)   Upon completion of the review and evaluation process set forth in
Section 626(a)(1)(2) of the Cable Act, 47 USC 546, should that process be
invoked, the city shall notify the franchisee that it may file a renewal
application including a renewal proposal. The notice shall specify the
information to be included in the renewal application and the deadline for
filing the application, which shall be no earlier than 30 calendar days
following the date of the notice.
         (a)   The application shall comply with the requirements of §
112.09(A) through (C), and (J), and provide the specific information requested
in the notice. If the franchisee does not submit a renewal application by the
date specified in the city's notice to the franchisee pursuant to this
subsection, the franchisee will be deemed not to be seeking renewal of its
franchise.
         (b)   Upon receipt of the renewal application, the city shall publish
notice of its receipt and make copies available to the public. The city,
following prior public notice, may hold one or more public hearings on the
renewal application.
      (2)   The City Commission shall consider the renewal application at a
public hearing at which the City Commission will either:
         (a)   Pass a resolution agreeing to renew the franchise, subject to
the negotiation of a
franchise agreement satisfactory to the city and the franchisee; or
         (b)   Pass a resolution that makes a preliminary assessment that the
franchise should not be renewed.
      (3)   If a preliminary assessment is made that a franchise should not be
renewed, at the request of the franchisee or on its own initiative, the city
will commence a proceeding in accordance with Section 626(c) of the Cable Act,
47 USC 546(c), to address the issues set forth in Section 626(c)(1)(A) through
(D) of the Cable Act, 47 USC 546(c)(1)(A) though (D). Any denial of a proposal
for renewal that has been submitted in compliance with Subsection (b) of
Section 546 shall be based on one or more adverse findings made with respect to
the factors described in Section 546(c)(1)(A) through (D), pursuant to the
record of proceedings under Section 546(c). The city shall not base a denial of
renewal on a failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the
franchise under Section 546(c)(1)(A) or on events considered under Section 546
(c)(1)(B) unless the city has provided the franchisee with notice and
opportunity to cure, or in any case in which it is documented that the city has
waived its right to object, or the franchisee gives written notice of a failure
or inability to cure and the city fails to object within a reasonable time
after receipt of such notice.
      (4)   Any request to initiate a renewal process or proposal for renewal
not submitted within the time period set forth in Section 626(a) of the Cable
Act, 47 USC 546(a), shall be deemed an informal proposal for renewal and shall
be governed in accordance with Section 626(h) of the Cable Act, 47 USC §546(h).
The City Commission may hold one or more public hearings or implement other
procedures under which comments from the public on an informal proposal for
renewal may be received. Following such public hearings or other procedures,
the City Commission shall determine whether the franchise should be renewed and
the terms and conditions of any renewal.
      (5)   If the City Commission grants a renewal application, the city and
the franchisee shall agree on the terms of a franchise agreement, pursuant to
the procedures specified in this subchapter, before the renewal becomes
effective.
      (6)   If renewal of a franchise is lawfully denied, the city may acquire
ownership of the cable system or require a transfer of the system upon approval
of the City Commission in a manner not inconsistent with federal law. The city
may not acquire ownership of the system or approve a transfer while an appeal
of a denial for renewal is pending in any court pursuant to 47 USC 546(e).
      (7)   If renewal of a franchise is lawfully denied and no appeal to a
court is pending, and the city does not purchase the cable system or approve or
require a transfer of the cable system to another person, the city may require
the former franchisee to remove its facilities and equipment at the former
franchisee's expense. If the former franchisee fails to do so within a
reasonable period of time, the city may have the removal done at the former
franchisee's and/or surety's expense.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.13 TRANSFER OF A FRANCHISE.
   (A)   No transfer of a franchise shall occur without prior approval of the
City Commission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter,
pledges in trust or mortgages of the assets of a cable system or OVS to secure
construction, operation or repair of the system and the sale of a portion of
the assets of the system that will not substantially affect the system's
operations, may be made without application and without the city's prior
consent; except that no such arrangement may be made if it would in any respect
under any condition prevent the cable system or OVS operator or any successor
from complying with the franchise and applicable law, nor may any such
arrangement permit a third party to succeed to the interest of the franchisee,
or to own or control the cable system or OVS without the prior consent of the
city. Any mortgage, pledge or lease shall be subject and subordinate to the
rights of the city under this subchapter or other applicable law.
   (B)   All applications for a transfer of a franchise shall be filed at least
120 calendar days prior to the effective date of the transfer, shall meet the
requirements of this subchapter, and shall provide complete information on the
proposed transaction, including details on the legal, financial, technical, and
other qualifications of the transferee, and on the potential impact of the
transfer on subscriber rates and services. Except in the case of a pro forma
transfer, the application shall contain, at a minimum, the information required
in §
112.09(E)(1) through (5), (8), (11), and (12) with respect to the proposed
transferee. If the information to be provided in response to these items will
not change as a result of the transfer, the transferee may so indicate in its
response. The information required in §
112.09(E)(7), (9), and (10) shall also be provided whenever the proposed
transferee expects material changes to occur in those areas. The following
information must be included in the application, provided that a franchisee is
not required to duplicate information that it submits to the city to comply
with its obligations under federal or state law:
      (1)   All information and forms required under federal law, or the
equivalent of the forms if no longer required by federal law;
      (2)   Any contracts or other documents that relate to the proposed
transaction, and all documents, schedules, exhibits or the like referred to
therein to the extent that the documentation is required by the FCC;
      (3)   Any shareholder reports or filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that discuss the transaction;
      (4)   Other information deemed necessary by the city to provide a
complete and accurate understanding of the financial position of the cable
system or OVS before and after the proposed transfer;
      (5)   Complete information regarding any potential impact of the transfer
on subscriber rates and service;
      (6)   A brief summary of the proposed transferee's plans for at least the
next five years regarding line extension, plant and equipment upgrades, channel
capacity, expansion or elimination of cable services, and any other changes
affecting or enhancing the performance of the cable system or OVS.
   (C)   An application for approval of a pro forma transfer of a franchise
shall be considered granted on the 91st calendar day following the filing of
such application with the city unless, prior to that date, the city notifies
the franchisee to the contrary. An application for approval of a pro forma
transfer of a franchise shall clearly identify the application as such,
describe the proposed transaction, and explain why the applicant believes the
transfer is pro forma. Unless otherwise requested by the city within 30
calendar days of the filing of an application for a pro forma transfer, the
applicant shall be required only to provide the information required in §
112.09(E)(1), (3)(a), (5)(b) and (12) with respect to the proposed transferee.
   (D)   In making a determination on whether to grant an application for a
transfer, the City Commission shall consider the legal, financial, and
technical qualifications of the transferee to operate the system; whether the
incumbent franchisee is in substantial compliance with the material terms of
its franchise agreement and this subchapter and, if not, the proposed
transferee's commitment to cure the noncompliance; whether the transfer may
reduce competition in cable services within the city; and whether operation by
the transferee would adversely affect subscribers or the city, or otherwise be
contrary to the public interest.
   (E)   No application for a transfer shall be granted unless the transferee
agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of this subchapter
and the franchise agreement, and that it will assume the obligations and
liabilities, known and unknown, of the previous franchisee under this
subchapter and the franchise agreement.
   (F)   Approval by the city of a transfer of a franchise does not constitute
a waiver or release of any of the rights of the city under this subchapter or
the franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the
transfer.
   (G)   The transferee shall notify the city that the transfer is complete
within five business days of the date the transfer is complete.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.14 REVOCATION OR TERMINATION OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   The City Commission may revoke a franchise for a franchisee's failure
to construct, operate or maintain the cable system as required by this
subchapter or the franchise agreement, or for any other material violation of
this subchapter or material breach of the franchise agreement or material
violation of applicable law. To invoke the provisions of this section, the city
shall give the franchisee written notice by certified mail at the last known
address that the franchisee is in material violation of this subchapter or in
material breach of the franchise agreement. The notice shall describe the
nature of the alleged violation or breach with specificity and demand
correction within 30 calendar days or, within a reasonable time period stated
in the notice, which shall not be less than 30 calendar days. If within 30
calendar days following receipt of the written notice from the city the
franchisee has not cured the violation or breach, or has not commenced
corrective action and such corrective action is not being actively and
expeditiously pursued, the city may give written notice to the franchisee of
its intent to revoke the franchise, stating its reasons.
   (B)   Prior to revoking a franchise under division (A) above, the City
Commission shall hold a public hearing, upon 10 calendar days notice, at which
time the franchisee and the public shall be given an opportunity to be heard.
Following the public hearing, the City Commission may determine whether to
revoke the franchise based on the evidence presented at the hearing, and other
evidence of record. If the City Commission makes a determination to revoke a
franchise, it shall direct that a written decision setting forth the reasons
for its decision shall be transmitted to the franchisee.
   (C)   Notwithstanding divisions (A) and (B) above, any franchise may, at the
option of the City Commission following a public hearing before the Commission,
be revoked 120 calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors
or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the
franchisee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment
for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding, unless within that
120 day period:
      (1)   Such assignment, receivership, or trusteeship has been vacated; or
      (2)   Such assignee, receiver, or trustee has fully complied with the
terms and conditions of this subchapter and the franchise agreement and has
executed an agreement, approved by a court having jurisdiction, assuming and
agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this subchapter and the
franchise agreement.
   (D)   In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the
facilities, equipment, or property of a franchisee, the city may revoke the
franchise, following a public hearing before the Commission, by serving notice
upon the franchisee and the successful bidder at the sale, in which event the
franchise and all rights and privileges of the franchise will be revoked and
will terminate 30 calendar days after serving the notice, unless:
      (1)   The city has approved the transfer of the franchise to the
successful bidder; and
      (2)   The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the city to
assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement and
this subchapter.
   (E)   If the city revokes a franchise, or if for any other reason a
franchisee abandons, terminates, or fails to operate or maintain service to its
subscribers for a period of six months, the following procedures and rights are
effective:
      (1)   The city may require the former franchisee to remove its facilities
and equipment at the former franchisee's expense. If the former franchisee
fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the city may have the
removal done at the former franchisees and/or surety's expense.
      (2)   The city, by resolution of the City Commission, may acquire
ownership pursuant to this subchapter, or effect a transfer of the cable
system.
      (3)   If a cable system is abandoned by a franchisee, the city may sell,
assign or transfer all or part of the assets of the system.
   (F)   The city may revoke the franchise if the franchisee commits or
participates in an act of fraud or deceit upon the city.
   (G)   Where the city has issued a franchise specifically conditioned in the
franchise agreement upon the completion of construction, system upgrade, or
other specific obligation by a specified date, the city may revoke a franchise
by resolution for failure of the franchisee to complete such construction or
upgrade, unless the city, at its discretion and for good cause demonstrated by
the franchisee, grants an extension of time.
   (H)   The foregoing provisions shall not be deemed to preclude the city from
obtaining any other available remedies for repeated violations of the same
general type, whether remedied or not.
   (I)   Except as provided in division (G) above, the city shall not take
action against a franchisee pursuant to this section except after a noticed
public hearing at which the franchisee is given an opportunity to participate.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.15 EFFECTIVE DATE OF A FRANCHISE.
   Unless a franchise agreement provides otherwise, the effective date of any
franchise agreement shall be as follows:
   (A)   If an initial franchise, the date of acceptance of the franchise
agreement by the franchisee; or
   (B)   If a renewal of a franchise, the date the initial franchise ceases to
be effective or the date the initial franchise expires, whichever is earlier in
time.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.16 USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   (A)   Any pavements, sidewalks, curbing, or other paved area taken up or any
excavations in the public rights-of-way made by a franchisee shall be done
under the supervision and direction of the city under permits issued for work
by the proper officials of the city, and shall be done in such manner as to
give the least inconvenience to the inhabitants of the city. A franchisee shall
not commence construction in the public rights-of-way until the city has issued
all applicable permits, except in the case of an emergency. The term
"emergency" shall mean a condition that affects the public's health, safety or
welfare, which includes an unplanned out-of-service condition of a pre-
existing service. A franchisee shall provide prompt notice to the city of
construction in the public rights-of- way in the event of an emergency. As a
condition of granting such permits, the city may impose rules or regulations
governing the construction in public rights- of-way. Permits shall apply only
to the areas of public rights-of-way specifically identified in the permit. The
city may issue a blanket permit to cover certain activities, such as routine
maintenance and repair activities, that may otherwise require individual
permits or may impose lesser requirements.
   (B)   As part of any permit application to perform construction in the
public rights-of-way, the franchisee shall provide at least the following:
      (1)   An engineering plan signed and sealed by a state registered
professional engineer, or prepared by a person who is exempt from such
requirements as provided in F.S. § 471.003, identifying the location of the
proposed facilities, including a description of the facilities to be installed,
where they are to be located, and the approximate size of facilities and
equipment that will be located in the public rights-of-way;
      (2)   A description of the manner, in which the facilities will be
installed (i.e., anticipated construction methods and/or techniques);
      (3)   A traffic maintenance plan for any disruption of the public rights-
of-way;
      (4)   Information on the ability of the public rights-of-way to
accommodate the proposed facilities, if available (such information shall be
provided without certification as to correctness to the extent obtained from
other persons with facilities in the public rights-of- way);
      (5)   If appropriate given the construction proposed, an estimate of the
cost of restoration to the public rights-of-way;
      (6)   The timetable for construction of the project or each phase
thereof, and the areas of the city which will be effected; and
      (7)   Such additional information requested by the city that the city
finds necessary to review the permit application.
      (8)   Unless prohibited by applicable law, the city shall have the power
to prohibit or limit construction within the public rights-of-way if there is
insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests to perform construction
or place facilities in that area of the public rights-of-way, for the
protection of existing facilities in the public rights-of-way, or to
accommodate city plans for public improvements or projects that the city
determines are in the public interest.
   (C)   All poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes, and other
fixtures erected by a franchisee in, upon, along, across, above, over and under
the public rights-of-way within the city shall be so located, and all
construction in the public rights-of-way shall be performed so as not to
interfere unreasonably with the use of the public rights-of-way by the
traveling public and to cause minimum interference with the rights or
reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the public rights-
of-way. A franchisee shall not place facilities, equipment, or fixtures where
they will interfere with any gas, electric, telephone, water, sewer, or other
utility facilities, or obstruct or hinder in any manner the various utilities
serving the residents of the city or their use of any public rights-of-way.
   (D)   A franchisee shall, at its own cost and expense, and in a manner
approved by the city, replace and restore any such pavements, sidewalks,
curbing, other paved areas, lawn, landscaping or any other areas where the
franchisee performed construction to at least as good a condition as before the
work was done. A franchisee shall warrant its restoration for a period of 12
months after completion of the restoration. If the franchisee fails to make
such restoration within 20 calendar days after completion of construction, or
such other time as may be required by the city, the city may, after ten days
notice to the franchisee, perform such restoration using city employees, agents
or contractors, and charge all costs of the restoration against the franchisee
and require reimbursement within 20 days after the submission of the bill by
the city to the franchisee.
   (E)   The city shall have the authority to require a franchisee to remove or
to relocate its facilities in the public rights-of-way, unless prohibited by
applicable law. A franchisee shall, on the request of any person holding a
building-moving permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its wires
to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of the temporary removal or
raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same,
and the franchisee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance,
except in the case where the requesting person is the city, in which case no
such payment shall be required. The franchisee shall be given not less than
five calendar days advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes.
   (F)   A permit from the city constitutes authorization to undertake only
certain activities on public rights-of-way in accordance with this subchapter,
and does not create a property right or grant authority to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way. The city
may issue such rules and regulations concerning the installation and
maintenance of a cable system and OVS installed in the public rights-of-way, as
may be consistent with this subchapter and the franchise agreement. The city
makes no warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability or
availability of public rights-of-way for a franchisee's facilities and any
performance of work or costs incurred by a franchisee shall be at the
franchisee's sole risk. Nothing in this subchapter shall affect the city's
authority to add, vacate or abandon public rights-of-way.
   (G)   In connection with excavation in the public rights-of-way, a
franchisee shall, where applicable, comply with the Underground Facility Damage
Prevention and Safety Act set forth in F.S. Chapter 556, as it may be amended.
   (H)   A franchisee shall, upon notice to the city of not less than seven
days, emergency situations excepted, have the authority to trim trees or other
natural growth upon and overhanging the public rights- of-way so as to prevent
the branches of the trees from coming in contact with the wires and other
equipment of the franchisee, except that, at the option of the city, such
trimming as may be done by it or under its supervision and direction at the
expense of the franchisee. All such work shall be done in accordance with such
standards as have now or hereafter may be established by the city.
   (I)   A franchisee shall install and maintain its facilities in the public
rights-of-way in a manner consistent with accepted industry practice and
applicable law. A franchisee shall use all safety practices required by law
when performing construction, maintenance, and repair. A franchisee shall, at
all times:
      (1)   Install and maintain its wires, cables, fixtures and other
equipment in accordance with the requirements of §§
150.10 through
150.24 of this code, as they may be amended, and any other applicable building
or electrical safety code, and in such manner so that they will not interfere
with any installations of the city; and
      (2)   Keep and maintain in a safe, suitable, and substantial condition,
and in good order and repair, all structures, lines, equipment, and connections
in the public rights-of-way or places of the city, wherever situated or
located;
   (J)   On public rights-of-way where electrical or telephone utility wiring
is located underground, either at the time of initial construction of a cable
or open video system or at any time thereafter, a franchisee's facilities shall
also be located underground at the franchisee's expense. Between a street and a
subscriber's residence, a franchisee's drop must be located underground if both
electrical and telephone utility wiring are located underground. If a
franchisee is otherwise not required to locate its facilities underground, a
franchisee shall, at the subscriber's request, locate its drop between a street
and a subscriber's residence underground if the subscriber pays the
franchisee's actual costs of the underground location. The city shall
encourage, to the extent feasible, that other users of the public rights-of-way
and the franchisee cooperate in opening up trenches and making such trenches
available to all parties with the understanding that the costs of opening and
retiling of such trenches would be shared equally by all users of such
trenches. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, with respect to underground
or aerial construction, a franchisee shall install underground extensions of
lines in new residential subdivisions over five units or new multiple occupancy
buildings.
   (K)   A franchisee shall publicize the initial build or any substantial
rebuild, upgrade or extension of its facility that involves work in public
rights-of-way in each affected neighborhood at least one week prior to
commencement of that work by causing written notice of the construction to be
delivered to the city and by notifying those persons whose property is within
300 feet of the work in at least 2 of the following ways: by telephone, in
person, by mail, by distribution of flyers, by publication in local newspapers,
or in any other manner approved by the city that is reasonably calculated to
provide adequate notice. Apart from any initial build or substantial rebuild or
upgrade, any underground construction will be publicized in accordance with
applicable notice requirements. Before performing construction on private
property, a franchisee shall use its best efforts to contact the property owner
or resident and describe the construction to be performed.
   (L)   The city shall have the right to make such inspections of facilities
in the public rights-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with
this subchapter. In the event the city determines that a violation exists with
respect to a franchisee's facilities in the public rights-of-way that is not
considered to be an emergency or danger to the public health, safety or
welfare, the city will provide the franchisee no less than three days notice
setting forth the violation and requesting correction.
   (M)   A franchisee shall ensure that it provides the city with plans,
revised as necessary, or "as-builts," that show the locations of the actual
installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way. The plans shall be in a
digitized format showing the two-dimensional location of the facilities based
on the city's geographical database, or other format acceptable to the city.
The franchisee shall provide such plans at no cost to the city. The city shall
maintain the confidentiality of such plans and any other information provided
in accordance with F.S. § 202.195, as it may be amended.
   (N)   The city reserves the right to place and maintain, and permit to be
placed or maintained, sewer, gas, water, electric, storm drainage,
communications, and other facilities, cables or conduit, and to do, and to
permit to be done, any underground and overhead installation or improvement
that may be deemed necessary or proper by the city in public rights-of-way
occupied by a franchisee. A franchisee may allow city facilities to be co-
located within the city's public rights-of-way through the use of a joint
trench during franchisee's construction project. Such joint trench projects
shall be negotiated in good faith by separate agreement between a franchisee
and city, and may be subjected to other city rights-of-way requirements. The
city further reserves, without limitation, the right to alter, change, or cause
to be changed, the grading, installation, relocation or width of the public
rights-of- way within the limits of the city and within said limits as the same
may from time to time be altered.
   (O)   The city shall have the right to install and maintain free of charge
upon any pole or in any conduit owned by a franchisee any wire or fixtures that
do not interfere unreasonably with a franchisee's operations, and the city may
be required to indemnify the franchisee, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, for all claims arising out of the city's use of the franchisee's poles and
conduits.
   (P)   To the extent that any person leases or otherwise uses facilities of a
franchisee, such person shall make no claim, nor assert any right, which will
impede the lawful exercise of the city's rights, including requiring the
removal of such facilities from the public rights-of-way of the city,
regardless of the effect on the person's ability to use the franchisee's
facilities in public rights-of-way of the city.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.17 SUSPENSION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Subject to this subchapter, the city may suspend a permit issued or
deny an application for a subsequent permit to a franchisee for work in the
public rights-of-way for one or more of the following:
      (1)   Failure to satisfy permit conditions, or conditions set forth in
this subchapter or other applicable city codes, regulations or orders governing
the public rights-of-way, including, without limitation, failure to take
reasonable safety precautions to alert the public of work at the work site, or
to restore any public rights-of-way;
      (2)   Misrepresentation or fraud by the franchisee;
      (3)   Failure to have a valid franchise; and/or
      (4)   Failure to relocate or to remove facilities as may be required by
the city.
   (B)   After the suspension or denial of a permit pursuant to this section,
the city shall provide notice of the reason to the franchisee. Upon correction
of any grounds that gave rise to a permit suspension or denial, the city may
lift the suspension or denial.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.18 CONSTRUCTION BOND.
   (A)   Prior to any construction, upgrade, rebuild or other significant work
in the public rights-of-way, a franchisee shall establish in the city's favor a
construction bond in an amount specified in the franchise agreement, permit, or
other authorization as necessary to ensure the franchisee's faithful
performance of the construction, upgrade, rebuild, or other work. The amount of
the construction bond shall be based on the nature of the construction to be
performed.
   (B)   In the event a franchisee subject to such a construction bond fails to
complete the construction in a safe, timely, and competent manner in accord
with the provisions of the franchise agreement, permit, or other requirement of
the city, there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal
and surety of the bond, any damages or loss suffered by the city as a result,
including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of
removal or abandonment of any property of the franchisee, or the cost of
completing or repairing the construction, plus a reasonable allowance for
attorneys' fees, up to the full amount of the bond. The city may also recover
against the bond any amount recoverable against the security fund pursuant to §
112.23, where such amount exceeds that available under the security fund.
   (C)   The franchise agreement, permit, or other authorization from the city
may specify that upon completion of the system construction, upgrade, rebuild,
or other work in the streets and payment of all construction obligations of the
cable system to the satisfaction of the city, the city may eliminate the bond
or reduce its amount. However, the city may subsequently require an increase in
the bond amount for any subsequent construction, upgrade, or other work.
   (D)   The construction bond shall be issued by a surety having a minimum
rating of A-1 in “Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition”; shall be
subject to the approval of the City Attorney; and shall provide that:
      "This bond may not be canceled, or allowed to lapse, until 60 days after
receipt by the city, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written
notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew."
   (E)   The rights reserved by the city with respect to any construction bond
established pursuant to this section are in addition to all other rights and
remedies the city may have under this subchapter, the franchise agreement, or
at law or equity.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)

(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.21 ACCESS CHANNELS AND FACILITIES.
   (A)   (1) At a minimum, all franchisees operating in the city shall provide

programming for purposes of this section), Monday through Friday, for six
consecutive weeks, the franchisee shall, without charge, at the request of the
city, provide the city with a third access channel. If at any time the first,
second and third access channels provided to the city by a franchisee are
programmed with non-duplicative programming during at least eight hours per
day, Monday through Friday, for six consecutive weeks, the franchisee shall,
without charge, at the written request of the city, provide the city with a
fourth access channel at no charge. In the event the programming on the access

the right to deactivate the subsequently provided access channels. The city may
by resolution adopt rules and regulations concerning use of the access channels
that are not inconsistent with federal law.
      (4)   The city may require in a franchise agreement that a franchisee
provide live cablecasting of City Commission meetings in their entirety to all
of the franchisee's subscribers located within the city. The city may require
the replay of such meetings at times specified by the city.

franchisee's studio facilities, equipment, and personnel for the production of
live and videotaped city programs, subject to reasonable availability and to
scheduling requirements of the franchisee.
      (2)   A franchisee shall provide, at the request of the city, use of the
franchisee's studio equipment and technical services for character generation
and cablecasting of such character generation on the access channels, subject
to reasonable availability and scheduling requirements of the franchisee.
      (3)   A franchise agreement may provide that upon the city's request, the
franchisee shall provide, at its cost, trained personnel and necessary
equipment for:
         (a)   Live cablecasting of events at the location of City Hall and
other specific locations within the city; and
         (b)   The production of videotapes of civic and government programs
and events that take place at locations other than the locations capable of
offering live programming. Such videotapes shall be played and replayed on the
access channels at times specified by the city.
         (c)   Live cablecasting may be facilitated with the interconnection
among franchisees pursuant to this subchapter. At the time of the city's
request for live cablecasting of city Commission meetings, the franchisee
serving the largest number of subscribers at the location of city hall shall be
responsible for live cablecasting production of professional quality, including
all necessary equipment and trained personnel. If requested by the franchisee
so responsible, all other franchisees shall share in the cost of producing and
delivering the live cablecasting to all subscribers on a pro-rata per
subscriber basis.
         (d)   In the event that the city changes the location of City
Commission meetings and desires to change the location where live cablecasting
occurs, the city may extend a franchisee's franchise agreement to allow the

terms of existing franchise agreements, the franchisees shall be required to
pay the city the assessed amount based on each franchisee's subscriber base in
the city, within 90 days of the city's notice.
   (E)   All facilities, equipment, services, and all other support to be
provided by a franchisee pursuant to this subchapter or a franchise agreement
shall constitute capital costs which are required to be incurred by the
franchisee for public, educational, or governmental access facilities within
the meaning of Section 622(g)(2)(c) of the Cable Act, 47 USC 542(g)(2)(c). Such
support grants do not constitute a franchise fee or tax within the meaning of
the Cable Act, state law, this subchapter, or any franchise agreement.

   (B)   All insurance policies shall be with sureties qualified to do business
in the state and shall be with sureties with a minimum rating of A in “Best's
Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition.” The city may require coverage and
amounts in excess of the above minimums where necessary to reflect changing
liability exposure and limits or where required by law.
   (C)   A franchisee shall keep on file with the city certificates of
insurance, which certificates shall indicate evidence of payment of the
required premiums and shall indicate that the city, its officers, boards,
commissions, City Commission members, agents, and employees are listed as
additional insureds. In the event of a potential claim such that the city
claims insurance coverage, the franchisee shall immediately respond to all
reasonable requests by the city for information with respect to the scope of
the insurance coverage.
   (D)   All insurance policies shall further provide that any cancellation or
reduction in coverage shall not be effective unless 30 days prior written
notice thereof has been given to the city. A franchisee shall not cancel any
required insurance policy without submission of proof that the franchisee has
obtained alternative insurance satisfactory to the city that complies with this
subchapter.
   (E)   A franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold
harmless, and defend the city, its officials, boards, commissions, City
Commission members, agents, and employees against any and all claims, suits,
causes of action, proceedings, judgments for damages or equitable relief, and
costs and expenses arising out of the construction, maintenance, or operation
of its cable system or open video system, the conduct of the franchisee's
business in the city or in any way arising out of the franchisee's enjoyment or
exercise of a franchise, regardless of whether the act or omission complained
of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by this subchapter or a franchise
agreement. In addition, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any
franchisee granted a renewal of a franchise on or after the effective date of
this subchapter shall indemnify and hold harmless the city, its officials,
boards, commissions, City Commission members, and agents or employees from any
claim arising under federal or state law. This provision includes, but is not
limited to, the city's reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending against
any such claim, suit, or proceedings; and claims arising out of copyright
infringements or a failure by the franchisee to secure consents from the
owners, authorized distributors, or providers of programs to be delivered by
the cable system or open video system, claims arising out of Section 638 of the
Cable Act, 47 USC 558, and claims against the franchisee for invasion of the
right of privacy, defamation of any person, or the violation or infringement of
any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent, or of any other
right of any person. The city agrees to notify the franchisee, in writing,
within ten days of the city receiving notice of any issue it determines may
require indemnification. Nothing in this subchapter shall prohibit the city
from participating in the defense of any litigation by its own counsel and at
its own cost.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.23 SECURITY FUND.
   (A)   The city shall require in a franchise agreement that the franchisee
post with the city a security fund. The fund may be in the form of a cash
deposit, letter of credit, or bond as agreed to in the franchise agreement. The
security fund will be used to ensure the franchisee's faithful performance of
and compliance with all provisions of this subchapter, the franchise agreement,
and other applicable law, and the payment by the franchisee of any claims,
liens, fees or taxes due the city which arise by reason of the construction,
operation or maintenance of the cable system or OVS. The amount of the security
fund shall be the amount that the city determines, under circumstances existing
at the time, that is necessary to protect the public, to provide adequate
incentive to the franchisee to comply with this subchapter and the franchise
agreement, and to enable the city to enforce effectively compliance therewith,
and, based on the city's prior experience in needing to draw on the security
fund submitted by a franchisee, the city finds that with respect to a franchise
agreement granted after the effective date of this subchapter, in no event
shall such fund be less than $200,000. The franchise agreement shall provide
for the procedures to be followed with respect to the security fund. Neither
the posting of the cash deposit or filing of an indemnity bond or any form of
surety bond with the city, nor the receipt of any damages recovered by the city
thereunder, shall be construed to excuse faithful performance by the franchisee
or limit the liability of the franchisee under the terms of its franchise for
damages, either to the full amount of the bond or otherwise.
   (B)   The rights reserved to the city with respect to the security fund are
in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by this
subchapter or authorized by other law or the franchise agreement, and no
action, proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund
will affect any other right the city may have.

traded, a copy of its most recent annual report;
      (8)   Upon request, a list of all persons who at the time of filing
control or hold 5% or more ownership or otherwise cognizable interest in the
franchisee pursuant to 47 CFR 76.501;
      (9)   A copy of the franchisee's rules and regulations applicable to
subscribers of the cable system or OVS;
      (10)   Upon request, a report on the number of senior citizens,
economically disadvantaged, or handicapped subscribers receiving any rate
discounts, the number of multiple dwelling buildings and property owners'
associations and units therein receiving any discount and the amount of any
such discounts for specific services if the franchisee offers separate rates or
discounts for those categories of subscribers;
      (11)   A full schedule and description of services, office and telephone
hours, and location of the franchisee's customer service offices available to
subscribers, and a schedule of all rates, fees, and charges for all services;
and
      (12)   A report on the number of total subscribers served by the
franchisee in the city, with a breakdown by the types of services received by
the subscribers.
   (B)   A franchisee shall provide, on an annual basis, the following
documents to the city as received or filed, without regard to whether the
documents are filed by the franchisee or an affiliate:
      (1)   Annual report of the franchisee or any affiliate of the franchisee
that controls the franchisee and issues an annual report;
      (2)   Upon the city's request, copyright filings reflecting the operation
of the system;
      (3)   Upon the city's request, FCC Forms 325 and 395A for the system, or
their successor forms;
      (4)   Any and all pleadings, petitions, applications, communications,

franchisee, provided, however, that any such notice or documents relating to an
affiliate of the franchisee need be provided only to the extent the same may
directly or indirectly affect the franchisee's operations in the city. For
example, a notice that an affiliate, which has a management contract for the
system in the city, was not in compliance with FCC EEO requirements would be
deemed to affect operations in the city;
      (6)   Any request for protection under bankruptcy laws, or any judgment
related to a declaration of bankruptcy; and
      (7)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, a franchisee shall
provide the city, within 30 days of filing or receipt of such, any document

   (C)   A franchisee shall make a complete set of books and records available

publicly available to the extent permitted by applicable law, including, but
not limited to, the state public records law. The city may inspect such
proprietary materials, but not copy or remove such materials, to the extent
permitted by law.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.25 COMPLIANCE WITH CONSUMER PROTECTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   To provide franchisees a reasonable opportunity to make necessary
changes to their operations, the consumer protection standards contained within
this subchapter will be enforced beginning 90 days after the effective date of
this subchapter.
   (B)   A franchisee shall comply with the consumer protection standards
contained in this subchapter during normal operating conditions. "Normal
operating conditions" means those service conditions that are within the
control of the franchisee. Those conditions that are not within the control of
the franchisee include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, civil
disturbances, power outages, telephone network outages, and severe or unusual
weather conditions. Those conditions that are ordinarily within the control of
the franchisee include, but are not limited to, special promotions, pay-per-
view events, rate increases, regular peak and seasonal demand periods, and
maintenance or upgrade of the cable system.
   (C)   A franchisee shall satisfy other consumer protection standards
established by the city from time to time by ordinance or by resolution. In
addition, a franchisee shall at all times comply with any additional or
stricter requirements established by applicable law including, without
limitation, FCC customer service standards and state and federal consumer
protection laws.
   (D)   The consumer protection standards contained in this subchapter shall
apply to open video systems to the extent permissible by applicable law. A
franchisee providing cable service via an open video system, or a cable
franchisee operator that complies with the consumer protection standards
applicable to cable systems may be certified by the city as "consumer friendly"
if the city determines that the franchisee is complying with the requirements
contained herein. The city may revoke the certification for failure to comply
with the standards, or if the city is unable to determine whether the
franchisee is in compliance.
   (E)   A franchisee shall maintain all parts of its system in good condition
and in accordance with standards generally observed by the cable television
industry. Sufficient employees shall be retained to provide safe, adequate, and
prompt service for all of its customers and facilities.
   (F)   (1)   A franchisee shall maintain designated representatives
responsible for resolving customer issues received by the city from residents.
A franchisee shall provide the city with current direct telephone numbers,
direct facsimile numbers and email addresses of representatives and their
supervisors designated to resolve customer issues received by the city for
referral to the franchisee. A franchisee shall provide the city with current
direct contact telephone numbers, facsimile numbers, and email addresses for
the general manager or equivalent employee with responsibility for operations
within the city and for management level personnel with responsibility for
customer installation, repair, and billing. Such telephone numbers shall
generally be answered by a live person capable of resolving customer issues
referred by the city.
      (2)   If the franchisee does not comply with divisions (C), (E) and F(1)
above, the franchisee shall have 30 days to cure such violation from the day
the franchisee receives notice of the violation. If the franchisee has not
cured the violation within 30 days, the city shall fine the franchisee for
violation of this section $100 per day for each day that the violation
continues. If there is a second violation of divisions (C), (E), or (F)(1)
within one year of a previous violation, and the franchisee does not cure such
violation within 30 days of the notice, the city shall fine the franchisee $250
per day for each day that the violation continues. The fines shall begin to
accrue on the first business day after the 30 day cure period has terminated.
      (3)   A franchisee shall respond to customer issues referred by the city
within 24 hours, and shall notify the city of the resolution or of its efforts
to resolve the customer issue referred by the city within five business days.
The city may develop a form for use by a franchisee in responding to customer
issues referred to a franchisee.
      (4)   If the franchisee does not comply with division (F)(3) above, the
franchisee shall have five business days to cure such violation from the day
the franchisee receives notice of such violation. If the franchisee has not
cured the violation within five days from such notice date, the city shall fine
a franchisee for violation of Subsection (F)(3) $100 per day for each day that
the violation continues. If there is a second violation of division (F)(3)
above within one year of a previous violation, and the franchisee does not cure
such violation within five days of the notice, the city shall fine the
franchisee $250 per day for each day that the violation continues. The fines
shall begin to accrue on the first business day after the five day cure period
has terminated.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.26 BUSINESS OFFICE.
   (A)   A franchisee shall maintain at least one conveniently located business
office and service center within the city limits under the name in which it
does business within the city. Consumers may make payments, obtain information,
return, pick up and exchange equipment, or conduct other business regarding
cable service at the business office. This business office shall be open at
minimum from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, and at least four
weekend and four evening hours. The city may waive temporarily a franchisee's
obligation to have an office within the city if the franchisee provides other
methods for providing convenient services to its customers. As an alternative
to maintaining an office within the city, a franchisee may maintain an office
within five miles of the city provided the franchisee maintains a location
within the city where subscribers may make payments without additional charge,
and the city determines that the franchisee is otherwise able to respond
conveniently to consumers' requests.
   (B)   If the franchisee does not comply with this section, the franchisee
shall have 30 days to cure the violation from the day the franchisee receives
notice of the violation. If the franchisee has not cured the violation within
30 days from such notice date, the city shall fine a franchisee for violation
of this section $500 per day for each day that the violation continues. The
fines shall begin to accrue on the first business day after the 30 day cure
period has terminated.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.27 TOLL-FREE TELEPHONE NUMBER; ANSWERING TIME STANDARDS.
   (A)   Franchisees or their affiliates shall maintain a listed, toll-free
telephone number under the business name familiar to consumers and employ a
sufficient number of telephone lines, personnel, and answering equipment or
service to allow reasonable access by subscribers and members of the public to
contact the franchisee on a full-time basis, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week,
including holidays. Knowledgeable, qualified franchisee representatives will be
available to respond to customer telephone inquiries, 24 hours per day, 7 days
per week, including holidays.
   (B)   If the franchisee does not comply with this section, the franchisee
shall have 30 days to cure such violation from the day the franchisee receives
notice of such violation. If the franchisee has not cured the violation within
30 days from such notice date, the city shall fine a franchisee for violation
of this section $500 per day for each day that the violation continues. The
fine shall begin to accrue on the first business day after the 30 day cure
period has terminated.
   (C)   A franchisee shall answer all customer service and repair telephone
calls made under normal operating conditions within 30 seconds, including wait
time and within an additional 30 seconds to transfer the call. Customers shall
receive a busy signal less than 3% of the time. To the extent technically
feasible, these standards should be measured with respect to telephone calls
coming from residents of the city. The phrase "of the time" refers to the
percentage of calls to a franchisee. As an example, if 100 customers call a
franchisee, fewer than 3 callers should receive a busy signal. These standards
shall be met no less than 90% of the time under normal operating conditions,
measured on a quarterly basis.
   (D)   If a franchisee fails to meet these standards on a quarterly basis,
the franchisee shall track the telephone answer time standards on a daily
basis, beginning with the first day following the end of the quarter for which
the franchisee fails to satisfy these standards. The franchisee shall submit to
the city data measuring its compliance with the standards set forth herein.
Quarterly results will be submitted to the city no later than the 25th day of
the month following the end of the preceding quarter. If a franchisee has
satisfied the telephone answering standards set forth herein for a continuous
period of one year, upon the franchisee's request, the city may relieve a
franchisee of its obligation to provide such data measuring compliance with
these standards and provide that the franchisee will provide such data upon the
city's request. If a franchisee must track results on a daily basis, the
franchisee shall provide such daily results to the city on every Friday for the
preceding week until resolved to the city's satisfaction.
   (E)   (1)   If a franchisee violates the telephone answering standards
contained herein for any quarter, the city may require the franchisee to
provide the city with a communication traffic study within 30 days of notice or
longer reasonable time period required by the city. The study will be conducted
on all customer service trunk lines and must include information on the
efficiency of the communications system measured from the telephone company's
central office, as well as other performance information available from the
franchisee's communication equipment. The study must provide information that
confirms the franchisee's communications system is properly trunked and staffed
to meet the requirements of this section using generally accepted telephonic
engineering standards.
      (2)   Based upon the findings of the traffic study that additional
personnel or equipment is needed and other relevant considerations, the city
may require the franchisee to staff a minimum specified number of customer
service representatives or to add particular equipment to handle telephone
calls to the extent permitted by applicable law. If the city requires staffing
or additional equipment, the city and the franchisee shall determine the
minimum number of customer service representatives and equipment necessary to
allow the franchisee to meet the telephone answer standards contained in this
section. For purposes of this calculation, the number of calls received daily
shall be the median number of calls received on a daily basis for the quarter
during which the standards were not met.
      (3)   In addition to other remedies specified in this section, the city
shall fine a franchisee for violation of the standards set forth in this
section. If the telephone standards in division (C) above are not satisfied for
any one quarter, the franchisee shall have 30 days to cure such violation from
the first business day after receipt of a notice of violation from the city. If
the franchisee fails to cure its violation of the telephone standards in
subsection A 30 days from such date, based on the franchisee's daily
measurement as required by subsection B, the city shall fine a franchisee $250
per day for each day that the violation continues. If a franchisee has a
subsequent violation of division (C) above within one year of a violation that
resulted in a fine, and the franchisee fails to cure the violation within the
time period required herein, the city shall fine the franchisee $500 per day
for each day that the violation continues. If the franchisee does not comply
with divisions (D) and (E) above, the franchisee shall have five days to cure
such violation from the day the franchisee receives notice of such violation.
If the franchisee has not cured the violation within five business days from
such notice date, the city shall fine a franchisee for violation of this
section $500 per day for each day that the violation continues. The fine shall
begin to accrue on the first business day after the 5-day cure period has
terminated.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.28 INSTALLATION AND SERVICE STANDARDS.
   (A)   A franchisee shall employ and maintain sufficient qualified personnel
and equipment to be available:
      (1)   To accept payments and exchange or accept equipment;
      (2)   To receive subscriber complaints or requests for service or repairs
on a full-time basis, 24 hours per day, seven days per week;

hours; and/or
      (4)   To enable a technician to respond to service calls 24 hours per

from the same active electronic device, such as an amplifier or node, call with
a complaint.
   (B)   The franchisee must meet each of the following standards no less than
95% percent of the time under normal operating conditions as measured on a
quarterly basis:
      (1)   Standard installation work shall be performed within seven calendar
days after an order has been placed, except in those instances where a
subscriber specifically requests an installation date beyond the 7 calendar day
period. "Standard" installations are up to 125 feet from the existing
distribution system. Installation requests shall be completed within 120 days
of a request where an extension of over 125 feet and up to one-half mile is
required and within 180 days where an extension of over one-half mile is
required. If scheduled installation is neither started nor completed as
scheduled, unless due to the customer's fault, an employee of the franchisee
will telephone the subscriber the same day. Evening personnel shall also
attempt to call subscribers at their homes between the hours of 5:30 and 8:00
p.m. If the call to the subscriber is not answered, an employee of the
franchisee shall telephone the subscriber the next day.
      (2)   The franchisee will respond to service interruptions promptly and
in no event later than 24 hours after the interruption becomes known. Other
requests for service will be responded to promptly and in no event later than
48 hours after the initial request. All service interruptions and service
problems within the control of the franchisee will be corrected within 72 hours
after a complaint.
      (3)   The appointment window alternatives made available for
installations, service calls, repairs, and other installation activities will
be either a specific time, a four-hour or less block of time during normal
business hours, or if requested by the subscriber, "all day." The franchisee's
scheduling options shall be clearly explained to subscribers at the time of the
scheduling.
      (4)   The franchisee may not cancel an appointment with a subscriber
after 5:00 pm on the business day prior to the scheduled appointment.
   (C)   If at any time an installer or technician is running late for a
scheduled appointment, an attempt to contact the customer will be made and the
appointment rescheduled as necessary at a time which is convenient for the
customer. Subscribers who have experienced one missed installation or service
appointment due to the franchisee's fault shall receive standard installation
free of charge. If the installation was to have been provided free of charge or
if the appointment was for service or repair, the subscriber shall receive a
credit of not less than $20.
   (D)   With regard to subscribers with disabilities, upon a subscriber's
request, a franchisee will arrange for pickup and/or replacement of converters
or other equipment at the subscriber's address or by a satisfactory equivalent
(such as the provision of a postage-prepaid mailer), without a special charge.
   (E)   If the standards of divisions (A) or (B) above are not met, the
franchisee shall have 30 days to cure such violation from the first business
day after receipt of a notice of violation by the city. In addition, a
franchisee shall begin to measure the standards of division (B) above on a
daily basis following the last day of the quarter during which the standards
were not satisfied. If the franchisee is not in compliance 30 days from such
date as required herein, the city shall fine a franchisee for violation of
divisions (A) and (B) above a maximum of $500 per day for each day that the
violation continues. The city shall fine a franchisee for violation of
divisions (C) and (D) above $250 per day for each day that the violation
continues. The fines shall begin to accrue on the first business day after the
30 day cure period has terminated.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.29 DISCONNECTION AND DOWNGRADES.
   (A)   (1) A subscriber may terminate or downgrade service at any time. No
charges for service may be made after the subscriber requests disconnection or
downgrade. No period of notice before voluntary termination or downgrade of
cable service may be required of subscribers. There will be no charge for
disconnection, except for a collection fee authorized by applicable law, and
any downgrade charges will conform to applicable law. This section does not
apply to promotional contracts or bulk contracts where a subscriber received an
actual discount from standard rates for a multi-month contract, so long as:
         (a)   The disconnect fee plus the amount paid by the customer is no
higher than the amount the customer would have paid for service actually
received before the disconnect request at the franchisee's prevailing rates for
the service;
         (b)   The disconnect fee was stated prominently and in writing, and
provided to the customer before the customer began taking service; and
         (c)   The subscriber was given the option of disconnecting without a
disconnect fee within the first 15 days after subscriber began receiving the
discounted service.
      (2)   Any security deposit and/or other funds, including interest, due a
subscriber that disconnects or downgrades service will be returned to the
subscriber within 45 days from the date disconnection or downgrade was
requested, except in cases where the subscriber does not permit the franchisee
to recover its equipment, in which case the amounts owed will be paid to
subscribers within 45 days of the date the equipment was recovered.
      (3)   A subscriber that requests to terminate a promotional offer or
requests to return to the prior level of service after the promotion ends shall
be able to do so without paying any additional charges or being required to
obtain additional equipment at the subscriber's cost.
   (B)   (1)   A franchisee may disconnect a subscriber's service for non-
payment if:
         (a)   The subscriber is delinquent in payment for cable service;
         (b)   A written notice of impending disconnection, postage prepaid,
has been sent to the subscriber after the due date of the bill, and at least
ten days before the date on which service may be disconnected, at the premises
where the subscriber requests billing, which notice must identify the name and
address of the subscriber whose account is delinquent, state the date by which
disconnection may occur if payment is not made, and the amount the subscriber
must pay to avoid disconnection, and a telephone number of a representative of
the franchisee who can provide additional information concerning and handle
complaints or initiate an investigation concerning the services and charges in
question;
         (c)   The subscriber fails to pay the amounts owed to avoid
disconnection by the date of disconnection which must be at least 35 days after
the due date of the subscriber's monthly bill or other charge; and
         (d)   No pending inquiry exists regarding the bill that the subscriber
has failed to pay to which the franchisee has not responded in writing, if the
subscriber inquiry was in writing, or via telephone or in writing if the
subscriber inquiry was via telephone.
      (2)   A subscriber is not delinquent in payment for a bill until after
the date a late fee could be imposed on that bill.
      (3)   Service may only be disconnected on days in which the subscriber
can reach a representative of the franchisee either in person or by telephone
to make a payment on the account.
      (4)   After disconnection, upon payment by the subscriber in full of all
proper fees or charges, including the payment of the reconnection charge, if
any, the franchisee will reinstate service within five business days, except as
otherwise provided in this subchapter below.
   (C)   A franchisee may immediately disconnect a subscriber if:
      (1)   The subscriber is damaging, destroying or unlawfully tampering with
or has damaged or destroyed or unlawfully tampered with the franchisee's cable
system;
      (2)   The subscriber is not authorized to receive service and is
receiving and/or is facilitating, aiding or abetting the unauthorized receipt
of service by others; or
      (3)   Subscriber-installed or attached equipment is resulting in signal
leakage in violation of FCC rules.
   (D)   Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to prevent the
franchisee from removing its property from a subscriber's premises upon the
termination of service consistent with FCC rules and any other applicable Law.
At the subscriber's request, a franchisee shall remove all of its facilities
and equipment from the subscriber's premises within 30 calendar days of the
subscriber's request. Where removal is impractical, such as with buried cable
or internal wiring, facilities and equipment may be disconnected and abandoned
rather than removed, unless there is a written agreement stating otherwise,
provided, however, that the agreement must be consistent with applicable law
and FCC rules. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, a franchisee shall
comply with all FCC rules as now or hereafter may be amended with respect to
subscribers' rights and interests including, but not limited to, right to
purchase and determination of ownership of cable wiring and equipment.
   (E)   If a franchisee does not comply with this section, the franchisee
shall have 30 days to cure such violation from the day the franchisee receives
notice of such violation. If the franchisee has not cured the violation within
30 days from such notice date, the city shall fine a franchisee for violation
of this section $100 per day for each day that the violation continues. If a
franchisee has a subsequent violation of this section within one year of a
violation that resulted in a fine, and the franchisee fails to cure the
violation within the time period required herein, the city shall fine the
franchisee $500 per day for each day that the violation continues. Fines shall
begin to accrue on the first business day after the 30 day cure period has
terminated.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.30 SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS.
   (A)   The franchisee shall intentionally interrupt service only for good
cause and for the shortest time possible. The franchisee shall use its best
efforts to ensure that the interruptions shall occur during the least
inconvenient times for subscribers that shall be the period between 1:00 a.m.
and 6:00 a.m., if practicable. The franchisee shall maintain and make available
to the city a written log for all intentional service interruptions.

interruption is major, i.e., affects 50 or more subscribers for a time period
greater than four hours. The city may establish procedures for such
notification after normal business hours.
   (C)   If the franchisee does not comply with this section, the franchisee
shall have 30 days to cure the violation from the day the franchisee receives
notice of the violation. If the franchisee has not cured the violation within
30 days from such notice date, the city shall fine a franchisee for violation
of this section $500 per day for each day that the violation continues. The

§ 112.31 FRANCHISEE IDENTIFICATION.
   (A)   The franchisee shall cause all its field employees and field contract
workers to wear a picture identification badge indicating that they work for

public rights-of-way where the work involves cutting or trenching, or requires
more than one hour to perform, each franchisee will post a sign that
prominently displays the name under which the franchisee is doing business in
the city, and the franchisee's telephone number.
   (D)   The telephone number posted must be a local or toll free number. The
phone must connect to persons trained to receive and respond to calls regarding
employees, construction and problems (including repair problems) associated
with construction.

shall have 30 days to cure such violation from the day the franchisee receives
notice of such violation. If the franchisee has not cured the violation within

§ 112.32 COMPLAINT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   A franchisee shall develop written procedures for the investigation
and resolution of all subscriber or city resident complaints, including, but
not limited to, those regarding the quality of service and equipment
malfunction, which procedures shall be subject to the review and approval by
the city. A subscriber or city resident who has not been satisfied by following
the franchisee's procedures may file a written complaint with the city, which
will investigate the matter and, in consultation with the franchisee as
appropriate, attempt to resolve the matter. The city shall consider a
franchisee's good faith or lack thereof in attempting to resolve subscriber and
resident complaints in a fair and equitable manner in connection with the
franchisee's renewal application.
   (B)   The franchisee shall maintain a complete list of all complaints not
resolved within seven days of receipt and the measures taken to resolve them.
This list shall be compiled in a form to be approved by the city. It shall be
compiled on a monthly basis. The list for each calendar month shall be supplied
to the city no later than the 15th day of the next month. The franchisee shall
also maintain a list of all complaints received for a period of 24 months,
which list will be available to the city.
   (C)   A subscriber or other person with a claim in law or equity against a
franchisee may also file an appropriate action in a court of competent
jurisdiction. A franchisee's policies and procedures with respect to customers'
complaints shall not have the effect of prohibiting a subscriber or other
person from pursuing any claim for relief in law or equity in a court of
competent jurisdiction. This code, including this subchapter, state and
applicable federal law, shall govern a franchisee's customer service policies
and procedures. Nothing herein shall prohibit a franchisee from defending to
the full extent allowed by applicable law any claim brought by any person.
   (D)   If a franchisee does not comply with divisions (B) or (C) above, the
franchisee shall have 30 days to cure the violation from the day the franchisee
receives notice of the violation. If the franchisee has not cured the violation
within 30 days from the notice date, the city shall fine a franchisee for
violation of this section $250 per day for each day that the violation
continues. The fines shall begin to accrue on the first business day after the

§ 112.33 COMMUNICATIONS WITH CUSTOMERS AND BILLING.
   The franchisee shall abide by the following requirements governing
communications with customers, bills, and refunds:
   (A)   Each franchisee shall provide to subscribers written information about
each of the following at the time of installation, at least once annually, and
thereafter at any future time upon request of a subscriber:
      (1)   How to use the cable service;
      (2)   Installation and service maintenance policies;
      (3)   The products and services offered;
      (4)   Prices and service options;
      (5)   Channel positions of programming carried on the system;
      (6)   The franchisee's procedures for the receipt and resolution of
complaints;
      (7)   The franchisee's address of all business offices within the city
and telephone number to which complaints may be reported, and the hours of
operation;
      (8)   The telephone number and address of the city's office and the
city's office designated to handle cable television complaints and inquiries
shall be printed on the bill;
      (9)   The availability of a parental control device and services or
specialized equipment available to subscribers with disabilities, and the
conditions and costs to obtain such devices and/or services; and/or
      (10)   Franchisee's information collection and disclosure policies for
the protection of subscribers' privacy.
   (B)   At the request of the city, a franchisee shall provide written notice
to all subscribers of any city meeting regarding the franchisee's renewal,
transfer, or modification of its franchise. The city shall make such a request
in writing, no less than 30 days prior to the mailing of any billing by the
franchisee. Said notices shall be made at the franchisee's expense, and said
expense shall not be considered part of the franchise fee assessed pursuant to
this subchapter and shall not be regarded as a franchise fee, as the term is
defined in Section 622 of the Cable Act, 47 USC 542.
   (C)   The franchisee's bills to subscribers will be clear, concise, and
understandable. All charges shall be separately itemized on the bill.
   (D)   Refund checks will be issued promptly, but no later than the earlier
of 30 days or the subscriber's next billing cycle following the resolution of a
refund request, or the return of the equipment supplied by the franchisee if
service is terminated.
   (E)   Credits for service will be issued no later than the subscriber's next
billing cycle following the determination that a credit is warranted.
   (F)   A franchisee shall provide subscribers and the city with at least 30
days advance written notice of any changes in rates, charges, channel lineup,
change in subscriber procedures and policies, or initiations or
discontinuations or changes of service or services offered over the cable
system within the control of the franchisee. Notice to subscribers and the city
of such changes not within the control of the franchisee shall be provided as
quickly as practicable.
   (G)   (1)   The franchisee's first billing statement after a new
installation or service change shall be pro- rated as appropriate, and shall
reflect any security deposit.
      (2)   The franchisee's billing statement must be fully itemized, with
itemizations including, but not limited to, basic and premium service charges
and equipment charges. Bills will also clearly delineate all activity during
the billing period, including optional charges, rebates and credits.
      (3)   The franchisee's billing statement must show a specific due date
not earlier than ten days after the date the statement is mailed or ten days
after the beginning of the service period. If the franchisee charges a late fee
or administrative fee, the bill must show the date after which the fees will be
imposed and the amount. Any balance not received within 15 days after the due
date may be assessed an administrative charge as a late fee. Any administrative
charge imposed as a "late fee" must be reasonable and must be limited to a fair
approximation of the actual cost of handling and collecting the customer bill.
Franchisees shall use late fees for cost recovery only and not as a tool of
profit for the collection of additional revenues, or as a penalty or deterrent.
Any late fee charged to subscribers in excess of $5 per billing period is
presumed to be unreasonable, and the franchisee shall bear the burden of
proving that any such late fee is reasonable, consistent with applicable law.
         (a)   Any administrative charge applied to unpaid bills shall be
subject to regulation by the city consistent with applicable law.
         (b)   Subscribers shall not be charged an administrative fee or a late
fee, or be otherwise penalized for any failure by the franchisee, its
employees, or contractors, to bill the subscriber timely and correctly or to
credit properly the subscriber for a payment timely made.
         (c)   With respect to the majority of cases in which late fees are
imposed, the calendar day prior to the date a late fee is imposed must be a day
on which the franchisee's local business office is scheduled to be open and on
which mail will be delivered.
         (d)   In the event of a billing dispute, the franchisee shall not
charge a late fee while the dispute is pending.
      (4)   The franchisee must notify the subscriber that he or she can remit
payment in person at the franchisee's office and must inform the subscriber of
the address of that office.
   (H)   If the franchisee does not comply with this section, the franchisee
shall have 30 days to cure such violation from the day the franchisee receives
notice of such violation. If the franchisee has not cured the violation within
30 days from such notice date, the city shall fine a franchisee for violation
of this section $250 per day for each day that the violation continues. If a
franchisee has a subsequent violation of this section within one year of a
violation that resulted in a fine, and the franchisee fails to cure the
violation within the time period required herein, the city shall fine the
franchisee $500 per day for each day that the violation continues. The fines
shall begin to accrue on the first business day after the 30 day cure period
has terminated.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.34 SERVICE CREDITS FOR OUTAGES.
   (A)   A franchisee shall credit a subscriber's account a minimum of 1/30 of
the monthly charge for service upon request if a subscriber is without service
or if service is substantially impaired for any reason, except caused by the
subscriber, for a minimum of 3 to less than 24 hours. In the event of a service
interruption for 24 hours or longer, upon a subscriber's request, a franchisee
shall credit the subscriber's account a minimum of 10% of a subscriber's
monthly bill. Service interruption includes the loss of picture or sound on one
or more channels or, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, the
loss of cable modem internet service provided by a franchisee.
   (B)   A subscriber shall be deemed to have requested a credit if the
subscriber requests a credit or complains about a service interruption within
45 days of the outage.
   (C)   A subscriber shall also be deemed to have requested a credit unless at
least quarterly the franchisee provides each subscriber a notice with the
following text, prominently displayed:
   "WE ARE REQUIRED TO GIVE YOU A CREDIT IF YOUR SERVICE WAS OUT OR IMPAIRED
FOR THREE HOURS OR MORE DURING ANY DAY. YOU MUST CALL OR WRITE US TO REQUEST
THIS CREDIT WITHIN 45 DAYS OF THE DATE OF THE SERVICE OUTAGE OR IMPAIRMENT."
   (D)   For subscribers who do not receive an individual bill and receive
service pursuant to a contract with a home owners or condominium association, a
franchisee shall provide credit, as required in this subchapter, to the
association, provided such credit does not conflict with the provisions of any
such contract or applicable law. The credit provided to such association shall
be based on the number of subscribers entitled to the credit. By way of
example, if a 3 hour outage affects 50 individual subscribers within a home
owners association, the franchisee shall provide the association with a credit
of, at a minimum, 1/30 of the monthly charge to all 50 subscribers. In
providing such a credit to an association, the franchisee shall provide the
association with the names and addresses of the subscribers for whom the credit
was issued.
   (E)   If a franchisee does not comply with this section, the franchisee
shall have 30 days to cure the violation from the day the franchisee receives
notice of the violation. If the franchisee has not cured the violation within
30 days from such notice date, the city shall fine a franchisee for violation
of this section $250 per day for each day that the violation continues. If a
franchisee has a subsequent violation of this section within one year of a
violation that resulted in a fine, and the franchisee fails to cure the
violation within the time period required herein, the city shall fine the
franchisee $500 per day for each day that the violation continues. The fines
shall begin to accrue on the first business day after the 30 day cure period
has terminated.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.35 ALTERATION OF SERVICE.
   A franchisee may not substantially alter the service being provided to a
subscriber (including by re- tiering, restructuring a tier, or otherwise)
without the express permission of such subscriber, unless it complies with this
section.
   (A)   Any time a franchisee intends to alter the service being provided to a
subscriber (including by re- tiering, restructuring a tier, or otherwise) in
such a way that the subscriber will no longer be able to obtain the same
package of services in the same manner and at the same cost, the franchisee
must provide the subscriber with 30 days written notice of the alteration. The
notice shall explain the substance and the full effect of the alteration and
provide the subscriber the right, within the 30-day period following notice, to
opt to receive any combination of services offered by the franchisee. A
subscriber that requests to terminate a promotional offer or requests to return
to the prior level of service after the promotion ends shall be able to do so
without paying any additional charges or being required to obtain additional
equipment at the subscriber's cost.
   (B)   Except as provided herein or under applicable law, no charge may be
made for any service or product which the subscriber has not requested
affirmatively by name, in a manner separate and apart from payment of the
regular monthly bill, that the subscriber wishes to receive. A subscriber's
request may be made orally or in writing, but it is the franchisee's burden to
show that an affirmative request was made.
   (C)   Within seven days of a subscriber's request, a franchisee shall fully
block or scramble any channel that is not included within the services
purchased by the subscriber so as to prevent signal bleed, at no cost to the
subscriber.
   (D)   If the franchisee does not comply with this section, the franchisee
shall have 30 days to cure such violation from the day the franchisee receives
notice of such violation. If the franchisee has not cured the violation within
30 days from such notice date, the city shall fine a franchisee for violation
of this section $500 per day for each day that the violation continues. The
fines shall begin to accrue on the first business day after the 30 day period
has terminated.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.36 DUTY OF FRANCHISEE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE STAFF AND EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   The failure of the franchisee to hire sufficient staff or to train
properly its staff will not justify a franchisee's failure to comply with any
provision hereof.
   (B)   The franchisee must have sufficient trucks, tools, testing equipment,
monitoring devices and other equipment and facilities and the trained and
skilled personnel required so that the franchisee complies with each and every
requirement of applicable law, including applicable customer service
requirements, technical standards, maintenance standards and requirements for
responding to outages. This includes the facilities, equipment and staff
required to:
      (1)   Properly test the system and conduct an ongoing and active program
of preventive maintenance and quality control; and
      (2)   Be able to quickly respond to customer complaints and resolve
problems.
   (C)   The franchisee must install and maintain equipment necessary to
measure its performance with applicable consumer protection standards that the
city may adopt from time to time after providing the franchisee the opportunity
to comment; except that the franchisee may obtain relief temporarily from this
requirement if it shows that:
      (1)   It has a high level of subscriber satisfaction;
      (2)   There are alternative, adequate ways to review its performance; or
      (3)   For other good cause shown.
   (D)   Knowledgeable, qualified representatives shall be available to respond
to customer telephone inquiries, in, at a minimum, English and Spanish
languages. Any automated answering equipment will provide at least English and
Spanish language alternatives. When a customer speaking Spanish schedules
service calls, the franchisee shall offer to have the service call made by a
representative speaking Spanish.
   (E)   If the franchisee does not comply with this section, the franchisee
shall have 30 days to cure the violation from the day the franchisee receives
notice of the violation. If the franchisee has not cured the violation within
30 days from such notice date, the city shall fine a franchisee for violation
of this section $100 per day for each day that the violation continues. The
fines shall begin to accrue on the first business day after the 30 day cure
period has terminated.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.37 SUBSCRIBER PRIVACY.
   (A)   A franchisee shall at all times protect the privacy of all subscribers
to the full extent required by Section 631 of the Cable Act, 47 USC 551, and
applicable law. The franchisee shall comply with all applicable law regarding
collecting, storing and disseminating of individual subscriber information, and
shall operate the system in a manner that protects against invasions of any
person's privacy and protects the privacy of data services and data signals
distributed over the system. Unless otherwise permitted by applicable law, a
franchisee shall not sell or otherwise make available for commercial purposes
the name, address, and telephone number of any subscriber, or any information
that identifies the individual viewing habits of the subscriber, without the
involved subscriber's written consent.
   (B)   If the franchisee does not comply with this section, the franchisee
shall have 30 days to cure the violation from the day the franchisee receives
notice of such violation. If the franchisee has not cured the violation within
30 days from such notice date, the city shall fine a franchisee for violation
of this section $500 per day for each day that the violation continues. The
fines shall begin to accrue on the first business day after the 30 day cure
period has terminated.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.38 DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITED.
   (A)   A franchisee operating a cable system or OVS shall not deny service
nor discriminate in its rates or charges or in the availability of the service
or facilities of its system, or in any other respect, or make or grant undue
preferences or advantages to any subscriber, potential subscriber, or group of
subscribers or potential subscribers, nor subject any such persons or group of
persons to any undue prejudice or any disadvantage. A franchisee shall not
deny, delay, or otherwise burden service or discriminate against subscribers or
users on the basis of age, race, creed, religion, color, sex, sexual
orientation, handicap, national origin, marital status, or political
affiliation, except for discounts for senior citizens, the economically
disadvantaged, or handicapped that are applied in a uniform and consistent
manner. A franchisee may also offer promotional discounts to subscribers and
bulk discounts to multiple dwelling buildings and property owners' associations
to the extent such discounts are otherwise permissible by law.
   (B)   A franchisee shall not deny cable service, offer different services,
or charge different rates to any potential subscribers because of the income of
the residents of the local area in which such subscribers reside.
   (C)   A franchisee shall not refuse to employ, nor discharge from
employment, nor discriminate against any person in compensation or in terms,
conditions, or privileges of employment because of age, race, creed, religion,
color, sex, sexual orientation, disability, national origin, marital status, or
political affiliation. The franchisee shall comply with applicable law
governing equal employment opportunities, as the same may be from time to time
amended.
   (D)   If the franchisee does not comply with this section, the franchisee
shall have 30 days to cure the violation from the day the franchisee receives
notice of the violation. If the franchisee has not cured the violation within
30 days from such notice date, the city shall fine a franchisee for violation
of this section $500 per day for each day that the violation continues. The
fines shall begin to accrue on the first business day after the 30 day cure
period has terminated.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.39 CONTINUATION OF SERVICE MANDATORY.
   (A)   It is the right of all subscribers obtaining cable service legally to
receive all available services requested from the franchisee as long as their
financial and other obligations to the franchisee are satisfied.
   (B)   In the event of a termination of a franchise for whatever reason, the
franchisee shall ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted
service regardless of the circumstances. The franchisee shall cooperate with
the city to continue the operation of the system for a period following
termination as necessary to maintain continuity of service to all subscribers.
The period shall not exceed six months without the franchisee's written
consent. During such period, the cable system shall be operated under such
terms and conditions as the city and the franchisee may agree, or such other
terms and conditions that will continue, to the extent possible, the same level
of service to subscribers and that will provide reasonable compensation to the
cable operator.
   (C)   In the event a franchisee fails to operate the system for seven
consecutive days without prior approval of the city or without just cause, the
city may, at its option, operate the system or designate another person to
operate the system until such time as the franchisee restores service under
conditions acceptable to the city or until a permanent new franchisee is
selected. If the city is required to fulfill this obligation for the
franchisee, the franchisee shall reimburse the city for all costs or damages
resulting from the franchisee's failure to perform that are in excess of the
revenues from the system received by the city. Additionally, the franchisee
will cooperate with the city to allow city employees and/or city agents access
to the franchisees' facilities and premises for purposes of continuing system
operations as described herein.
   (D)   If the franchisee does not comply with this section, the franchisee
shall have 30 days to cure such violation from the day the franchisee receives
notice of such violation. If the franchisee has not cured the violation within
30 days from such notice date, the city shall fine a franchisee for violation

period has terminated.

and installation shall comply with applicable law. Upon written request from
the city or its agent, the franchisee shall provide all requested data, records
and documentation to show the compliance of the rates with applicable law.
Where such information is designated proprietary and confidential, it shall not
be copied or removed or otherwise subject to public inspection, to the extent
the city is permitted to protect such information from public inspection under
applicable law.

§ 112.41 EXCLUSIVE CONTRACTS.

obtaining or continuing cable service. Notwithstanding this section, a
franchisee may enter into an exclusive contract with a subscriber, property
owner, or property manager, provided such contract is mutually desired and not
prohibited under applicable law.
   (B)   A franchisee's contract for service shall not provide that the length
of the term of the contract shall be the length of a franchise agreement or for
as long as the franchisee has the legal authority to provide service in the
city.
   (C)   If the franchisee does not comply with this section, the franchisee
shall have 30 days to cure such violation from the day the franchisee receives

violation continues. The fines shall begin to accrue on the first business day
after the 30 day cure period has terminated.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.42 CUSTOMER SERVICE PLANNING.
   (A)   A franchisee shall develop an affirmative plan for measuring customer
satisfaction; identifying best practices in delivery of customer service;
internally assessing the franchisee's response to customer demands; and
translating those assessments into customer-driven quality improvements. Each
franchisee holding a franchise as of the effective date of this subchapter
shall provide the plan to the city within 90 days of the effective date of this
subchapter. A person who receives a franchise after the effective date of this

August 1 of each year that, based upon internal due diligence by the franchisee
and to the best of the franchisee's knowledge, it is in substantial compliance
with the consumer protection standards set forth in this subchapter. At the
request of the city, the franchisee shall submit such documentation as may be
required to demonstrate the franchisee's compliance with this subchapter. This

§ 112.44 ADMINISTRATION OF CONSUMER PROTECTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   The City Manager or designee (when used herein "City Manager" shall
mean the City Manager or designee) shall have the responsibility for the
administration of the consumer protection standards contained in this
subchapter. Such responsibility shall include the resolution of all complaints
against a franchisee regarding the quality of service, billing matters,
equipment malfunctions, and all other customer matters. The City Manager's
authority includes the authority to order refunds or fines. The city manager
may settle or compromise any controversy arising from operations of the
franchisee, either on behalf of the city, the franchisee, or any subscriber, in
accordance with the best interests of the public.
   (B)   Any decision made by the City Manager shall be provided to the
franchisee in writing. The franchisee shall have ten days from receipt of such
written decision to respond in writing to such decision.
   (C)   In cases where requests for service have been ignored or where the
service provided is unsatisfactory for any reason, the City Manager shall have
the power to require the franchisee to provide service if in the opinion of the
City Manager, such request for service is reasonable.
   (D)   A franchisee shall cooperate with the City Manager to provide the City
Manager with access to subscriber complaints or other matters received by the
franchisee from residents of the city. If technically feasible and not
inconsistent with applicable law, the franchisee shall provide the city with
technology that allows the City Manager to access subscriber records from a
computer within the City Manager's Office. If a franchisee establishes a web
site through which customers can send complaints and receive responses to the
franchisee, the franchisee shall cooperate with the city to provide the City
Manager technology to have access to such complaints.
   (E)   Any person aggrieved by a decision of the City Manager, including the
franchisee, may appeal the matter to the City Commission. The aggrieved person
shall have ten days from receiving the written decision of the City Manager to
file a written appeal to the City Commission. No interest or late charge shall
accrue during the pendency of such appeal. The City Commission may accept,
reject, or modify the decision of the City Manager, based upon a review of the
information provided. No adjustment, settlement, or compromise, whether
instituted by the City Manager or by the Commission, shall be contrary to the
provisions of this subchapter or any franchise agreement issued pursuant to
this subchapter, and neither the City Manager nor the Commission, in the
adjustment, settlement, or compromise of any controversy, shall have the right
or authority to add to, modify, or delete any provision of this subchapter or
of the franchise agreement, or to interfere with any rights of subscribers or
any franchisee under applicable law or private contract. Any person aggrieved
by a decision of the City Commission, including a franchisee or a subscriber,
may appeal the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction within the county.
In addition, nothing herein shall prohibit a person from pursuing any claim for
relief against a franchisee in a court of competent jurisdiction and the
remedies available to a subscriber herein are in addition to any other
remedies, at law or equity, a subscriber may have.
(Ord. 1406, passed 5-15-02)
§ 112.45 ENFORCEMENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking action to protect
the health, safety or welfare of the public or to prevent eminent danger of
damage to property.
   (B)   Enforcement of the consumer protection standards contained herein
shall be governed by the following:
      (1)   In addition to the powers delegated in §
112.44, the City Manager shall have the authority to order refunds from a
franchisee to individual subscribers who have submitted a written complaint to
the city and to assess fines against a franchisee for any violation of this
subchapter or any franchise agreement, which fines will be paid to the city.
      (2)   In ordering refunds to subscribers, the City Manager shall be
governed by the schedule set out below in which the refund indicated is
expressed as a percentage of the subscriber’s monthly bill. The refunds listed
are to be made on a per violation basis with each day of a continuing violation
constituting a separate violation. The refund ordered by the City Manager
pursuant to this section shall not exceed 100% of a subscriber’s monthly bill,
unless a violation has continued at least 30 days.
 
Schedule of Refunds to Subscribers
Single Violation of:                             Maximum Refund (Percent of Subscriber’s Monthly
                                                 Bill)
Failure to provide a local business office - §  10%
112.26
Failure to satisfy telephone standards - §      10%
112.27
Repair and installation standards                50%
 
      (3)   In assessing fines against a franchisee, the City Manager shall be
governed by the amount set forth in each section of §§
112.25 through 112.45. Fines are to be assessed on a per violation basis, with
each day of a continuing violation constituting a separate violation, or each
occurrence of a violation constituting a separate violation, whichever is
appropriate given the nature of the violation. The fines shall begin to accrue
on the first business day after the 30 day cure period has terminated. Where a
specific consumer protection provision does not contain a specific amount of a
fine, the City Manager may assess a fine up to $250 per violation.
      (4)   Prior to ordering a refund or assessing a fine, the City Manager
shall provide the franchisee with notice of the city's intention to assess a
refund and/or fine, which notice shall contain a description of the alleged
violation. Following receipt of such notice, the franchisee shall cure or
commence to cure such violation. Final cure of a violation shall toll the
accrual of assessed fines and refunds. Where a specific consumer protection
provision does not contain a specific amount of time for a franchisee to cure a
violation, the franchisee shall have 30 calendar days from the date of receipt
of the written notice to file a written response with the City Manager. The
city and the franchisee shall make good faith reasonable efforts to resolve the
dispute in question. A management level employee of the franchisee shall sign
the franchisee's written response and all statements contained therein will be
regarded as material representations to the city.
      (5)   Prior to ordering a refund and/or assessing a fine, the City
Manager shall consider any justification or mitigating factor advanced in the
franchisee's written response, including, but not limited to, rebates or
credits to the subscriber or the franchisee's good faith efforts to cure the
violation. The City Manager may, after consideration of the response of the
franchisee, waive or reduce any proposed refund or fine. In the case of a
violation of this subchapter or any franchise agreement, the City Manager shall
not assess any fine if the franchisee has reasonably resolved the complaint or
cured the violation within a reasonable time frame not to exceed ten days. Such
time period may be extended for good cause shown. If the City Manager
determines ultimately to impose a fine, the fine shall begin to accrue from the
date the franchisee received the written notice of violation. Each day of a
continuing violation shall constitute a separate violation for purposes of
imposing fines. However, an affected subscriber may be entitled to a credit or
refund as provided herein. It is the intent of the city to determine refunds
and/or fines as a reasonable estimate of the damages suffered by the city and/
or the subscribers.
      (6)   Subsequent to the notice of proposed refund and/or fine to the
franchisee and consideration of the franchisee's response, if any, the City
Manager may issue an assessment of refund or fine. The refund and/or fine shall
be paid within 30 days of written notice to the franchisee. The City may
enforce payment of the refund or fine in any court having jurisdiction or by
drawing down any security fund submitted by the franchisee.

given the system proposed, an estimate of the availability of space in conduits
and an estimate of the cost of any necessary rearrangement of existing
facilities;
      (4)   A description, where appropriate, of how services will be converted
from existing facilities to new facilities, and what will be done with existing
facilities;
      (5)   Proof in the form of financial statements, attested to by a
certified public accountant, that the applicant has the financial resources to
complete the proposed project, and to construct, operate and repair the
proposed facility over the term of the franchise. It is not the intent of the
city to require an applicant to prove that the services it proposed to offer
will succeed in the marketplace;
      (6)   Proof that the applicant is technically qualified to construct,
operate and maintain the proposed system. At a minimum, the applicant must show
that it has experience or resources to ensure that work is to be performed

conclude the applicant cannot be relied upon to comply with requirements of a
franchise, or provisions of this subchapter;
         (c)   Is not a convicted vendor 36 months or fewer prior to the date

         (e)   Does not hold a cable franchise and does not have a pending
application for an initial or renewal cable franchise;
         (f)   Did not have a request for an initial or renewal OVS franchise
denied within 36 months of the application (or, where the applicant challenged
the denial, the applicant must show more than 36 months has passed since the
final adjudication of that challenge); and
         (g)   Did not have a request for an initial or renewal cable system
franchise denied based upon past performance, or because the applicant failed
to propose a franchise that reasonably met the cable- related needs and
interests of the community, in light of the costs thereof within 36 months of
the application (or, where the applicant challenged the denial, the applicant
must show more than 36 months has passed since the final adjudication of that
challenge).
      (8)   To the extent that the applicant is in any respect relying on the
financial or technical resources of another person, including an affiliate, the
proofs required by this section should be provided for that person.
   (C)   An application for a transfer of a franchise must contain the same

the extent information provided by the transferor remains accurate, the
transferee may simply cross-reference the earlier application.
   (D)   The city may request such additional information as it finds
necessary, and require such modifications to the application as may be
necessary in the exercise of the city's authority over open video systems. Once
the information required by the city has been provided, the city shall promptly
review the application and the City Commission shall grant the application if
it finds the following:
      (1)   The applicant has the qualifications to construct, operate and
maintain the system proposed in conformity with applicable law. The city shall
provide a reasonable opportunity to an applicant to show that it would be
inappropriate to deny it a franchise on the grounds that it is not legally
qualified, by virtue of the particular circumstances surrounding the matter and
the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing there from and
prevent their recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant’s
principals, or the remoteness of the matter from the operation of an open video
system. An application for a franchise area shall not be granted if the
applicant has no plans to construct a system within the entire area for which
the franchise is sought;
      (2)   The applicant accepts the modifications required by the city to its
proposed system, to the extent applicable law does not prohibit such
modifications;
      (3)   The applicant is willing to enter into a franchise agreement that
the city determines complies with the requirements of this subchapter and
applicable law; and
      (4)   Whether issuance of a franchise is in the public interest
considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights-of-way and
private property that would be used by the open video system, including the
extent to which installation or maintenance as planned would require
replacement of property or involve disruption of property, public services, or
use of the public rights-of-way; and the comparative superiority or inferiority
of competing applications.
   (E)   In the case of a transfer, the city must also determine that:
      (1)   There will be no adverse effect on the public interest or the
city's interest in the franchise;
      (2)   The transferee agrees to be bound by all the conditions of the
franchise and to assume all the obligations of its predecessor; and
      (3)   Any outstanding compliance and compensation issues are resolved or
preserved to the satisfaction of the city.
   (F)   The city shall not award an applicant a franchise if the applicant
files, or in the previous three years filed, materially misleading information
in a franchise application, or intentionally withheld information that the
applicant lawfully is required to provide.

an amount equal to the highest amount contributed by a cable franchisee under
its franchise for and in support of public, educational and government use
(including use of the system for an institutional network) of its cable system.
   (B)   To the extent that a cable franchisee is providing other in-kind

city.
   (C)   In applying this section, the city shall ensure that the obligations
borne by the open video system operator in a franchise agreement are no greater

specified in a franchise agreement with an open video system operator as the
support that cable franchisees are required to provide increases.

Whenever practicable, the franchisee shall have 20 calendar days after notice

violates this subchapter, its franchise agreement, or applicable law:

remedy required to prevent further violations, and such other matters as the
city determines are appropriate to the public interest.
      (5)   Failure of the city to enforce any requirements of a franchise
agreement or this subchapter shall not constitute a waiver of the city's rights
under a franchise agreement or this subchapter, and shall not constitute a
waiver of the city's right under a franchise agreement or this subchapter to
pursue remedies with respect to a violation or subsequent violations of the
same type or to seek appropriate enforcement remedies.
      (6)   In any proceeding wherein there exists an issue with respect to a
franchisee's performance of its obligations pursuant to this subchapter or a
franchise agreement, the franchisee has, throughout any such proceedings and
appeals thereof, the burden of proving that said franchisee is in compliance
with the terms of this subchapter or a franchise agreement. The City Commission

or more franchises for the operation of ambulances within the city; to provide
for the regulation, to the extent permitted by law, of each private ambulance
service provider operating in the city in the public interest, to provide for
the payment of fees and other valuable consideration by a franchisee to the
city for the use of the streets by its ambulances; and to promote the safe and
efficient use of the streets. Under no circumstances, should the intent and
purpose of this subchapter be construed to regulate the standards and/or

services.

§ 112.72 FRANCHISE CHARACTERISTICS.
   A franchise authorizes the use of city streets for the operation of private
ambulance services within the city. A franchise is non-exclusive, and will not
expressly or implicitly preclude the issuance of other franchises within the
city, or affect the city's right to authorize use of city streets by the city
or other persons to operate private ambulance services or for other purposes it
deems appropriate. A franchise shall be a privilege which is in the public
trust and is personal to the original franchisee. No transfer of a franchise
shall occur without the prior consent of the city and unless application is
made by the franchisee.
(Ord. 1160, passed 5-15-96; Am. Ord. 1181, passed 9-4-96)

require compliance or performance under this subchapter shall not be deemed to
constitute a waiver of such right or a waiver of compliance or performance.

prohibited by this subchapter, provided, however, that franchisee's obligation

negligence of the city, its officials, boards, commissioners, agents or
employees. This provision includes, but is not limited to, the city's
reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit
or proceedings. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city from

with the safe movement of normal vehicular traffic; and
         (b)   According to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor
Vehicles 2007 Florida Traffic Crash Statistics Report, 530 pedestrians were
killed on Florida roadways in 2007; 65 of those pedestrians were killed on
roadways in Broward County; and
         (c)   As reported in the USDOT National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration's June 2008 National Pedestrian Crash Report, the City of
Pembroke Pines experienced two pedestrian crash deaths in 2006 alone;
         (d)   Based upon statistics collected by the Surface Transportation
Policy Project, the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area is one of the most dangerous
areas in the United States for pedestrians; and
         (e)   Numerous types of right-of-way canvassers and solicitors may
seek to operate within the City of Pembroke Pines, including, but not limited
to, children, adolescents and adults who seek to collect money for school and
community activities; vendors who sell flowers, newspapers and other products;
and people who seek donations or distribute written information; and
         (f)   Right-of-way canvassers and solicitors approach motorists and
passengers in motor vehicles engaged in travel on roads, and are particularly
susceptible and vulnerable to serious injury, or death due to the speed and
number of motorists who operate vehicles on busy roads within the city; and
         (g)   Roads are primarily designed for vehicular traffic and are not
suited to safely accommodate right-of way canvassers and solicitors; and
         (h)   According to a local newspaper article published in 2003, 29
right-of-way canvassers/solicitors have been seriously injured and at least 14
more have been killed by motor vehicles during a 15-year period; many of those
deaths occurred while the canvasser/solicitor was sitting or standing in a
median or on the side of the street (including a Sun-Sentinel newspaper vendor
who was struck by a car while carrying papers on U.S. 1 and Broward Boulevard
in Fort Lauderdale on July 30, 2000; a Miami Herald newspaper vendor who was
standing on the median at Federal Highway and Stirling Road on May 23. 2002;
and a Miami Herald newspaper vendor who was selling papers on the side of the
street at Stirling Road and U.S. 441 on August 7, 2002); and
         (i)   The presence of right-of-way canvassers and solicitors
interferes with the safe movement of normal vehicular traffic; and
         (j)   The road network in the city is substantially burdened by a high
volume of traffic, and road design frequently includes complex vehicle turn
movements that demand a driver's strict attention; and
         (k)   It is the intention of the City Commission to use the least
restrictive means to advance the significant governmental interests of traffic
safety and public safety and, consequently, the city staff analyzed each of the
major roads within the city and determined that the roads listed in division
(C) below present an increased and significant danger for use by distracted
drivers, pedestrians and right-of-way canvassers and solicitors and pose the
greatest threat to traffic and public safety in reference to activities and use
by right-of-way canvassers and solicitors, and therefore the City Commission
has determined that such activities and use by right-of way vendors and
solicitors shall be prohibited on the roads listed in division (C) below; and
         (l)   It is the finding of the City Commission that many other
alternative channels of communication (other than right-of-way canvassing and
solicitation on the prohibited roadways) exist for persons who seek to exercise
their First Amendment freedoms, such as, but by no means limited to,
solicitation of funds or distribution of literature through the mail or at
alternate locations (such as houses of worship, shopping areas and special
events); the sale and/or distribution of newspapers through home or office
delivery, vending machines and retail stores; and the sale of goods and
services at retail stores, through the internet and from vending machines; and
         (m)   The City Commission desires to preserve and protect the personal
safety and quality of life of its residents and of those who use streets within
the city, both pedestrians and motorists alike; and
         (n)   The City Commission has reviewed the proposed regulations
provided by this section and finds that such regulations accomplish the
purposes intended while utilizing the least restrictive means; and
         (o)   The City Commission finds that it is in the best interests of
the residents of the city to adopt this section.
   (C)   Prohibited roadways. It shall be unlawful for any person to act as a
right-of-way canvasser or solicitor on Pines Boulevard, Pembroke Road,
University Drive, Sheridan Street, Dykes Road and Flamingo Road or within 200
feet from the lateral curb or boundary line of any intersection located on the
roadways identified in this division.
   (D)   F.S. Chapter 316. The enforcement of this section shall not, in any
way, preclude the enforcement of F.S. § 316.130(5), as applicable.
   (E)   Enforcement and penalties.
      (1)   It shall be the duty of any police officer of the city to require
any person seen soliciting or canvassing and who is not known by the officer to
be duly permitted, to produce his solicitor's or canvasser's permit, and to
enforce the provisions of this chapter against any person found in violation
thereof.
      (2)   Except for violations of §
94.49 of the City Code, any person who violates any terms or provisions of this
section shall be prosecuted before a court of competent jurisdiction and, upon
conviction of such violation before the judge of the county court, shall be
subject to the penalties prescribed by the county judge. Each day of violation
of any term or provision of this article shall constitute a separate and
distinct violation.
      (3)   Any person who violates §
94.49 of the City Code shall be subject to the code enforcement provisions of
Chapter 32 of the City Code, and the penalties set forth in §
32.066 of the City Code.

('69 Code, § 8A-11) (Ord. 419, passed 4-5-76)
UNFAIR PRICING PRACTICES
§ 114.25 DECLARATION OF LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT.
   (A)   The City Commission finds and determines that the present inflationary
spiral has had and is having a deleterious effect on the consumers of food in
the city. Specifically, the City Commission is cognizant of the widespread
emotional distress caused by the practice of repricing and remarking certain
commodities offered to the public for retail sale merely because the retailer
has become aware of a new and higher wholesale price, the cost of which is not
related to the cost of existing goods. The adverse impact on consumers appears
to be the greatest in the area of retail sale of foods.
   (B)   It is the desire of the City Commission to reduce the psychological
harm to consumers who are the victims of arbitrary repricing where it is
possible to do so and thereby to contribute to the stabilization of food
prices. The City Commission also finds that preventing this consumer abuse will
have the effect of enhancing the good will and public image of the city retail
food merchant. Further, by preventing unfair repricing practices, consumers
will also be informed as to the relative age of food products offered for sale
and thereby have the opportunity to make an intelligent choice.
   (C)   The City Commission realizes that this subchapter will not cure the
national inflation, but regards its requirements as a valuable method of
lessening the inflation's impact on the people of the city.
('69 Code, § 8A-32) (Ord. 395, passed 3-17-75)
§ 114.26 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply

merchandise at prices which are lower than those offered in the general course
of business. Such a sale shall not exceed 30 days.
   MERCHANDISE. Food or other commodity sold at retail for human or animal
nourishment. MERCHANDISE shall not include any commodity imported into the

commodities and irrevocably committed to retail sale in the city.
   MERCHANT. Any person who buys and sells merchandise, grows and sells,
manufactures and sells, processes and sells, or any other person who sells
merchandise for profit in the city.

§ 114.27 RELABELING AND REMARKING.
   No merchant shall relabel or remark merchandise, as defined in this
subchapter, that is offered for sale in a retail establishment, to reflect a
price higher than that price at which the merchandise has previously been
offered for sale to the public, where the price change is intended to reflect a
new and higher wholesale price for the same type of merchandise. Reductions in
the price of merchandise may be made without regard to the provisions of this
subchapter.
('69 Code, § 8A-34) (Ord. 395, passed 3-17-75) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 114.28 MARKING AND LABELING PREVIOUSLY UNMARKED, UNLABELED MERCHANDISE.
   (A)   It is recognized that from time to time it may be necessary for a
merchant to increase the price of new merchandise while older or similar
merchandise remains on the merchant's shelf, displayed and offered for sale at
a marked or labeled price lower than the increased price of the new
merchandise. In such circumstances the merchant may mark or label the new and
previously unmarked and unlabeled merchandise at the increased price and place
such new merchandise on display, provided the merchant notes both the old and
the new price (or prices) legibly and distinctly at a place on or in close
proximity to the shelf on which said merchandise is displayed.
   (B)   No product previously labeled or marked may be remarked in violation
of §
114.27.

cause shown may grant, a temporary or permanent injunction restraining any
person from violating any provision of this subchapter, and thereafter enforce
the terms of the injunction.

single-family home. In the case of a cul-de-sac, all homeowners in the cul-de-
sac will be notified.
      (2)   Following notice, if 30% of the surrounding townhome or condominium
property owners or one contiguous owner, if single-family, objects to the
proposed application, the City Administration shall evaluate the objection. The
Administration shall presume the appropriateness of all applications for family
day care homes and the burden shall be on an opponent to establish sufficient
grounds for the imposition of conditions or the denial of an application. In
reviewing objections the City Administration shall consider the effect of the
proposed use on existing and future dwellings in the vicinity, the proposed
site, the traffic safety, and the general health and safety of the community.
In the event the objections are found invalid, the City Administration shall
continue processing the application for a local business tax receipt. Objectors

ADMINISTRATION
§ 121.10 REGISTRATION FOR PLACING OR MAINTAINING COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN
PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   (A)   A communications services provider, communications facility provider,
or pass-through provider that desires to place or maintain a communications
facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall first register with the city
in accordance with this section. Subject to the terms and conditions prescribed
in this section, a registrant may place or maintain a communications facility
in public rights-of-way.
   (B)    A registration shall not convey any title, equitable or legal, to the
registrant in the public rights-of-way. Registration under this section governs
only the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in public
rights-of- way. Registration does not excuse a communications services
provider, communications facility provider, or pass-through provider from
obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before locating its
facilities on the city’s or another person’s facilities. Registration does not
excuse a communications services provider, communications facility provider, or
pass-through provider from complying with all applicable city ordinances, codes
or regulations, including this chapter.
   (C)   Each communications services provider that desires to place or
maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall
file a single registration with the city which shall include the following
information:
      (1)   Name of the applicant;
      (2)    Name, address and telephone number of the applicant's primary
contact person in connection with the registration and the person to contact in
case of an emergency;
      (3)   Evidence of the insurance coverage required under §
121.25 of this chapter and acknowledgment that registrant has received and
reviewed a copy of this chapter;
      (4)   A copy of the applicant’s certificate of authorization or local
business tax receipt to provide communications services issued by the Florida
Public Service Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, or other
federal or state authority, if any;
      (5)   For an applicant that does not provide a Florida Public Service
Commission certificate of authorization number, if the applicant is a
corporation, proof of authority to do business in the State of Florida,
including the number of the certificate of incorporation; and
   (D)   The City Manager, or his, or her designee shall review the information
submitted by the applicant. If the applicant submits information in accordance
with division (C) above, the registration shall be effective and the city shall
notify the applicant of the effectiveness of registration in writing. If the
city determines that the information has not been submitted in accordance with
division (C) above, the city shall notify the applicant of the non-
effectiveness of registration, and reasons for the non-effectiveness, in
writing. The city shall so reply to an applicant within 30 days after receipt
of registration information from the applicant.
   (E)   A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the city
stating that it will no longer place or maintain any communications facilities
in public rights-of-way within the city and will no longer need to obtain
permits to perform work in public rights- of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a
registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any
communications facilities in public rights-of-way.
   (F)   Registration shall not in itself establish any right to place or
maintain or priority for the placement or maintenance of a communications
facility in public rights-of-way within the city, but shall establish for the
registrant a right to apply for a permit, if permitting is required by the
city. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or
replacement of this chapter and further subject to any additional city's
ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be enacted.
   (G)   A registrant shall renew its registration with the city by April 1 of
even numbered years in accordance with the registration requirements in this
chapter, except that a registrant that initially registers during the even
numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd numbered year immediately
preceding such even numbered year shall not be required to renew until the next
even numbered year. Within 30 days of any change in the information required to
be submitted pursuant to division (C), a registrant shall provide updated
information to the city. If no information in the then-existing registration
has changed, the renewal may state that no information has changed. Failure to
renew a registration may result in the city restricting the issuance of
additional permits until the communications services provider has complied with
the registration requirements of this section.
   (H)   In accordance with applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations
and this chapter, a permit shall be required of a communications services
provider, communications facility provider, or pass-through provider that
desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way.
An effective registration shall be a condition precedent to obtaining a permit.
Notwithstanding an effective registration, permitting requirements shall
continue to apply. A permit may be obtained by or on behalf of a registrant
having an effective registration if all permitting requirements are met.
   (I)   A registrant that places or maintains communications facilities in the
public rights-of-way and that pays communications services taxes shall not be
required to pay a permit fee since the city has elected to collect the
communications services tax pursuant to F.S. Ch. 202, as may be amended from
time to time. A pass-through provider that places or maintains a communications
facility in the city’s roads or rights-of-way shall pay the city an annual
amount not to exceed $500 per linear mile or portion thereof. The city’s roads
or rights-of-way do not include roads or rights-of-way that extend in or
through the municipality but are state, county, or another authority’s roads or
rights-of-way.

§ 121.11 TRANSFER, SALE OR ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS IN PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
     (A)   If a registrant transfers, sells or assigns its assets located in
public rights-of-way incident to a transfer, sale or assignment of the
registrant's assets, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall be obligated to
comply with the terms of this chapter. Written notice of any such transfer,
sale or assignment shall be provided by such registrant to the city within 24
days after the closing date of the transfer, sale or assignment. If the
transferee, buyer or assignee is a current registrant, then the transferee,
buyer or assignee is not required to re-register. If the transferee, buyer or
assignee is not a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee
shall register as provided in §
121.10 of this chapter within 60 days of the transfer, sale or assignment. If
permit applications are pending in the registrant's name, the transferee, buyer
or assignee shall notify the Engineering Department that the transferee, buyer
or assignee is the new applicant.
   (B)   Any encumbrance on the communications facilities of the registrant in
the public rights-of-way shall be subject and subordinate to the rights of the
city under this chapter and applicable law.

   (B)   To the extent not otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, the
city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or
additional communications facilities and personal wireless service facilities
within a particular area of public rights- of-way. The city shall have the
power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications
facilities and personal wireless service facilities within the public rights-
of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests to
place and maintain facilities in that area of the public rights-of-way, for the
protection of existing facilities in the public rights- of-way or to
accommodate city adopted plans for public improvements or projects that the
city determines are in the public interest.
   (C)   All safety practices required by applicable law or accepted industry
practices and standards shall be used during the placement or maintenance of
communications facilities and personal wireless service facilities.
   (D)   Personal wireless service facilities located in the public rights-of-

      (1)   Required approvals. No application for placement of personal
wireless service facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be permitted
without approval of the Building Department, the Public Services Department,
and the Planning and Economic Development Division.
      (2)   (a)   Because an antenna must be placed above- ground in order to
transmit and receive signals, an applicant proposing placement of an antenna in
the public rights-of-way, except in the case of a co- location, shall submit an
application for approval through the Planning and Economic Development Division
as a non-quasi-judicial action before the Planning and Zoning Board. The
application shall consist of the following:
            1.    Application form provided by the city;
            2.   Copy of current business tax receipt;
            3.   A scaled site plan depicting an area within a 600-foot radius
from the center of the proposed personal wireless service facility, and showing
the proposed antennas, equipment, related infrastructure, sidewalks, all
existing utilities, antennas, towers, stealth facilities, the right-of-way
boundaries, wireless communications facility boundary, road improvements, all

a properly completed application for personal wireless service facilities in
the public rights-of-way within 90 days or, as required by federal and state
law, after the date the application is determined to be properly completed. An
application is deemed submitted or resubmitted on the date the application is
received by the Planning and Economic Development Division. The Planning and
Economic Development Division shall notify the applicant within 20 days after
the date the application is initially submitted or additional information
resubmitted, whether the application is properly completed in compliance with
the city’s requirements. If the application is not completed in compliance with
the city’s requirements, the Planning and Economic Development Division shall
so notify the applicant in writing indicating with specificity any deficiencies
which, if cured, make the application properly completed. Upon resubmission of
information to cure the stated deficiencies, the Planning and Economic
Development Division shall notify the applicant, in writing, no later than 20
days after the additional information is submitted, of any remaining
deficiencies that must be cured. If a specified deficiency is not properly
cured when the applicant resubmits its application to comply with the notice of
deficiencies, the Planning Division may continue to request the information
until such time as the specified deficiency is cured, or may establish a
reasonable time frame within which the required information to cure the
application deficiency is to be provided. If the curative information is not
provided within such time frame, the application will be considered withdrawn
or closed.
      (4)   Co-location or use of stealth facilities. An antenna in the public
right-of-way shall, to the extent possible, be co-located on an existing power,
light or other utility pole. When co-location of an antenna is not possible, a
freestanding stealth facility is preferred. For co-locations, the applicant
shall submit an application to the city’s Building Department for approval.
      (5)   Statement. A statement or statements shall be submitted certifying
that the construction of personal wireless service facilities proposed to be
located in the public rights-of-way will comply with applicable standards as

electrical codes; and describing the proposed personal wireless service
facilities’ capacity to permit multiple users, including an example of the
number and type of antennas or other attachments that can be accommodated on
support structures. No personal wireless service facility which exceeds its
support structure’s loading capacity, which causes any pole or structure to
exceed its loading capacity or which does not conform to applicable electrical
codes shall be permitted in the public rights-of-way.
      (6)   Dimensional limits for cabinets, boxes and vaults. No permit or
order shall be granted authorizing the placement, construction or modification
in the public rights-of-way of a personal wireless service facility cabinet,
box or vault having a total volume exceeding 24 cubic feet unless the applicant
provides a statement explaining the need for the greater proposed dimensions
and certifying that current technology provides no alternative consistent with
the dimensional requirements of this division (D)(6).
         (a)   Height, setbacks and related location requirements.
            1.   The height of a new personal wireless service facility in the
public right-of-way to which an antenna is attached shall not exceed the height
of existing poles or structures in the public rights-of-way within 100 feet of
such proposed new personal wireless service facility, or if no such existing
poles are present in the public rights-of-way within 100 feet of such proposed
new personal wireless service facility, the new personal wireless service
facility shall be a minimum of 20 feet in height, and not exceed a height of 50
feet. Height shall be measured from the crown of the road of the nearest public
street.
            2.    Except as otherwise provided herein, personal wireless
service facilities in the public rights-of-way shall conform to the standards
and requirements set forth in the State of Florida Department of Transportation
Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance

other utility pole, or unless installed as a stealth facility, shall be
permitted within 50 feet of any principal residential structure.
            4.   A box or cabinet housing the equipment connected to an antenna
attached to a freestanding pole in the public rights-of-way shall be placed on
the ground instead of attached to the pole supporting the antenna, and shall be
screened from view.
         (b)   Antennas.
            1.   Each application for a personal wireless service facility,
other than for co-location, shall contain a rendering or photograph of the
proposed antenna which depicts its aesthetic features including, but not
limited to, the use of colors and screening devices. The application shall be
subject to administrative review regarding consistency with the requirements of
this section. The City Manager, or his or her designee, may require, to the
extent possible, that aesthetic features, including but not limited, to the use
of colors and screening devices, be used so that antennas blend into the
surrounding environment.
            2.   No signals, lights, or illumination shall be permitted on an
antenna or, except in the case of a light pole or a stealth facility designed
to emulate a light pole, on a pole to which such antenna is attached, unless
required by applicable state or federal laws or rules.
            3.   Antennas shall be mounted at a height and location that will
not interfere with use of the public rights-of- way.
            4.   No exterior antenna in the public rights-of-way shall exceed
the height of the pole to which it is attached unless it is attached as a co-
location to an existing power, light or other utility pole or on a pole
designed to emulate a light pole.
            5.   No antenna shall be mounted more than four inches from the
pole to which it is attached unless it is attached as a co-location to an
existing power, light or other utility pole.
            6.   Exterior looping of excess cable length installed on any
personal wireless service facility located in the public right-of-way is
prohibited.
            7.   Distance between antenna locations/number of antenna locations

the proliferation and clustering of antennas and associated above-ground
personal wireless service facilities, no antenna site in the public rights-of-
way shall be located within 600 feet of any other such antenna site or
telecommunications tower. Further, no more than 13 antenna sites may be located
within an area of one square mile. This division (C)(6)(b)7. shall not apply to
any antenna co-located on an existing power, light or other utility pole within
the public rights-of-way.
         (c)   Co-locations. For the purposes of this section, CO-LOCATION
means the mounting or installation of an antenna on an existing power, light or
other utility pole for the purpose of transmitting and/or receiving radio
frequency signals for communications purposes. In any co-location, the existing
power, light or other utility pole may be modified or replaced to accommodate
the new attachment, provided however that the modified or replacement pole
complies with the height, setback and related location requirements, unless
such requirements are waived. For the purposes  of this section, an existing
power, light or other utility pole modified or replaced to accommodate a new
attachment shall continue to be considered an existing pole after replacement
or modification.
         (d)   Approval required from other governmental agencies and owners.
Each application for the location of a personal wireless service facility in
the public rights-of-way may be required to include written approval, or a
statement of no objection, from state agencies that regulate siting, design,
and construction of such facilities, or have jurisdiction over the public

         (f)   Buffering.
            1.   Except in the case of an application for a co-location, as a
condition of approval the City Manager, or his or her designee, may require the
use of a fence as a buffer that is consistent in design and function with
existing fencing used in the public rights-of-way.
            2.   Except in the case of an application for a co-location, as a
condition of approval the City Manager, or his or her designee, may require the
use of landscaping as a buffer, which landscaping is consistent with the
landscaping otherwise located in the public rights-of-way. Additional
landscaping may be required if deemed necessary to buffer adjacent properties.
The City Manager, or his or her designee, may require landscaping in excess of
the requirements of the city code to enhance compatibility with adjacent
residential and nonresidential land uses.
            3.   All buffering required in connection with the use of personal
wireless service facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be maintained by
the owner of such facilities at its own cost.
         (g)   Equipment. The location in the public rights-of-way of any
equipment or equipment cabinets associated with personal wireless service
facilities shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer. Any such
cabinets or equipment must be approved by the City Engineer as to safety, and
shall not interfere with the use of the public rights-of-way. The City Engineer
may require a statement certifying the need for the proposed equipment and
location. No generators utilized in connection with personal wireless services
facilities may be placed in the public rights-of-way, except temporarily in the
case of emergency and if approved in advance by the City Engineer.
         (h)   Signs and advertising. The use of any portion of a personal
wireless service facility in the public rights-of-way for the posting of signs
or for advertising purposes, including, but not limited to, the display of
lights, banners and streamers is strictly prohibited. For purposes of emergency
contact, the owner of the personal wireless service facility shall place one
identification label on the equipment advising of the name and contact
telephone number of the owner of the personal wireless service facility.

current contact information for such owner or its authorized representative.
            2.   The owner or operator of a personal wireless service facility
in the public rights-of-way shall submit a report to the city’s Building
Department, certifying the integrity of the personal wireless service facility
and the safety of electrical components at least once every two years.
         (j)   Cooperative determination. In the event an applicant
demonstrates, in writing, to the satisfaction of the City Manager, or his or
her designee, that the operation of this section produces a result which is
either (i) a burdensome hardship on the applicant, and is inconsistent with the
general public welfare; or (ii) inconsistent with the intent of the particular
provisions of this section, and inconsistent with the general public welfare,
the applicant and the City Manager, or his or her designee, shall cooperate to
determine an appropriate location and aesthetic design for the proposed
facility. In any such cooperative determination there shall be a preference for
co-location with existing personal wireless service facilities or other utility
facilities, or for use of unused capacity on existing personal wireless service
facilities. Where facilities cannot be co-located and no such unused capacity
exists, there shall be a preference for the use of free-standing stealth-type
structures which are consistent, to the extent possible, with this section. The
City Manager, or his or her designee, may require a written statement
certifying that the proposed location is needed by a personal wireless services
provider to close a significant gap in its service to the affected areas.
         (k)   Modifications or replacements. Modification or replacement of
any personal wireless service facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be
subject to approval of the city’s Building Department. If such modification or
replacement of personal wireless service facilities or equipment would, as
reasonably determined by the city, result in the facility or equipment being
readily discernibly different in size, type, and appearance when viewed from
ground level from surrounding properties, such modification shall require
approval as a non-quasi judicial item before the Planning and Zoning Board. Any
co-location of personal wireless service facilities, removal of personal
wireless service facilities or replacement of personal wireless service
facilities that substantially changes the physical dimensions of an antenna
node site shall be subject to approval of the city’s Building Department.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, for an eligible
facilities request under Section 6409 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job
Creation Act of 2012, the application shall be subject only to the Building
Department’s review and approval process.
         (l)   Statements and certifications. Any statement or certification
submitted by or on behalf of an applicant pursuant to the provisions of this
section shall be prepared applying rational analysis by one or more engineers
registered and licensed in the state, or by such other person or persons
designated by the applicant who are qualified to perform the required analysis.
Any person or persons providing such a statement or statements shall also
certify as to his or her competence in the discipline or disciplines necessary
to perform the analysis and to provide the statement.

way to at least its original condition before such work after the completion of
any placement or maintenance of a communications facility or personal wireless
service facility in public rights-of-way or each phase thereof. If the
registrant fails to make such restoration within 30 days following the
completion of such placement or maintenance, the city may perform such
restoration as it deems necessary and charge all costs of the restoration
against the registrant in accordance with F.S. § 337.402, as it may be amended.
The registrant shall guarantee its restoration work and shall correct any
improper restoration work at its own expense for 12 months following the
original completion of the work.
   (F)   Removal or relocation at the direction of the city of a registrant’s
communications facility or personal wireless service facility in public rights-
of-way shall be governed by the provisions of F.S. §§ 337.403 and 337.404, as
they may be amended.
   (G)   A permit from the city constitutes authorization to undertake only
certain activities on public rights-of-way in accordance with this chapter, and
does not create a property right or grant authority to impinge upon the rights
of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way.
   (H)   A registrant shall maintain its communications facility or personal
wireless service facility in public rights-of-way in a manner consistent with
accepted industry practice and applicable law.
   (I)   In the interest of the public’s health, safety and welfare, upon
request of the city, a registrant shall coordinate placement or maintenance
activities under a permit with any other work, construction, installation or
repairs that may be occurring or scheduled to occur within a reasonable time
frame in the subject public rights-of-way. The city may require a registrant to
alter its placement or maintenance schedule as the city determines to be
reasonably necessary so as to minimize disruptions and disturbance in the
public rights-of-way. The city may provide a more definite time frame based on
individual city construction or maintenance schedules.
   (J)   The city makes no warranties or representations regarding the fitness,
suitability, or availability of city’s public rights-of-way for the
registrant’s communications facilities or personal wireless service facilities
and any performance of work or costs incurred by registrant or provision of
services shall be at registrant’s sole risk. Nothing in this chapter shall
affect the city’s authority to add, vacate or abandon public rights-of-way and
city makes no warranties or representations regarding the availability of any
added, vacated or abandoned public rights-of-way for communications facilities
or personal wireless service facilities.
   (K)   The city shall have the right to make such inspections of
communications facilities and personal wireless service facilities placed or
maintained in public rights-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance
with this chapter. In the event the city determines that a violation exists
with respect to registrant’s placement or maintenance of facilities in the
public rights-of-way that is not considered to be an emergency or danger to the
public health, safety or welfare, the city will provide the registrant at least
three days written notice setting forth the violation and requesting
correction.
   (L)   The city reserves the right to place and maintain, and permit to be
placed or maintained, sewer, gas, water, electric, storm drainage,
communications, and other facilities, cables or conduit, and to do, and to
permit to be done, any underground and overhead installation or improvement
that may be deemed necessary or proper by the city in public rights-of-way
occupied by the registrant. Registrant shall, if the registrant so agrees,
allow city facilities to be co-located within city’s public rights-of-way
through the use of a joint trench during registrant’s construction project.
Such joint trench projects shall be negotiated in good faith by separate
agreement between the registrant and the city and may be subjected to other
city rights-of-way requirements. The city further reserves without limitation
the right to alter, change, or cause to be changed, the grading, installation,
relocation, or width of the public rights-of-way within the limits of the city
and within said limits as same may from time to time be altered.
   (M)   A registrant shall, on the request of any person holding a permit
issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its communications facilities or
personal wireless service facilities to permit the work authorized by the
permit. The expense of such temporary raising or lowering of facilities shall
be paid by the person requesting the same, and the registrant shall have the
authority to require such payment in advance. The registrant shall be given not
less than 30 days advance written notice to arrange for such temporary
relocation. If the city requests a temporary raising or lowering of a facility
for a public purpose, the city shall not be charged for the temporary raising
or lowering of the facility.

§ 121.21 APPEALS.
   (A)   Final, written decisions of the City Manager, or his or her designee,
suspending a permit, denying an application for a registration or denying an
application for renewal of a registration are subject to appeal. An appeal must
be filed with the City Clerk within 30 days of the date of the final, written
decision to be appealed. Any appeal not timely filed as set forth above shall
be waived. The City Commission shall hear the appeal. The hearing shall occur
within 30 days of the receipt of the appeal, unless waived by the registrant,
and a written decision shall be rendered within 20 days of the hearing. Upon

§ 121.22 CONDITIONAL USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   (A)   In the event the registrant desires to use its existing facilities or
to construct new facilities for the purpose of providing other utility or non-
utility services to existing or potential consumers or resellers, by providing
any other services other than the provision of communications service, or for
providing any other use to existing or potential consumers, a registrant shall
seek such additional and separate authorization from city for such activities
as may be required by applicable law.
   (B)   To the extent that a registrant leases or otherwise uses the
facilities of a person that is duly registered or otherwise authorized to place
or maintain facilities in the public rights-of-way of the city, the registrant
shall make no claim, nor assert any right, which will impede the lawful
exercise of the city's rights, including requiring the removal of such
facilities from the public rights-of-way of the city, regardless of the effect
on registrant's ability to place or maintain its own communications facilities
in public rights-of-way of the city.

§ 121.23  INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION OF REGISTRATION.
   (A)   The city may terminate a registration if:
      (1)   A federal or state authority suspends, denies, or revokes a
registrant's certification or local business tax receipt to provide
communications services;
      (2)   The registrant's placement or maintenance of a communications
facility in the public rights-of-way presents an extraordinary danger to the
general public or other users of the public rights-of-way and the registrant
fails to remedy the danger promptly after receipt of written notice; or
      (3)   The registrant ceases to use all of its communications facilities
in public rights-of-way and has not complied with §
121.30 of this chapter.
   (B)   Prior to termination, the registrant shall be notified by the City
Manager, or his or her designee, with a written notice setting forth all
matters pertinent to the proposed termination action, including which of
divisions (1) through (3) above is applicable as the reason therefore, and
describing the proposed action of the city with respect thereto. The registrant
shall have 30 days after receipt of such notice within which to address or
eliminate the reason or within which to present a plan, satisfactory to the
City Manager, or his or her designee, to accomplish the same. If the plan is
rejected, the City Manager, or his or her designee, shall provide written
notice of such rejection to the registrant and shall make a recommendation to
the City Commission regarding a final decision as to termination of
registration. A decision by a city to terminate a registration may only be
accomplished by an action of the City Commission. A registrant shall be
notified by written notice of any decision by the City Commission to terminate
its registration. Such written notice shall be sent within seven days after the
decision.
   (C)   In the event of termination, the former registrant shall:
      (1)   Notify the city of the assumption or anticipated assumption by
another registrant of ownership of the registrant's communications facilities
in public rights-of-way; or
      (2)   Provide the city with an acceptable plan for disposition of its
communications facilities in public rights-of-way. If a registrant fails to
comply with this division, the city may exercise any remedies or rights it has
at law or in equity, including but not limiting to taking possession of the
facilities, requiring the registrant's bonding company within 90 days of the
termination to remove some or all of the facilities from the public rights-of-
way and restore the public rights-of-way to its original condition before the
removal, or requiring that some or all of the facilities be removed and the
public rights-of-way restored to its original condition before the removal at
the registrant's expense.
   (D)   In any event, a terminated registrant shall take such steps as are
necessary to render every portion of the communications facilities remaining in
the public rights-of-way of the city safe.
   (E)   In the event of termination of a registration, this provision does not
permit the city to cause the removal of any communications facilities that are
used to provide another service for which the registrant holds a valid
certification or local business tax receipt with the governing federal or state
agency, where required, and is properly registered with the city for such
certificated or licensed service, where required.

    (A)   A registrant shall not commence construction, operation or
maintenance of the facility without obtaining all insurance required under this

signed by the registrant's Chief Financial Officer or designee. Information
contained therein is subject to review and approval by city's Risk Management
Division.

in that event, the registrant shall furnish, at least 30 calendar days prior to
the expiration of the date of such insurance, a renewed certificate of
insurance of equal and like coverage.

the following hazards: X-explosion, C-Collapse, U-underground.
      (2)   Workers’ compensation insurance. Shall be maintained to comply with

   (G)   This section shall not be construed to affect in any way the city’s
rights, privileges and immunities as set forth in F.S. § 768.28. Insurance
under this section shall run continuously with the presence of the registrant's
facilities in the public rights-of-way and any termination or lapse of such
insurance shall be a violation of this section and subject to the remedies as
set forth herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may, in its sole
discretion, require increased or decreased levels of insurance for any other
object placed in the city 's public rights-of-way by way of individual local
business tax receipt agreements.

§ 121.26 INDEMNIFICATION.
   (A)   A registrant shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold
harmless, and defend the city, its officials, boards, members, agents, and
employees, against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings,
judgments for damages or equitable relief, and costs and expenses incurred by
the city arising out of the placement or maintenance of its communications
system or facilities in public rights-of-way, regardless of whether the act or
omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by this chapter,
provided, however, that a registrant's obligation hereunder shall not extend to
any claims caused by the gross negligence or wanton or willful acts of the
city. This provision includes, but is not limited to, the city's reasonable
attorneys' fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit or
proceedings. The city agrees to notify the registrant, in writing, within a
reasonable time of city receiving notice, of any issue it determines may
require indemnification. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city from
participating in the defense of any litigation by its own counsel and at its
own cost if in the city's reasonable belief there exists or may exist a
conflict, potential conflict or appearance of a conflict. Nothing contained in
this section shall be construed or interpreted:
      (1)   As denying to either party any remedy or defense available to such
party under the laws of the State of Florida;
      (2)   As consent by the city to be sued; or
      (3)   As a waiver of sovereign immunity beyond the waiver provided in
F.S. § 768.28, as may be amended.
   (B)   The indemnification requirements shall survive and be in effect after
the termination or cancellation of a registration.

§ 121.27 CONSTRUCTION BOND.
    (A)   Prior to issuing a permit where the work under the permit will
require restoration of public rights-of-way, the city may require a
construction bond to secure the restoration of the public rights-of-way.
   (B)   In the event a registrant subject to such a construction bond fails to
complete the work in a safe, timely and competent manner in accordance with the
provisions of the permit, there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally
from the principal and surety of the bond, any damages or loss suffered by the
city as a result, including the full amount of any compensation,
indemnification or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the
registrant, or the cost of completing the work, plus a reasonable allowance for
attorneys’ fees, up to the full amount of the bond.
   (C)   No less than 12 months after completion of the construction and
satisfaction of all obligations in accordance with the bond, the registrant may
request the City Engineer or his or her designee, to remove the requirement to
continue the construction bond. Notwithstanding, the city may require a new
bond for any subsequent work performed in the public rights-of-way.
   (D)   The construction bond shall be issued by a surety having a minimum
rating of A-1 in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition; shall be
subject to the approval of the City Attorney; and shall provide that:
   “This bond may not be canceled, or allowed to lapse, until sixty (60) days
after receipt by the city, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a
written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to
renew.”
   (E)   The rights reserved by the city with respect to any construction bond
established pursuant to this section are in addition to all other rights and
remedies the city may have under this section, or at law or equity, and no
action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to the construction bond
will affect any other right the city may have.

legal or equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.
   (C)   Before imposing a fine pursuant to division (B)(1) of this section,

such penalties, which notice shall contain a description of the alleged
violation. Following receipt of such notice, the registrant shall have 30 days
to either:
      (1)   Cure the violation to the city's satisfaction and the city shall
make good faith reasonable efforts to assist in resolving the violation; or
      (2)   File an appeal with the city to contest the alleged violation; §

allowed by law.
   (D)   In determining which remedy or remedies are appropriate, the city
shall take into consideration the nature of the violation, the person or
persons bearing the impact of the violation, the nature of the remedy required
in order to prevent further violations, and such other matters as the city
determines are appropriate to the public interest.
   (E)   Failure of the city to enforce any requirements of this chapter shall
not constitute a waiver of the city's right to enforce that violation or
subsequent violations of the same type or to seek appropriate enforcement
remedies.

respect to a registrant's performance of its obligations pursuant to this
chapter, the registrant shall be given the opportunity to provide such

chapter.
   (G)   The City Manager or designee shall be responsible for administration
and enforcement of this chapter, and is authorized to give any notice required
by law.

shall notify the city within 90 days.
   (B)   The city may direct the registrant to remove all or any portion of
such abandoned facility at the registrant’s sole expense if the city determines

safety or welfare, which shall include, but is not limited to:
      (1)   Compromises safety at any time for any public rights-of-way user or
during construction or maintenance in public rights-of-way;
      (2)   Prevents another person from locating facilities in the area of
public rights-of-way where the abandoned facility is located when other
alternative locations are not reasonably available; or
      (3)   Creates a maintenance condition that is disruptive to the public

third person to coordinate with the registrant that owns the existing facility
for joint removal and placement, where agreed to by the registrant.
   (C)   In the event that the city does not direct the removal of the
abandoned facility, the registrant, by its notice of abandonment to the city,

of the facility by the city, another utility or person at such third party’s
cost.
   (D)   If the registrant fails to remove all or any portion of an abandoned
facility as directed by the city within a reasonable time period as may be
required by the city under the circumstances, the city may perform such removal

chapter, causes or events not within a registrant’s control shall include,
without limitation, acts of God, floods, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes,
fires and other natural disasters, acts of public enemies, riots or civil

cannot be copied and moved, then a registrant may request that the inspection
take place at some other location mutually agreed to by the city and the
registrant, provided that the registrant must make necessary arrangements for
copying documents selected by the city after its review; and the registrant
must pay all travel and additional copying expenses incurred by the city in
inspecting those documents or having those documents inspected by its designee.
   (E)   Without limiting the foregoing, a registrant shall provide the city
the following within 10 calendar days of their receipt or (in the case of
documents created by the registrant or its affiliate) filing:
      (1)   Notices of deficiency or forfeiture related to the operation of the
facility; and

      (1)   The fee to collocate a small wireless facility on a city utility
pole shall be $150 per pole annually.
      (2)   The city may reserve space on a city utility pole for future public
safety uses. However, a reservation of space may not preclude collocation of a
small wireless facility. If replacement of the city utility pole is necessary
to accommodate the collocation of the small wireless facility and the future
public safety use, the pole replacement is subject to make-ready provisions and
the replaced pole shall accommodate the future public safety use.
      (3)   For a city utility pole that supports an aerial facility used to
provide communication services or electrical service, the city and applicant
shall comply with the process for make-ready work under 47 U.S.C. § 224 and
implementing regulations. The good faith estimate of the city for any make-
ready work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested collocation
must include pole replacement, if necessary.
      (4)   For a city utility pole that does not support an aerial facility
used to provide communications services or electric service, the city shall
provide a good faith estimate for any make-ready work necessary to enable the
pole to support the requested collocation, including necessary pole
replacement, within 60 days after receipt of a complete application. Make-ready
work, including any pole replacement, shall be completed within 60 days after
written acceptance of the good faith estimate by the applicant. Alternatively,
the city may require the applicant seeking to collocate a small wireless
facility to provide a make-ready estimate at the applicant’s expense of the
work necessary to support the small wireless facility, including pole
replacement, and perform the make-ready work. If pole replacement is reguired,
the scope of the make-ready estimate is limited to the design, fabrication, and
installation of a utility pole that is substantially similar in color and
composition. The city may not condition or restrict the manner in which the
applicant obtains, develops, or provides the estimate or conducts the make-
ready work subject to usual construction restoration for work in the rights-of-
way.
      (5)   The make-ready work specified in subsections (I)(3) and (4) of this
section shall be subject to the city’s usual construction restoration standards
for work in the right-of-way. The replaced or altered city utility pole shall
remain the property of the city.
   (J)   Design standards. The city’s design standards set forth in the
applicable codes may be waived by the City Manager, or his or her designee,
upon a showing that the design standards are not reasonably compatible for the
particular location of a small wireless facility or that the design standards
impose an excessive expense for a small wireless facility. The waiver shall be
granted or denied within 45 days after the date of the request.
   (K)   Permitting. An applicant for installation of a small wireless facility
shall obtain a right-of-way permit from the city for any work that involves
excavation, closure of a sidewalk, or closure of a vehicular lane.
   (L)   Airport airspace. A structure granted a permit and installed pursuant
to this section shall comply with F.S. Chapter 333, and federal regulations
pertaining to airport airspace protections.

§ 130.06 ADULT CIVIL CITATION PROGRAM.
   (A)   Policy and intent. It is the policy and intent of the City of Pembroke
Pines for officers of the city's Police Department to use reasonable judgment
and appropriate discretion when making decisions that may lead to an arrest or
an alternative to arrest. The Adult Civil Citation Program is designed to
divert first-time misdemeanor offenders from the criminal justice system.
Department members are responsible for adhering to the following protocols in
support of the program.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning:
      ACC PROGRAM. The Adult Civil Citation Program established pursuant to
this section.
      DEPARTMENT. The City of Pembroke Pines Police Department.
      PROVIDER. The entity engaged by the City of Pembroke Pines to provide
educational and/or counseling services as a component of the successful
completion of the city's Adult Civil Citation Program.
   (C)   Engagement of provider. The city shall contract with an entity
qualified to provide educational and/or counseling services related to mental
or behavioral health and addiction recovery. Adults who receive a civil
citation pursuant to this section may, at the Department's discretion or as
provided by this section, be required to complete a program offered by the
provider. All fees and costs associated with the completion of a provider
program shall be the responsibility of the adult issued an adult civil citation
pursuant to this section.
   (D)   The ACC Program shall only be available as an option to adults for
misdemeanor offenses relating to:
      (1)   Criminal mischief, if the victim consents;

      (6)   Offenses of assault and battery, if the victim consents.
   (E)   Eligible adults who elect to participate in the ACC Program must agree
to the issuance of the adult civil citation. By accepting and signing the adult
civil citation, the adult misdemeanor offender:

Rights;
      (2)   Admits to the offense(s) cited and gives up their right to appear
in court;
      (3)   Agrees to waive their right to a speedy trial;

by the Pembroke Pines Police Department's Civil Citation Program; and
      (6)   Agrees, if the adult civil citation is being issued for possession
of cannabis, to submit to drug screening by the provider. If deemed necessary
by the Department or the provider upon receipt of the results of the screening,
the offender agrees to participate in the provider's addiction recovery
program. Successful completion of the recovery program shall be a condition of
completion of the ACC Program set forth in division (O)(2).
      (7)   Failure to successfully complete the program will result in the
case being referred to criminal prosecution.
      (8)   Failure to agree to the issuance of a civil citation may result in
arrest.

eligibility criteria has been met:

         (a)   Does not have any prior arrests;
         (b)   Has not been previously issued an adult civil citation; and

officers are responsible for determining the eligibility of the adult for the
issuance of an adult civil citation. They can determine if the adult has
previously been issued an adult civil citation or is currently participating in
the ACC Program by either calling the Department's ACC Program coordinator or
contacting the provider.
   (H)   Officers shall explain the following to the adult:
      (1)   The difference between an actual arrest and an adult civil
citation; and
      (2)   The option to refuse the adult civil citation.
   (I)   If the adult offender refuses the adult civil citation and is
arrested, the officer has the option to either:
      (1)   Issue a Notice to Appear (NTA); or
      (2)   Transport the adult to the Broward County Jail.
   (J)   Officers are responsible for documenting the following in the offense
or arrest paperwork:
      (1)   The reason(s) for either issuing or not issuing an adult civil
citation; and
      (2)   Any adult civil citation refusal.
   (K)   The signature of the adult on the adult civil citation attests to
their agreement, and officers shall:
      (1)   Issue Miranda warnings prior to obtaining the adult's signature on
the adult civil citation; and
      (2)   Ensure the right thumbprint of the adult is placed in the bottom
right corner on the adult civil citation form.

pertinent information in the offense report narrative section.

Broward County Jail.
   (N)   Supervisors are responsible for reviewing all arrest or adult civil
citation documents and shall ensure:
      (1)   Adults issued adult civil citations meet the criteria for adult
civil citation issuance;
      (2)   Adults arrested did not meet the criteria for adult civil citation
issuance; and
      (3)   Officers followed the documentation requirements of this section.
   (O)   The Department member designated as the ACC Program Coordinator is
responsible for the following:
      (1)   Review of all completed adult civil citations to ensure correctness
and compliance with program protocols; and
      (2)   Completion of adult civil citation follow-up activities to include:
         (a)   Upon being notified by the provider that an adult has
successfully completed the program, complete a supplemental offense report with
a case status designation of exceptional clearance; and
         (b)   Upon being notified by the provider that an adult has failed to
complete the program, the Department will refer the adult to criminal
prosecution.
   (P)   Failure of the ACC Program occurs when the adult:
      (1)   Fails to comply with the assigned intervention services within the
prescribed time period; or
      (2)   Commits a new criminal offense prior to completion of the program.
   (Q)   In addition to any conditions and penalties imposed pursuant to this
section, adults issued an ACC shall be subject to a fine in an amount to be
determined
by the city.
   (R)   Adults who successfully satisfy the requirements of this section and
the ACC Program shall not incur any form of documented criminal record related
to the issuance of the adult civil citation.

design, drawing, or advertisement of any nature upon any flag of the United
States; or
      (2)   Expose to public view any such flag standard, color, ensign, or
shield upon which shall have been printed, painted, or otherwise produced, or
to which shall have been attached, appended, affixed, or annexed any such word,
figure, mark, picture, design, drawing, or advertisement.
   (B)   No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United states of
America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental
colors, state flags, and organization or institutional flags are to be dipped
as a mark of honor.
      (1)   The flag should never be displayed with the union down, except as a
signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.
      (2)   The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the
ground, the floor, water, or merchandise.
      (3)   The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always
aloft and free.
      (4)   The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or
drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always
allowed to fall free. Bunting of blue, white, and red, always arranged with the
blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below, may be used for
covering a speaker's desk draping the front of the platform, and for decoration
in general.
      (5)   The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in
such a manner as to permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way.
      (6)   The flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling.
      (7)   The flag should never have placed upon it, mark, insignia, letter,
word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.
      (8)   The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving,
holding, carrying, or delivering anything.
      (9)   The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any
manner whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or
handkerchiefs and the like printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or
boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard. Advertising
signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the flag is
flown.
      (10)   The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a
fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably
by burning.
   (C)   The flag, when carried in a procession with another flag or flags,
should be either on the marching right; that is, the flag's own right, or, if
there is a line of other flags, in front of the center of that line.
      (1)   The flag should not be displayed on a float in a parade except from
a staff, or as provided in this section.
      (2)   The flag should not be draped over the hood, top, sides, or back of
a vehicle or of a railroad train or a boat. When the flag is displayed on a
motorcar, the staff shall be fixed firmly to the chassis or clamped to the
right fender.
      (3)   No other flag or pennant should be placed above or, if on the same
level, to the right of the flag of the United States of America, except during
church services conducted by naval chaplains at sea, when the church pennant
may be flown above the flag during church services for the personnel of the
Navy. No person shall display the flag of the United Nations or any other
national or international flag equal, above, or in a position of superior
prominence or honor to, or in place of, the flag of the United States at any
place within the United States or any territory or possession thereof:
provided, that nothing in this section shall make unlawful the continuance of
the practice heretofore followed by displaying the flag of the United Nations
in a position of superior prominence or honor, and other national flags in
positions of equal prominence or honor with that of the flag of the United
States at the headquarters of the United Nations.
      (4)   The flag of the United States of America, when it is displayed with
another flag against a wall from crossed staffs, should be on the right, the
flag's own right, and its staff should be in front of the staff of the other
flag.

localities or pennants of societies are grouped and displayed from staffs.
      (6)   When flags of states, cities, or localities, or pennants of
societies are flown on the same halyard with the flag of the United States, the
latter should always be at the peak. When the flags are flown from adjacent
staffs, the flag of the United States should be hoisted first and lowered last.
No such flag or pennant may be placed above the flag of the United States or to
the United States flag's right.
      (7)   When flags of two or more nations are displayed, they are to be
flown from separate staffs of the same height. The flags should be of
approximately equal size. International usage forbids the display of the flag
of one nation above that of another nation in time of peace.
      (8)   When the flag of the United States is displayed from a staff
projecting horizontally or at an angle from the window sill, balcony, or front
of a building, the union of the flag should be placed at the peak of the staff
unless the flag is at half staff. When the flag is suspended over a sidewalk
from a rope extending from a house to a pole at the edge of the sidewalk, the
flag should be hoisted out, union first, from the building.
      (9)   When displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall,
the union should be uppermost and to the flag's own right, that is, to the
observer's left. When displayed in a window, the flag should be displayed in
the same way, with the union or blue field to the left of the observer in the
street.
      (10)   When the flag is displayed over the middle of the street, it
should be suspended vertically with the union to the north in an east and west
street or to the east in a north and south street.
      (11)   When used on a speaker's platform, the flag, if displayed flat,
should be displayed above and behind the speaker. When displayed from a staff
in a church or public auditorium, the flag of the United States of America
should hold the position of superior prominence, in advance of the audience,
and in the position of honor at the clergyman's or speaker's right as he faces
the audience. Any other flag so displayed should be placed on the left of the
clergyman or speaker or to the right of the audience.
      (12)   The flag should form a distinctive feature of the ceremony of
unveiling a statue or monument, but it should never be used as the covering for
the statue or monument.
      (13)   The flag, when flown at half-staff, should be first hoisted to the
peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff position. The flag
should be again raised to the peak before it is lowered for the day. On
Memorial Day the flag should be displayed at half- staff until noon only, then
raised to the top of the staff. By order of the President, the flag shall be
flown at half- staff upon the death of principal figures of the United States
Government and the Governor of the state, territory, or possession, as mark of
respect to their memory. In the event of the death of other officials or
foreign dignitaries, the flag is to be displayed at half- staff in accordance
with recognized customs or practices not inconsistent with law. In the event of
the death of a present or former official of the government of any state,
territory, or possession may proclaim that the National flag shall be flown at
half-staff. The flag shall be flown at half-staff 30 days from the day of death
of the Vice President, the Chief Justice or a retired Chief Justice of the
United States, or the Speaker of the House of Representatives; from the day of
death until interment of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, a Secretary
of an executive or military department, a former Vice President, or the
Governor of the State, territory, or possession; and on the day of death and
the following day for a Member of Congress.
      (14)   When the flag is used to cover a casket, it should be so placed
that the union is at the head and over the left shoulder. The flag should not
be lowered into the grave or allowed to touch the ground.
      (15)   When the flag is suspended across a corridor or lobby in a
building with only one main entrance, it should be suspended vertically with
the union of the flag to the observer's left upon entering. If the building has
more than one main entrance, the flag should be suspended vertically near the
center of the corridor or lobby with the union to the north, when entrances are
to the east and west or to the east when entrances are to the north and south.
If there are entrances in more than two directions, the union should be to the
east.
   (D)   Time and occasions for display.
      (1)   It is the universal custom to display the flag only from sunrise to
sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs in the open. However, when a
patriotic effect is desired, the flag may be displayed 24 hours a day if
properly illuminated during the hours or darkness.
      (2)   The flag should be hoisted briskly and lowered ceremoniously.
      (3)   The flag should not be displayed on days when the weather is
inclement, except when an all weather flag is displayed.
      (4)   The flag should be displayed on all days especially on United
States and State holidays.
      (5)   The flag should be displayed daily on or near the main
administration building of every public institution.

RESIDENCY OF SEXUAL OFFENDERS AND SEXUAL PREDATORS
§ 134.60 SEXUAL OFFENDER RESIDENCY PROHIBITION; FINDINGS AND INTENT.
   (A)   Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence,
and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an
extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to
use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders
commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are
prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual
offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly
exorbitant.
   (B)   It is the intent of this subchapter to serve and to protect the city's
compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and
welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where
children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual
offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or
permanent residence.
(Ord. 1518, passed 8-3-05)
§ 134.61 DEFINITIONS.

14 or more consecutive days.
   SEXUAL OFFENDER. For purposes of this chapter, shall be defined as provided
by F.S. § 943.0435(a), as may be amended from time to time.
   SEXUAL PREDATOR. For purposes of this chapter, shall be defined as a repeat
sexual offender, a sexual offender who uses physical violence, a sexual
offender who preys on children or as otherwise defined by F.S. § 775.21, also
known as The Florida Sexual Predators Act, as may be amended from time to time.
   TEMPORARY RESIDENCE. A place where the person abides, lodges, or resides for
a period of 14 or more days in the aggregate during any calendar year and which
is not the person's permanent address, or a place where the person routinely
abides, lodges, or resides for a period of four or more consecutive or
nonconsecutive days in any month and which is not the person's permanent
residence.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 150.01 (RESERVED)
§ 150.02 NEW HOME BUYERS WARRANTY.
   (A)   Purpose. The objective of this section is to protect the purchasers of
new residences in this city by requiring the providing of insurance or third-
party warranties for the correction of major construction defects or proof that
same shall be available at the time the developer closes on the sale of the
property with the original purchaser as a condition precedent to the future
issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any dwelling in this city, and a
bond to insure completion of a residential home.
   (B)   Requirement of affidavit.
      (1)   Each person or entity, as a condition to the issuance of a building
permit, shall provide the city with an affidavit, signed by the person or a
principal of the entity requesting the building permit, in a form prescribed by
the City Attorney and available at the Building Department.
   (C)   Requirements of insurance, warranty, or other security.
      (1)   To assure the quality of construction in this city and to assure to
residents financial resources which may be necessary for the correction of
major structural construction defects, the Chief Building Official shall not
issue a certificate of occupancy for any dwelling unit until the developer,
builder, or general contractor shall first furnish proof to such official of
the issuance or guaranteed availability of same at the time the developer
closes on the sale of the property with the original purchaser of an insurance
policy or insured five-year or greater warranty provided by any VA/FHA approved
warranty company and warranty certificate by a company authorized by the
Florida Department of Insurance to do business in the state or authorized under
applicable federal law, naming as beneficiary the purchaser and his successors
and assigns of that dwelling unit and obligating the insurer in a minimum
amount equal to the original purchase price of the home to make and pay for all
corrections which may be necessary with respect to any major structural defects
subject to warranty time limitations.
      (2)   Insurance policies or warranty certificates issued for condominium
units shall be in a form consistent with the Florida Condominium Warranty
Statute, to wit, F.S. § 7l8.203.
      (3)   The developer, builder, or general contractor may in lieu of any
insurance policy deposit with the city a good and sufficient bond of the
developer, builder, or general contractor approved as to form and substance, by
the City Attorney, or a cash deposit, or an irrevocable bank letter of credit,
or other collateral approved by the City Commission which shall be held as
security for the payment of corrections of construction defects hereinafter
defined. Promissory notes shall not be accepted under this section. The bond or
letter of credit shall be in an amount equal to $5,000 per individual dwelling
unit with a maximum of $100,000 aggregate for all dwelling units constructed by
the same developer with any one project. The bond or letter of credit shall be
for a term of five years from the date of the certificate of occupancy or shall
be issued annually, but provide for an automatic renewal.
   (D)   The regulations contained herein shall not apply to a single-family
home constructed by an owner/builder for his own residence. In order to qualify
as an owner/builder, an individual must sign and provide the city with an
affidavit in recordable form stating that he shall live in the residence when
completed and that he intends to occupy the residence for at least two years.
If the owner/ builder moves from the residence within two years of the issuance
of a certificate of occupancy, he shall be required to provide a bond as
required in this section.
   (E)   Identification and determination of major structured defects.
      (1)   MAJOR STRUCTURAL DEFECT shall mean any noncompliance with the
Florida Building Code, as to any part of the original construction of the
building which results in actual physical damage to the following designated
load- bearing portions of the residence caused by failure to such load-bearing
portions which affect their load- bearing functions to the extent that the
residence becomes unsafe, unsanitary, or otherwise unlivable:
            (a)   Foundation systems and footings;
            (b)   Beams;
            (c)   Girders;
            (d)   Lintels;
            (e)   Columns;
            (f)   Walls and partitions;
            (g)   Floor systems;
            (h)   Roof framing system;
            (i)   Mechanical;
            (j)   Air conditioning systems;
            (k)   Plumbing; or
            (l)   Electrical systems.
      (2)   The Chief Building Official shall determine whether there have been
any major structural defects with respect to the building code or other
applicable laws which were existing at the time of the issuance of the
certificate of occupancy.
   (F)   Penalty. Failure to comply with this section shall prohibit the
granting of a building permit, or if a building permit is in effect at the time
of the passage of this section, no certificate of occupancy shall be issued.
(Ord. 87-6, passed 5-20-87; Am. Ord. 1715, passed 5-2-12)
§ 150.03 ESCROW DEPOSITS.
   (A)   Purpose of section. The purpose of this section is to protect future
residents from the loss of deposits on the purchase of their dwelling by
providing for the maintenance of escrow accounts or, in lieu thereof, providing
for surety or letters of credit to secure the deposits until closing of the
dwelling unit by the purchaser.
   (B)   Requirement of escrow.
      (1)   The developer shall be required to place in an escrow account, with
a person, firm, or institution having a bona fide fiduciary obligation, all
deposits received towards the purchase of any dwelling unit constructed or to
be constructed within the city. The deposits shall be released from escrow upon
or simultaneously with the closing of the unit.
      (2)   The developer shall submit to the Chief Building Official, with the
developer's application for permit, evidence from the escrow agent that the
deposits are placed in an escrow account. If the developer desires to secure a
building permit prior to the sale of a dwelling unit, the developer shall
deposit with the Chief Building Official a bond as provided in division (B)(3)
below. At the time of sale of the unit, the developer may request and the Chief
Building Official shall release the bond upon evidence that the deposits have
been placed in escrow.
      (3)   In lieu of placing the purchaser's deposits in escrow, the
developer may deposit with the Chief Building Official a bond, approved as to
form and substance by the City Attorney, in the form of cash, letter of credit,
or other collateral, which shall be held as security for the deposits. That
bond shall be in an amount greater than the amount of the deposit or 5% of the
selling price of the dwelling unit. Where a developer is building multiple
units simultaneously, the aggregate amount of all bonds shall not be required
to exceed $100,000 per subdivision. The city shall release the bonds upon the
closing of the unit.

§ 150.04 HOMEOWNER OR CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATION AFFIDAVIT REQUIREMENT FOR
BUILDING PERMITS.
   (A)   Declaration of intent. The intent of this section is to require
property owners whose property is governed by a homeowners' association or
condominium association to provide an affidavit indicating their awareness that
they may be subject to additional association regulations despite the issuance
of a building permit for exterior renovations by the city. This section is
intended to protect the city from becoming involved in controversies between
property owners and their associations, where property owners may obtain
permits from the city for projects inconsistent with the association's
regulations. This section is further intended to protect the health, safety and
welfare of the citizens and residents of the city by ensuring awareness of all
proper regulations prior to the issuance of a building permit.
   (B)   Definitions.
      (1)   CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATION. An association created pursuant to F.S.
Chapter 718, to govern and represent the residents of a condominium.
      (2)   HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION. An association created pursuant to F.S.
Chapter 720, to govern and represent the residents of a community.
   (C)   Affidavit requirement for building permits.
      (1)   As part of the application process, when applying for a city
building permit, every applicant shall sign an affidavit indicating an
awareness that if the subject property is located in a homeowner's association
or condominium association there may be additional regulations despite the
issuance of a permit by the city. Applicants whose subject property is not
located within a homeowners' association or condominium association shall
submit an affidavit indicating that the subject property is not in such an
association and that this section is not applicable.
      (2)   The Building Department shall, at the applicant's expense, forward
by certified mail a copy of the affidavit of awareness to the homeowners'
association or condominium association, provided that such association is on
the city's master list. The cost of this mailing shall be factored into the
city's fees for building permits.

§ 150.18 BOND TO ACCOMPANY BUILDING PERMIT APPLICATION.
   (A)   Whenever an application is made for a building permit in the city, it
shall be the duty of the Building Official to determine whether the improvement
is to be erected on a lot or tract in a section served by public sidewalks or
public curbs, and whether there is a probability that the public side-walks or
public curbs and gutters may be damaged by moving supplies and materials to the
proposed location. If, in the opinion of the Building Official, it appears
probable that, in the course of construction, the public sidewalks or public
curbs and gutters in front of or adjacent to or in the neighborhood of the
proposed improvement may be damaged by moving supplies and materials to the
proposed location, the Building Official shall require a cash bond of $250 to
be posted with him by the applicant, to guarantee during the construction,
before issuing the permit.
   (B)   The Building Official shall give a receipt for the sum of money on a
form to be prepared by him. The receipt form shall contain a provision that any
part or all of the sum shall be used by the city and its employees, if
necessary, in the replacement of curbs, sidewalks, and gutters broken or

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.001 TITLE.
   The legislature of the State of Florida has in Chapter 166, Florida
Statutes, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Commission does ordain the following
sections set forth in this chapter. Accordingly, these regulations shall be
known as the "Floodplain Management Ordinance of the City of Pembroke Pines,
Florida," hereinafter referred to as "this chapter."
(Ord. 1775, passed 5-7-14)
§ 152.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city may be subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life, property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are mainly caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 1775, passed 5-7-14)
§ 152.003 PURPOSE; OBJECTIVES; SCOPE.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to
flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
flood waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To protect human life and health;
      (2)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, and streets and bridges
located in flood plains;
      (6)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood
blight areas; and
      (7)   To ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is
in a flood area.
   (C)   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development that is
wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not
limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site
improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling,
enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of
buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building
Code; placement installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and
manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of
recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other
development.
(Ord. 1775, passed 5-7-14)
§ 152.004 INTENT.
   The purposes of this chapter and the flood load and flood resistant
construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum
requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to
minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of
development in flood hazard areas to:
   (A)   Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access, and public
service during times of flooding;
   (B)   Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to
prevent or minimize future flood damage;
   (C)   Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation,
drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development
which may increase flood damage or erosion potential;
   (D)   Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and
shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial
functions of the floodplain;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood hazard areas;
   (G)   Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood
control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and
   (H)   Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for
community participation as set forth in the 44 C.F.R. 59.22.
(Ord. 1775, passed 5-7-14)
§ 152.005 COORDINATION WITH THE FLORIDA BUILDING CODE.
   This chapter is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with
the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the
standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code.
(Ord. 1775, passed 5-7-14)
§ 152.006 WARNING.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter and the Florida
Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land
outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within
such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood
hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the Flood Insurance Study
and shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and the requirements of 44 C.F.R. §§ 59
and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring
this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation
in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing
use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this chapter.
(Ord. 1775, passed 5-7-14)
§ 152.007 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City Commission
of the City of Pembroke Pines, Florida, or by any officer or employee thereof
for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 1775, passed 5-7-14)
APPLICABILITY
§ 152.008 GENERAL.
   Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific
requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable.
(Ord. 1775, passed 5-7-14)
§ 152.009 AREAS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all flood hazard areas within the City of
Pembroke Pines, Florida, as established in §
152.010 of this chapter.
(Ord. 1775, passed 5-7-14)
§ 152.010 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING FLOOD HAZARD AREAS.
   The Flood Insurance Study for Broward County. Florida and Incorporated Areas
dated July 31, 2024, and all subsequent amendments and revisions, and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), and all subsequent amendments
and revisions to such maps, are adopted by reference as a part of this chapter
and shall serve as the minimum basis for establishing flood hazard areas.
Studies and maps that establish flood hazard areas are on file with the City
Engineer of the City of Pembroke Pines at 8300 South Palm Drive, Pembroke
Pines, Florida.

§ 152.011 SUBMISSION OF ADDITIONAL DATA TO ESTABLISH FLOOD HAZARD AREAS.
   To establish flood hazard areas and base flood elevations, pursuant to §§
152.040 through
152.043 of this chapter the Floodplain Administrator (as defined in §
152.020) may require submission of additional data. Where field surveyed
topography prepared by a Florida licensed professional surveyor or digital
topography accepted by the community indicates that ground elevations:
   (A)   Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas
not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be
considered as flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of this chapter
and, as applicable, the requirements of the Florida Building Code.
   (B)   Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation, the area shall
be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a Letter
of Map Change that removes the area from the special flood hazard area.
(Ord. 1775, passed 5-7-14)
§ 152.012 OTHER LAWS.
   The provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to nullify any provisions
of local, state, or federal law.
(Ord. 1775, passed 5-7-14)
§ 152.013 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter supersedes any ordinance in effect for management of
development in flood hazard areas. However, it is not intended to repeal or
abrogate any existing ordinances including but not limited to land development
regulations, zoning ordinances, stormwater management regulations, or the
Florida Building Code. In the event of a conflict between this chapter and any
other ordinance, the more restrictive shall govern. This chapter shall not
impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement, but any land that is subject
to such interests shall also be governed by this chapter.
(Ord. 1775, passed 5-7-14)
§ 152.014 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall
be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;

R-1C, R-1P, R-2U, R-3, R-3A, or R-3U zoning district shall not be designed to
front on an arterial street or trafficway. These lots shall be designed as
reverse frontage lots with a planting strip at least ten feet in width on the
rear end of the lots on the arterial street or trafficway. The planting strip
shall be restricted against use for vehicular access to the arterial street or
trafficway.
      (2)   The regulations provided in this division (E)(2) shall apply to all
areas of the city, except for areas lying within county territory or other
incorporated municipalities. Where a residential subdivision or residential
property abuts an existing or proposed arterial street, the Board may require
marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a
nonaccess reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with or without
rear service alleys, or any other treatment that may be necessary for adequate
protection of residential properties and to ensure separation of through and
local traffic.
   (F)   Plats adjacent to railroad or expressway right-of-way. Where a
subdivision borders on or contains a right-of-way for a railroad, expressway,
drainage canal, or waterway, the Board may require a street or a fence
approximately parallel to and on each side of the right-of-way, at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land. The distances shall
be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades for
future grade separations. All alleys must be paved.
   (G)   Reserve strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be
prohibited, except where their control is definitely placed in the city under
conditions approved by the Board.

previously removed, shall be removed and restored in the specified manner.
Where pavement is removed for installation, maintenance or removal of any
underground facility, restoration shall be in accordance with City Standards R-
26, R-27, R-28, R-29 and R-30, attached herewith. Equipment shall not travel
over loose rock fragments or other hard material lying on sections of pavement
which are not to be removed.
   (C)   Swale areas, medians, sidewalks, driveways, and similar structures
shall be restored in kind to a condition equal to or better than that which was
disturbed.
   (D)   All benchmarks and permanent reference survey markers disturbed during
the course of construction shall be replaced at an equal or better level of
precision, at the permittee's expense, by a professional land surveyor
registered in the state.

§ 154.87 PROCEDURE FOR RESTORATION OF FLEXIBLE PAVEMENT.
   The procedure for backfill and pavement restoration shall be as follows.
Density test of compacted fill, backfill and/or base shall be taken at each
six-inch lift, prior to placement of the succeeding lift of material according
to the following schedule.
   (A)   For any road crossing in which the road is cut and restored one lane
at a time, one density test shall be taken in each lane at each six-inch lift.
   (B)   For any road crossing in which the road is cut and restored two lanes
at a time, densities shall be tested in one lane per lift, alternating lanes
with each lift.
   (C)   For any road crossing in which the road is cut and restored three
lanes at a time, densities shall be tested in two locations per six-inch lift,
staggering locations with each successive lift.
   (D)   Cuts across roads shall not be left open overnight unless absolutely
necessary. Trenches shall be backfilled and a temporary asphalt applied to make
a smooth level patch. The trenches shall then be excavated the next day and
permanent backfill and pavement installed in accordance with these standards.
The only exception will be when the installed facility must be tested before
the road is restored. In these cases, the permanent restoration must be
performed on the day of testing or the next day.
   (E)   When the installation parallels the roadway and damages the pavement,
the density tests shall be made every 100 l.f. at six-inch layers, with test
locations staggered 25 inches each lift. A copy of all Proctor and Field
Density Tests shall be furnished to the Engineering Department.
   (F)   Roadway base material shall be compacted to a minimum of 98% of
maximum dry density, as determined by AASHTO T-180 (Modified Proctor Test).
Subgrade material under paved areas shall by compacted to a minimum of 100% of
maximum dry density. Shoulder area and swale area beyond shoulders shall be
compacted to a minimum of 98% of maximum dry density, as determined by AASHTO
T-99-C (Standard Proctor Test).
   (G)   Restoration of striping, signing and signalization devices shall be
accomplished immediately after pavement restoration is completed.

§ 154.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person, including agents, servants, and employees, found guilty of
violating the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and
punished as provided in §
10.99. Each day that a violation is permitted to continue shall constitute a
separate offense. The imposition of any fine or penalty shall not be construed
as excusing or permitting the continuance of any violation of this chapter.
('69 Code, § 14-28) (Ord. 73, passed 3-1-62)
   (B)   A person who sells, rents, or leases his property in violation of §

ARTICLE 1: PURPOSE
§ 155.100 TITLE.
   This Code shall be officially entitled the "Land Development Code of the
City of Pembroke Pines, Florida", and may be referred to as the "Pembroke Pines
Land Development Code," the "Land Development Code," the "LDC," or "this Code".
(Ord. 2021-02, adopted 3-17-21; sought to be reconsidered, Commission passed 4-
21-2021)
§ 155.101 AUTHORITY.
   This Code is enacted pursuant to the requirements and authority of F.S. Ch.
163, Pt. II (the "Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development
Regulation Act"), the general powers confirmed in F.S. Ch. 166 ("Home Rules
Powers Act") and the Constitution of the State.
(Ord. 2021-02, adopted 3-17-21; sought to be reconsidered, Commission passed 4-
21-21)
§ 155.102 GENERAL APPLICABILITY, ANNEXATION AND VESTED RIGHTS.
   (A)   General applicability. Unless otherwise permitted as an exception
under division (C) below or allowed to continue as a nonconforming use, all
existing, proposed and new development and uses of land in the city shall
conform strictly to the provisions of this Code. Except as expressly provided
in this Code, no development or use of land shall be undertaken without prior
approval and issuance of a development order pursuant to the provisions of this
LDC. The fact that a development order, permit or decision has been issued by
an officer or employee with ostensible authority over the interpretation or
enforcement of this Code shall not stop or otherwise prevent the city from
strict enforcement of the provisions of this Code. If provisions of this LDC
are inconsistent with one another, or with provisions of other adopted codes or
ordinances of the city, or with provisions of applicable county, state, and
federal laws, the more restrictive provision shall govern to the extent
permitted by law unless the terms of the more restrictive provision specify
otherwise. The more restrictive provision is the one that imposes greater
restrictions, or more stringent controls.
   (B)   Annexation agreements. Nothing in this LDC is intended to supersede,
annul, or interfere with any rights, covenant, or other agreements provided for
in any currently effective annexation agreement between the city and any

§ 155.305 ZONING IN PROGRESS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide an administrative
and legislative procedure whereby the city can place a temporary hold on
development permits and approvals if there are pending active efforts underway
to amend this Code in a way that would preclude such permits and approvals
should the pending amendment be adopted.
   (B)   Applicability. Zoning in progress shall be in place from the time that
the City Manager or designee determines that:
      (1)   The city is actively developing and processing a proposal to amend
this Code in a way that would preclude permits and approvals of certain uses
and development, and
      (2)   Authorization or approval of such uses and development before the
proposed amendment is decided would be detrimental to the public interest. The
city shall not grant any development permit or approval, or accept any
application for a development permit or approval, that authorizes or proposes
development that would not be allowed under the proposed amendment to this LDC.
   (C)   Procedure.
      (1)   The City Manager or designee shall issue an administrative order
that specifies the area(s) affected by the proposed amendment and that
prohibits the issuance of any development permits or granting of development
approvals that would be precluded by the proposed amendment;
      (2)   On issuing the administrative order, the City Manager or designee
shall schedule consideration of a resolution confirming the administrative
order for the next available City Commission meeting.
   (D)   City Commission review and action.
      (1)   The City Commission shall review the City Manager's or designee's
zoning in progress determination and decide whether to confirm or reject it.
      (2)   If the City Commission decides to confirm the City Manager's or
designee's zoning in progress determination, they shall adopt a resolution
affirming the administrative order.
      (3)   If a resolution is adopted by the City Commission, the zoning in
progress shall remain active for up to six months or until the adoption of the
amendment to the LDC. The time period may be extended if determined necessary
by the City Commission.

Economic Development Director shall determine the official zoning district
classification.
      (5)   The Planning and Economic Development Department Director shall

district boundaries, the Planning and Economic Development Department Director
may enter on the official zoning map notations reflecting the ordinance
wording.

§ 155.450 DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURES FOR PLANNED DISTRICTS.
   (A)   All planned districts as defined in this subchapter are subject to
site plan approval procedures set forth in §
155.301(A) unless otherwise noted herein.
   (B)   All planned districts undergoing a site plan amendment shall comply
with the procedures set forth in §
155.301(B).
   (C)   Zoning change to a planned district shall comply with the procedures
set forth in §
155.301(F) and shall include a site plan and narrative to demonstrate
compliance with the requirements for the requested zoning district as outlined
in this subchapter.
   (D)   All planned districts undergoing an amendment to previously approved
planned districts guidelines shall comply with the procedures set forth in §
155.301(F).
(Ord. 2021-02, adopted 3-17-21; sought to be reconsidered, Commission passed 4-

§ 155.451 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD).
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   This district is intended to provide flexible land use and design
regulations through the use of performance criteria; so that small-to-large
scale areas, or portions thereof, may be developed with a variety of
residential types and nonresidential uses, and may contain both individual
building sites and common property.
      (2)   A planned unit is to be designed and organized so as to be capable
of satisfactory use and operation as a separate entity without necessarily
needing the participation of other building sites or other common property in
order to function as a neighborhood. This section specifically encourages
innovations so that the growing demands of residential and nonresidential uses
may be met by a greater variety in type, design, and siting of buildings and by
the conservation and more efficient use of land.
      (3)   This section recognizes that the standard zoning functions (use and
bulk) and the subdivision function (platting and design) are appropriate for
the regulation of land use in areas of neighborhoods that are already
substantially developed. This section further recognizes that a rigid set of
space requirements along with bulk and use specifications would frustrate the
application of this concept. Therefore, where PUD techniques are deemed
appropriate the land may be rezoned to a PUD District. In so doing,
conventional use and dimensional specifications are ignored in this section and
are herein replaced by an approval process in which an approved plan becomes
the basis for continuing land use controls. This provides the means by which
City Commission may approve land development plans which meet or exceed the
level of development quality required by regular city zoning standards.
      (4)   It is intended that this district offer development design
flexibility to developers, in order to encourage imaginative, functional, high
quality development planning. The use of this district shall be limited to
those development projects which will result in desirable community
environmental qualities and development which is compatible with surrounding
lands and activities.
   (B)   Design guidelines. Guidelines for the planned unit development shall
be determined at the time of application submittal to the Planning and Economic
Development Department. Guidelines include but are not limited to: Setbacks,
buffers, required yards, lot size, distance between structures, or otherwise
established herein.
   (C)   Active planned unit developments.
      (1)   Where a parentheses () comes after a planned unit development, it
shall denote the name of an alias of the approved PUD.
      (2)   Where an asterisk * comes after a planned unit development, it
shall mean that the PUD has been approved under a site plan.
         (a)   Big Sky (Keystone Lake);
         (b)   Big Sky North (Laguna Isles);
         (c)   Chapel Trail;
         (d)   Charleston in the Pines*;
         (e)   Meadow Pines (Cobblestone);
         (f)   Grand Palms;
         (g)   Nasher (Sarah Park);
         (h)   Pembroke Falls;

         (n)   The Landings;
         (o)   TownGate;
         (p)   Country Pines (Walnut Creek).
   (D)   Standards.
      (1)   Minimum area required. Under normal circumstances, the minimum area
required to qualify for a PUD District shall be 120 contiguous acres of land.
The Planning and Zoning Board may consider projects with less acreage where the
applicant can demonstrate that a smaller parcel will meet the objectives and
requirements of a PUD District, but in no case shall projects less than 50
acres be qualified as a PUD District.
      (2)   Ownership of land to be used for the project. The parcel of land
for a project may be owned, leased, or controlled either by a single person,
corporation, or by a group of individuals. An application must be filed by the
owner or by the authorized agent of all property included in a project. In the
case of multiple ownership, the approved plan shall be binding on all owners,
heirs, successors, and assigns.
      (3)   Permitted uses. All uses within an area designated as a PUD
District are determined by the provisions of this section and the approved plan
of the project concerned.
         (a)   Residential uses. Residences may be of any variety of types.
(Single-family, multi-family, rental, condominium, townhouses, quadplexes, and
the like). In developing a balanced community, the uses of a variety of housing
types and designs shall be deemed most in keeping with this section.
         (b)   Accessory, commercial, service, and other nonresidential uses:
            1.   Because of the primarily residential nature of PUD, only those
commercial and industrial uses which are compatible with residential uses may
be permitted.
            2.   Customary accessory or associated uses may also be permitted,
as appropriate, to the PUD.
            3.   The permitted uses shall conform to the approved PUD plan.
      (4)   Minimum area and land dedication requirements.
         (a)   Planned unit developments shall contain areas at least equal to
35% of the gross area in open space. In addition thereto, planned unit
developments shall comply with the standards and regulations set forth in §
154.36.
         (b)   In the event the land shall not be required for municipal
purposes, the City Commission may require the developer to make a cash
contribution in lieu of the land dedication. The cash contribution shall be the
higher of the appraisals of two qualified, mutually acceptable appraisers.
         (c)   Where the planned unit development is being constructed on a
planned, phased basis, areas to be dedicated to the city shall be shown on the
plan for that phase and shall be deeded to the city at the time of the approval
of that phase. Likewise, cash contributions in lieu of land dedication shall be
payable upon the approval of each phase.
      (5)   Setbacks or yards. There shall be a setback or yard of not less
than 25 feet in depth, abutting all public road rights-of-way within or
abutting a Planned Unit Development District.
      (6)   Access.
         (a)   Each dwelling unit or other permitted use shall have access to a
public street either directly or indirectly via a private approach road,
pedestrian way, court, or other area dedicated to public or private use or by
common easement guaranteeing access. Permitted uses are not required to front
on a road.
         (b)   The city shall be allowed access on privately owned roads,
easements, and open space to insure the police- and fire-protection of the
area, to meet emergency needs, to conduct city services, and to generally
insure the health and safety of the residents of the planned unit development.
      (7)   Compatibility zone with adjacent zoning district. The planned unit
development shall be generally compatible with surrounding uses and
communities.
      (8)   Length of structures. The length of structures within any given PUD
District shall be subject to the recommendations of the Planning and Zoning
Board and the approval of the City Commission.
      (9)   Off-street parking. Off-street parking shall at least meet all
requirements as required by the city. If changes in these requirements are
requested by the applicant, a parking study shall be required to deem the
changes necessary.
      (10)   Underground utilities.
         (a)   With the planned unit development, all utilities, including
telephone, television cable, and electrical systems, shall be installed
underground. Primary facilities providing service to the site may be exempted
from this requirement.
         (b)   Large transformers shall be placed on the ground and contained
within pad mounts, enclosures, or vaults.
         (c)   The developer shall provide adequate landscaping with shrubs and
plants to screen all utility facilities permitted above ground.
      (11)   Open space regulations. Planned unit developments shall exhibit
and maintain a total open space requirement at least equal to 35% of the gross
area of the PUD. The following areas qualify wholly or partially as open space:
         (a)   No more than 50% of lakes and golf courses shall be counted
toward the total open space requirement.
         (b)   All canals and lakes in excess of 80 feet in width may be
counted toward open space requirements subject to division (D)(11)(a) of this
section.
         (c)   If natural habitats of unique and significant value are
determined to exist, the Planning and Zoning Board may recommend the area so
defined to be left in an undisturbed state, and adequately protected or
incorporated into the design of the PUD as a passive recreation area with a
minimum of improvements permitted. In either case, 100% of the area contained
therein may be counted as open space.
         (d)   The area contained in a continuous, open space pedestrian
system; consisting of permanently maintained walks and trails, not less than 12
feet wide; leading to a natural amenity, recreation facility, or commercial
use; offering internal pedestrian walkways that are divorced from roads and
streets; may be counted as open space.
         (e)   The area contained in mini-parks; which may or may not be part
of the open space system, but contain at least one acre and have a minimum
dimension of 100 feet together with, but not limited to, one of the following:
benches, playground apparatus, barbeque pits, and fire rings; may be counted as
open space.
         (f)   The area occupied by a multiple-use recreation building and its
attendant outdoor recreation facilities may be counted as open space.
         (g)   Any privately maintained or owned exterior open space adjacent
to and for the exclusive use by the residents of an individual dwelling unit;
enclosed or partially enclosed by walls, buildings, or structures, including
balconies, terraces, porches, decks, patios and atriums may be counted toward
the total open space requirement, providing the total area contained therein
does not exceed 5% of the gross area of the PUD, nor decreases the amount of
ground level open space below 30% of the gross area of the PUD. All previous
land areas between the property or lot lines and the building or buildings
thereon shall count as open space, except as herein otherwise provided.
         (h)   The area contained in public and private streets rights-of-way
is not considered as open space and receives no credit toward the open space
requirement.
         (i)   All open space and all private streets and ways shall conform to
its intended use and remain as expressed in the master development plan through
the inclusion in all deeds of appropriate covenants.
            1.   The deed restrictions shall run with the land and be for the
benefit of present as well as future property owners.
            2.   All covenants and deed restrictions shall be included in the
association documents, which shall specifically provide that the city shall
have the power to enforce all the covenants and deed restrictions which affect
the health, safety, and welfare of residents.
            3.   All covenants and deed restrictions shall grant to the city a
lien upon all real property benefitted by the enforcement, in the event it is
necessary for the city to enforce the covenants or restrictions.
         (j)   All open space as well as public and recreation facilities shall
be specifically included in the development plan schedule, and be constructed
and fully improved by the developer at an equivalent or greater rate than the
construction of residential structures.
            1.   If the rate of construction of dwelling units is greater than
the rate which open space and recreational facilities have been constructed and
provided, no permits shall be issued until the proper ratio has been provided.
      (12)   Procedure for zoning change land to PUD District classification.
The applicant shall submit to the city an application for zoning change, on a
form provided by the city,

§ 155.453 MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT (MXD).
   (A)   Purpose. This district is intended to provide flexible design
regulations and uses for each project to encourage innovative development and
redevelopment. Mixed use projects must have a consistent architectural theme,
promote a pedestrian friendly environment and reduce traffic generation.
   (B)   Active mixed use developments. A list of active mixed use developments
and guidelines shall be maintained in the Planning and Economic Development
Department.
   (C)   Standards.
      (1)   A mixed use development is to be designed and organized to
encourage a combination of at least two uses that compliment each other and
assist in reducing traffic generation. No single use shall dominate a mixed use
project. Single use buildings, especially "Big Box Retail" are discouraged
unless the mixture of buildings is designed to encourage interaction among the
proposed uses.
      (2)   Floor area ratio calculations and ground coverage shall be provided
to determine scale, density and impact of the project.
      (3)   The minimum project size shall be 25 acres. The project may contain
less than 25 acres if off-street pedestrian and vehicular access is provided to
adjacent uses and the applicant can demonstrate the inter-relationships and
benefits of a Mixed Use Development District of such size.
      (4)   Within the mixed use project, pedestrian movement and safety shall
be given priority. Internal roadways shall be "pedestrian friendly" including
the use of pavers, wide sidewalks, narrow vehicular lanes and parallel parking.
Major parking areas shall be located to encourage walking and discourage
internal vehicle trips among the various buildings and uses.
      (5)   Parking garages, loading docks, and service areas shall be directly
accessible from major roadways and appropriately screened to promote a
pedestrian scale and safety.

ARTICLE 5: USE REGULATIONS
§ 155.500 OVERVIEW OF USE REGULATIONS.
   General purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is to authorize the
establishment and continuation of land uses that are allowed as a primary use
of a parcel of land and consistent with the comprehensive plan. The subchapter
identifies the zoning districts in which the various primary uses are allowed,
identifies if any special processes might be required for the use, and
establishes any use standards that might be applicable to the various primary
uses. Before utilizing this subchapter to confirm if a use is allowed within a
specific zoning district, it must first be determined if the zoning district
designation of the subject site is consistent with the site's future land use
designation as depicted on the future land use map of the city's comprehensive
plan.

very nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable characteristics,
particularly when several of them are concentrated in any given location,
thereby having a deleterious effect upon adjacent business and residential
areas. Specific regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these
adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting and downgrading of the
surrounding neighborhood.
         (b)   Adult entertainment uses shall be located nearer than 1,000 feet
to the same or any other designated use, an establishment at which alcoholic
beverages are sold or consumed, or to any religious institutions, or public,

accordance with division (A)(1)(d) of this section.
         (c)   It shall be unlawful hereafter to establish any designated use
within the corporate limits of the city if the proposed location is within 500
feet of a residentially zoned district. This prohibition shall be waived upon

the waiver, signed by 51% of all those persons owning real property, residing
or operating or managing a business within 500 feet of the proposed location of
the designated use.
            1.   The circulator of the petition requesting a waiver shall
subscribe and swear to an affidavit attached to the petition that the
circulator personally witnessed that the signatures were affixed to the
petition by the persons whose names appear in the petition. The petition shall
bear at the top of each page thereof a typewritten title in substantially the
following form. "The undersigned hereby request a waiver from the Planning and
Zoning Board of Pembroke Pines, Florida, that shall permit the establishment
and location of a (an) (state specifically which designated use is sought to be
established) within 500 feet of my real property, residence, or business."
            2.   The Planning and Zoning Board shall investigate the petition
and signatures on the petition to verify that the petitioners do in fact own
real property, or reside or do business in a residentially zoned district
within 500 feet of the proposed designated use. Measurement of the 500 feet
shall be made in accordance with division (A)(1)(d) of this section.
         (d)   For the purposes of this section, a designated use or proposed
designated use shall be deemed to be within 1,000 feet or 500 feet of another
designated use or an establishment at which alcoholic beverages are sold or
consumed, religious institutions, school, real property, residence, business,
or residentially zoned district, respectively, as defined or described herein,
if any part of the building in which, or lot of land upon which, a designated
use is located, is within 1,000 feet or 500 feet, as measured by an actual or
imaginary straight line upon the ground or in the air, of any part of the
building in which, or lot of land upon which, another designated use or an
establishment at which alcoholic beverages are sold or consumed, a religious
institution, school, real property, residence, business, or residentially zoned
district respectively, is located.
         (e)   Where a designated use is located in conformity with the
provisions of this subchapter, the subsequent locating of an establishment
which sells or permits the consumption of alcoholic beverages on premises, a
religious institution or school within 1,000 feet, or a residentially zoned
district within 500 feet of the existing designated use shall not be construed
to cause the designated use to be in violation of this subchapter.

   (A)   Location near religious institutions, schools, residential districts:
      (1)   In the development, enforcement, and amendment of this LDC, it is
recognized that there are uses and accessory uses which, because of their
nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable characteristics,
particularly when several of them are concentrated in any given location,
thereby having a deleterious effect upon adjacent business and residential
areas. Specific regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these
adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting and downgrading of the
surrounding neighborhood.
      (2)   Tattoo parlor shall not be located nearer than 1,000 feet to the
same or any other designated use, an establishment at which alcoholic beverages
are sold or consumed, or to any religious institutions, or public, private or

within the corporate limits of the city if the proposed location is within 500
feet of a residentially zoned district.
      (4)   For the purposes of this subchapter, a designated use or proposed
designated use shall be deemed to be within 1,000 feet or 500 feet of another
designated use, an establishment at which alcoholic beverages are sold or
consumed, religious institutions, school, real property, residence, business,
or residentially zoned district, respectively, as defined or described herein,
if any part of the building in which, or lot of land upon which, a designated
use is located, is within 1,000 feet or 500 feet, as measured by an actual or
imaginary straight line upon the ground or in the air, of any part of the
building in which, or lot of land upon which, another designated use, an
establishment at which alcoholic beverages are sold or consumed, a religious
institutions, school, real property, residence, business, or residentially
zoned district respectively, is located.
      (5)   Where a designated use is located in conformity with the provisions
of this LDC, the subsequent locating of an establishment which sells or permits
the consumption of alcoholic beverages on premises, a religious institution or
school within 1,000 feet, or a residentially zoned district within 500 feet of
the existing designated use shall not be construed to cause the designated use
to be in violation of this LDC.

regulations. Where an antenna will not exceed the highest point of the existing
structure upon which it is to be mounted, such evidence shall not be required.
   (D)   Shared use of communication towers.
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this LDC, to minimize
adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of
telecommunication towers, colocation of facilities on existing or new towers
shall be encouraged by:
         (a)   Only issuing permits to qualified shared facilities at locations
where it appears there may be more demand for towers than the property can
reasonably accommodate; or
         (b)   Giving preference to qualified shared facilities over other
facilities in authorizing use at particular locations.
      (2)   For a facility to become a qualified shared facility, the facility
owner must show that:
         (a)   The facility is appropriately designed for sharing; and
         (b)   The facility owner is prepared to offer adequate space on the
facility to others on fair and reasonable, nondiscriminatory terms.
      (3)   To satisfy the requirements of division (D)(2)(b) of this section,

limits of the city. The list shall include the location, height, and available
capacity for additional antennas as well as the name, address, and phone and
facsimile number of the applicant. The city shall make these lists available to
applicants to assist in the collocation of antennas.
      (5)   Collocation of communication antennas by more than one provider on
existing or new telecommunication towers shall take precedence over the
construction of new single-use telecommunication towers. Accordingly, each
application for a telecommunication tower shall include the following:
         (a)   A written evaluation of the feasibility of sharing a
telecommunication tower, if an appropriate telecommunication tower or towers
is/are available. The evaluation shall analyze one or more of the following
factors:
            1.   Structural capacity of the tower or towers;
            2.   Radio frequency interference;
            3.   Geographical coverage requirements;
            4.   Mechanical or electrical incompatibility;
            5.   Inability or ability to locate equipment on the tower or
towers;
            6.   Availability of towers for collocation;
            7.   Any restrictions or limitations of the Federal Communications
Commission that would preclude the shared use of the tower.
            8.   Additional information requested by the city.
         (b)   The city may deny an application if an available collocation is
feasible and the application is not for such collocation.
      (6)   A telecommunication tower that is determined to be inappropriate
for sharing shall be assumed to be inappropriate for sharing the same types of
facilities in the future. Such towers will not need to be evaluated in the
future regarding sharing with the same type of facility for which it has been
determined to be inappropriate. The city shall retain a list of such towers and
will provide a copy of the list to all potential applicants. The city may
require additional sharing feasibility evaluations if warranted by changes in
technology.
      (7)   For any telecommunications tower approved for shared use, the owner
of the tower shall provide notice of the location of the telecommunication
tower and the tower's load capacity to the city. The city will maintain and
make this list available to all applicants.
   (E)   Applications.
      (1)   The city shall act promptly on any application submitted in
accordance with the provisions of this LDC. The reasons for rejecting any
application filed under these provisions shall be explained, set forth in
writing, and based on substantial evidence.
      (2)   The issuance of a permit, however, is not a lease, and no
municipally-owned property may be used without a lease agreement with the city.
The city may, as appropriate to protect its property and the public interest,
establish additional requirements beyond the minimum requirements of a permit
for municipally-owned property. Furthermore, nothing in this LDC shall prohibit
the city from requiring additional provisions in a lease.

§ 155.632 BUFFERYARD BETWEEN RESIDENTIAL AND NON-RESIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Applicability.
      (1)   The provisions of this section shall apply to proposed
nonresidential development adjacent to a developed or site plan approved
residential site.
      (2)   If a residential site is proposed adjacent to an existing
nonresidential site, the provisions of this division shall not apply.
   (B)   The goal of the bufferyard is to accomplish the following:
      (1)   To better reinforce compatible development with adjacent
residential and non- residential land uses, particularly low-density
residential uses through proper land use transitions and buffering techniques;
      (2)   To provide more adequately for the proper site for nonresidential
accessory uses such as loading, refuse storage, parking, mechanical equipment
and exterior lighting that can be the cause for noise, dust, glare, and other
nuisances or inconveniences in proximity to low-density residential areas;
      (3)   To provide unobstructed minimal space for fire access, driveways,
and service roads to service nonresidential activities; and
      (4)   To provide unobstructed space for adequate landscaping to screen
and/or soften the visual impact of nonresidential uses that adjoin residential
settings.
   (C)   Bufferyard characteristics.
      (1)   Bufferyards shall be a minimum of 100 feet wide on all adjacent
sides exclusive of street facings. At a minimum the first 50 feet shall be
dedicated to landscaping to permit minimum space for the creation of landscape
berm, mounds, and the planting of vegetation including shade trees and hedge
materials.
      (2)   The following is permitted in bufferyards, only in areas which lie
beyond the required landscaped portions of the bufferyard area:
         (a)   Drainage easements;
         (b)   Fences, walls and hedges;
         (c)   Parking;
         (d)   Service drives;
         (e)   Sidewalks or walkways;
         (f)   Television antennas, satellite dishes;
         (g)   Utility easements.
   (D)   Alternative bufferyard.
      (1)   The Planning and Zoning Board may approve other means of buffering
including, but not limited to, a solid masonry wall, which shall be a minimum
of six feet in height, for amendments, to nonresidential site plans, when one
of the following apply:
         (a)   The previously approved bufferyard is being reduced in size; or
         (b)   The scope of the site plan amendment includes demolition of more
than 50% of the previously approved structure on a site or plat of land
regardless of ownership.
      (2)   All landscape areas shall be established beyond any and all
required utility, drainage, or other easements that would compromise the
establishment of dense landscaping without interfering with utilities.
      (3)   Landscaping requirements.
         (a)   One shade tree of a height not less than 12 feet with a three
inch caliper trunk measured at a height of four and one- half feet above grade
shall be planted for each 500 square feet of landscaped bufferyard. Provided,
however, one-half of the required trees may be other landscaped material if it
complies with the requirements of this section as determined by the Planning
and Zoning Board.
         (b)   The final landscape design shall provide an effective visual
screen between the two uses within three years of planting. Hedge materials and
suitable ground cover shall be provided. Hedging shall be planted to a height
not less than two feet at installation. Irrigation shall be required in all
landscaped areas.
         (c)   Grass seeding shall be provided during the initial phases of
site development to mitigate against the nuisance factors that occur during
large-scale construction.

LIGHTING
§ 155.685 PURPOSE AND INTENT - LIGHTING.
   The purpose and intent of this subchapter is to ensure that exterior
(outdoor) lighting positively enhances the visual impact of a building or
project on surrounding properties and uses. To that end, exterior lighting at a
building or project should be designed, operated, and installed in a consistent
and coordinated fashion to provide safe, convenient and efficient lighting for
customers, pedestrians and vehicles, while avoiding the creation of hot spots,
glare, obtrusive light, light pollution, light trespass, and visual nuisance.
Also, exterior lighting should accentuate key architectural elements of a
building or project, and highlight or otherwise emphasize landscape features.
   (A)   Guiding principles.
      (1)   Lighting designs shall be of a consistent design within each
respective site, and should minimize light trespass/pollution and impact on
neighboring properties and natural habitats, while ensuring safety, security,
utility, productivity, commerce, livability, and enjoyment. Lighting equipment
should be responsibly selected and sourced through careful consideration of the
short and long-term financial, environmental, and social costs incurred through
lighting.
      (2)   Energy and resource should be conserved to the greatest extent
possible. Designs should be practical as well as financially and
technologically feasible, based on industry-acceptable best practices. Energy
efficient practices and lighting is encouraged.

federal codes and regulations.
   (B)   Exterior lighting plan. An exterior lighting plan, including a
photometric plan (which covers the parcel which is the site of the building or
project in question), appropriate pole, fixture, and lamp cut sheets, and
descriptions of lenses and appropriate data tables, shall be submitted for site
plan review.
      (1)   The exterior lighting plan shall be prepared by a licensed
professional engineer, who shall certify that the exterior lighting plan
complies with this section.
      (2)   The photometric plan shall be prepared in a scale that is easily
legible. The current edition of the IES Lighting Handbook, published by the
Illumination Engineers Society is the standard to be used by the engineer as a
guide for the design and testing of lighting plans.
      (3)   The standards contained therein shall apply unless standards
developed and adopted by this section or subsequent amendments are more
restrictive, in which case the more restrictive standards shall apply.
      (4)   Lighting equipment must be of commercial quality and listed with a
Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) such as Underwriters
Laboratories (U.L.) or Electrical Testing Labs (ETL).
   (C)   Pole lighting height standard. All private, pole mounted, outdoor
surface lot lighting shall be limited to 30 feet in height above grade. Non-
vehicular pedestrian areas shall incorporate pedestrian scale lighting where
appropriate.
   (D)   Illumination levels. The maximum illumination for a project shall be
12 f.c. with the minimum average illumination, at grade, to be not less than
two f.c., average maintained over the site. The illumination level at the
property line of any project shall be a maximum of 0.5 f.c. To avoid glare or
spill light from encroaching onto adjacent properties, illumination shall be
installed with house side shields and reflectors, and shall be maintained in
such a manner as to confine light rays to the premises of the building or
project. Color correlated temperature (CCT): The maximum CCT for a site shall
be as follows:

implemented to minimize or prevent glare, light trespass, and light pollution.
      (4)   When up lighting is required, lighting systems should be low in
intensity and incorporate full shielding.
      (5)   Ground mounted lighting should be screened from view.
   (G)   Construction lighting.
      (1)   All construction site lighting fixtures must be full cut-off or
directionally shielded fixtures that are aimed and controlled so the directed
light is substantially confined to the object intended to be illuminated and
not directly visible outside of the property.
      (2)   Interior construction lights shall be extinguished after the work
has been completed for the day unless needed to ensure safety, security, or
legal compliance.
      (3)   A building is no longer considered under construction once exterior
walls and windows are installed and permanent lighting replaces temporary
lighting as the primary source of light for the building.
   (H)   Nonconforming lighting.
      (1)   When 50% or more of any component (e.g., luminaires, poles) of the
exterior lighting system at a building or project is upgraded, changed, or
replaced (not including regular maintenance), such component for the remainder
of the exterior lighting shall be brought in compliance with all applicable
requirements of this section.
      (2)   In the event less than 50% of the exterior lighting system is being
replaced and the Planning and Economic Development Director or designee
determine that an equivalent replacement is no longer obtainable, due to
obsolescence or lack of supply, such component for the remainder of exterior
light shall be brought in compliance with all applicable requirements of this
section.

SIGNS
§ 155.695 PURPOSE - SIGNS.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to create the framework for a
comprehensive but balanced system of sign control, thereby facilitating a clear
and pleasant communication between people and their environment. It is the
belief of the City Commission that the nature of signs is to provide an index
to the needed goods and services. It is the intention of this subchapter to
authorize the use of signs which are:
      (1)    Appropriate in dimension and scale with surrounding buildings,
shopping center and community.
      (2)   Content neutral.
      (3)   Expressive of the identity of individual proprietors or the
community as a whole.
      (4)   Legible under the circumstances in which they are seen.
      (5)   Effective in indexing the environment.
      (6)   Promotive of the aesthetics, health, safety, welfare, and the
assurance of protection of adequate lighting, energy, and air space within the
city by regulation of the posting, displaying, erection, use, and maintenance
of signs.
      (7)   May also be determined by staff to ensure the sign is complimentary
to the surrounding community.
   (B)   Applicability. The provisions of this subchapter include but are not
limited to:
      (1)   General standards;
      (2)   Location;
      (3)   Sign plans;

display any statement, word, character, or illustration of an obscene nature,
as defined by F.S. Ch. 847, as may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   Measurement. A sign calculation graphic will be maintained in the
Planning and Economic Development Department.
   (C)   Misleading. It shall be unlawful for a person to display false or
misleading statements upon signs, intended to mislead the public as to anything
sold, any services to be performed or information disseminated. The fact that
any sign or display shall contain words or language sufficient to mislead a
reasonable and prudent person in reading same, shall be prima facie evidence of
a violation of this section by the person displaying the sign or permitting
same to be displayed.
   (D)   Non-commercial copy. Any sign authorized in this subchapter may
contain non-commercial copy in lieu of any other copy. However, in
nonresidential zoning districts, the area of a sign containing non-commercial
copy shall be construed to count towards the total signage area allowed for the
sign type that it most closely resembles. Any sign allowed under this
subchapter may contain, in lieu of any other message or copy, any lawful non-
commercial message that does not direct attention to a business operated for
profit, or to a product, commodity or service for sale or lease, or to any
other commercial interest or activity, so long as said sign complies with the
size, height, area and other requirements of this subchapter.
   (E)   In accordance with F.S. § 526.111, 526.121, and 553.79, as may be
amended from time to time, this subchapter shall not apply to the design,
construction, or location of signage advertising the retail price of gasoline.
   (F)   In accordance with F.S. § 533.79, as amended from time to time, this
subchapter does not authorize the city to adopt or enforce any regulation that
conflicts with or impairs corporate trademarks, service marks, trade dress,
logos, color patterns, design scheme insignia, image standards, or other
features of corporate branding identity on real property or improvements
thereon used in activities conducted under F.S. Ch. 526, or in carrying out
business activities defined as a franchise by Federal Trade Commission
regulations in 16 C.F.R. § 436.1, et seq. This division does not affect any
requirement for design and construction in the Florida Building Code.

(Ord. 936, passed 10-17-90)
§ 156.13 MEASUREMENT OF CAPACITIES.
   (A)   Water and wastewater. Measurement of water and wastewater facilities
will be based on design capacities and service flows. Usage and discharge will
be based on adopted level of service standards. These levels may be amended
when substantiated by engineering studies which are reviewed and approved by
the City Engineer and/or amendment to the Pembroke Pines Comprehensive Plan.
   (B)   Roadways. The initial measurement of highway capacities is the Florida
DOT Table of Generalized Daily Level-of-Service Maximum Volumes, made available
to local government for use from January 1989 through December 1990. Future
capacities standards will be issued by FDOT as necessary. The measurement of
capacity may also be determined through substantiation in the form of
engineering studies or other data. Traffic analysis techniques must be
technically sound and justifiable as determined by the City Engineer.
Alterations to capacity on the State Highway Network shall require the
opportunity for FDOT review. Any developments that are determined to be within
or create a compact deferral area may be reviewed with input by the Broward
County Office of Planning and any other affected agencies to determine if an
Action Plan can resolve the capacity deficiencies.
   (C)   Drainage. Measurement of drainage facilities will be based on the
South Florida Water Management District and the South Broward Drainage District
basin design standards. Variations may exist for specific parcels but the
overall effect of the area drainage system must meet established water

as follows:
      (1)   The total design capacity of existing facilities operating at the
required level of service; and
      (2)   The total design capacity of new facilities that will come
available concurrent with the impact of the development. The capacity of new
facilities may be counted only if one or more of the following is demonstrated:
         (a)   The necessary facilities are in place at the time a development
permit is issued, or a development permit is issued subject to the condition
that the necessary facilities will be in place when the impacts of development
occur.
         (b)   Construction of the new facilities is under way at the time of
application and will be complete prior to Certificate of Occupancy.
         (c)   The new facilities are the subject of a binding executed
contract for the construction of the facilities to be constructed within a
period of time as stipulated in the contract or the provision of services at
the time the development permit is issued.
         (d)   The new facilities have been included in the city/county/state
capital improvement program annual budget.
         (e)   The new facilities are guaranteed at a specific time in an
enforceable development agreement. An enforceable development agreement may
include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to F.S. §
163.3220, or an agreement or development order pursuant to F.S. Chapter 380.
Such facilities must be consistent with the Capital Improvements Element of the
City/County Comprehensive Plan and approved by the City/County Engineer.
         (f)   The developer has contributed funds to the city/county necessary
to provide new facilities consistent with the Capital Improvements Element of
the City/County Comprehensive Plan. Commitment that the facilities will be
built must be evidenced by an appropriate budget amendment and appropriation by
the city/county or other governmental entity.
         (g)   Specific to transportation.
            1.   The proposed development does not place any trips on an over
capacity roadway link.
            2.   There is an approved action plan to accommodate the traffic
impact of the development.
            3.   Satisfaction of Broward County concurrency standards. The
burden shall be on the applicant to demonstrate compliance with the standards
detailed in this section. If applicable, the development application shall be
reviewed to ensure that the proposed development satisfies the Broward County
Concurrency Standards for the Regional Road Network as outlined in § 5-182(a)
of the Broward County Land Development Code, as amended from time to time. The
applicant shall provide the necessary documentation from Broward County
demonstrating satisfaction of these requirements. The applicant may choose to
satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements by making a proportionate
share contribution to an eligible transportation project located within the
Southwest Concurrency District, pursuant to the requirements set forth in § 5-
182(a)(5)(b)(4) of the Broward County Land Development Code, as amended from
time to time, and § 163.3280, Florida Statutes, as amended from time to time.
            4.   The options available for and methodology for determining the
amount of proportionate share mitigation, and the procedures for the city to
implement such proportionate share mitigation on the city’s roadway network,
shall be as specified in § 5-182(a)(5)(b)(4) of the Broward County Land
Development Code, as amended from time to time.
         (h)   The development is authorized by an approved Development of
Regional Impact (DRI) Development Order.
         (i)   The proposed development is found to have vested rights with
regard to any affected roadway segments or infrastructure capacity
reservations.
         (j)   This determination may not be satisfied by the transfer of
committed capacity from a previously approved plat or DRI to another parcel of
land not included within the previous plat or DRI.
   (B)   Subtracting from division (A) the sum of:
      (1)   The design demand for the service created by existing development,
if applicable; and
      (2)   The new design demand for the service (by phase or otherwise) that
will be created concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development and by
the anticipated completion of other presently approved developments.
   (C)   Infrastructure construction. If infrastructure construction is
necessary to meet adopted levels of service, the developer must complete
construction and issue performance bonds to insure completion of work or risk
forfeiture of favorable concurrency status. If a developer in the area wishes
to complete off site infrastructure construction that may or may not be part of
other effective developers agreements, he may do so in accordance with a new
developers agreement that may entail reimbursable clauses for off site work and
facility oversizing to meet area needs. The original developer will be
contacted concerning the potential of work being deleted from his developers
agreement. It shall be determined by the city that modifying the original
developers agreement is in the best interests of the city. The original
developer must pay reasonable infrastructure costs to new developers under the
terms of the original or modified developers agreement.

development activity to ensure the development is consistent with the city
Comprehensive Plan. A concurrency monitoring system is instituted to verify
that public facilities and services will be available at adopted levels of
service concurrent with the impacts of the development on those prescribed
facility or service standards.
   (B)   Certificate of concurrency. Applications for development permits shall
be chronologically logged to determine rights to available capacity. Compliance
will be calculated and capacity reserved with the issuance of a certificate of
concurrency.
   (C)   Certificate of concurrency procedures. The general parameters for the
issuance of a certificate of concurrency are as follows:
      (1)   For petitions controlled by §
156.10(A) and (B), if the property is unplatted, then concurrency would be
established through platting the property. If the property is platted, then
concurrency determination would be reviewed through amendment to the plat to be
approved by both the City Commission and the Broward County Commission. The
amendment will stipulate the intensity of development.
      (2)   For petitions controlled by §
156.10(C), concurrency certificates will be issued through an amendment to the
note on the plat and will be approved by the City Commission and the Broward
County Commission. The amendment will stipulate the intensity of development.
   (D)   Intergovernmental coordination. The City Planning Department shall
coordinate concurrency activities within and outside the city. The City
Planning Department, Public Works Department, Fire Department and Police
Department shall act as liaisons depending on the specific level of service
standard with the South Florida Regional Planning Council, Broward County and/
or any other municipality or governmental entity to review technical issues of

CHAPTER 159: SPECIAL DISTRICTS
Section
   
159.01   Safe Neighborhood Improvement Districts
§ 159.01 SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS.
   (A)   The City Commission hereby finds and declares that among the many
causes of deterioration in the business and residential neighborhoods of the
state are the following: proliferation of crime, automobile traffic flow
strangled by outmoded street patterns, unsuitable topography, faulty lot
layouts, fragmentation of land uses and parking areas necessitating frequent
automobile movement, lack of separation of pedestrian areas from automobile
traffic, lack of separation of vehicle traffic lanes and railroad traffic, and
excessive noise levels from automobile traffic.
   (B)   The City Commission further finds and declares that safe neighborhoods
are the product of planning and implementation of appropriate environmental
design concepts, comprehensive crime prevention programs, land use
recommendations, and beautification techniques.
   (C)   The City Commission further finds and declares that the provisions of
this part and the powers granted to local governments, property owners'
associations, special dependent districts, and community redevelopment
neighborhood improvement districts are desirable to guide and accomplish the
coordinated, balanced, and harmonious development of safe neighborhoods; to
promote the health, safety, and general welfare of these areas and their
inhabitants, visitors, property owners, and workers; to establish, maintain,
and preserve property values and preserve and foster the development of
attractive neighborhood and business environments: to prevent overcrowding and
congestion: to improve or redirect automobile traffic and provide pedestrian
safety; to reduce crime rates and the opportunities for the commission of
crime; and to provide improvements in neighborhoods so they are defensible
against crime.
   (D)   It is the intent of the City Commission to authorize the creation of
Safe Neighborhood Improvement Districts as provided in F.S. §§ 163.501 through
163.526, also known as the Safe Neighborhood Improvement Act (the "Act"), to
assist the City in implementing plans that employ crime prevention through
community policing innovations, environmental design, environmental security,
and defensible space techniques to establish safe neighborhoods. The
Legislature, therefore, declares that the development, redevelopment,
preservation, and revitalization of neighborhoods in this state, and all the
purposes of this part, are public purposes for which public money may be
borrowed, expended, loaned, and granted.
