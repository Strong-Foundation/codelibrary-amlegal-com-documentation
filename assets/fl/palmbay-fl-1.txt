ordinances into one ordinance in book form, and
   WHEREAS, the City Council of the City of Palm Bay has authorized a general

general and permanent nature and publication of such ordinances in book form.
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ENACTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF PALM BAY,
BREVARD COUNTY, FLORIDA, as follows:

comprehensive ordinance which consists of all general and permanent ordinances
of the City of Palm Bay, Florida, enacted up to and including Ordinance No. 95-

and to extract from such Code all provisions which from time to time may be
repealed by the City Council. This copy of such Code shall be available for all
persons desiring to examine the same.
   Section 4. It shall be unlawful for any person to change or alter by
additions or deletions, any part or portion of such Code, or to insert or
delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in such
manner whatsoever which will cause the laws of the City of Palm Bay to be
misrepresented thereby. Any person violating this section shall be punished as
provided in Chapter 10, of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Palm Bay,
Florida.
   Section 5. Whenever in such Code an act is prohibited or is made or declared
to be unlawful or an offense or a misdemeanor by the City Council, or whenever

provided in such other section shall be held to relate to the section so
amended, unless such penalty is specifically repealed therein.

hereby repealed and all ordinances or parts of ordinances not in conflict
herewith are hereby continued in full force and effect.

this ordinance is held or declared to be either unconstitutional, invalid,
inapplicable, inoperative or void, then such declaration shall not be construed
to affect other portions of the ordinance; it is hereby declared to be the
express opinion of the City Council of the City of Palm Bay that any such
unconstitutional, invalid, inapplicable, inoperative or void portion or
portions of this ordinance did not induce its passage, and that without the
inclusion of any such portion or portions of this ordinance, the City Council
would have enacted the valid constitutional portions thereof.

supervisor of elections or the official designated by city council to determine
the number of registered voters who signed it. The city clerk shall, within

force and effect. Further, this subchapter shall not restrict or replace cost
recovery from funding sources available under state and federal regulations

   (D)   Conditions for indemnification and representation. The duty to defend
or indemnify and save harmless as prescribed by this section shall be
conditioned upon the prompt cooperation by the official in his or her own

notice with the City Manager requesting indemnification, which notice shall
include all relevant documents, including all summons, writs, judgments,

or a complaint, where the official enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere,
or where said official is found guilty of any action in violation of local,

violations, so long as such violation does not involve intentional, wanton,
willful, or reckless behavior.
      (3)   At the request of any member of the City Council, the City Manager
or the City Attorney, a "good cause" determination shall be made by the Risk
Management Committee at a hearing on any request for representation or
indemnification made by an official. The official shall be provided at least 20
days notice prior to the hearing. The sole issue before the Risk Management
Committee shall be the obligation of the city to indemnify or provide a defense
for the official, and the merits of the claim made against the official shall
not be an issue, so that the defense of the claim shall not be prejudiced. At
the hearing, the city and the official may offer such witnesses or other
evidence as is relevant to a determination. The Risk Management Committee may
call its own witnesses or any person that will help in the determination to be
made. Witnesses shall give sworn testimony. At the conclusion of the hearing,
the Risk Management Committee shall make its findings of fact and conclusions
on the evidence, which shall be final and binding.
      (4)   If the Risk Management Committee finds that good cause exists to
refuse to provide the official with indemnification or defense, the city may
refuse to pay any judgment or decree previously or subsequently entered against
any official, and may refuse to proceed with the indemnification or defense of
a pending charge allegation or claim. Further, any attorney's fees, costs, or
other expenses already paid by the city, if any, on behalf of the official
relating to the claims, allegation or charges may be recovered by the city.
Should the official fail to repay these fees, costs and expenses, the city may
bring a civil action against the official for recovery of such.
      (5)    When a charge, claim, indictment, or allegation is brought against
an elected officer by reason of such official being or having been an elected
officer, or the subject matter of which is in any way related to the elected
officer's official duties, prior to city representation or reimbursement of
expenses, the elected officer shall sign a contract with the city which shall
contain a requirement and legally binding agreement providing for the repayment
to the city, in full, of all costs, attorney's fees or other expenses, incurred
by the city in the defense of the elected officers in the event of a final
determination by an administrative judge or commission, of final judgement,
mandate or order by a state or federal court, of guilt, bad faith, malicious
purpose, an award of punitive damages, or the flagrant, willful or intentional
violation of a city ordinance, or state or federal lawn by that elected
officer. The elected officer shall also be responsible for repayment in full in
the event the elected officer pleads guilty or no contest (nolo contendere) to

   (C)   The City Manager or the person designated by the City Manager to
investigate complaints (Investigator) shall conduct a preliminary investigation
within 30 days of the receipt of the complaint. The preliminary investigation
shall determine if the complaint merits further investigation. The Investigator
may confer with the City Attorney or the City Attorney's designee regarding

Investigator may consolidate investigations when complaints allege the same or
similar improper governmental action.
   (G)   Upon completion of a full investigation, a final written report
containing the findings and conclusions of the investigation shall be delivered
to the complainant, complainant's department, and the City Council. The report

who are otherwise protected by the state's Whistle-blower's Act. The provisions
of this subchapter may not be used by employees while they are under the care,
custody, or control of the state or county correctional system, or after their
release from the care, custody or control of the state or county correctional
system, with respect to circumstances that occurred during any period of

within sixty (60) days after the action prohibited by this subchapter with the
City Attorney. The written complaint must set forth the facts which constitute

Department of Administrative Hearings (DOAH) within sixty (60) days, except the
City Attorney shall have the authority to extend such time for reasonable
cause.

and shall be based exclusively on the evidence of record and on matters
officially recognized. The presiding officer shall complete and submit to the

interpretation of administrative rule and must make a finding that its
substituted conclusion of law or interpretation of an administrative rule is as
or more reasonable than that which was rejected or modified. Rejection or
modification of conclusions of law may not form the basis for rejection or
modification of findings of fact.
   (E)   If the written complaint directly involves a public officer appointed
by the City Council pursuant to the City Charter, the presiding officer shall
submit its findings to the City Council for a final decision. The City Council

as the final order of the city. The City Council may reject or modify the
conclusions of law and interpretation of ordinances and administrative rules.
When rejecting or modifying such conclusion of law or interpretation of an
administrative rule, the City Council must state with particularity the reasons
for rejecting or modifying such conclusion of law or interpretation of
administrative rule and must make a finding that its substituted conclusion of
law or interpretation of administrative rule is as or more reasonable than that
which was rejected or modified. Rejection or modification of conclusions of law
may not form the basis for rejection or modification of findings of fact.

§ 34.28 RELIEF.
   (A)   In any case brought under this subchapter in which the City Manager or

and the City Manager or City Council, as may be applicable, may direct the
employee to pay the costs of the hearing, including the employer's attorney's
fees.
   (C)   In any case where the final decision is reached pursuant to §
34.27(D), in favor of the complainant, the City Council shall direct the City
Manager to grant relief pursuant to the provisions within this section.
(Ord. 2002-30, passed 4-18-02; Am. Ord. 2020-75, passed 11-5-20)
§ 34.29 DEFENSES.
   In order to establish retaliation as an affirmative defense to an adverse
personnel action, the employee must demonstrate that the employee's activity
under this subchapter was protected activity and was the primary reason for the
action the employee is grieving or appealing. The city may rebut this defense
if it demonstrates that it would have taken the same action regardless of the
employee's participation in the activity protected under this subchapter, and
that the adverse personnel action was taken for legitimate business reasons.

§ 38.08 MANDATORY CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS.
   The Mandatory City Council approval amount is defined as the minimum
purchasing amount at which City Council approval is required. Such purchases
must be approved by the City Council prior to execution of the contract or
purchase order.
   (A)   City Council approval of an award recommendation does not constitute a
binding contract with the recommended vendor until execution of a purchase
order or contract by the City.
   (B)   Council approval is required for all the following circumstances prior
to execution of the contract or purchase order:
      (1)   Council approval for purchases or award of contracts solicited via
competitive solicitation equal to or greater than one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000.00) total expenditure for the initial contract term;
      (2)   Council approval for purchases or award of contracts for items
delineated as Exclusions per §
38.07(B) equal to or greater than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00)
total expenditure for the initial contract term;
      (3)   Council approval for purchases or award of contracts for items
delineated as Special Procurements per §
38.07(C) equal to or greater than $25,000 total expenditure for the initial
contract term;

contracts originally awarded for one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) or
more shall be ten percent (10%) or one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00)
whichever is lower. For calculation purposes, the ten percent (10%) threshold
amount is cumulative;
      (5)   Council approval for task orders against continuing contracts
issued for professional services equal to or greater than one hundred thousand
dollars ($100,000.00); and
      (6)   Council approval for amendments to contracts and task orders

be ten percent (10%) or one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) whichever is
lower, except as provided in § 38.08(C). For calculation purposes, the ten
percent (10%) threshold amount is cumulative.
   (C)   Contract duration and term contracts:
      (1)   For calculation purposes, initial contract term is the duration
first agreed to by both parties, prior to renewal options. This is typically
one year, but in the case of longer initial term (i.e. two-year initial terms),
value is calculated by adding the values of the years comprising the initial
term.
      (2)   Contract amendments to term contracts do not require City Council
approval and shall be made in accordance with the Procurement Administrative
Codes.
   (D)   Purchases, awards, construction change orders, and contract amendments
not exceeding the mandatory City Council approval amount shall be made in
accordance with the Procurement Administrative Codes.
   (E)   The Chief Procurement Officer will prepare a report for Council
acknowledgement of competitive solicitations issued by the Procurement
Department and awarded in accordance with the Procurement Administrative Codes
which are under the mandatory City Council approval amount. Reporting
requirements will be further delineated in the Procurement Administrative
Codes.

§ 38.13 METHODS OF PROCUREMENT.
   The Chief Procurement Officer shall determine the appropriate method of
source selection for each procurement method, among the following:
   (A)   Competitive Sealed Bid Process.
      (1)   Invitation for Bids. The Invitation for Bids (IFB) process shall be
the preferred method of procurement and shall be awarded to the lowest
responsive and responsible bidder. The IFB solicitation document shall include
the specifications and all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the
procurement.
      (2)   Public notice of the IFB shall be published on the City's website
for a reasonable period prior to bid opening. For construction projects,
advertisements will be processed in compliance with Fla. Stat. § 255.025, where
applicable, and will include the location of the bid opening. The public notice
shall state the place, due date and time for delivery/receipt. Bids received
after the time and date specified in the IFB document shall not be opened and
shall not be accepted for consideration. IFBs may include pricing for the life
cycle cost of items and shall be awarded to the lowest responsive and
responsible bidder, considering all pertinent qualifications of the recommended
awardee.
      (3)   The Chief Procurement Officer shall have the authority to accept or
reject any portions of bids or all bids; to waive informalities and minor
irregularities; and to cancel and resolicit the requirement at any time prior
to execution of a purchase order or contract for the solicitation.
      (4)   The competitive sealed bid process shall be further delineated in
the Procurement Administrative Codes and the City's IFB solicitation document.
   (B)   Competitive Sealed Proposal Process.
      (1)   Request for Proposals. When it is determined by the Chief
Procurement Officer that the use of competitive sealed bidding is either not
practical, not advantageous to the City due to the technical or specialized
nature of the goods and/or services sought, or best value procurement will
result in selection of the best qualified vendor/contractor at a reasonable
price, the City may utilize the competitive sealed proposal process. A Request
for Proposals (RFP) shall be used as the solicitation document.
      (2)   Public notice of the RFP shall be published on the City's website
for a reasonable period prior to RFP opening, but at a minimum of fourteen (14)
calendar days. The public notice shall state the place, due date and time for
delivery/receipt. Proposals received after the time and date specified in the
RFP document shall not be opened and shall not be accepted for consideration.
      (3)   The Chief Procurement Officer shall have the authority to accept or
reject any portions of proposals or all proposals; to waive informalities and
minor irregularities; and cancel and resolicit the requirement at any time
prior to execution of a purchase order or contract for the solicitation.
      (4)   The RFP process shall be further delineated in the Procurement
Administrative Codes and the City's RFP solicitation document.
   (C)   Request for Qualifications (RFQ) Process.
      (1)   When it is determined by the Chief Procurement Officer to be the
best method of procurement and for the procurement of services in accordance
with Fla. Stat. § 287.055 for professional architects, engineers, landscape
architect, surveyors, and mapping services, the City may utilitze the
competitive qualification process. A Request for Qualifications (RFQ) shall be
used as the solicitation document..
      (2)   Continuing contracts for these services may be solicited and
entered into on a rotational basis, in accordance with Fla. Stat. § 287.055(2)
(g), and as further delineated in the Procurement Administrative Codes. The
master contracts may have an expiration date, but in accordance with Fla. Stat.
§ 287.055(2)(g) may have no time limitation except that the master contract
shall provide a termination clause. Services shall be authorized via issuance
of Task Orders.
      (3)   Public notice of the RFQ shall be published on the City's website
for a reasonable period prior to RFQ opening. The public notice shall state the
place, due date and time for delivery/receipt. Submittals received after the
date and time specified in the RFQ document shall not be opened and shall not
be accepted for consideration.
      (4)   The Chief Procurement Officer shall have the authority to accept or
reject any portions of submittals or all submittals; to waive informalities and
minor irregularities; and cancel and resolicit the requirement at any time
prior to execution of a purchase order or contract for the solicitation.
      (5)   The RFQ process shall be completed in accordance with Fla. Stat. §
287.055 and further delineated in the Procurement Administrative Codes and the
City's RFQ solicitation document.
   (D)   Competitive Negotiations Process.
      (1)   When the Chief Procurement Officer determines that the use of
competitive negotiations would be advantageous to the City, the competitive
negotiations process may be used. An Invitation to Negotiate (ITN) shall be the
solicitation document.
      (2)   The goal of an ITN is to obtain proposals from interested and
qualified firms so that the City may enter into negotiations with the firm or
firms determined most capable of providing the required supplies and services.
      (3)   The ITN document will supply the firms with information necessary
to understand the need; however, the terms, scope of work, price, method of
delivery, conditions of performance, and approaches of the project may be open
to consideration and negotiations, including simultaneous negotiations with the
most qualified firms.
      (4)   ITNs may not be used for procuring professional services addressed
by Fla. Stat. § 287.055 (CCNA).
      (5)   Public notice of the ITN shall be published on the City's website
for a reasonable period prior to the due date/time but at a minimum of fourteen
(14) calendar days. The public notice shall state the place, due date and time
for delivery/receipt. Submittals received after the designated time and date
shall not be opened and shall not be accepted for consideration.
      (6)   The Chief Procurement Officer shall have the authority to accept or
reject any portions of submittals or all submittals; to waive informalities
and/or minor irregularities; and cancel and resolicit the requirement at any
time prior to execution of a purchase order or contract for the solicitation.
      (7)   The competitive negotiations process shall be further delineated in
the Procurement Administrative Codes and the ITN solicitation document.
   (E)   Multi-Step Competitive Solicitation / Request for Information (RFI)
Process.
      (1)   When it is considered impractical to initially prepare a purchase
description to support an award based on price or detailed scope of work, any
competitive solicitation may be preceded by a Request for Information (RFI)
requesting the submission of information, which will provide input for the
specifications or scope of work to be included in a subsequent competitive
solicitation.
      (2)   The RFI process shall be further delineated in the Procurement
Adminstrative Codes and the RFI document.
      (3)   As determined by the Chief Procurement Officer, the Multi-Step
Competitive Solicitation can also be used for source selection by combining the
elements of both competitive sealed bids and sealed proposals. The Multi-Step
process shall be further delineated in the Procurement Administrative Codes and
the solicitation document.
   (F)   Alternative source selection.
      (1)   Small purchases. Any purchase for an amount less than the mandatory
City Council approval amount shall be made in accordance with those procedures
promulgated in the Procurement Administrative Codes, provided, however, no
purchase shall be artificially divided so as to constitute a small purchase
under this section.
      (2)   Sole source purchases.
         (a)   The Chief Procurement Officer may make or authorize the purchase
of goods and/or services, subject to the mandatory City Council approval level
stipulated in this Ordinance, without competitive solicitation when the
director of the client department has documented in writing that such good and/
or service is the only item that meets the need and is available through only
one source of supply, or when the intent to award via sole source is posted on
the City's website for a reasonable time period but at a minimum of seven (7)
calendar days, or when a documented research effort by the Chief Procurement
Officer fails to identify further competing sources of the goods or services.
Such written determinations and supporting documentation shall be retained by
the Chief Procurement Officer for public inspection and auditing purposes.
         (b)   Where standardization is determined by the Chief Procurement
Officer to be appropriate, and negotiation of such standard items is
appropriate, a sole source determination is justified.
         (c)   The sole source process shall be further delineated in the
Procurement Adminstrative Codes.
      (3)   Emergency purchases. The City Manager or Chief Procurement Officer,
if delegated in the Procurement Administrative Codes, may make or authorize
emergency purchases as defined herein.
         (a)   In the event of an emergency, such as a declaration of emergency
pursuant to Fla. Stat. § 252.38, by the Governor, or Fla. Stat. § 252.38, by
the County or City, an equipment failure, catastrophic damage to City property,
or other similar unexpected event, all formal competitive bidding procedures
are waived, and normal procurement procedures and requirements directly related
to such emergency shall be suspended; and with the approval of the City Manager
or the Chief Procurement Officer, the head of any department may purchase any
required emergency supplies, materials, equipment or services. The head of such
department shall send to the Chief Procurement Officer a requisition and copy
of the delivery record together with a full justification and circumstances of
the emergency.
         (b)   Records of emergency purchases shall be maintained by the Chief
Procurement Officer.
         (c)   A record listing of all emergency purchases exceeding the
mandatory City Council approval amount shall be submitted to the City Council
within ninety (90) days of said purchase.
         (d)   The emergency purchase process shall be further delineated in
the Procurement Administrative Codes.
      (4)   Cooperative purchases and piggyback purchases.
         (a)   The City may purchase from any cooperative contract, including
but not limited to: term contracts by the State of Florida, Federal General
Services Administration, and other governmental cooperatives and entities
within and outside the State of Florida provided that the cooperative contract
is established in compliance with the procurement procedures and requirements
of the issuing body, entity, authority, or cooperative.
         (b)   If such other governmental or cooperative contract is utilized,
the public notice requirements and the need to utilize the methods of selection
processes included in this Ordinance are obviated.
         (c)   The ability to utilize cooperative contracts shall not be
restricted by nonparticipation in the estimated quantities of the City's needs,
nor inaccurate estimates of usage by the City prior to award of the cooperative
contract. Any such contracts equal to or in excess of one hundred thousand
dollars ($100,000) shall go to the City Council for approval.
         (d)   The City may utilize (piggyback) a contract entered into by
another governmental or public entity and a provider of supplies or services
required by the City, if the Chief Procurement Officer determines that it is
practicable and advantageous for the City to employ this method of purchase,
and such contracts specify that they are cooperative procurements at the time
of solicitation or the governmental entity Procurement official otherwise
agrees to the sue of such contract in writing. Any such contracts equal to or
in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) shall go to the City
Council for approval.
         (e)   Other governmental agencies are authorized to utilize the City's
contracts.
         (f)   City departments may utilize (piggyback) a contract established
for another City department, provided such usage is in accordance with the same

strategies to ensure successful project delivery.
      (4)   Within ten (10) business days after receipt of the conceptual
proposal, the City will either (1) summarily reject the conceptual proposal and
return the proposal review fee; or (2) accept the conceptual proposal for
substantive review and notify the private entity of the anticipated time
required for the City to complete the review of the conceptual proposal.
      (5)   If the City decides to accept the conceptual proposal for
substantive review, the City will preliminarily assess whether: (1) the
proposed project is a qualifying project; (2) the proposed project delivery
model offers advantages over traditional models, for example, lower cost,
shorter schedule, increased investment, etc.; (3) the proposed project is
reasonably likely to satisfy the criteria established by the P3 Statute.
      (6)   Upon completion of review of the conceptual proposal, the city will
notify the private entity in writing of the City's position regarding the
proposed project. The City may:
         (a)   Decide not to pursue the proposed project;
         (b)   Decide to pursue the proposed project, or a similar project,
using other procurement methods (in which, if open to private companies, the
private entity may compete if otherwise qualified); or
         (c)   Decide to continue considering the proposed project under the P3
Statute and request the private entity to submit a detailed proposal (which
request shall not constitute a formal solicitation).
      (7)   The City's disposition of a conceptual proposal does not limit its
discretion or authority with respect to future projects, whether solicited or
unsolicited.
   (C)   Unsolicited detailed proposals.
      (1)   A private entity may submit an unsolicited detailed proposal to the
City, to initiate the City's consideration of whether to deem the proposed
project as a qualifying project and whether to pursue it further under the P3
Statute. The City is not obligated to pursue a project under the P3 Statute,
even if the project satisfies the statutory definition of a qualifying project.
      (2)   A private entity must tender a proposal review fee of twenty-five
thousand dollars ($25,000) with its detailed proposal, unless the private
entity has already paid a fee for review of a substantially similar conceptual
proposal, in which case the proposal review fee is twenty thousand dollars
($20,000). The City will not review a detailed proposal that is not accompanied
by the payment of this fee. The proposal review fee is non-refundable.
      (3)   A detailed proposal must contain information sufficient to inform
the City about: the detailed quality and character of the proposed qualifying
project; the detailed experience and capacity of the private entity; and the
detailed financial and implementation strategies to ensure successful project
delivery. This information should include the following:
         (a)   A description of the private entity, including name, address,
type of organization, and legal structure.
         (b)   Name and complete contact information of the primary point of
contact for the detailed proposal.
         (c)   Names and experience of proposed key project personnel.
         (d)   Type of support needed, if any, from the City, for example,
facilities, equipment, materials, personnel, financial resources, etc.
         (e)    Identification of any proprietary data used and the manner in
which it is used.
         (f)    Identification of any outside entities or professionals the
private entity has or intends to consult with respect to the project.
         (g)   The names of any other federal, state, or local agencies
receiving the same proposal.
         (h)   A complete discussion of the objective of the project, the
method of approach, the nature of the anticipated results, and the
characteristics that make it a qualifying project worthy of pursuit by the
City.
         (i)   A detailed overview of the proposed business arrangements,
including the plan for the development, financing, and operation of the
project.
         (j)   A preliminary project schedule.
         (k)   A detailed financial analysis of the proposed project.
         (l)   Specification as to when the pricing or terms of the proposal
will expire.
      (4)   Within ninety (90) business days after receipt of the detailed
proposal, the City will notify the private entity in writing of the City's
decision either to reject the detailed proposal or to accept the detailed
proposal for competitive review. During this period, the City may meet with the
private entity to gain a deeper understanding of the detailed proposal, and the
City may request that the private entity submit additional information. These
meetings will be preliminary in nature, and will not include or constitute
substantive negotiation of agreement terms. In considering whether to accept
the detailed proposal for competitive review, the City will assess whether: (1)
the proposed project is a qualifying project; (2) the proposed project delivery
model offers advantages over traditional models, for example, lower cost,
shorter schedule, increased investment, etc.; (3) the proposed project is
reasonably likely to satisfy the criteria established by the P3 Statute. The
City may determine that it requires more than ninety (90) days to complete its
review of the detailed proposal and this assessment, in which case it will
notify the private entity in writing of how much time will be required.
      (5)   An unsolicited proposal may be rejected by the City at any time.
The City has complete discretion and authority to reject any unsolicited
proposal it receives.
      (6)   If the City decides to accept an unsolicited proposal for
competitive review, the City will follow the procedural notice requirements as
provided for in the P3 Statute, including notice to affected local
jurisdictions.
      (7)   If the City decides to accept an unsolicited proposal for
competitive review, the City will advertise the potential opportunity and
accept competing detailed proposals as required in the P3 Statute.
         (a)   The advertisement will include: a general description of the
qualifying project; an invitation to submit a competing detailed proposal for
the qualifying project with or without a proposal review fee (if required),
which may propose the identical project, a functionally equivalent project, or
an alternative project that achieves the same purpose or uses the same City
resources as the proposed project; information about how to obtain more
detailed information; and a due date for responding as defined in the P3
Statute, which may be up to one hundred twenty (120) days as the circumstances
warrant.
         (b)   The City will advertise the potential opportunity in the Florida
Administrative Register at least once a week for two consecutive weeks; in a
newspaper of general circulation within the City at least once a week for two
weeks prior to the due date for competing proposals; and on the City's website
in the same manner as competitive solicitations.
   (D)   Solicited detailed proposals.
      (1)   The City may on its own initiative determine to issue a
solicitation inviting private entities to submit detailed proposals for any
opportunity that the City has identified as a qualifying project.
      (2)   Any solicitation that the City issues under the authority of the P3
Statute will identify the P3 Statute and the City's related Code sections as
the governing procurement process. The solicitation documents will specify
information necessary for interested parties to understand and respond to the
solicitation.
      (3)   If a solicited qualifying project includes design work, the
solicitation will include a design criteria package prepared by an architect,
landscape architect, or engineer licensed in this state, in accordance with
Fla. Stat. § 255.065(3)(c). The design criteria package will be sufficient to
allow private entities to prepare a bid or a response. The licensed design
professional who prepares the design criteria package will remain in the
service of the City until the qualifying project is completed.
      (4)   The City is not obligated to proceed under the P3 Statute when
soliciting proposals, and may follow any legally available procurement process,
regardless of whether the project qualifies as a qualifying project and
regardless of whether the ultimate transaction may be characterized as a P3.
   (E)   Competitive review and negotiation of detailed proposals.
      (1)   Whether received in response to a solicitation under the P3 Statute
or in response to an advertisement concerning an unsolicited proposal, the City
will designate a negotiation team to conduct negotiations concerning the
qualifying project. No person with a financial interest in the outcome of the
negotiation team's efforts or in the qualifying project may participate on the
negotiation team.
      (2)   The negotiation team's meetings are temporarily exempt from the
Sunshine Law as provided in Fla. Stat. § 286.0113(2), and Fla. Stat. § 255.065
(15). The City will record and preserve as required by law any exempt portion
of a negotiation team meeting.
      (3)   The negotiation team will conduct negotiations in accordance with
the P3 Statute.
      (4)   In its discretion, the negotiation team may recommend that the City
and the private entity enter into an interim agreement as described in the P3
Statute. The negotiation team is not authorized to enter into or otherwise bind
the City to an interim agreement. Any recommendation to enter into an interim
agreement will be brought to the City Council for consideration. Only the City
Council is authorized to approve an interim agreement.
      (5)   The negotiation team may recommend that the City and the private
entity enter into a comprehensive agreement as described in the P3 Statute. The
negotiation team is not authorized to enter into or otherwise bind the City to
a comprehensive agreement. Any recommendation to enter into a comprehensive
agreement will be brought to the City Council for consideration. Only the City
Council is authorized to approve a comprehensive agreement.
      (6)   In deciding whether to enter into a comprehensive agreement, the
City Council will consider and determine all reasonable factors, including but
not limited to:
         (a)   Whether the proposed project is a qualifying project.
         (b)   Whether the qualifying project is in the public's best interest.
         (c)   Whether the qualifying project involves a facility that is owned
by the City or for a facility for which ownership will be conveyed to the City.
         (d)   Whether the comprehensive agreement has adequate safeguards in
place to ensure that additional costs or service disruptions are not imposed on
the public in the event of material default by the private entity or
cancellation of the qualifying project by the City.
         (e)   Whether the comprehensive agreement has adequate safeguards in
place to ensure that the City or the private entity has the opportunity to add
capacity to the qualifying project or other facilities serving similar
predominantly public purposes.
         (f)   Whether the qualifying project will be owned by the City upon
completion or termination of the project and payment of amounts financed.
         (g)   Whether there is a public need for or benefit derived from the
qualifying project.
         (h)   Whether the estimated cost of the qualifying project is
reasonable in relation to similar facilities.
         (i)   Whether the comprehensive agreement will result in the timely
acquisition, design, construction, improvement, renovation, expansion,
equipping, maintenance, or operation of the qualifying project.

the conduct of their affairs. The Chief Procurement Officer shall render a
written decision to the protestant via certified U. S. mail.

Council may, in its sole discretion, dismiss the appeal or reject all bids and
proposals, which will render it moot.
   (R)   Nothing in this section is intended to affect the existing powers of
the City Council to settle actions pending before the Courts. In the event of a
court upholding the protestant's claim, the court awarded damages on behalf of
the protestant shall be solely limited to bid/proposal preparation costs, and
reimbursement of the amount of the protest application fee/protest bond as
stipulated herein.

§ 52.080 INTENT.
   It is the intent of this subchapter to promote, protect, educate and improve
the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city, by adopting the
Local Government Code Enforcement Boards Act, F.S. §§ 162.01 through 162.13,
and supplemental code enforcement procedures, as provided in F.S. §§ 162.21
through 162.30.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 1-20-22)
§ 52.081 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply

executor, administrator, trustee, or other legal entity, whether singular or
plural, masculine or feminine, as the context may require.
   REASONABLE TIME. The time that would be required by a prudent person acting
diligently to correct the violation, taking into consideration the scope of the
work required, the necessity to obtain any required permit, license or other
approval by a government agency, and delays that may reasonably be expected to
be encountered such as, but not necessarily limited to, the weather; however,
where a different time period in which to correct the violation is provided for
by the ordinance being enforced, that time period shall constitute reasonable
time for that particular violation.
   REPEAT VIOLATION. A violation of a provision of an ordinance by a person who
has been previously found by a Special Magistrate or through any other quasi-
judicial or judicial process, or who has admitted by virtue by paying a fine
imposed through a citation, to have violated the same provision within five (5)
years prior to the violation, notwithstanding the fact that the violations
occurred at different locations.
   SPECIAL MAGISTRATE. An officer appointed as provided in this subchapter who
shall have the status and authority of a Code Enforcement Board.

§ 52.082 JURISDICTION.

(Ord. 2022-11, passed 1-20-22)
§ 52.084 POWERS OF SPECIAL MAGISTRATE.

      (4)   Take testimony under oath; and
      (5)   Issue orders following a hearing, which shall have the force of law
and which shall set forth the steps necessary to bring a violation into
compliance with the code or ordinance that has been violated, including

   (B)   A Special Magistrate shall not have the power to consider requests for

   The following conflict of interest provisions shall apply to the Special
Magistrate:
   (A)   A Special Magistrate shall not engage in ex parte communications with
any party, representative of a party, or interceding person concerning an
alleged violation.
   (B)   No person who is, or may become, a party to a hearing before a Special
Magistrate shall engage in ex parte communications with any Special Magistrate
concerning that violation. This restriction shall extend to any person
appearing or interceding on behalf of a party, whether or not such person may
have a direct personal or financial interest in the property subject of the
alleged violation.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 1-20-22)
§ 52.086 PRESENTATION OF CASES.
   (A)   The code compliance officers have the primary duty of enforcing the
various codes and initiating enforcement proceedings before the Special
Magistrate. No Special Magistrate shall have the power to initiate such
enforcement proceedings.
   (B)   A code compliance officer may not initiate enforcement proceedings for
a potential violation of a duly enacted code or ordinance by way of an
anonymous complaint. A person who reports a potential violation of a code or an
ordinance must provide his or her name and address to the city before an
enforcement proceeding may occur. This division does not apply if the code
enforcement officer has reason to believe that the violation presents an
imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare or imminent destruction of
habitat or sensitive resources.
   (C)   Each case before the Special Magistrate shall be presented by the code
compliance officer issuing the notice of violation, the code compliance
supervisor, other person with knowledge of the violation or the attorney
representing the city.
   (D)   All testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The Special
Magistrate shall take testimony from the code compliance officer and the
alleged violator. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due
process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings.
   (E)   The Special Magistrate has discretion to continue a code enforcement
hearing at any time and may request additional information from either party.
   (F)   If a code enforcement hearing is continued, a date certain for the
continued code enforcement hearing shall be announced at the public hearing or
a notice shall be provided to the respondent if a date is not available at the
code enforcement hearing.
   (G)   Upon completion of all the evidence, the Special Magistrate shall
close the code enforcement hearing.
   (H)   The Special Magistrate shall immediately deliberate in open session
before the public. Although the public is welcome at the code enforcement
hearings, they shall not be allowed to participate in or address the Special
Magistrate during deliberation.
   (I)   After the conclusion of the hearing, the Special Magistrate shall
issue findings of fact, based on evidence of record and conclusions of law, and
shall issue an order affording the proper relief. The order shall include a
notice that it must be complied with by a specified date and that a fine may be
imposed and, under the conditions specified in F.S. § 162.09(1), as may be
amended from time to time, the cost of repairs may be included along with the
fine if the order is not complied with by the specified date.
   (J)   If the city prevails in enforcing a case before the Special
Magistrate, it shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in enforcing the
case before the Special Magistrate, and in any appeals from the Special
Magistrate's order. Such costs include but shall not be limited to:
investigative costs, administrative costs, prosecution costs, and preparation
of the record on appeal.
   (K)   A certified copy of the order required in division (I) may be recorded
in the public records of the county and shall constitute notice to any
subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns if the violation
concerns real property, and the findings therein shall be binding upon the
violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent
purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. If an order is recorded in the
public records pursuant to this subsection and the order is complied with by
the date specified in the order, the Special Magistrate shall issue an order
acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the public records. A
hearing is not required to issue such an order acknowledging compliance.
   (L)   In all proceedings and hearings before the Special Magistrate, the
Special Magistrate shall not be empowered to consider or rule upon the validity
of any city ordinance. The Special Magistrate shall presume the validity of all
city ordinances, except where a court of competent jurisdiction has determined
an ordinance to be invalid. Furthermore, the Special Magistrate shall not be
empowered to determine if the Special Magistrate has jurisdiction with respect
to any alleged violation of a city ordinance; if the alleged violation derives
from any city ordinance, the Special Magistrate has jurisdiction and may
proceed with the Special Magistrate's enforcement duties pursuant to F.S.
Chapter 162, and the Code of Ordinances.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 1-20-22)
§ 52.087 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES; COSTS OF REPAIR; LIENS.
   (A)   Upon being notified by the code compliance officer that a previous
order of the Special Magistrate has not been complied with by the time
specified in such order, or finding that a repeat violation has been committed,
the Special Magistrate may impose a fine at the daily rate previously set by
the Special Magistrate, or in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the
repeat violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat violation is
found to have occurred by a code compliance officer.
   (B)   If there is reason to believe that a violation or a condition causing
the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety and
welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the
Special Magistrate shall notify the City Council, which may authorize
reasonable repairs or other corrective actions required to bring the property
into compliance, or otherwise secure the property, and charge the violator with
the reasonable costs of the repairs or other corrective actions along with the
fines imposed pursuant to this section. Making such repairs does not create a
continuing obligation on the part of the city to make further repairs or to
maintain the property and does not create any liability against the City
Council for damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good
faith. If a finding of a violation or a repeat violation has been made as
provided in this section, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the
order imposing the fine by the Special Magistrate.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 1-20-22)
§ 52.088 FINES IN EXCESS OF STATUTORY LIMITS.
   (A)   When the Special Magistrate determines that the factors and criteria
in subsection (B) exist in any matters regarding violations of the Palm Bay
Code of Ordinances that involve multifamily of more than three (3) units and
commercial structures, the Special Magistrate may impose the following fines:
      (1)   For a first violation, a fine not exceed one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) for each day that the violation continues past the date set for
compliance.
      (2)   Five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per day per violation for repeat
violations;
      (3)   A fine not to exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) per
violation, if the Special Magistrate finds a violation to be irreparable or
irreversible in nature;
      (4)   In addition to such fines, the Special Magistrate may impose
additional fines to include all costs of repairs or other corrective action
taken by the City of Palm Bay in enforcing its codes and all cost of repairs
pursuant to F.S. § 162.09.
   (B)   In determining the amount of the fine to be imposed, the Special
Magistrate shall consider the following factors:
      (1)   The gravity of the violation;
      (2)   Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation;
      (3)   If the corrective actions taken by the violator were made in good
faith;
      (4)   Any previous violations committed by the violator;
      (5)   The length of time the violation existed;
      (6)   Whether the harm resulting from the violation is irreparable or
irreversible;
      (7)   The character of the surrounding neighborhood.
   (C)    Liens created pursuant to an order by the Special Magistrate and
recorded in the public record shall bear simple interest at a rate not to
exceed the legal rate allowed for such liens and may be foreclosed pursuant to
the procedure set forth in F.S. Chapter 162.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 1-20-22)
§ 52.089 OTHER REMEDIES.
   (A)   The provisions and procedures contained in this subchapter shall be in
addition and supplemental to any other remedies now existing or subsequently
provided for by law regarding violations of this Code and any other ordinance
of the city.
   (B)   The City Council may, by resolution, establish uniform schedules to be
imposed on code enforcement cases that appear before the Special Magistrate to
cover all costs of enforcement.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 1-20-22)
§ 52.090 APPEALS.
   Any aggrieved party, including the City, may appeal a ruling or order of the
Special Magistrate to the circuit court as provided by F.S. § 162.11. Such an
appeal shall not be a hearing de novo but shall be limited to appellate review
of the record created before the Special Magistrate. An appeal must be filed
within thirty (30) days of the execution of the order to be appealed.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 1-20-22)
§ 52.091 SETTLEMENT OR COMPROMISE OF LIENS.
   (A)   The Special Magistrate shall be authorized to review and approve
requests for settlement, compromise or cancellation of liens imposed pursuant
to this subchapter or F.S. Chapter 162. The Special Magistrate shall make the
determination as to whether to settle a lien for less than face value or to
cancel such lien altogether, upon submission of a Petition for Relief (form on
file) by an affected property owner or prospective owner. Approval of
settlement, compromise or cancellation shall be objectively based upon the
following:
      (1)   The market value of the real property as most recently determined
by the Brevard County Property Appraiser;
      (2)   The gravity of the violation;
      (3)   The due diligence of the property owner upon receipt of the
violation notice;
      (4)   The actions taken and the amount of money spent on correcting the
violation(s);
      (5)   Any previous violations committed by the property owner or the
property owner's tenant and/or occupant;
      (6)   Whether the violation was committed by the current property owner;
and
      (7)   Any other extenuating circumstances which justify the reduction or
refusal to reduce the amount owed.
   (B)   The City Council may, at its discretion by resolution, adopt a more
formal policy regulating the criteria for settlement, compromise or
cancellation of code enforcement liens. No reduction may be granted by the
Special Magistrate for a lien when current litigation exists in which the
primary litigants are the property owners and the city and in which the real
property is at issue.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 1-20-22)
§ 52.092 PROCEDURE FOR SETTLEMENT OR COMPROMISE OF LIENS.
   (A)   The owner or a prospective purchaser of real property against which a
code enforcement lien has been imposed may file a Petition for Relief with the
City Manager or the City Manager's designee seeking satisfaction of such code
enforcement lien with less than full payment, including partial payment in
conjunction with verified improvements to the exterior of the real property. No
such application shall be forwarded to the Special Magistrate for consideration
until the applicant has first shown that:
      (1)   All ad valorem property taxes, special assessments, city utility
charges and other government-imposed charges, fines or liens against the
subject real property have been paid or are current;
      (2)   All code violations have been corrected under required permits
issued therefore and appropriate affidavits of compliance are on-file in the
matter.
   (B)   In the event the property owner is seeking relief under this section
to facilitate a refinancing of the real property or to secure a home equity
loan, the property owner may apply for the relief notwithstanding subsection
(A)(1) above, provided a binding agreement is executed whereby the unpaid
taxes, assessments, other liens or other indebtedness will be fully satisfied
at the closing of the refinancing or home equity loan.
   (C)   Petition for Relief. In considering an application to reduce a code
enforcement lien, no settlement or satisfaction shall be approved by the
Special Magistrate with less than full payment, unless the Special Magistrate
hears the matter as a quasi-judicial hearing at a public meeting (not a public
hearing). Subsequent to the hearing, the Special Magistrate shall make specific
findings that no violation of any city ordinance currently exists on the
subject real property, or that a prospective purchaser has agreed to correct
such violations on or before a date certain, which agreement is evidenced by a
written agreement.
   (D)   Settlement of litigation. In considering whether to authorize a
reduction of a code enforcement lien to bring a litigation matter to closure,
no settlement or satisfaction shall be approved by the Special Magistrate with
less than full payment, until the Special Magistrate receives a recommendation
from both the City Attorney and the City Manager in writing, is fully apprised
of the market value of the property, the amount of the lien(s), and any other
extenuating circumstances. If time is of the essence, this determination does
not require a public meeting at the time a decision is rendered; however, the
settlement decision shall be ratified by the Special Magistrate at the next
public meeting of the Special Magistrate and the full amount of the lien shall
be placed in escrow by the closing agent until such time as the Magistrate's
order is ratified.
   (E)   Urgent settlements. In the event an applicant requests that a Petition
for Relief be considered prior to the next regularly scheduled hearing date,
good cause must be shown. Good cause may include, but is not limited to, an
unexpected short closing date for the purchase of real property. The Special
Magistrate has the sole discretion to determine whether the matter involves a
legitimate urgency which requires resolution prior to the next scheduled
hearing. Before making a determination under this subsection, the Special
Magistrate shall receive a recommendation from both the City Attorney and the
City Manager in writing, shall be fully apprised of the market value of the
property, the amount of the lien(s), and any other extenuating circumstances.
This determination does not require a public meeting at the time a decision is
rendered; however, the settlement decision shall be ratified by the Special
Magistrate at the next public meeting of the Special Magistrate and the full
amount of the lien shall be placed in escrow by the closing agent until such
time as the Magistrate's order is ratified.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 1-20-22)
§ 52.093 NUISANCES UNDER Fla. Stat. § 893.138.
   Pursuant to F.S. Chapter 166 and § 893.138, the City Council hereby creates
the public nuisance abatement process and designates a Special Magistrate to
hear public nuisance complaints. It is the intent of this section to establish
a public nuisance abatement process to promote, protect, and improve the
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by providing an
equitable, expeditious and effective method to abate public nuisances. The
Special Magistrate shall have authority to hold hearings and assess fines
against property owners and issue orders having the force of law in accordance
with the terms and conditions herein set and under the authority of F.S.
Chapter 166 and § 893.138. The Special Magistrate may impose fines not to
exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day for public nuisances;
requiring payment of reasonable costs, including reasonable attorney's fees,
associated with the investigations of and hearings on public nuisances;
imposing fines not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for
recurring public nuisances; providing for continuing jurisdiction for a period
of one (1) year over any place or premises that has been or is declared to be a
public nuisance; providing for the recording of orders on public nuisances;
providing for recorded orders on public nuisances becoming liens against the
real property that is the subject of the order; and providing for the
foreclosure of property subject to the lien and the recovery of all costs,
including reasonable attorney's fees, associated with the recording of orders
and foreclosure. The jurisdiction of the public nuisance abatement Special
Magistrate shall not be exclusive.

with any provision of any ordinance of the City regulating the use by the
Company of the streets, alleys, easements, or public ways of the City and
continue to violate the same for a period of five (5) days after the Company

successors of the City and the successors and assigns of the Company and the
same shall not be assigned or transferred without the written approval of the
City Council of the City, which will not be unreasonably withheld; provided,

Company as security for debt without such approval.

equipment throughout the area covered by its franchise as rapidly as
practicable, but, in any event, shall:

making service available impracticable. The Company shall extend cable
television service to any building within the City which is located within two
hundred (200) feet of any portion of the distribution facilities of the Company
existing at the time of the application for service. Such extension shall be
made within six (6) months after receipt of a reasonable request for such
service.

trunk cable service unless there is a density of at least fifty (50) homes per
trunk cable mile in the area of the person making the request for service. The
Company shall provide one (1) basic service outlet to all municipal facilities

calendar year, showing the exact areas of the City being served by the cable
television system and the location and identification of major component parts
of the system.
   B.   Failure on the part of the Company to diligently pursue the foregoing
requirements shall be grounds for termination of this franchise pursuant to the
terms of Section 9 hereof; provided, however, that the City may in its
discretion extend the time for the completion of construction and installation
for additional periods in the event the Company, acting in good faith,
experiences delays by reasons of circumstances beyond its control.
   C.   In the event the operation of any part of a cable television system is
discontinued for a continuous period of thirty (30) days, or in the event such
system has been installed in any public street without complying with the
requirements of the Company's franchise, the Company shall promptly, upon being
given ten (10) days notice, remove from the streets or public places all such
property and poles of such system. Any property which the Company allows to
remain in place sixty (60) days after having been notified by the City that it
must be removed, shall be considered permanently abandoned and shall become the
property of the City subject to the provision of any utility joint use
attachment agreement.
   D.   Upon the failure of the Company to satisfactorily complete any work
upon the public streets as may be required by law or the terms of its franchise

(30) days after receipt of an itemized report.
Section 12.

terminate at the point of connection of the Company's facilities to the
subscriber's receiver.
Section 13.

binding contract between the City and the Company but this ordinance shall be

of this ordinance, file with the City Clerk of the City a written acceptance of
this ordinance and the franchise herein granted, agreeing that it will comply
with all the provisions and conditions hereof and that it will refrain from
doing all things prohibited by this ordinance.
Section 14.
   In determining the five percent (5%) of the gross revenue that the Company
is required to pay the City, as provided in Section 12 of this agreement, it is
agreed and understood that there shall be included only those taxes, licenses,
fees, impositions levied or imposed by the City upon the Company in connection
with its operation to carry out the purpose of this agreement and only those
impositions or taxes by the City upon the property of the Company that is used
only and exclusively to carry out the purpose of this agreement. Any other
taxes, licenses, or impositions whatsoever, shall not be included in the
computation of said five percent (5%) of the gross revenue.

taken to resolve them in form to be approved by the City. The list shall be

regarding the quality of service, equipment malfunctions, and similar matters,
may be delegated by the City, if it so chooses, to adjust, settle or compromise
any controversy arising from operations of the Company either on behalf of the
City, the Company, or any subscriber, in accordance with the best interest of
the public; provided that any person aggrieved by a decision may appeal the
matter to the City Manager for hearing and determination. The City Manager may
accept, reject, or modify the decision and may adjust, settle, or compromise
any controversy arising from the operations of the Company under the franchise
granted pursuant to this ordinance. No adjustment, settlement, or compromise
shall be contrary to the provisions of this ordinance or of the franchise
agreement, and the City Manager, in the adjustment, settlement, or compromise
of any controversy shall have no right or authority to add to, modify or delete
any provision of this ordinance. The Company shall notify subscribers at the
time of initial subscription to the system of the procedure for reporting and

application of the Company whenever amendments are necessary either to enable
the Company to utilize new developments in television or radio signal
transmission which would improve and update cable television service in the
franchise area, or to comply with any modifications in the rules of the Federal
Communications Commission. Amendments to Federal Communications Commission
rules applicable to cable television will be incorporated into this Ordinance
within one (1) year of their adoption or at the time of franchise renewal,
which ever comes first and the Company shall keep the City advised of any such
amendments.

maintenance and operation in the City of a cable television system for the
transmitting of the television and other signals either separately or upon or
in conjunction with any public utility maintaining the same in the City with
all of the necessary and desirable appliances and appurtenances pertaining

way shall be accomplished by the jacking of an underground pipe or conduit and
under no circumstances shall any cable be constructed under a paved street,
alley or other public way by digging or excavating from the surface. The right
herein granted for purposes herein set forth shall not be exclusive and the
City reserves the right to grant a similar use of said streets, alleys,
easements, public ways and places to any persons or entities at any time during
the period of this franchise for the operation and maintenance of other cable
television systems.

emergency (hereafter “emergency”), it shall appear necessary in the reasonable
judgment of the City to cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers,

reasonable efforts to contact the Company prior to any cutting or moving of
wires, cables, amplifiers, appliances, or appurtenances of the Cable System,
and, if possible, in the City's reasonable discretion, to allow the Company to
perform any cutting or moving of the Cable System wires, cables, amplifiers,
appliances, or appurtenances. The Company shall bear all costs of
reinstallation, repair, and other costs resulting from or arising out of the
emergency cutting or removal of the Cable System; provided, however that in the

removal and reinstallation shall be borne by the City. The City shall be liable

installations of the City or of a public utility serving the City.

securing of any rights-of-ways or easements, nor shall the City be responsible
for securing any permits or agreements with other persons.

standards as set forth in Section 76.309 of the Rules of the Federal
Communication Commission. The Company shall adopt procedures for the
investigation and resolution of complaints related to the operation of the
Company's cable television system within the City, and the Company shall have
the responsibility for the administration and implementation of such
procedures. At the request of the City, the Company shall make available a
summary of written complaints from customers in Palm Bay. At the request of the
City, the Company will provide reports to the City regarding data on customer
service complaints if such reports are technically possible. The Company shall
maintain an office in Brevard County, Florida. The office shall be open during

use of the system.
   (f)   The Company's system may be installed above ground in areas where
existing power or telephone facilities are above ground, and shall be installed
underground in areas where existing power and telephone facilities are
installed underground.
   (g)   All installations in the public right-of-way shall be done by the

   (h)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance, the Company
shall comply with the Palm Bay Code of Ordinances, and all amendments made
thereto.
   (i)   It is understood that there may from time to time be within the City
various streets which the City does not have the unqualified right to authorize
the Company to use, because of reservations in favor of the dedicators or
because of other legal impediments; therefore, in making this grant, the City
does not warrant or represent as to any particular street or portion of a
street that it has the right to authorize the Company to install or maintain
portions of its cable system therein, and in each case the burden and
responsibility for making such determination in advance of the installation
shall be upon the Company.
   (j)   The Company shall have the authority to trim trees upon and
overhanging streets of the City so as to prevent the branches of such trees
from coming in contact with Company's wires and cables, all trimming to be done
under the direction of the City and at the expense of the Company.
   (k)   The Company shall promptly and at its own expense relocate, remove or
modify any part of this system which the City may request in connection with
any public purpose including the abandonment of any right-of-way street. At the
request of the City, the Company shall remove its above ground equipment and
restore the right of way if the Company abandons, discontinues or ceases to
operate the cable system in the City of Palm Bay.

or places of the City shall be kept by the Company at all times in a safe and
substantial condition.
   (n)   The Company shall, on the request of any person holding a building
moving permit issued by the City, temporarily raise or lower its lines to

authority to require such payment in advance. The Company shall be given not
less than ten (10) business days notice of a contemplated move to arrange for
temporary wire changes.
   (o)   The City shall have the right to inspect the system with reasonable
notice and during regular business hours, with a Company representative
present, to insure compliance with the above provisions.
   (p)   At the request of the City, the Company will establish a Citizens'
Advisory Group for the purpose of providing for Palm Bay Company customers'
input. This group will function in an advisory capacity and will meet at a
minimum semiannually.
Section 7. Performance Bond.
   In case of any disturbance of pavement, roadway, easement, vegetation,
sidewalk, driveway or any other surfacing (hereafter “improvements”), the
Company shall at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the City
Manager replace and restore any improvements so disturbed in as good condition
as before said work was commenced. The Company will post a bond in the amount
of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) with the City for its faithful
performance of the conditions of this paragraph, said bond to be approved by
the City Manager.
Section 8. System Service.
   (a)   All structures, lines and equipment erected by the Company within the
City shall be located so as to cause no interference with the proper use of
streets, alleys, easements and other public ways and places and to minimize
interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners and
the Company shall comply with all proper and lawful ordinances of the City now
or hereafter in force. Existing poles, posts and other such structures of the
City or utility which may be available to the Company for leasing or licensing
at reasonable terms shall be used to the extent practicable in order to
minimize interference with travel. No new poles shall be erected by the Company
without the consent of the City Manager.
   (b)   In case of any disturbance of improvements, the Company shall at its
own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the City replace and restore
all improvements so disturbed in as good condition as before said work was
commenced.
   (c)   In the event that at any time during the period of this franchise the
City shall lawfully elect to alter or change any street, alley, easement or
other public way requiring the relocation of the facilities of the Company,
then in such event the Company upon reasonable notice by the City, shall remove
and relocate the same at Company's own expense.
   (d)   The Company shall extend cable television service to any residence
within the City which is located within two hundred (200) feet of any portion
of the distribution facilities of the Company existing at the time of the
application of service, except to the extent that density of homes, adverse
terrain, or other factors render making service available impractical. Such
extension shall be made within sixty (60) days after receipt of a reasonable
request for such service except where permitting takes a longer period of time.
There shall, however, be no obligation on the part of the Company to extend
feeder cable service unless there is a density of at least thirty (30)
subscribers per feeder cable mile in the area of the person making the request
for service. The Company shall provide one (1) basic service outlet to all
municipal facilities and public schools within the City's franchise area at no
cost to the City or school involved provided, however, that the structure to be
served is within two hundred (200) feet of the Company's distribution system
except to the extent that adverse terrain or other factors render making
service impractical or cost prohibitive. The Company shall serve any building
beyond two hundred (200) feet if the owner of said building pays the cost of
the extension to such building.
   (e)   The Company shall make available, to any residential subscriber so
requesting, a parental “lock-out” device. The Company shall advise all
residential subscribers regarding the availability of this device, and an
additional reasonable charge for any such device may be imposed.
   (f)   In the case of an emergency or disaster, the Company shall provide
emergency override capability on cable channels for transmission of emergency
or disaster information. This service shall be shared and coordinated with
Brevard County and the other governmental entities within Brevard County served
by the same system.
   (g)   The Company at all times shall be solely responsible for complying
fully with all applicable regulations from time to time established by the FCC,
and any other state or federal agency which now or hereafter has jurisdiction
over the cable television activities of the Company, and it is expressly agreed
that the Company may be entitled to renegotiate or amend the provisions hereof
because amended or newly enacted regulations of the Company's activities and
business are more onerous or expensive for the Company to implement.
Section 9. Government Access Channel.
   At the time of the contemplated system upgrade, the Company shall designate
a channel for governmental use. This channel shall be shared by the various
governmental entities served by the same company system. Any segment of the
Government access channel established for the City shall be under sole control
of the City. Any City programming must meet technical standards of Grantee.
Section 10. Discriminatory Practices Prohibited.
   The Company shall not as to rates, charges, service facilities, rules,
regulations, or in any other respect make or grant any preference or advantage
to any person nor subject any person to any prejudice or disadvantage;
provided, however, this shall not be deemed to prohibit the establishment of a
graduated scale of charges and classified rates schedules to which any customer
coming within such classification shall be entitled. This provision shall not
apply to discounts provided to owners or operators of multiple unit dwelling
complexes when such discounts or contract rates are provided under contract or
“bulk” agreements.
Section 11. City Police Power.
   The right is hereby reserved to the City to adopt, in addition to the
provisions herein contained and existing applicable ordinances, such additional
ordinances as it shall find necessary in the exercise of the police power,
provided that such regulations shall be reasonable and not in conflict with the
rights herein granted and not in conflict with the laws of the State of Florida
or the United States of America.
Section 12. Franchise Term.
   This franchise shall be renewed for a period of fifteen (15) years from the
current expiration date of May 16, 1995. The City herewith grants to the
Company the option and privilege for renewal of this franchise for ten (10)
years upon terms and conditions to be then agreed upon provided, however, that
such renewal shall be granted by the City after a public hearing with due
notice to the public, at which hearing, the City Council shall make a
determination that it is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare
of the citizens of Palm Bay to renew this franchise. Such option and privilege
to renew this franchise may be exercised by the Company by giving the City
notice in writing of its election to exercise this option. Such renewal shall
require acceptance by the Company within sixty (60) days.
Section 13. Surrender of Franchise.
   The Company may surrender this franchise at any time upon filing with the
City Clerk of the City a written notice of its intention to do so at least six
(6) months before the surrender date. On the surrender date specified in the
notice, all of the rights and privileges and all of the obligations, duties and
liabilities of the Company shall terminate.
Section 14. Rate Regulation.
   Pursuant to federal law, the City shall have the right to exercise its rate
regulatory authority or to refrain from exercising such regulation for any
period of time as its sole discretion. The City shall provide advance
notification to the Company of its intention to exercise any such regulation.
Any such regulation may be adopted by ordinance or resolution at the option of
the City with notice to the Company.
Section 15. Compliance with Applicable Laws and Regulations.
   The construction of new facilities shall be applied for and approved by the

   (a)   All of the rights and privileges of all obligations, duties and
liabilities created by this franchise shall pass to and be binding upon the
successors of the City and the successors and assigns of the Company and the
same shall not be assigned or transferred without the written approval of the
City Council, which will not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that
this shall not prevent the assignment of the franchise by the Company as
security for debt without such approval. No such prior consent or approval of
the City shall be required for any transfer or assignment to a person
controlling, or controlled by, or under the same common control as the Company.
   (b)   A change in, transfer of, or acquisition of control includes an
acquisition of more than fifty percent (50%) of the capital interests of the
Company by a person or a group of related persons who before the acquisition
owned less than fifty percent (50%), or any change in actual working control in
whatever manner exercised.
Section 18. Re-regulation.
   Company agrees that in the event that the Congress of the United States,
Federal Communications Commission, or any other appropriate governmental
agency, by ruling of case law or otherwise allows additional regulatory
authority regarding rates and fees, programming, basic channel carriage or any
other regulatory authority to be exercised by the City, then and in that event
this franchise shall allow such additional or other regulation to be undertaken
by the City at such time that it is legally permissible to do so. The City
shall be entitled to pass an ordinance supplementing this franchise ordinance
implementing the rights then granted by law as above set forth. The City will
notify the Company thirty (30) days prior by certified mail of a proposed
ordinance and shall allow the Company opportunity for input and discussion.
Section 19. City Code.

   If at any time there is an issue of compliance between the City and the
Company which cannot be resolved between the City and the Company, the
following procedure shall be implemented:
   A.   The City Manager or designee shall notify the Company in writing of the
exact nature of the alleged violation constituting a ground for termination and
give the Company thirty (30) days, or such greater amount of time as the City
Manager may specify, to correct such violation or to present facts and
arguments to refute the alleged violation.
   B.   If the City Manager then concludes that there is a basis for
termination, he or she shall notify the Company thereof by certified mail.
   C.   If within the designated time the Company does not remedy and/or put an
end to the alleged violation, the City Council, after a public hearing where
all interested parties may be heard, may suspend or revoke the franchise if it
determines that such action is warranted.
   D.   The Company shall not be held in default nor suffer any penalties where
non-compliance or default is caused by an event beyond the Company's control.
   E.   The Company shall have the right to review by a court of competent
jurisdiction upon any determination by the City Council of noncompliance.
Section 21. Right of Condemnation Reserved.
   Nothing herein shall limit any right the City may have to acquire by eminent

§ 54.10 FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY [ORDINANCE NO. 2004-12]
An Ordinance Granting to Florida Power & Light Company, Its Successors and
Assigns, an Electric Franchise, Imposing Provisions and Conditions Relating
Thereto, and Providing for Monthly Payments to the City.
Be It Enacted by the City of Palm Bay, Florida:
Section 1.
   There is hereby granted to Florida Power & Light Company, its successors and
assigns (hereinafter called the "Grantee"), for the period of thirty (30) years
from the effective date hereof, the nonexclusive right, privilege and franchise
(hereinafter called "franchise") to construct, operate and maintain in, under,
upon, along, over and across the present and future roads, streets, alleys,
bridges, easements, rights-of-way and other public places (hereinafter called
"public rights-of-way") throughout all of the incorporated areas, as such
incorporated areas may be constituted from time to time, of the City of Palm
Bay, Florida, and its successors (hereinafter called the "Grantor"), in
accordance with the Grantee's customary practice with respect to construction
and maintenance, electric light and power facilities, including, without
limitation, conduits, poles, wires, transmission and distribution lines, and
all other facilities installed in conjunction with or ancillary to all of the
Grantee's operations (hereinafter called "facilities"), for the purpose of
supplying electricity and other services to the Grantor and its successors, the
inhabitants thereof, and persons beyond the limits thereof. This grant of
authority to Grantee excludes telecommunication services for resale to third
parties.
Section 2.
   The facilities of the Grantee shall be installed, located or relocated so as
to not unreasonably interfere with traffic over the public rights-of-way or
with reasonable egress from and ingress to abutting property. To avoid
conflicts with traffic, the location or relocation of all facilities shall be
made as representatives of the Grantor may prescribe in accordance with the
Grantor's reasonable rules and regulations with reference to the placing and
maintaining in, under, upon, along, over and across said public rights-of-way;
provided, however, that such rules or regulations (a) shall not prohibit the
exercise of the Grantee's right to use said public rights-of-way for reasons
other than unreasonable interference with motor vehicular traffic, (b) shall
not unreasonably interfere with the Grantee's ability to furnish reasonably
sufficient, adequate and efficient electric service to all of its customers,
and (c) shall not require the relocation of any of the Grantee's facilities
installed before or after the effective date hereof in public rights-of-way
unless or until widening or otherwise changing the configuration of the paved
portion of any public right-of-way used by motor vehicles causes such installed
facilities to unreasonably interfere with motor vehicular traffic. Such rules
and regulations shall recognize that above-grade facilities of the Grantee
installed after the effective date hereof should be installed near the outer
boundaries of the public rights-of-way to the extent possible. When any portion
of a public right-of-way is excavated by the Grantee in the location or
relocation of any of its facilities, the portion of the public right-of-way so
excavated shall within a reasonable time be replaced by the Grantee at its
expense and in as good condition as it was at the time of such excavation. The
Grantor shall not be liable to the Grantee for any cost or expense in
connection with any relocation of the Grantee's facilities required under
subsection (c) of this Section, except, however, the Grantee shall be entitled
to reimbursement of its costs from others and as may be provided by law.
Section 3.
   The Grantor shall not be liable or responsible in any manner whatsoever for
any accident, personal injury, property damage or any claim or damage that may
occur in the course of the construction, installation, operation or maintenance
by Grantee, its employees, agents, contractors, sublessees or licensees of any
of its facilities, except for damage specifically caused by or arising out of
the negligence, strict liability, intentional torts or criminal acts of the
Grantor. Nothing in this Franchise Agreement shall be construed to affect in
any way the Grantor's rights, privileges, immunities under the doctrine of
"sovereign immunity" as set forth in § 768.28, Florida Statutes. The Grantee
agrees to indemnify, and hold harmless the Grantor, its officers, agents and
employees from and against any and all claims, suits, actions and causes of
action arising during the term of this Franchise Agreement and resulting in
personal injury, loss of life or damage to property sustained by any person or
entity, caused by or arising out of Grantee's negligent construction, operation
or maintenance of its electric system facilities within the City of Palm Bay,
including all costs, attorneys fees, expenses, including any appeal, or
proceeding and any order, judgment or decree which may be entered in any such
action or proceeding, except for damages specifically caused by or arising out
of negligence, strict liability, intentional torts or criminal acts of the
Grantor, its officers, agents, employees or contractors. Nothing in this
Franchise Agreement shall be construed to affect in any way the Grantor's
rights, privileges, and immunities under the doctrine of "sovereign immunity"
as set forth in § 768.28, Florida Statutes.
Section 4.
   All rates and rules and regulations established by the Grantee from time to
time shall be subject to such regulation as may be provided by law.
Section 5.
   As a consideration for this Franchise Agreement, the Grantee shall pay to
the Grantor, commencing ninety (90) days after the effective date hereof, and
each month thereafter for the remainder of the term of this Franchise
Agreement, an amount which added to the amount of all licenses, excises, fees,
charges and other impositions of any kind whatsoever (except ad valorem
property taxes and non-ad valorem tax assessments on property and charges for
municipal services including, but not limited to water, sewer, stormwater and
inspection fees) levied or imposed by the Grantor against the Grantee's
property, business or operations and those of its subsidiaries during the
Grantee's monthly billing period ending 60 days prior to each such payment will
equal five point nine percent (5.9%) of the Grantee's billed revenues, less
actual write-offs, from the sale of electrical energy to residential,
commercial and industrial customers (as such customers are defined by FPL's
tariff) within the incorporated areas of the Grantor for the monthly billing
period ending sixty (60) days prior to each such payment, and in no event shall
payment for the rights and privileges granted herein exceed five point nine
percent (5.9%) of such revenues for any monthly billing period of the Grantee.
   The Grantor understands and agrees that such revenues as described in the
preceding paragraph are limited, as in the existing Franchise, Section 54.10,
Code of Ordinances, to the precise revenues described therein, and that such
revenues do not include, by way of example and not limitation: (a) revenues
from the sale of electrical energy for Public Street and Highway Lighting
(service for lighting public ways and areas); (b) revenues from Other Sales to
Public Authorities (service with eligibility restricted to governmental
entities); (c) revenues from Sales to Railroads and Railways (service supplied
for propulsion of electric transit vehicles); (d) revenues from Sales for
Resale (service to other utilities for resale purposes); (e) franchise fees;
(f) Late Payment Charges; (g) Field Collection Charges; (h) other service
charges.
Section 6.
   As a further consideration, during the term of this Franchise Agreement or
any extension thereof, the Grantor agrees: (a) not to engage in the
distribution and/or sale, in competition with the Grantee, of electric capacity
and/or electric energy to any ultimate consumer of electric utility service
(herein called a "retail customer") or to any electrical distribution system
established solely to serve any retail customer formerly served by the Grantee,
(b) not to participate in any proceeding or contractual arrangement, the
purpose or terms of which would be to obligate the Grantee to transmit and/or
distribute, electric capacity and/or electric energy from any third party(ies)
to any other retail customer's facility(ies), and (c) not to seek to have the
Grantee transmit and/or distribute electric capacity and/or electric energy
generated by or on behalf of the Grantor at one location to the Grantor's
facility(ies) at any other location(s). Nothing specified herein shall prohibit
the Grantor from engaging with other utilities or persons in wholesale
transactions which are subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act.
   Nothing herein shall prohibit the Grantor, if permitted by law, (i) from
purchasing electric capacity and/or electric energy from any other person, or
(ii) from seeking to have the Grantee transmit and/or distribute to any
facility(ies) of the Grantor electric capacity and/or electric energy purchased
by the Grantor from any other person; provided, however, that before the
Grantor elects to purchase electric capacity and/or electric energy from any
other person, the Grantor shall notify the Grantee. Such notice shall include a
summary of the specific rates, terms and conditions which have been offered by
the other person and identify the Grantor's facilities to be served under the
offer. The Grantee shall thereafter have ninety (90) days to evaluate the offer
and, if the Grantee offers rates, terms and conditions which are equal to or
better than those offered by the other person, the Grantor shall be obligated
to continue to purchase from the Grantee electric capacity and/or electric
energy to serve the previously-identified facilities of the Grantor for a term
no shorter than that offered by the other person. If the Grantee does not agree
to rates, terms and conditions which equal or better the other person's offer,
all of the terms and conditions of this Franchise Agreement shall remain in
effect.
Section 7.
   If the Grantor grants a right, privilege or franchise to any other person or
otherwise enables any other such person to construct, operate or maintain
electric light and power facilities within any part of the incorporated areas
of the Grantor in which the Grantee may lawfully serve or compete on terms and
conditions which the Grantee determines are more favorable than the terms and
conditions contained herein, the Grantee may at any time thereafter terminate
this Franchise Agreement if such terms and conditions are not remedied within
the time period provided hereafter. The Grantee shall give the Grantorat least
sixty (60) days advance written notice of its intent to terminate. Such notice
shall, without prejudice to any of the rights reserved for the Grantee herein,
advise the Grantor of such terms and conditions that it considers more
favorable. The Grantor shall then have sixty (60) days in which to correct or
otherwise remedy the terms and conditions complained of by the Grantee. If the
Grantee determines that such terms or conditions are not remedied by the
Grantor within said time period, the Grantee may terminate this Franchise
Agreement by delivering written notice to the Grantor's Clerk and termination
shall be effective on the date of delivery of such notice.
Section 8.
   If as a direct or indirect consequence of any legislative, regulatory or
other action by the United States of America or the State of Florida (or any
department, agency, authority, instrumentality or political subdivision of
either of them) any person is permitted to provide electric service within the
incorporated areas of the Grantor to a customer then being served by the
Grantee, or to any new applicant for electric service within any part of the
incorporated areas of the Grantor in which the Grantee may lawfully serve, and
the Grantee determines that its obligations hereunder, or otherwise resulting
from this Franchise Agreement in respect to rates and service, place it at a
competitive disadvantage with respect to such other person, the Grantee may, at
any time after the taking of such action, terminate this Franchise Agreement if
such competitive disadvantage is not remedied within the time period provided
hereafter. The Grantee shall give the Grantor at least ninety (90) days advance
written notice of its intent to terminate. Such notice shall, without prejudice
to any of the rights reserved for the Grantee herein, advise the Grantor of the
consequences of such action which resulted in the competitive disadvantage. The
Grantor shall then have ninety (90) days in which to correct or otherwise
remedy the competitive disadvantage. If such competitive disadvantage is not
remedied by the Grantor within said time period, the Grantee may terminate this
Franchise Agreement by delivering written notice to the Grantor's Clerk and
termination shall take effect on the date of delivery of such notice.
Section 9.
   Failure on the part of the Grantee to comply in any substantial respect with
any of the provisions of this franchise shall be grounds for forfeiture, but no
such forfeiture shall take effect if the reasonableness or propriety thereof is
protested by the Grantee until there is final determination (after the
expiration or exhaustion of all rights of appeal) by a court of competent
jurisdiction that the Grantee has failed to comply in a substantial respect
with any of the provisions of this franchise, and the Grantee shall have six
months after such final determination to make good the default before a
forfeiture shall result with the right of the Grantor at its discretion to
grant such additional time to the Grantee for compliance as necessities in the
case require.

of the provisions of this ordinance, including but not limited to: (a) denying
the Grantee use of public rights-of-way for reasons other than unreasonable
interference with motor vehicular traffic; (b) imposing conditions for use of
public rights-of-way contrary to Florida law or the terms and conditions of
this franchise; (c) unreasonable delay in issuing the Grantee a use permit, if
any, to construct its facilities in public rights-of-way, shall constitute
breach of this franchise and entitle the Grantee to withhold all or part of the
payments provided for in Section 5 hereof until such time as a use permit is
issued or a court of competent jurisdiction has reached a final determination
in the matter. The parties recognize and agree that nothing in this Franchise
Agreement constitutes or shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of a party's
delegated sovereign right of condemnation and that each party, in their sole
discretion, may exercise such right.
Section 11.
   If during the term of this franchise the Grantee enters into a Franchise
Agreement with any other municipality located in Brevard County, Florida, the
population of which is equal to or less than that of theGrantor, the terms of
which provide for the payment of franchise fees by the Grantee at a rate
greater than six percent (6%) of the Grantee's residential, commercial and
industrial revenues, under the same terms and conditions as specified in
Section 5 hereof, the Grantee, upon written request of the Grantor, shall
negotiate and enter into a new Franchise Agreement with the Grantor in which
the percentage to be used in calculating monthly payments under Section 5
hereof shall be no greater than that percentage which the Grantee has agreed to
use as a basis for the calculation of payments to the other Brevard County
municipality, provided, however, that such new Franchise Agreement shall
include additional benefits to the Grantee, in addition to all benefits
provided herein, at least equal to those provided by its franchise agreement
with the other Brevard County municipality. Subject to all limitations, terms
and conditions specified in the preceding sentence, the Grantor shall have the
sole discretion to determine the percentage to be used in calculating monthly
payments, and the Grantee shall have the sole discretion to determine those
benefits to which it would be entitled, under any such new franchise agreement.

each anniversary date of this franchise, at the Grantor's expense, examine the
records of the Grantee relating to the calculation of the franchise payment for

maintained. Records not prepared by the Grantee in the ordinary course of
business may be provided at the Grantor's expense and as the Grantor and the
Grantee may agree in writing. Information identifying the Grantee's customers

corporate limits of the City. Gross revenue for purposes of this ordinance
shall be defined as the revenue received by the company for the sale of gas and
shall not include revenue from rental of or repairs to equipment.
   The City further agrees that should any other company be granted the right
to provide similar gas services in the city limits and should the franchise fee
charged them be less than the sum set forth herein, then the franchise fee
charged the Company shall be reduced to the lowest fee charged by the City to a
Company in competition with the company herein.
Section 5. Rates and Charges.
   The Company, its successors and assigns, shall at all times be limited in
its charges for service furnished in accordance with this franchise to the
schedule of charges which shall be presented to and approved by the City
Council. The gas rates currently in effect on the date of adoption of this
ordinance shall continue in effect pursuant to the terms of the previous
franchise contained in Ordinance No. 62-5, which was held by General
Development Utilities, Inc., until modified or changed by the parties hereto.
The Company may, if it deems it necessary to amend or change said schedule of
charges, give the City notice in writing of same. Within sixty (60) days after
notice as aforementioned, the City shall authorize and hold a public hearing
and within thirty (30) days after such public hearing, if the City shall
decline to act, then the Company may forthwith put into effect such amendments
or change of schedule. It is understood and agreed that if the Company should
raise charges as hereinabove stated, the monies so collected shall be escrowed
by the Company with a national or state banking institution, or the Company
shall post with the City a good and sufficient surety bond, for a period of
ninety (90) days. In the event the City should deny the raise at any time
during this ninety (90) day period, the Company shall refund to its customers
the monies collected by virtue of the raise. However, upon the expiration of
the said ninety (90) days, the monies collected, if no action is taken by the
City theretofore, shall become the funds of the Company and there shall be no
further obligation on the part of the Company to escrow any monies or in the
case of a surety bond, said surety bond will no longer be in force, and the
increase in charges will continue the same as if the request of the Company had
been granted. If at any time the rates for the gas service are insufficient to
maintain and operate with an allowance for a fair return as determined by the
formula and criteria used by the L.P. Gas Division of the Agricultural
Department of the State of Florida on the replacement or reproduction value of
the Company's property used and useful in furnishing gas, for maintenance and
operation of the Company and an allowance for the replacement of equipment, and
an allowance for debt service and an allowance being made for the depreciation
of the gas system which will include all pipe lines, storage tanks, machinery
and equipment and appurtenances thereto and in general all parts and portions
of the gas system in the entirety, and all taxes of every description levied or
imposed on the Company or its property, revenues, income and expenses, the City
shall have the right and power to fix and make effective such rates as are
reasonable, sufficient and compensatory, after taking into consideration the
matters herein referred to. Any tax or charge imposed by any governmental
authority on the Company which is a tax imposed solely because the Company is a
utility, as distinguished from other individuals, corporations or businesses in
general, may be apportioned among the consumers as a direct tax upon the
consumers without resort to the City for permission to increase the Company's
rates.
Section 6. Review of Company's Plans and Specifications.
   The Company agrees that the location or relocation of all facilities shall
be made in compliance with such rules and regulations as are now or hereafter
may be imposed by the City. The Company agrees that all plans and
specifications for the extension, location or relocation of any gas facilities
shall be approved by the City prior to commencement of any construction. Such
approval shall not unreasonably interfere with the proper operation and
construction of the Company's facilities and services. The Company agrees to
pay the inspection costs of the City in addition to the franchise fee. This
inspection cost shall be a charge approved by the City by ordinance.
Section 7. Compliance with Regulation.
   The Company agrees that in the construction, operation, extension, expansion
and maintenance of the gas system, it will, at all times, comply with all City
ordinances, comprehensive plan, statutes, and duly promulgated rules, standards
and regulations as may be imposed by the City, State or Federal Government or
their agencies and within their lawful authority. The City has the right, upon
request, to inspect Company facilities and equipment during normal Company
working hours.
Section 8. Indemnification.
   The Company shall, at all times, protect, indemnify and save harmless the
City, its boards, officers, agents, representatives, officials, and employees
and any other city agencies and their members, officers, representatives,
agents, officials, and employees, against any and all liabilities for injury to
or death of any person or any damage to any property or any other liability,
including but not limited to reasonable attorney's fees and court costs for
both, trial and any appeals thereto, caused by the company, the Company's
officers, representatives, agents, officials, contractors and all
subcontractors, whether subcontractors of the Company or the Company's
contractors, or employees, in the construction, operation, repair, or
maintenance of its property, or arising out of the exercise of any right or
privilege under the franchise.
Section 9. Comprehensive Liability Insurance.
   At all times during the term of the franchise the Company will, at the
Company's expense, maintain in force general comprehensive liability insurance
with an insurance company approved by the City, the policy or policies to be in
form satisfactory to the City Attorney. The coverage represented by the policy
or policies shall be for the protection of the City, its officers,
representatives, agents, officials, and employees against liability for loss or
damages for bodily injury, death, and property damage occasioned by the
activities of the Company under the franchise. Minimum liability limits under
the policy or policies are to be one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) combined
single limits for personal injury or death, or damage to property resulting
from any one occurrence and in the aggregate. The policies mentioned in the
foregoing sentence shall each contain a provision that a written notice of any
cancellation or reduction in coverage of the policies shall be delivered to the
City ninety (90) days in advance of the effective date of any cancellation.
Section 10. Service Standards.
   The Company shall at all times provide and furnish an adequate, safe and
continuous supply of liquefied petroleum gas to the City and its inhabitants,
subject, however, to the further provisions of this section. The Company shall
not be liable to the City or its inhabitants nor shall the City, or any
inhabitant who is a customer of the Company be liable to the Company hereunder
by reason of failure of the Company to deliver, or of the City or a customer to
receive, gas as a result of acts of God or the public enemy, inability of
pipeline suppliers or gas suppliers to furnish an adequate supply due to an
emergency, an order or decision of a public regulatory body, or other acts
beyond the control of the party affected. Whenever any of the occurrences named
above take place, the Company shall have the right and authority and it shall
be its duty to adopt reasonable rules and regulations in connection with limits
curtailing or allocating extensions of service or supplying of gas to any
customer or prospective customer, and withholding the selling of gas to new
customers, provided that such rules and regulations shall be uniform as applied
to each class of customers, and shall be nondiscriminatory. The Company shall
have the right to sell gas for industrial use on an interruptible basis,
requiring the customer to have standby equipment for the use upon notice by the
Company. The Company rules, regulation, schedule or contracts for curtailing
interruptible gas service shall be uniform as applied to each class of
interruptible customers. If service is suspended because of any of the reasons
set forth above, occurring through no fault or negligent act on the part of
this Company, such suspension shall not be made the basis of an action or
proceeding to terminate this franchise.
Section 11. Franchise Purchase Option.
   For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
the parties hereby acknowledge, the City hereby has the right to purchase the
pipeline system of the Company located within the City of Palm Bay and the City
shall provide written notice of intent to exercise its right to purchase the
company within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the two (2)
appraisals as hereinafter provided. After such notice by the City, should it
elect to exercise its right to purchase, the closing on such sale and purchase
shall occur within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the City conducts
any survey, investigation, evaluation or due diligence (investigation), of
whatever type or nature, it deems necessary. Such investigation shall be
concluded by the City within sixty (60) days after providing notice of its
intent to exercise its right to purchase under this provision.
   The purchase price shall be determined, established and set as follows:
      a)   within ten (10) days after the City notifies the Company of its
intent to exercise its right to purchase the Company, both the City and the
Company shall select a professional and experienced appraiser, appraising
company or firm (appraiser) qualified to appraise and evaluate entities that
provide the same services and are in the same type of business as the Company;
      b)   both appraisers shall utilize the same methods or procedure of
evaluation to determine the value of the Company;
      c)   the value of the Company shall be determined by adding together the
valuations established by each appraiser and dividing the sum total of the two
amounts by two (2); that is, the value and purchase price for the Company shall
be the average of the two (2) values set by the appraisals;
      d)   should the appraisers be unable to agree upon the method of
evaluation to be utilized within five (5) days after their appointment, then
the City and the Company shall each submit to the appraisers the method they
deem appropriate. The appraisers shall then utilize the method drawn by lot
from those submitted by the City and the Company.
      Should the City determine it does not desire to purchase the Company
after it conducts its investigation, the City shall notify the Company and
shall be thereafter relieved of any obligation or responsibility to purchase.
Section 12. Approval of Transfer.
   No sale, assignment or lease of this franchise shall be effective until it
is approved by the City Council and until the vendee, assignee or lessee has
filed in the office of the City Clerk an instrument duly executed reciting the
fact of such a sale assignment or lease, accepting the terms of the franchise
and an agreement to perform all the conditions thereof, together with a
current, certified financial statement prepared by a C.P.A. licensed to do
business in the State of Florida. The City will not unreasonably withhold its
approval or delay the approval. The City will approve or disapprove the
purchaser within sixty (60) days from request for approval being requested by
the Company.
Section 13. Default.
   The failure on the part of Company to comply in any respect with any of the
provisions of this ordinance shall be grounds for forfeiture of this grant.
However, no such forfeiture shall take effect if the propriety thereof is
protested by the Company in a hearing before the City Council of the City to
determine if the Company has failed to comply in any respect with provisions of
this franchise. The Company shall have three (3) months after the final
determination of the City Council to remedy any defaults the City Council may
find before a forfeiture shall become final with the right of the City, at its
discretion, to grant such additional time to Company for compliance, as
necessities in the case may require.
   Upon written notice by the City to the Company that any provision of this
ordinance has been violated or breached, the Company shall have the right to
request a hearing before the City Council to determine if the violation or
breach is a basis to terminate the franchise granted hereunder. Such request
for a hearing shall be made in writing to the City Clerk at the City of Palm
Bay within ten (10) days after receipt of the notice. After the request for
hearing is made by the Company, a hearing will be held by the City Council
within forty five (45) days from the date of request, unless such time is
expanded by the agreement of both the City and the Company. City Council shall
render its decision on the hearing within twenty (20) days from the date of the
hearing. The Company and the City shall have the right to present and cross-
examine witnesses, and the right to be represented by counsel at such hearing.
At anytime, the Company may appeal a decision of the City Council to a court of
competent jurisdiction for an interpretation of the issue of default.
Section 14. Failure to Comply.
   The failure on the part of the Company to comply in any substantial material
respect with any of the provisions of this ordinance shall be grounds for
forfeiture of the franchise, at the option of the City Council.
Section 15. Severability. 
   This franchise is granted pursuant to the laws of the State of Florida
relating to the granting of such rights and privileges by municipal
corporations. If any section, sentence, clause, part or provision of this
ordinance is for any reason held illegal, invalid, or unconstitutional, such
invalidity shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole, or any
other of the remaining portions. The invalidity of any portion of this
ordinance shall not affect any consideration or other obligation of the
Company.

   The provisions of this ordinance shall become effective upon due execution
and acceptance by the City and Company, respectively.

of services, or this ordinance which the Company is a party; and the Company

complying with any of the requirements of this chapter by any failure of the
City on any one or more occasions to insist upon or to seek compliance with any
such terms or conditions.
   (5)   Application Considerations. The considerations and criteria set forth
in this chapter to assist the City Council may be changed by ordinance as the
City Council deems appropriate, in accordance with law.

voluntarily leave his or her accumulated contributions in the fund for a period
of five (5) years after leaving the employ of the police department or fire
department pending the possibility of being re-employed as a police officer or
firefighter without losing credit for the time that he or she was a member of
the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the police department or

accumulated contributions shall be returned only upon written request. Upon
return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his or her rights and
benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. Upon reemployment, a
police officer or firefighter shall not receive credit for the years and

      (2)   The years or fractional parts of years that a member serves in the
military service of the Armed Forces of the United States, voluntarily or

         (a)   The member returns to his or her employment as a police officer
or firefighter within one (1) year from the date of or release from such
military service.
         (b)   The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of
the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act.
         (c)   The maximum credit for military service shall be five (5) years.
      (3)   Credited service shall not be deemed to be interrupted by any
authorized leave of absence or vacation, provided that all members similarly
situated shall be treated alike pursuant to uniform, nondiscriminatory rules.
Leave granted pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act shall not constitute
a break in service for vesting or eligibility purposes, but the period of such
leave shall not be counted as credited service for benefit purposes unless the
member pays into the fund the member contributions that would have been paid
had the member not been on leave, plus interest as determined by the Board,
within ninety (90) days after the member's return from leave, or within ninety
(90) days following the effective date of this section, whichever is later.
      (4)   Effective October 1, 2005, any police officer member who is
employed by the city on that date or after and retires or enters the DROP after
that date, who has served a minimum of ten (10) years as a sworn law
enforcement officer for the city, and who, prior to city employment, had
experience as a sworn law enforcement officer and/or in uniformed military
service, may purchase up to four (4) years of credited service for such prior
uniformed military experience or experience as a sworn law enforcement officer,
but not more than a combined total of four (4) years of credited service, in
accordance with this paragraph (4). The cost of the prior law enforcement and/
or military service purchased pursuant to this paragraph (4) shall be based on
the contributions the police officer member would have made for the purchased
time based upon the contribution rates and compensation of the police officer
member at the time of hire by the city. In addition to or in lieu of a cash
payment, the member may use the value of their accrued sick and vacation leave
to purchase all or a portion of the prior law enforcement and/or military
service purchased pursuant to this paragraph (4). The member may use any
combination of accrued sick or vacation leave, or a cash payment to purchase
all or a portion of the prior law enforcement and/or military service. In no
event may a member purchase more than four (4) years of prior law enforcement
and/or military service pursuant to this paragraph (4). Effective August 3,
2007, a police officer member who is currently eligible to purchase prior law
enforcement and/or military service in accordance with this paragraph (4) shall
have thirty-six (36) months from August 3, 2007, to purchase the prior law
enforcement and/or military service provided for in this paragraph (4).
Effective August 3, 2007, a police officer member shall have thirty-six (36)
months from the time the police officer member obtains a 100% vested interest
pursuant to §
55.10 of the Code of Ordinances to purchase the prior law enforcement and/or
military service provided for in this paragraph (4). The city reserves the
right to provide input concerning the actuarial methods and calculations to be
used to determine the cost of the prior law enforcement and/or military service
purchased pursuant to this paragraph (4). The city also reserves the right to
engage an independent actuary to review the methods and calculations of the
plan actuary, and if the two actuaries do not agree, the Board may consider the
positions of both actuaries in making a final determination as to the methods
and calculations to be used. All actuarial assumptions, cost methods, and

firefighter service, the firefighter member shall pay the full actuarial cost
thereof, as determined by the actuary and as approved by the Board. In no
circumstances may a firefighter member purchase any military experience or paid

§ 55.04 BOARD OF TRUSTEES.
   (A)   The sole and exclusive administration of and responsibility for the
proper operation of the system and for making effective the provisions of this
subchapter is hereby vested in a board of trustees. The board is hereby
designated as the plan administrator. The board shall consist of five (5)
trustees, two (2) of whom, unless otherwise prohibited by law, shall be legal
residents of the city, who shall be appointed by the Palm Bay City Council; one
(1) of whom shall be a police officer member of the system, who shall be
elected by a majority of the police officers who are members of the system; and
one (1) of whom shall be a firefighter member of the system, who shall be
elected by a majority of the firefighters who are members of the system. The
fifth trustee shall be chosen by a majority of the previous four (4) trustees,
as provided for herein, and such person's name shall be submitted to the Palm
Bay City Council. Upon receipt of the fifth person's name, the Palm Bay City
Council shall, as a ministerial duty, appoint such person to the board of
trustees as its fifth trustee. The fifth trustee shall have the same rights as
each of the other four (4) trustees appointed or elected as herein provided and
shall serve a two-year term unless he sooner vacates the office. Each resident
trustee shall serve as trustee for a period of two (2) years, unless he sooner
vacates the office or is sooner replaced by the Palm Bay City Council at whose
pleasure he shall serve. Each member trustee shall serve as trustee for a
period of two (2) years, unless he sooner leaves the employment of the city as
a police officer or firefighter or otherwise vacates his office as trustee,
whereupon a successor shall be chosen in the same manner as originally. Each
trustee may succeed himself in office. The board shall establish and administer
the nominating and election procedures for each election. The board shall meet
at least quarterly each year. The board shall be a legal entity with, in
addition to other powers and responsibilities contained herein, the power to
bring and defend lawsuits of every kind, nature and description.
   (B)   The trustees shall, by a majority vote, elect from their number a
chair, a vice-chair and a secretary. The secretary of the board shall keep a
complete minute book of the actions, proceedings or hearings of the board. The
trustees shall not receive any compensation as such, but may receive expenses
and per diem as provided by Florida law.
   (C)   Each trustee shall be entitled to one vote on the board. Three (3)
affirmative votes shall be necessary for any decision by the trustees at any
meeting of the board.
   (D)   The board shall engage such actuarial, accounting, legal and other
services as shall be required to transact the business of the system. The
compensation of all persons engaged by the board and all other expenses of the
board necessary for the operation of the system shall be paid from the fund at
such rates and in such amounts as the board shall agree. In the event the board
chooses to use the city's legal counsel, actuary or other professional,
technical or other advisors, it shall do so only under terms and conditions
acceptable to the board.
   (E)   The duties and responsibilities of the board shall include, but not
necessarily be limited to, the following:
      (1)   To construe the provisions of the system and determine all
questions arising thereunder.
      (2)   To determine all questions relating to eligibility and membership.
      (3)   To determine and certify the amount of all retirement allowances or
other benefits hereunder.
      (4)   To establish uniform rules and procedures to be followed for
administrative purposes, benefit applications and all matters required to
administer the system.
      (5)   To distribute to members, from time to time, information concerning
the system.
      (6)   To receive and process all applications for benefits.
      (7)   To authorize all payments whatsoever from the fund and to notify
the custodian, in writing, of approved benefit payments and other expenditures
arising through operation of the system.
      (8)   To have performed actuarial studies and valuations, at least as
often as required by law, and make recommendations regarding any and all
changes in the provisions of the system, including for benefit and other
improvements.
      (9)   To maintain or have maintained accurate records of credited
service, accumulated contributions and such other data as may be necessary or
prudent.

administer the system.
      (12)   Any valuation report, draft, or final, shall be deemed a public
record and made available to the City Manager and any other interested party.
   (F)   The Board may, upon written request of the retiree of the system, or
by a dependent, if authorized by the retiree or the retiree’s beneficiary,
authorize the system administrator to withhold from the monthly retirement
payment funds that are necessary to pay for the benefits being received through
the city, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the city, and to make any
payments for child support or alimony.

§ 55.05 FINANCES AND FUND MANAGEMENT; ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF FUND.
   (A)   As part of the system there exists the fund, into which shall be
deposited all of the contributions and assets whatsoever attributable to the
system.
   (B)   The actual custody and supervision of the fund (and assets thereof)
shall be vested in the board. Payment of benefits and disbursements from the
fund may be made by the custodian but only upon written authorization from the
board.
   (C)   All funds of the system may be deposited by the board with the city,
acting in a ministerial capacity only, which shall be liable in the same manner
and to the same extent as it is liable for the safekeeping of funds for the
city. However, any funds so deposited with the city shall be kept in a separate
fund or clearly identified as such funds of the system. In lieu thereof, the
board may deposit the funds of the system in a qualified public depository as
defined in Fla. Stat. § 280.02, which depository with regard to such funds
shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of Fla. Stat. Chapter
280. In order to fulfill its investment responsibilities as set forth herein,
the board may retain the services of a custodian.
   (D)   All funds and securities of the system may be commingled in the fund,
provided that accurate records are maintained at all times reflecting the
financial composition of the fund, including accurate current accounts and
entries as regards the following:
      (1)   Current amounts of accumulated contributions of members on both an
individual and aggregate account basis; and
      (2)   Receipts and disbursements; and
      (3)   Benefit payments; and
      (4)   Current amounts clearly reflecting all movies, funds and assets
whatsoever attributable to contributions and deposits from the city; and
      (5)   All interest, dividends and gains (or losses); and
      (6)   Such other entries as may be properly required so as to reflect a
clear and complete financial report of the fund.
   (E)   An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant
for the most recent plan year of the system showing a detailed listing of
assets and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such
income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning
and end of the year. Said report shall include other items normally included in
a certified audit.
   (F)   The Board, subject to the fiduciary standards in Fla. Stat. §§
112.656, 112.661, and 518.11, and the Code of Ethics in Fla. Stat. §§ 112.311
through 112.3187, shall have the following investment powers and authority,
which may be delegated to one or more investment advisors selected and
supervised by the Board.
      (1)   The fund may be invested and reinvested in such securities or
property real or personal wherever situated and of whatsoever kind, including
but not limited to stocks, common or preferred, bonds and other evidences of
indebtedness or ownership. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the
Board of Trustees may invest up to twenty-five percent (25%) of plan assets in
foreign securities on a market-value basis.
      (2)   The board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such
amount of the fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for cash
requirements of the system.
      (3)   No person or entity shall be liable for the making, retention or
sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any
loss or diminishment of the fund, except that due to his or its own negligence,
willful misconduct or lack of good faith.
      (4)   The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be
registered in or transferred into the name of the fund or into the name of such
nominee as the board may direct, or it may retain them unregistered solely to
permit transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that
all investments are part of the fund.
      (5)   The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any
stocks, bonds or securities of any corporation, association or trust and to
give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of
substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations,
consolidations and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to
deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or
like committee or with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to
amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount
resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally, to
exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds or other
investments of the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the
fund.
      (6)   At least once every three (3) years, and more often as determined
by the board, the board shall retain a professionally qualified independent
consultant, as defined in Fla. Stat. §§ 175.071 and 185.06, to evaluate the
performance of all existing investment advisors and make recommendations
regarding retention of all such investment advisors or selection of
replacements or additional investment managers. These recommendations shall be
considered by the board at its next regularly scheduled meeting.
(Ord. 2000-15, passed 5-5-00; Am. Ord. 2013-45, passed 8-13-13)
§ 55.06 CONTRIBUTIONS.
   (A)   Member contributions.
      (1)   Amount:
         (a)   Police officer members shall contribute eight and seventy-six
one-hundredths percent (8.76%) of compensation, effective September 30, 2000.
         (b)   Firefighter members shall contribute five and twenty-nine one-
hundredths percent (5.29%) of compensation, effective September 30, 2001.
Firefighter members shall contribute six and eighty-six one-hundredths percent
(6.86%) of compensation, effective October 1, 2003). Effective October 1, 2007,
firefighter members shall contribute eight and seventy-six one-hundredths
percent (8.76%) of compensation.
   Member contributions withheld by the city on behalf of members shall be
deposited in the fund immediately after each pay period. The contributions made
by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions
pursuant to Section 414(h) of the code. Such designation is contingent upon the
contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for Federal Income
Tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be
considered to be member contributions. No member shall have the option of
choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them
paid by the City to the fund.
      (2)   Method. Member contributions shall be made by payroll deduction.
      (3)   Duration. Member contributions shall be deducted until a member has
reached his actual retirement date or his termination date, whichever occurs
first.
      (4)   Suspension. Should a member be suspended and subsequently
reinstated as a police officer or firefighter, he may receive credit for the
period he was under suspension by making member contributions for such period,
and shall again become a member of the system. In the event that the
reinstatement of such member is made on the basis that he is entitled to
receive full credit for the period of service prior to his date of suspension
and for the period during his suspension as though his employment had never
terminated, then the following shall apply:
         (a)   Member contributions shall be deducted from compensation that
the city is required to pay for the period of suspension.
         (b)   If the suspended member had withdrawn his accumulated
contributions, then he shall repay to the fund an amount equal to the amount of
the withdrawal and the city shall pay interest thereon, at a rate to be
determined by the board, from the date of withdrawal to the date of repayment.
These payments shall be made within ninety (90) days of the date of
reinstatement.
         (c)   Upon satisfaction of these conditions, the suspended member
shall reenter the system and receive service credit for his credited service
prior to his suspension and for the period of suspension. During the period
from the date of reinstatement to the date when the conditions set forth in
subdivisions (a) and (b) above are satisfied, member contributions shall be
made in the same manner as for other members of the system.
         (d)   In the event that such suspended member fails to comply with
subdivision (a) above, his credited service shall begin as of his date of
reinstatement and he shall forfeit all credited service prior to the date of
reinstatement.
      (5)   Transfers between employment groups. In the event that a member of
the system changes his job status with the city such that he is considered to
be in a different employment group, he shall transfer to and become a member of
the new group for purposes of the system as of the date when the change in job
status occurs. An example of a transfer between employment groups is where a
general employee becomes a police officer. In the event of such a transfer, the
member's accumulated contributions as of the date of transfer shall remain
allocable to the previous group. The member's retirement benefit payable by the
previous group shall be calculated by using his credited service as of the date
of transfer and his average final compensation as of the date of his
termination of employment or the date of transfer, whichever amount is greater.
This benefit shall be payable commencing on the date when retirement benefits
applicable to his new group status begin. The transferred employee shall not be
eligible for any other benefits from the previous group. For purposes of
determining his eligibility for vesting, death, disability and retirement
benefits as a member of the new group, the employee's credited service prior to
the date of transfer shall be included. For the purposes of determining the
amount of any vesting and retirement benefits as a member of the new group,
only service following the date of transfer shall be included. For purposes of
determining the amount of any death or disability benefits as a member of the
new group, the employee's credited service prior to date of transfer shall be
included.
   (B)   State contributions.
      (1)   Any monies received or receivable by reason of the laws of the
State of Florida for the purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits
for police officers or firefighters shall be used to provide benefits for
police officers and firefighters that are in addition to or greater than
benefits provided for general employees of the city. Additional or greater
benefits may take the form of lower retirement ages, higher benefit accrual
rates, higher disability benefits or any other type of extra benefit. Such
monies shall be deposited in the fund immediately and under no circumstances
more than five (5) days after receipt by the city. The city may provide
authorization for the direct payment to the board.
      (2)   Two separate sub-accounts shall be created within the fund, one for
the state contributions received on behalf of police officers and one for the
state contributions received on behalf of firefighters. The monies allocable to
these sub-accounts shall be invested in securities or assets, as determined by
the board, that are separate from the securities and assets held by the main
fund. The sub-accounts shall be increased by the respective payments received
from the state and by the investment earnings attributable to the securities
and assets attributable to such sub-accounts. The sub-accounts shall be reduced
by their share of administrative expenses of the system and by all benefits
paid to police officers and firefighters as compared to general employees.
      (3)   Each year, as part of the actuarial valuation, the system's actuary
shall determine the cost of benefits provided for police officer members and
firefighter members over and above those provided for general employees of the
city. The cost of additional benefits shall be equal to the excess of the
required annual contribution for benefits of police officer members and
firefighter members over the required annual contribution that will result if
police officer members and firefighter members were covered by the same
benefits as general employees of the city. In computing the latter amount,
assets attributable to police officer members and firefighter members shall be
reduced by the sub-account attributable to each group. The city shall take a
credit against its required annual contribution in an amount equal to the
lesser of the cost of the additional benefits or the monies received from the
State of Florida for the year.
      (4)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section:
         (a)   Chapter 185 funds in the amount of $380,000 in the excess state
monies reserve as of June 1, 2016 shall be used to reduce the city's annual
contributions to the fund; and Chapter 185 funds in the excess state monies
reserve as of June 1, 2016 in excess of $380,000 shall be transferred to the
Police Share Plan as provided in §
55.29.
         (b)   Annual premium tax revenues received pursuant to Chapter 185
after June 1, 2016 shall be used as follows: annual premium tax revenues
received up to $520,734.08 shall be used to reduce the city's annual pension
contribution. If the annual premium tax distribution exceeds $520,734.08, fifty
percent (50%) of the sum above $520,734.08 shall be transferred to the Police
Share Plan as provided in §
55.29, and the remaining fifty percent (50%) shall be used to reduce the City's
annual pension contribution.
      (5)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section:
         (a)   Chapter 175 funds in the amount of $150,000 in the excess state
monies reserve as of October 1, 2015 shall be used to reduce the city's annual
contributions to the fund; and Chapter 175 funds in the excess state monies
reserve in the amount of $7,840 shall be transferred to the Fire Share Plan as
provided in §
55.30.
         (b)   Annual premium tax revenues received pursuant to Chapter 175
after October 1, 2015 shall be used as follows: annual premium tax revenues
received up to $825,324 shall be used to reduce the city's annual pension
contribution. If the annual premium tax distribution exceeds $825,324, fifty
percent (50%) of the sum above $825,324 shall be transferred to the Fire Share
Plan as provided in §
55.30, and the remaining fifty percent (50%) shall be used to reduce the City's
annual pension contribution.
   (C)   City contributions. Each year the city shall make monthly
contributions to the fund in an amount equal to the difference in each year
between the total aggregate member contributions for the year, plus state
contributions for such year, and the total cost for the year, as shown by the
most recent actuarial valuation of the system. The total cost for any year
shall be defined as the total normal cost plus the additional amount sufficient
to amortize all unfunded past service liability as provided in Fla. Stat. Part
VII of Chapter 112.
   (D)   Other. Private donations, gifts and other contributions shall be
deposited to the fund, but such deposits may be used only for additional
benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce
what would have otherwise been required city contributions.

1991. Provided, however, that if such firefighter has completed twenty (20)
years of credited service as a firefighter, instead of the amount described in
the previous sentence, his or her monthly normal retirement benefit shall be an
amount equal to three percent (3%) of his or her average final compensation
multiplied by his or her credited service. Provided further, however, if such
firefighter has completed more than twenty (20) years of credited service as a
firefighter, in addition to the amount described in the previous sentence, his
or her monthly normal retirement benefit shall be an amount equal to five
percent (5%) of his or her average final compensation multiplied by his or her
credited service in excess of twenty (20) years, to a maximum of one hundred
percent (100%) of his or her average final compensation upon the completion of
twenty-eight (28) years of service.
            2.   The normal retirement benefit for members hired on or after
March 15, 2012, shall be as follows: The benefit formula for members with less
than twenty (20) years of credited service shall be an amount equal to two and
one-half percent (2.5%) of his or her average final compensation multiplied by
his or her credited service. The benefit formula for members with 20 or more
years of credited service shall be three and two-tenths percent (3.2%) of
average final compensation, with a maximum benefit of ninety percent (90%) of
average final compensation, excluding supplemental benefits.
            3.   In addition, each firefighter member shall receive a
supplemental monthly retirement benefit of one hundred and eighty-nine dollars
($189.00). Effective October 1, 2006, this supplemental monthly retirement
benefit shall be increased to four hundred fifty eight dollars ($458.00) and
paid for by Chapter 175 excise tax monies. This supplemental benefit shall only
be paid during the member's lifetime.
         (c)   Benefits shall commence on the first day of the month coincident
with or next following a member's retirement and shall be payable for life but
with one hundred twenty (120) payments guaranteed in any event. Benefits
payable by the system shall be in addition to federal Social Security benefits.
   (B)   Early retirement.

(20) years of credited service; or
         (b)   The first day of the month coincident with the next following
attainment of the member's fiftieth (50th) birthday and completion of ten (10)
years of credited service.
      (2)   Benefit. 
         For each member early retirement shall be as follows:
         (a)   A deferred monthly benefit commencing on the date that would
have been his normal retirement date had he remained in employment, determined
in the same manner as for retirement at normal retirement date, except that
credited service and average final compensation shall be determined as of early
retirement date; or
         (b)   An immediate monthly benefit commencing on his or her early
retirement date. The immediate monthly benefit shall be the actuarial
equivalent of the deferred monthly benefit but in no event shall the immediate
monthly benefit be reduced by more than three percent (3%) for each year by
which the starting date of the immediate monthly benefit precedes the date that
would have been his or her normal retirement date had he or she remained in
employment.
         (c)   In addition to either of the foregoing monthly benefits, each
firefighter member shall receive a supplemental monthly early retirement
benefit of one hundred eighty-nine dollars ($189.00). Effective October 1,
2006, this supplemental monthly early retirement benefit shall be increased to
four hundred fifty-eight dollars ($458.00) and paid for by
Chapter 175 excise tax monies. This supplemental benefit shall only be paid
during the member's lifetime.
         (d)   Benefits shall commence on the first day of the month coincident
with or next following a member's early retirement and shall be payable for
life but with one hundred and twenty (120) payments guaranteed in any event.
The monthly benefits payable by the system shall be in addition to federal
Social Security benefits.
   (C)   Supplemental Benefit for Police Officer Members. Effective October 1,
2006, police officer members who either terminate while vested or reach normal
retirement or early retirement shall receive a supplemental benefit of twenty-
five dollars ($25.00) per month for each complete year of credited service.
This benefit shall only be paid for the life of the member, and will not be
paid to disabled members. The benefit shall commence upon receipt of a
retirement benefit and separation from the city and shall cease when the member
attains the age of sixty-five (65). Effective October 1, 2021, police officer
members who thereafter either terminate while vested or reach normal retirement
or early retirement shall receive a supplemental benefit of thirty-five dollars
($35.00) per month for each complete year of credited service. This benefit
shall only be paid for the life of the member and will not be paid to disabled
members. Effective October 1, 2024, police officer members who thereafter
either terminate while vested or reach normal retirement or early retirement
shall receive a supplemental benefit of forty-five dollars ($45.00) per month
for each complete year of credited service. This benefit shall only be paid for
the life of the member and will not be paid to disabled members. The benefit
shall commence upon receipt of a retirement benefit and separation from the
city and shall cease when the member attains eligibility for Medicare/Medicaid
in accordance with federal standards.
   (D)   Supplemental Benefit for Firefighter Members. Effective October 1,
2007, firefighter members who either terminate while vested or reach normal
retirement or early retirement shall receive a supplemental benefit of twenty-
five dollars ($25.00) per month for each year of credited service earned prior

55 with 10 or more years of credited service or 25 years of credited service
regardless of age on that date, who either terminate while vested or terminate
upon reaching normal or early retirement shall receive a supplemental benefit
of $12.00 per month for each year of credited service earned on or after March
15, 2012. This benefit shall only be paid for the life of the member, and will
not be paid to disabled members who are being retained on the City's insurance
at the expense of the City. Effective October 1, 2024, firefighter members who
thereafter either terminate while vested or reach normal retirement or early
retirement shall receive a supplemental benefit of thirty dollars ($30.00) per
month for each year of credited service. This benefit shall only be paid for
the life of the member and will not be paid to disabled members who are being
retained on the City's insurance at the expense of the City. The benefit shall
commence upon entry into the DROP or upon receipt of a retirement benefit and
separation from the City. This benefit shall cease when the member attains the
age of Medicare eligibility.

§ 55.08 DEATH.
   (A)   Post-retirement death. Upon death of a retiree there shall be no
further benefits paid, except for return of accumulated contributions not
theretofore paid in the form of retirement benefits. However, if a retiree had
elected an optional form of benefit, benefits, if any, shall be payable in
accordance with such election.
   (B)   Pre-retirement death benefits for police officer members.
      (1)   Upon the death of a member not eligible for retirement, his or her
beneficiary, or his or her estate if there is no beneficiary, shall receive the
return of his or her accumulated contributions.
      (2)   Upon the death of a member eligible for retirement who had not
elected an optional form of benefit, it shall be presumed that such member had
elected a monthly benefit payable for life but with one hundred twenty (120)
payments guaranteed in any event and retired immediately preceding his death;
provided, however, that the resulting benefit may not be less than the amount
of member's accumulated contributions. If the deceased member had elected an
optional form of benefit, benefits, if any, shall be payable in accordance with
such election.
      (3)   Upon the death of a member having at least ten (10) years of
credited service, his beneficiary shall be entitled to the benefits otherwise
payable at the member's early or normal retirement date.
   (C)   Pre-retirement death benefits for firefighter members.
      (1)   Death in the line of duty.  
         (a)   Effective October 1, 2006, the beneficiary of any member whose
death was directly caused by performance of the member's duties as a
firefighter shall be entitled to a monthly pension benefit equal to the greater
of the member's accrued benefit or seventy-five percent (75%) of the member's
average final compensation provided that the member's death in the line-of-duty
is established to the satisfaction of the Board.
         (b)   Presumptions.
            1.   Any death of a member caused by hypertension or heart disease
shall be presumed to have been suffered in the line-of-duty unless the contrary
is shown by competent evidence; provided that such member shall have
successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service,
including a cardiogram, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such
condition.
            2.   The presumptions regarding certain communicable diseases
provided for in Fla. Stat. 112.181, as amended from time to time, shall apply
only to those conditions described in that statute that are diagnosed on or
after January 1, 1996.
            3.   A firefighter shall be considered to have died in the line of
duty if he or she dies as a result of cancer or circumstances that arise out of
the treatment of cancer.
      (2)   Death not in the line-of-duty. Effective October 1, 2006, the
beneficiary of any member, with at least ten (10) years of credited service,
whose death was not directly caused by the performance of the member's duties
as a firefighter shall be entitled to a monthly pension benefit equal to the
greater of the member's accrued benefit or twenty-five percent (25%) of the
member's average final compensation.
      (3)   Upon the death of a member eligible for retirement who had not
elected an optional form of benefit, it shall be presumed that such member had
elected a monthly benefit payable for life but with one hundred twenty (120)
payments guaranteed in any event and retired immediately preceding his death;
provided, however, that the resulting benefit may not be less than the amount
of member's accumulated contributions. If the deceased member had elected an
optional form of benefit, the benefits, if any, shall be payable in accordance
with such election.
      (4)   Upon written request to the Board made within a time frame
established by the Board, a beneficiary entitled to receive benefits under this
subsection (C) shall have the option of receiving the return of the deceased
member's accumulated contributions.
   (D)   Death during qualified military service. In the case of a death or
disability occurring on or after January 1, 2007, if a member dies while
performing qualified military service (as defined in Section 414(u) of the
Internal Revenue Code), the survivors of the member are entitled to any
additional benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of
qualified military service) provided under the plan as if the member had
resumed and then terminated employment by the City on account of death.

§ 55.09 DISABILITY.
   (A)   Disability benefits in line of duty. Any member who shall become
totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he or she is unable, by
reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render
useful and efficient service as a police officer or firefighter, which
disability was directly caused by the performance of his or her duty as a
police officer or firefighter, shall, upon establishing the same to the
satisfaction of the Board, be entitled to a monthly pension as follows:
      (1)   Firefighters hired before March 15, 2012, and police officers shall
be entitled to a monthly pension equal to the member's accrued benefit, but in
any event, the minimum amount paid to such member shall be seventy-five percent
(75%) of the member's average final compensation.
      (2)   Firefighter members hired on or after March 15, 2012, shall be
entitled to a monthly pension equal to the member's accrued benefit, but in any
event, the minimum amount paid to such member shall be sixty-six percent (66%)
of the member's average final compensation.
   (B)   In-line-of-duty presumption:
      (1)   Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a member
caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered
in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; provided,
that such member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon
entering into such service, including cardiogram, which examination failed to
reveal any evidence of such condition.
      (2)   Additional presumption. The presumption provided for certain
communicable diseases in Fla. Stat. § 112.181, as amended from time to time,
shall apply only to those conditions described in that statute that are
diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996.
      (3)   Diagnosis of cancer or the circumstances that arise out of the
treatment of cancer. A firefighter shall be considered totally and permanently
disabled in the line of duty if he or she meets the Plan's definition of
totally and permanently disabled due to the diagnosis of cancer or
circumstances that arise out of the treatment of cancer.
   (C)   Disability benefits not in line of duty. Any member with ten (10)
years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently
disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable
physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a
police officer or firefighter, which disability is not directly caused by the
performance of his duties as a police officer or firefighter, shall, upon
establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a
monthly pension equal to his accrued benefit, but in any event the minimum
amount paid to such member shall be twenty-five percent (25%) of average final
compensation.
   (D)   Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is
claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board,
that such disability was not occasioned primarily by:
      (1)   Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or alcohol
narcotics.
      (2)   Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally
participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections, or while committing a
crime.
      (3)   Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the
armed forces.
      (4)   Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a police
officer or firefighter shall have terminated.
      (5)   Injury or disease sustained by the member while working for anyone
other than the city and arising out of such other employment.
   (E)   Physical examination requirement. A member shall not be eligible for
disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by one
or more qualified physicians who shall be selected by the board for that
purpose.
      (1)   Any retiree receiving disability benefits hereunder may be
periodically re-examined by one or more qualified physicians who shall be
selected by the board to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If
the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled
to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a
police officer or firefighter, the board shall recommend to the city that the
retiree be returned to performance of duty as a police officer or firefighter.
In the event a retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the
order within thirty (30) days, or upon regaining certification where required
and as herein provided, he shall forfeit the right to his disability pension.
If recertification is required, then prior to returning to duty it shall be the
responsibility of the retiree to begin, within thirty (30) days, to regain his
certification as a police officer or firefighter, if he has lost such
certification during his disability period. In such event, he shall return to
work immediately after such recertification.
      (2)   The cost of the physical examination or re-examination of a member
or retiree shall be borne by the fund. Any other reasonable costs as determined
by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to,
transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, may be borne by the fund.
      (3)   If a retiree recovers from disability and re-enters the service of
the city as a police officer or firefighter, his service will be deemed to have
been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he
received a disability pension payment and ending with the date he re-entered
the service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the
purposes of the system.
      (4)   The board shall have the power and authority to make the final
decisions regarding all disability or recovery claims.
   (F)   Duration of disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member
is entitled in the event of his disability retirement shall be payable on the
first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement.
However, the monthly benefit shall be payable as of the date the board
determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be
paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be:
      (1)   If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next
preceding the date of such recovery; or
      (2)   If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment
due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later.
      (3)   Provided, however, a disability retiree may select, at any time
prior to the date on which disability benefit payments begin, an optional form
of benefit payment as described below.

understood that actuarially equivalent amounts shall be payable under any form
or manner of payment provided.
(Ord. 2000-15, passed 5-5-00; Am. Ord. 2013-45, passed 8-13-13)
§ 55.11 OPTIONAL FORMS OF BENEFITS.
   (A)   In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable as
specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to
receive a retirement income or benefit of actuarial equivalence, payable in
accordance with one of the following options:
      (1)   A monthly benefit payable to the retiree for his lifetime only.
      (2)   A monthly benefit payable to the retiree for life but with one
hundred twenty (120) payments guaranteed in any event.
      (3)   A monthly benefit payable to the retiree during his lifetime and
following his death, one hundred percent (100%), seventy-five percent (75%),
sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-%) or fifty percent (50%) of such monthly
amount, payable for the beneficiary's lifetime. In no event, however, shall the
present value of payments to the retiree be less than fifty percent (50%) of
the total present value of payments to the retiree and his beneficiary.
      (4)   If a member retires prior to the time at which Social Security
benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased monthly benefit
until such time as Social Security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a
reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as
possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of
retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuary for the
system, based upon the Social Security law in effect at the time of the
member's retirement.
   (B)   A member who elects any option in this section shall designate the
beneficiary to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the
event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation up
to two (2) times without approval of the Board or the current joint annuitant
or beneficiary. The retired member need not provide proof of the good health of
the joint annuitant or beneficiary. The retiree need not provide proof of the
good health of the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed and the joint
annuitant or beneficiary need not be living. Such designation shall name one or
more primary beneficiaries where applicable.
   (C)   The consent of a member's or retiree's beneficiary to change thereof
shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to
receive any benefits under the system shall thereupon forever cease.
   (D)   Any retired member who desires to change his or her beneficiary shall
file with the Board a notarized notice of such change either by registered
letter or on such form as is provided by the Board.
   (E)   Upon change of a retiree's beneficiary in accordance herewith, the
amount of the monthly benefit payable to the retiree shall be actuarially
recalculated on a prospective basis to take into account the age and sex of the
former beneficiary, of the new beneficiary and of the retiree. Any such retiree
shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. In the event that no designated
beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as may be payable in the event
of the death of the retiree shall be paid as provided in §
55.12.
   (F)   Monthly benefits shall be made under the option elected and shall be
subject to the following limitations:
      (1)   If a member dies prior to his early retirement date, no retirement
benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if
any, will be determined under §
55.08.
      (2)   If the designated beneficiary dies before the member retires, the
option elected will be canceled automatically and a monthly benefit in the
normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if
the election had not been made, unless a new election is made or a new
beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement.
      (3)   If both the retiree and all beneficiaries designated by the member
or retiree die before the full payment has been made under any option providing
for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, the board may, in its
discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in
a lump sum and in accordance with §
55.12.
      (4)   If a member continues employment beyond his normal retirement date
and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option is in effect,
monthly benefits shall be paid under said option to the beneficiary or
beneficiaries in an amount as if the member had retired under said option on
the date on which his death occurred.
   (G)   A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of
cashing or depositing his first benefit check.
   (H)   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Board, in its
discretion, may elect to make a lump-sum payment to a member or a member's
beneficiary in the event that the monthly benefit amount is less than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) or the total commuted value of the remaining monthly
benefits to be paid do not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). Any such
payment made pursuant hereto shall operate as a complete discharge of all
obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be
subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all
persons.

§ 55.12 BENEFICIARIES.
   (A)   Each member or retiree shall, on a form provided for that purpose,
signed and filed with the Board, designate a beneficiary to receive the
benefit, if any, that may be payable in the event of his or her death. Each
designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and
filing with the Board a new designation form. Upon such change, the rights of
all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the
system shall forever cease.
   (B)   If a deceased member or retiree duly failed to name a beneficiary or
if all beneficiaries so named predecease the member or retiree, the death
benefit, if any, that may be payable under the system with respect to such
deceased member or retiree shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree
and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the
remaining monthly benefits be paid in a lump sum.
   (C)   Any such payment hereto shall operate as a complete discharge of all
obligations under the system with regard to such member and any other persons
with rights under the system, and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but
shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons.

of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any
proceedings provided for in the Board's claims procedures. A reasonable fee may
be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas, not to exceed the maximum fee
provided by law.

§ 55.15 ROSTER OF RETIREES.
   The secretary of the Board shall keep a record of all persons receiving
pensions under the system in which it shall be noted the time when the pension
is allowed and when same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the secretary

§ 55.16 MAXIMUM PENSION.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of the system to the contrary, the
annual benefit to which a member is entitled under the system shall not, in any
limitation year, be in amount which would exceed the applicable limitations
under Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations issued
thereunder. If the benefit payable under the system would (but for this
section) exceed the limitations of Section 415 of the Code by reason of a
benefit payable under another defined benefit plan aggregated with this system
under Code Section 415(f), the benefit under this system shall be reduced only
after all reductions have been made under such other plan. As of January 1 of
each calendar year commencing on or after January 1, 2007, the dollar
limitation as determined by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service
for that calendar year shall become effective as the maximum permissible dollar
amount of benefit payable under the system during the limitation year ending
within that calendar year.

§ 55.17 MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS.
   (A)   General rules.
      (1)   Effective date. The provisions of this section will apply for
purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years
beginning with the 2007 calendar year.
      (2)   Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence
over any inconsistent provisions of the system.
      (3)   Requirements of treasury regulations incorporated. All
distributions required under this section will be determined and made in
accordance with the Treasury regulations under section 401(a)(9) of the Code.
      (4)   TEFRA Section 242(b)(2) Elections.  Notwithstanding the other
provisions of this Section other than this subsection (A)(4), distributions may
be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with
Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and
the provisions of the plan that related to Section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA.
   (B)   Time and manner of distribution.
      (1)   Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be
distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the
member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the
calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member
attains age seventy-three (73), provided the member had not attained age
seventy-two (72) by December 31, 2022; or the calendar year in which the member
retires unless otherwise provided for in the Plan. The Plan will make all
future required minimum distributions in compliance with the prevailing age
restrictions and additional parameters set out in the Internal Revenue Code as
amended from time to time.
      (2)   Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies
before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed,
or begin to be distributed no later than as follows:
         (a)   If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated
beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December
31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the
member died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would
have attained age seventy-three (73), provided the member had not attained age
seventy-two (72) by December 31, 2022, if later, as the surviving spouse
elects. The Plan will make all future required minimum distributions in
compliance with the prevailing age restrictions and additional parameters set
out in the Internal Revenue Code as amended from time to time.
         (b)   If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole
designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will
begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar
year in which the member died.
         (c)   If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the
year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest
will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth
anniversary of the member's death.
         (d)   If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated
beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before
distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (B)(2), other than
subsection (B)(2)(a), will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member.
      For purposes of this subsection (B)(2) and subsection (E), distributions
are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if
subsection (B)(2)(d) applies, the date of distributions are required to begin
to the surviving spouse under subsection (B)(2)(a). If annuity payments
irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date
(or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required
to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (B)(2)(a), the date
distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually
commence.
      (3)   Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed
in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single
sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution
calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with subsections (C),
(D), and (E) of this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the
form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions
thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)
(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations. Any part of the Member's interest
which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of
the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section
401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations that apply to individual
accounts.
   (C)   Determination of amount to be distributed each year.
      (1)   General annuity requirements. If the member's interest is paid in
the form of annuity distributions under the Plan, payments under the annuity
will satisfy the following requirements:
         (a)   The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made
at intervals not longer than one year.
         (b)   The distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a
period certain not longer than the period described in subsection (D) or (E).
         (c)   Once payments have begun over a period certain, the period
certain will not be changed even if the period certain is shorter than the
maximum permitted.
         (d)   Payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as
follows:
            1.   By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the
cumulative annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based
on prices of all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics or by a
fixed annual increase of five percent or less.
            2.   To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the member's
payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the
beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period
described in subsection (D) dies or is no longer the member's beneficiary
pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of Section
414(p) of the Code.
            3.   To provide cash refunds of accumulated contributions upon the
member's death.
            4.   To pay increased benefits that result from a system amendment.
      (2)   Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The
amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning
date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions
are required to begin under subsection (B)(2)(a) or (B)(2)(b) is the payment
that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made
until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends
in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments
are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the
member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar
year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments
for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date.
      (3)   Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any
additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first
distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment
interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in
which such amount accrues.
   (D)   Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during a member's
lifetime.
      (1)   Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the member's
spouse. If the member's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint
and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the member and a nonspouse
beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the member's required
beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the member's death must not
at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such
period that would have been payable to the member using the table set forth in
Q&A-2 of Section 1.401(a)(9)-6T of the Treasury regulations. If the form of
distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the
member and a non-spouse beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the
requirements in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be
made to the designated beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain.
      (2)   Period certain annuities.  Unless the member's spouse is the sole
designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no
life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during
the member's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the
member under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of
the Treasury regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity
starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the
member reaches age seventy-three (73), provided the participant had not
attained age seventy-two (72) by December 31, 2022, the applicable distribution
period for the member is the distribution period for age seventy-three (73)
under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the
Treasury regulations plus the excess of seventy-three (73) over the age of the
member as of the member's birthday in the year that contains the annuity
starting date. If the member's spouse is the member's sole designated
beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life
annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the member's
applicable distribution period, as determined under this subsection (D)(2), or
the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the member and the member's
spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in
Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations, using the member's and
spouse's attained ages as of the member's and spouse's birthdays in the
calendar year that contains the annuity starting date.
   (E)   Requirements for minimum distributions where member dies before date
distributions begin.
      (1)   Member survived by designated beneficiary. If the member dies
before the date distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a
designated beneficiary, the member's entire interest will be distributed,
beginning no later than the time described in subsection (B)(2)(a) or (B)(2)
(b), over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period certain not
exceeding:
         (a)   Unless the annuity starting date is before the first
distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary
determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the
calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the member's death.
         (b)   If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution
calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined
using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar
year that contains the annuity starting date.
      (2)   No designated beneficiary. If the member dies before the date
distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30th
of the year following the year of the member's death, distribution of the
member's entire interest will be completed by December 31st of the calendar
year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death.
      (3)   Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse
begin. If the member dies before the date distribution of his or her interest
begins, the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated
beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the
surviving spouse begin, this subsection will apply as if the surviving spouse
were the member, except that the time by which distributions must begin will be
determined without regard to Subsection (B)(2)(a).
   (F)   Definitions.
      (1)   Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the
beneficiary under the Plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 40l
(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury
regulations.
      (2)   Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum
distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the member's
death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately
preceding the calendar year which contains the member's required beginning
date. For distributions beginning after the member's death, the first
distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are
required to begin pursuant to Subsection (B)(2).
      (3)   Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single
Life Table in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations.
      (4)   Required beginning date. The date specified in Subsection (B)(1).
   (G)   Compliance with Internal Revenue Code.  Notwithstanding anything
contained in this section to the contrary, the limitations, adjustments and
other requirements prescribed in this section shall at all times comply with
the provisions of Internal Revenue Code, Section 401(a)(9), and the regulations
issued thereunder.

§ 55.18 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Interest of members in system. At no time prior to the satisfaction of
all liabilities under the system with respect to retirees and members and their
spouses or beneficiaries shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be
used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit.
   (B)   No reduction of accrued benefits. No amendment or ordinance shall be
adopted by the city that shall have the effect of reducing the then-vested
accrued benefits of any member or any member's beneficiaries.
   (C)   Qualification of system. It is intended that the system will
constitute a qualified pension plan under the applicable provisions of the
code, as now in effect or hereafter amended. Any modification or amendment of
the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify
or maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable
provisions of the code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other
applicable provisions of the U.S. federal tax laws, as now in effect or
hereafter amended or adopted and the regulations issued thereunder. Subject to
the foregoing, the system is declared to be an irrevocable plan and trust,
subject to the city's right to terminate in accordance with law.
      (1)   In recognition of the changing requirements of system
qualification, the Board shall adopt an administrative policy setting forth the
required provisions for tax qualification. Such a policy shall be amended by
the Board as required to maintain continuing compliance with the Internal
Revenue Code and that policy and any amendments shall have the force of law as
if adopted by the City Council.
   (D)   Use of forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service
of members shall serve only to reduce current or future contributions to the
fund.
   (E)   Correction of records. Should any change or error in records result in
any member or beneficiary receiving from the system more or less than he would
have been entitled to receive had the records been correct, then on discovery
of any such error the board shall cause the same to be corrected and as far as
practicable shall direct that the payments be adjusted in such manner that the
actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member or beneficiary was
correctly entitled shall be paid.
   (F)   USSERA. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Plan to the contrary,
effective as of December 12, 1994, contributions, benefits and service credit
with respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance with
Section 414(u) of the IRC, USSERA and FLA. Stat. Chapters 175 and 185.
   (G)   Differential Wage Payments. For Plan Years beginning after December
31, 2008: (i) an individual receiving a differential wage payment, as defined
by IRC section 3401(h)(2), is treated as a Member of the System; (ii) the
differential wage payment is treated as Compensation for purposes of IRC
section 415(c)(3) and Treasury Regulation section 1.415(c)-2; and (iii) the
System is not treated as failing to meet the requirements of any provision
described in IRC Section 414(u)(1)(C) (or corresponding System provisions) by
reason of any contribution or benefit which is based on the differential wage
payment.
   (H)   Notwithstanding any provision in this Part to the contrary members
eligible for an unreduced normal retirement benefit may receive an in-service
distribution provided any such distribution complies with the applicable
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Regulations and guidance
issued by the Internal Revenue service with respect to in-service
distributions. This provision is applicable only to members who were eligible
to commence normal retirement benefits during the period from April 1, 2004 to
November 30, 2011.
      (1)   Members may elect to cease in-service distributions, at any time. A
member who ceases in-service distributions may restart participation in this
Plan, to the extent they otherwise qualify under the terms of this Plan.
Contributions must continue upon the member's re-entry in this Plan, in
accordance with §
55.06 here.
      (2)   A member who ceases in-service distributions and restarts
participation in this Plan may receive credited service for their period of in-
service distribution, in each case, if and only if, upon their re-entry into
this Plan, the value of Contributions for such period of in-service
distributions are deducted from the member's retirement allowance and benefit,
in accordance with each other requirement for credited service herein.
      (3)   In accordance with the intent of Section 1.401-l(b)(l)(i) of the
Treasury Regulations, in no event shall a member be permitted to restart
participation in this Retirement Plan, under this §
55.18(H), greater than one time.
      (4)   At the time of a member's Retirement, when he or she ceases active
membership and severs employment with the City, such member's Retirement
allowance and benefit, determined in each case in accordance with the
provisions herein, shall be reduced by the actuarially equivalent value of the
in-service distribution.
      (5)   In the event that the in-service distributions of any member must
cease in order to maintain the tax-qualified status of this Plan, then those
members whose in-service distributions cease will be returned to active
membership in the Plan with prior service credit for all years in which
distributions were received, provided the member pays to the Plan the required
employee contributions, without interest, which would have been paid had the
member not commenced in-service distributions; provided, however, if such
member fails to pay the required employee contributions in the time and manner
determined by the Board of Trustees, such member shall not receive prior
service credit for the years in which in-service distributions were received.
To the extent required in order to maintain the tax-qualified status of the
Plan, the Plan shall recoup a member's prior in-service distributions from the
affected member's future benefit payments following such member's separation
from the City, upon the affected member's separation from the City, the
member's benefit payments (which shall take into account all of the member's
credited service) shall be reduced by the pro-rata monthly share of the amount
to be recouped based on the member's life expectancy utilizing the mortality
table in effect at the time benefits recommence.

§ 55.19 REPEAL OR TERMINATION OF SYSTEM.
   (A)   Upon termination of the system by the city for any reason or because
of a transfer, merger, or consolidation of governmental units, services, or
functions as provided in fla. Stat. Chapter 121, or upon written notice by the
city to the Board that contributions under the system are being permanently
discontinued, the rights of all members to benefits accrued to the date of such
termination and the amounts credited to the members’ accounts are non-
forfeitable. The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following
procedures:
      (1)   The Board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset
value required to fund all the non-forfeitable benefits after taking into
account the expenses of such distribution. The Board shall inform the city if
additional assets are required, in which event the city shall continue to
financially support the system until all non-forfeitable benefits have been
funded.
      (2)   The Board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset
value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of
another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or
otherwise, for each member entitled to benefits under the system as specified
in paragraph (3).
       (3) The Board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of
termination in the manner set forth in this paragraph, on the basis that the
amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially
computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method
of distribution determined under paragraph (2) involves the purchase of an
insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is
the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may
not be less than the member’s accumulated contributions to the system, with
interest if provided by the system, less the value of any system benefits
previously paid to the member.
      (4)   If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution
specified in paragraph (3), and after the payment of any expenses incurred with
such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the city, less return to
the state of the state's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less
than the total contributions made by the city and the state to date of
termination of the system, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the
total contributions made by the city and the state.
      (5)   The Board shall distribute, in accordance with paragraph (2), the
amounts determined under paragraph (3).
   If, after twenty-four (24) months after the date the system terminated or
the date the Board received written notice that the contributions thereunder
were being permanently discontinued, the city or the Board of the system’s
pension trust fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this
section, the Department of Management Services shall effect the termination of
the fund in accordance with this section.

(not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of
the distributee or the joint lives (or life expectancies) of the distributee
and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten
(10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is
required under Section 401(a)(9) of the code; and the portion of any
distribution that is not includable in gross income.
      (2)   ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLAN. An eligible retirement plan is an
individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the code, an
individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the code, an
annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the code, or a qualified trust
described in Section 401(a) of the code that accepts the distributee's eligible
rollover distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover
distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an
individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. Effective for
distributions made after December 31, 2001, an eligible retirement plan shall
also mean an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the code and an
eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the code which is maintained by a state,
political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state
or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for
amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan.
      (3)   DISTRIBUTEE . A distributee includes an employee or former
employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse is
a distributee with regard to the interest of the spouse. Effective as of
January 1, 2008, an employee's or former employee's non-spouse beneficiary is a
distributee with regard to the interest of the employee or former employee.
      (4)   DIRECT ROLLOVER. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the
eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. Effective as of January
1, 2008, a non-spouse beneficiary may make a direct rollover only to an
“inherited” individual retirement account as described in Section 408(b) of the
code.
   (D)   IRS compliance. If a police officer member is no longer employed by
the City of Palm Bay Police Department and the member's plan account is greater
than $1,000 but not greater than $5,000, the plan administrator may deposit the
money into an IRA in the member's name if they do not elect to receive or roll
it over. If a police officer member's account contains $1,000 or less, the plan
administrator may pay it to the member, less, in most cases, 20% income tax
withholding, with or without member consent. Members may still rollover the
distribution within sixty (60) days. Member contributions can remain in the
plan for up to 5 (five) years in accordance with the provisions set forth in
the definition of "Credited Service" under §
55.02. This provision only applies to police officer members.

§ 55.25 FIDUCIARIES AND FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY.

any discretionary authority or control regarding management or administration
of the system or its assets, and any person or entity that renders or that has

alike character and with like aims; and
      (3)   By performing their duties in accordance with the documents and
instruments setting forth and governing the system.

§ 55.26 INDEMNIFICATION AND DEFENSE OF CLAIMS.
   (A)   To the extent not covered by insurance contracts in force from time to
time, the city shall indemnify and hold harmless members of the board from all
personal liability for damages and costs, including court costs and attorneys'
fees, arising out of claims, suits, litigation or threat of same, herein
referred to as "claims," against such individuals because of acts or
circumstances connected with or arising out of their official duties as members
of the board. The city reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to settle or
not settle the claim at any time and to appeal or to not appeal from any
adverse judgment or ruling, and in either event will indemnify and hold
harmless any members of the board from the judgment, execution or levy thereon.
   (B)   This section shall not be construed so as to relieve any insurance
company or other entity liable to defend the claim or liable for payment of the
judgment or claim from any liability, nor does this section waive any provision
of law affording the city, the board or the trustees immunity from any suit in
whole or part, or waive any other substantive or procedural rights they may
have.
   (C)   This section shall not apply to claims arising out of acts or
omissions of members of the board that constitute felonies or gross malfeasance
or gross misfeasance in office.

§ 55.28 DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PLAN.
   (A)   Participation in the DROP.
      (1)   Eligibility to participate. In lieu of terminating his employment
as a police officer or firefighter, any police officer or firefighter actively
employed by the city who is or has been eligible for normal retirement, may
elect to participate in the DROP.
      (2)   Election to participate.  A police officer or firefighter's
election to participate in the DROP must be made in writing in a time and
manner determined by the Board and shall be effective on the first day of the
first calendar month following the Board's acceptance of such notification.
      (3)   Period of participation. No police officer or firefighter shall
participate in the DROP for more than sixty (60) months.
      (4)   Termination of participation.
         (a)   A police officer or firefighter shall cease DROP participation
by
            1.   terminating employment with the city.
            2.   participating in the DROP for 60 months.
         (b)   Upon termination of participation in the DROP, amounts shall
cease to be transferred from the Retirement System to the police officer or
firefighter DROP Account, and shall be disbursed in the normal manner for
retirement benefits. Any amounts remaining in his DROP Account shall be paid to
him in accordance with the provisions of division (C) of this section when he
terminates employment with the city.
         (c)   A police officer or firefighter who terminates his participation
in the DROP under division (A)(4) of this section shall not be permitted to
again become a participant of the Retirement System or DROP.
      (5)   Effect of DROP Participation on the Retirement System.
         (a)   A police officer or firefighter's Credited Service and accrued
benefit under the Retirement System shall be determined on the date his
election to participate in the DROP becomes effective. A police officer or
firefighter shall not accrue any additional Credited Service or additional
benefits under the Retirement System (except for any benefits provided under
any cost of living adjustments in the Retirement System) while he is a
participant of the DROP.
         (b)   No amounts shall be paid to a police officer or firefighter from
the Retirement System while a police officer or firefighter is a participant in
the DROP. Unless otherwise specified in the Retirement System and/or DROP
provisions, if a police officer or firefighter terminates his or her
participation in the DROP other than terminating his or her employment with the
city, no amounts shall be paid to him or her from the Retirement System until
he or she terminates his or her employment with the city.
            1.   Unless otherwise provided for within the Retirement System or
DROP provisions, amounts transferred to the firefighter member DROP Account
shall be paid directly to the firefighter member only on or after the earliest
date after the quarterly interest posting and declaration of interest, net of
fees by the Board for the quarter following the firefighter member's
termination of employment with the city. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, upon request of the firefighter member, the Board, based upon
performance of the plan during the then-current quarter, may make payment
directly to the firefighter member of up to seventy-five percent (75%) of the
amount in the firefighter member's DROP Account on or as soon as practical
after the firefighter member's termination of employment with the city. The
balance, if any, shall be paid directly to the firefighter member after the
quarterly interest posting and declaration of interest, net of fees, by the
Board for the quarter following the firefighter member's termination of
employment with the city. If it is subsequently determined by the Board that
the firefighter member has been overpaid, the firefighter member shall
forthwith repay the Board the amount of such overpayment, plus interest and the
Board may withhold from future benefit payments to the firefighter member the
amount of any such overpayment, plus interest.
            2.   Unless otherwise provided for within the Retirement System or
DROP provisions, amounts transferred to the police officer's DROP Account shall
be paid directly to the police officer only on or after the earliest date after
the quarterly interest posting and declaration of interest, net of fees by the
Board for that quarter following the police officer's termination of employment
with the city.
         (c)   Participant's contributions to the Retirement System cease on
effective date of DROP participation.
         (d)   In the event of death of a DROP participant, DROP participation
ceases. Retirement benefit is paid according to the form of benefit chosen upon
election to participate in the DROP, and Drop Account becomes payable at that
time.
   (B)   Funding.
      (1)   Establishment of DROP account. A DROP account shall be established
for each police officer or firefighter participating in the DROP.
      A police officer or firefighter's DROP account shall consist of:

Such amounts will not be segregated or invested separate from the System, but
accounted for separately.
      (2)   Transfers from retirement system.
         (a)   As of the first day of each month of a police officer or
firefighter's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly retirement
benefit he would have received under the Retirement System had he terminated
his employment as a police officer or firefighter and elected to receive
monthly benefit payments there under shall be transferred to his DROP Account.
A police officer or firefighter's period of participation in the DROP shall be
determined in accordance with the provisions of division (A) of this section,
but in no event shall it continue past the date he terminates employment with
the city.
         (b)   Amounts credited to a police officer or firefighter's DROP
Account under division (B)(2)(a) of this section shall be credited monthly.
         (c)   Investment earnings or losses shall be credited or debited
quarterly to a police officer or firefighter's DROP Account with the quarterly
net investment return, net of money manager fees and other expenses, determined
by the Board on the assets of the Retirement System. Individuals entering the
DROP during a quarter would have investment earnings or losses, net of money
manager fees and other expenses, determined by the Board on the assets of the
Retirement System for the specific number of months the funds were considered
in the DROP during that quarter; however, interest would be posted at quarter-
end.
   (C)   Distribution of DROP Account Funds on termination of employment.
      (1)   Eligibility for benefits. A police officer or firefighter shall
receive the balance in his DROP Account in accordance with the provisions of
this section upon his termination of employment as a police officer or
firefighter. Except as provided in division (C)(4) of this section, no amounts
shall be paid to a police officer or firefighter from the DROP prior to his
termination of employment as a police officer or firefighter. Should the police
officer or firefighter elect any combination of the forms of distribution, the
rollover and/or lump sum portions of the DROP account shall be deducted from
the balance prior to the calculation of annual installment amount.
      (2)   Forms of distribution.
         (a)   Annual installments. The amount of the annual installment shall
be fixed upon termination from employment as a police officer or firefighter,
and shall be no less than 10% (1/10th) or $10,000, whichever is greater, of the
balance of the member's DROP account at the time of termination. Annual
installments shall be distributed each December and continue until either the
member's DROP account is depleted, or the member chooses a Rollover or Lump Sum
distribution, as listed below.
         (b)   Rollover. The balance or any portion of the balance of a
member's DROP account may be rolled over to another qualified retirement plan.
         (c)   Lump sum. The balance or any portion of the balance of a
member's DROP account may be paid directly to the member.
         (d)   In the event that a police officer or firefighter dies before
total distribution of his DROP account, the balance in his DROP account shall
be paid in an immediate lump sum to his beneficiary.
      (3)   Date of payment of distribution.
         (a)   Distribution of a police officer or firefighter's DROP Account
shall begin as soon as administratively practicable following the police
officer or firefighter's termination of employment as a police officer or
firefighter in accordance with divisions (A)(5)(b) and (C)(2)(a) through (d) of
this section.
         (b)   Any amounts in the DROP Account of a police officer or
firefighter who terminated his participation in the DROP in accordance with
division (A)(4)(a)1. of this section by terminating his employment as a police
officer or firefighter shall continue to be invested as part of the DROP's
funds and shall be credited or debited with the net investment on those funds
in accordance with division (B)(2)(c) of this section until such amounts are
distributed to the police officer or firefighter or his beneficiary.
      (4)   Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other person. The Board
may require and rely upon such proof of death and evidence of the right of any
beneficiary or any other person to receive the value of a deceased police
officer or firefighter's DROP Account as the Board may deem proper and its
determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive
payment shall be conclusive.
   (D)   Administration of the DROP.
      (1)   Board responsibilities. The general administration of the DROP, the
responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP and the
responsibility for overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be
placed with the Board. However, DROP assets will not be segregated or invested
separate from the system's assets. The Board may adopt such administrative
procedures and regulations as it deems desirable for the conduct of its
affairs; may authorize one or more of its number or any agent to execute or
deliver any instrument or make any payment on its behalf; may retain counsel,
employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and
consulting services as it may require in carrying out the provisions of the
DROP; and may allocate among its members or delegate to other persons all or
such portion of its duties under the DROP, other than those granted to the
Board as a trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing
the DROP, as it, in its sole discretion shall decide.
      (2)   Individual accounts, records, and reports. The Board shall
maintain, or cause to be maintained, records showing the operation and
condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in
each police officer or firefighter's DROP account, and the Board shall keep, or
cause to be kept, in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the
valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The Board shall prepare or
cause to be prepared and distributed to each police officer or firefighter
participating in the DROP and shall file with the appropriate governmental
agencies, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data
required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the Internal
Revenue Service Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and any other
applicable laws.
      (3)   Establishment of rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the
Board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the
DROP and the transaction of its business. The Board shall have discretionary
authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including but not limited to
determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right
and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any
individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the
Board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed
question shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable
law.
      (4)   Limitation of liability.
         (a)   The members of the Board shall not incur any liability
individually or on behalf of anyother individuals for any act or failure to
act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP.
         (b)   Neither the Board nor any member of the Board shall be
responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the
Board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates
furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The
Board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by
it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel,
and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any
person with any interest in the DROP.
   (E)   General provisions.
      (1)   Amendment of DROP. The Board reserves the right at any time and
from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary and if permissible, to
amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However,
except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for
any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other
than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP.
No amendment to this section shall be made which has the effect of decreasing
the balance of the DROP account of any police officer or firefighter.
      (2)   Facility of payment. If a police officer or firefighter or other
person entitled to a benefit under the DROP has a duly appointed legal
representative, payment shall be made to such legal representative in complete
discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit.
      (3)   Information. Each police officer or firefighter, beneficiary or
other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him
or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the Board the information
that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP.
      (4)   Written elections and notifications.
         (a)   Any elections, notifications or designations made by a police
officer or firefighter pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in
writing and filed with the Board in a time and manner determined by the Board
under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The Board
reserves the right to change from time to time the time and manner for making
notifications, elections or designations by police officers or firefighters
under the DROP if it determines after due deliberations that such action is
justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a
conflict between the provisions for making and election, notification or
designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those
new administrative procedures shall prevail.
         (b)   Each police officer or firefighter or former police officer or
firefighter who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the
Board with his current address, along with any financial institution
information required by the Board to facilitate direct transfers of funds. Any
notice required to be given to a police officer or firefighter or former police
officer or firefighter hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at
the last such address given to the Board and mailed by registered or certified
United States mail. If any such correspondence or funds transfer is returned,
future disbursement of funds shall be suspended until such time as the police
officer or firefighter or former police officer or firefighter notifies the
Board of his address and financial institution information.
      (5)   Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable under the DROP shall
be paid only from the assets of the DROP and neither the city nor the Board
shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities
or other assets except to the extent required by applicable law. A positive or
negative quarterly earnings may occur throughout DROP participation and the
distribution period. The principal balance could be reduced due to lowered
market investment returns while in the DROP.
      (6)   Administrative expenses. The Board may pay the reasonable and
necessary expense of administering the DROP, including, but not limited to,
expenses incurred in connection with investing theDROP's assets, from the funds
of the system to the extent that they are not otherwise paid by the city.
      (7)   Construction.
         (a)   The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under
the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls.
         (b)   The masculine pronoun shall mean the feminine wherever
appropriate.
         (c)   The titles and heading of the articles and sections in this Plan
are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text
rather than the titles or headings shall control.
      (8)   Forfeiture of retirement benefits. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture
provisions applicable to the System. DROP participants shall be subject to the
forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits.
      (9)   Code Section 414(k) and Code Section 415. To the extent that the
DROP is treated as a defined contribution plan under Section 414(k) of the
Code, the amounts transferred to the participant's DROP account under section
55.28(B)(2) above and any other annual additions to the participant's DROP
account shall not exceed the applicable limit under Section 415(c) of the Code.
For purposes of the application of the applicable limit under Section 415(c) of
the Internal Revenue Code, the term "participant's compensation" shall mean the
participant's compensation and earnings from the City and the term "annual
additions" shall have the meaning given under Section 415(c)(2) and Income Tax
Regulations Section 1.415(c)-1. To the extent that the annual additions to a
participant's DROP account for any year exceed the applicable limit under
Section 415(c), the City shall correct such excess contribution in accordance
with IRS Revenue Procedure 2008-50 and any successor procedure issued by the
IRS.

§ 55.29 POLICE SHARE PLAN.
   (A)   Share Plan established. The Palm Bay Police Share Plan (hereinafter
"Police Share Plan") is hereby established as of October 1, 2016. The purpose
of this section is to implement the provisions of F.S. Chapter 185 and to
provide a mechanism to pay required "special benefits" pursuant to F.S. §
185.35. The Police Share Plan shall be funded exclusively with available
premium tax revenues received from the State of Florida pursuant to Chapter 185
and shall be in addition to the monthly defined benefit payable by the under
the system. "Available premium tax revenues" means the amount in excess of
$380,000 in the excess state monies reserve as of June 1, 2016 as provided in
subsection (b) below, and the annual amount of Chapter 185 premium tax revenues
in excess of $520,734.08 as provided in subsection (c) below. The Police Share
Plan shall be administered by the Board.
   (B)   Creation of share accounts and initial contribution. The Police Share
Plan shall be initially funded with the sum of $6,474.59, representing
unallocated Chapter 185 funds in the excess state monies reserve as of June 1,
2016 in excess of $380,000. Effective October 1, 2016, for accounting purposes,
an individual share account shall be established for each active police officer
member, including DROP participants. An eligible active "member" is defined as
a police officer who is currently making contributions to the System, on
military leave, or participating in the DROP. The initial allocation of the
excess state monies reserve shall be made to the share accounts of eligible
members based on each eligible member's number of shares. A "share" is defined
as one (1) full month of credited service in the System as identified by the
Board. (Example: one (1) month of credited service is equal to one (1) share;
one (1) year of credited service is equal to twelve (12) shares.) The Police
Share Plan shall account for each member's share account balance as provided
herein.
   (C)   Annual determination. Each year, after receipt of the annual
distribution of Chapter 185 money from the State, the Board, in consultation
with their actuary, shall determine the amount of available premium tax
revenue, if any, received pursuant to F.S. § 185.35. Premium tax revenue is not
available for payment into the Police Share Plan unless the annual premium tax
distribution exceeds $520,734.08 (hereinafter the "special benefit threshold").
If the annual premium tax distribution exceeds the special benefit threshold,
fifty percent (50%) of the sum above $520,734.08 shall be paid into the Police
Share Plan. The remaining fifty percent (50%) shall be used to reduce the
City's annual pension contribution. In future years in which there are
available funds, each member on September 30th of each year shall receive
shares of the available funds received during the fiscal year, less
administrative expenses, as follows:
      (1)   Annually the Board will calculate the number of shares earned by
each active member of the Police Share Plan.
      (2)   Annually, the Board shall calculate the total number of shares
earned by active members and the value of shares using (i) any available
Chapter 185 premium tax revenue received during the year under subsection
55.29(c) and (ii) funds forfeited from members who separate from service
without having been granted an early, normal or disability pension. The Board
will calculate the value of the available funds and divide it by the total
number of shares earned by active members to determine the monetary value of
one (1) share for the year, less administrative expenses. The Board shall
report the value of one (1) share to the FOP and the City annually.
(Example 1: A member with 10 years of credited service would earn 120 shares.
If the value of a share is $2.00 per share, a member's share value will be
$240.00 at the time of distribution. Example 2: A member with 25 years of
credited service would earn three hundred (300) shares. If the value of a share
is $2.000 per share, a member's share value will be $600.00 at the time of
distribution.)
      (3)   In the event a Police Share Plan member separates from City
employment without having been granted an early, normal or disability pension,
the member shall forfeit his/her share account balance, and the forfeited
account balance shall be added to the available funds for that year. A member
who separates from City employment on or after being granted an early, normal
or disability pension shall be entitled to a vested share balance.
   (D)   Interest crediting. On September 30 of each year share accounts shall
be credited with interest at an annual rate equal to the market rate of return

investment related expenses as reported by the System's Investment Consultant.
Available funds and share account balances shall be commingled with assets of
the Fund for investment purposes, and invested by the Board with other Fund
assets. The Plan Administrator shall provide an annual statement to the Board
and each Police Share Plan member on or before June 1 of each year showing each
member's individual share account balance and the interest credited to the
member's account for the preceding year. The expense of administering the
Police Share Plan for the preceding year shall be determined by the Board and

are made to the member share accounts. If no funds are available, Police
administration fees shall be paid by the Police Fund.
   (E)   Share Plan Distributions. Distributions shall only be available for
members who separate from City employment after having been granted an early,
normal or disability pension, hereinafter "vested" Police Share Plan members.
Police Share Plan funds shall be distributed as follows, depending on the date
that a vested Police Share Plan member separates from service:
      (1)   Separation prior to annual approval: If a vested Police Share Plan
member separates from City employment between October 1st and the date the
Board approves the share balances of the most recent September 30th, eighty
percent (80%) of the last share balance that was approved by the Board shall be
paid within ninety (90) days. The remainder shall be distributed within ninety
(90) days after the Board approves the share balances for the most recent
September 30th.
      (2)   Separation after annual approval: If a vested Police Share Plan
member separates from City employment after the date the Board approves the
share balances of the most recent September 30th, the full share balance as of
the most recent September 30th shall be distributed within ninety (90) days.
   (F)   Rollovers. All or any portion of a member's share account distribution
may be rolled over to an IRA or other qualified plan in accordance with the

account balance on the date of death shall be distributed in a lump sum to the
member's designated beneficiary or estate in accordance with subsection
55.29 (E)(1) or (E)(2) above.
   (G)   Rule-making authority. The Board shall be authorized to adopt any
rules necessary for the administration of the Police Share Plan.

§ 55.30 FIRE SHARE PLAN.
   (A)   Fire Share Plan established. The Palm Bay Firefighter Share Plan
(hereinafter "Fire Share Plan") is hereby established. The purpose of this
section is to implement the provisions of Chapter 175, Florida Statutes, and to
provide a mechanism to pay required "special benefits" pursuant to Section
175.351, Fla. Stat. The Fire Share Plan shall be funded exclusively with
available premium tax revenue received from the State of Florida pursuant to
Chapter 175 and shall be in addition to the monthly defined benefit payable
under the system. "Available premium tax revenues" means the amount in excess
of $150,000 in the excess state monies reserve as of October 1, 2015 as
provided in subsection (B) below, and the annual amount of Chapter 175 premium
tax revenues in excess of $825,324 as provided in subsection (C) below. The
Fire Share Plan shall be administered by the Board.
   (B)   Creation of share accounts and initial contribution. The Fire Share
Plan shall be initially funded with the sum of $7,840.00, representing
unallocated Chapter 175 funds in the excess state money reserve as of October
1, 2015 in excess of $150,000. For accounting purposes, an individual share
account shall be established for each active firefighter member, including DROP
participants. An eligible active Fire Share Plan "member" is defined as a
firefighter who is currently making contributions to the System, on military
leave, or participating in the DROP, on or after September 30, 2015. The
initial allocation of the excess state monies reserve shall be made to the
share accounts of eligible members based on the credited service of each
eligible member. Each eligible member shall receive an initial allocation equal
to the total months of credited service of the individual member divided by the
total months of credited service of the all eligible members. The Fire Share
Plan shall account for each member's share account balance as provided herein.
   (C)   Annual determination. Each year, after receipt of the annual
distribution of Chapter 175 money from the State, the Board, in consultation
with their actuary, shall determine the amount of available premium tax
revenue, if any, received pursuant to F.S. § 175.351. Premium tax revenue is
not available for payment into the Fire Share Plan unless the annual premium
tax distribution exceeds $825,324 (hereinafter the "special benefit
threshold"). If the annual premium tax distribution exceeds the special benefit
threshold, fifty percent (50%) of the sum above $825,324 shall be paid into the
Fire Share Plan. The remaining fifty percent (50%) shall be used to reduce the
City's annual pension contribution. In future years in which there are
available funds, each member on September 30th of each year shall receive an
equal share of the available funds received during the fiscal year, less
administrative expenses, deposited into his/her share account.
   (D)   Interest crediting. On September 30 of each year share accounts shall
be credited with interest at an annual rate equal to the market rate of return
on pension fund investments for that fiscal year ended September 30, net of
investment related expenses, as reported by the Fund's investment consultant.
Available funds and share account balances shall be commingled with assets of
the System for investment purposes, and invested by the Board with other System
assets. The Plan Administrator shall provide an annual statement to the Board
and each Fire Share Plan member on or before June 1 of each year showing each
member individual share account balance and the interest credited to the
members account for that year. The expense of administering the Fire Share Plan
for the preceding year shall be determined by the Board and charged against the
available funds received for that year, before allocations are made to the
member share accounts. If no funds are available, administration fees shall be
paid by the Fire Pension Plan.
   (E)   Share Plan distributions. Distributions shall only be available for
members who separate from City employment after having been granted an early,
normal or non-duty disability pension, and have attained a minimum of ten (10)
years of credited service, or after having been granted an in-line-of-duty
disability pension, hereinafter "vested" Fire Share Plan members. In the event
a Fire Share Plan member separates from City employment without having become a
vested Share Plan member, the member shall forfeit his/her share account
balance, and the forfeited account balance shall be added to the available
funds for that year. A Fire Share Plan member who separates from City
employment after having become a vested Share Plan member shall be entitled to
a vested share balance. Fire Share Plan funds shall be distributed as follows,
depending on the date that a vested Fire Share Plan member separates from
service:
      (1)   Separation prior to annual approval. If a vested Fire Share Plan
member separates from City employment between October 1st and the date the
Board approves the share balances of the most recent September 30th, eighty
percent (80%) of the last share balance that was approved by the Board shall be
paid within 90 days. The remainder shall be distributed within 90 days after
the Board approves the share balances for the most recent September 30th.
      (2)   Separation after annual approval. If a vested Fire Share Plan
member separates from City employment after the date the Board approves the
share balances of the most recent September 30th, the full share balance as of
the most recent September 30th shall be distributed within 90 days.
   (F)   Rollovers. All or any portion of a member's share account distribution
may be rolled over to an IRA or other qualified plan in accordance with the
Internal Revenue Code. If a member dies before retirement, the member's share
account balance on the date of death shall be distributed in a lump sum to the
member's designated beneficiary or estate in accordance with subsection
55.30 (E)(1) or (E)(2) above.
   (G)   Rule-making authority. The Board shall be authorized to adopt any
rules necessary for the administration of the Fire Share Plan.

cost thereof, (c) the manner of payment therefore, and (d) the amount thereof
to be assessed against each parcel benefitted thereby.
         (b)   Not less than 20 days prior written notice of the time and place

shall be made by affidavit of the City Clerk or Deputy City Clerk, by the City
Engineer, or by such agent of the city as shall be designated by the City
Clerk, such proof to be filed with the City Clerk; provided, that failure to
send such notice or notices shall not invalidate any of the proceedings
hereunder. The names and addresses of the owners of the benefitted properties
shall be obtained from the records of the Property Appraiser or from such other
sources as the City Clerk or City Engineer deems reliable. The notice required
by this Paragraph (5) may be combined with the notice of intent provided for in
§
56.01, provided that any such combined notice shall provide for a public
hearing to be (a) no earlier than the date for declaration of the results of
the election as provided in §
56.06, and (b) that the public hearing for a particular project will be
canceled if the project is not approved as provided in §

in the notice specified in Paragraph (5) above, the Council shall meet to hear
and consider any and all complaints as to the assessments and shall adjust and
equalize the assessments on a basis of justice and right. When so equalized and
approved by resolution of the Council, a final assessment roll shall be filed
with the City Clerk, and such assessments shall stand confirmed and constitute,
until paid, valid and binding liens upon the property against which such
assessments are made, coequal with other governmental liens for unpaid taxes,
as more particularly provided in Subsection (D) below.
         (a)   Promptly after such confirmation, the assessment roll shall be
recorded by the City Clerk in the official records of the city, and such record
of the liens shall constitute prima facie evidence of their validity.
         (b)   Upon completion of the project, the City shall credit to each of
the parcels assessed the difference in the amount of the assessment as
originally made, approved and confirmed and the proportionate part of the
actual cost to be paid by assessments as finally determined upon the completion
of the project, but in no event shall the final assessments exceed the lesser
of (a) the amount of benefits determined to accrue to the property or (b) one
hundred five percent (105%) of the amount originally assessed.
      (7)   Use of uniform method; combined notices and hearings. In the event
that the Council may determine to consider use of the uniform method for
collection of assessments, as set forth in F.S. Ch. 197, notice of intent to
use the uniform method may be combined with the publication of the resolution
provided for in Paragraph (1) above or with the publication of notice of the
hearing on the preliminary assessment roll provided for in Paragraph (5) above;
in such event, the publication shall comply with the provisions of F.S. §
197.3632(3)(a), regarding content and publication requirements, and the mailed
notice shall comply with the requirements of F.S. § 197.3632(4)(b), regarding
content and mailing requirements.
         (a)    At the hearing on use of the uniform method, if the Council
shall determine to use the uniform method, it shall adopt a resolution
satisfying the requirements of F.S. § 197.3632(3)(a), which may be combined
with the resolution required by Paragraph (1) above into one resolution. At the
hearing approving the preliminary assessment roll, the Council shall adopt a
resolution satisfying the requirements of F.S. § 197.3632(4)(c), which may be
combined with the resolution required by Paragraph (5) above into one
resolution.
         (b)   In the event that the Council shall determine to use the uniform
method in connection with the collection of the assessments: (a) there shall be
added to the amount of the annual installment due with respect to each parcel
an amount necessary to compensate the County Property Appraiser and County Tax
Collector for such fees and charges as they may impose in connection with the
collection of such assessments; (b) the amount of each annual installment of
the assessment due with respect to each parcel shall be adjusted as deemed
necessary by the Council to take into account discounts allowed for early
payment of annual installments of assessments and taxes as provided for in Fla.
Stat. Ch. 197; and (c) the annual rate of interest used to calculate the amount
of each annual installment of special assessments may be assumed to be one
percent per annum greater than the net interest cost (as hereinafter defined)
on the obligations issued to finance the project with respect to which the
assessments are levied.
         (c)   The city may enter into interlocal agreements with the County
Property Appraiser and the County Tax Collector regarding (a) any services to
be provided by them in connection with the preparation of the assessment roll,
(b) the collection of the assessments, (c) prepayment of assessments, and (d)
sales of tax certificates and tax deeds with respect to any assessed parcels.
   (D)   Payment of assessments; prepayment; method and terrn of installment
payment; extent and priority of lien; interest. Assessments shall be payable at
the time and in the manner stipulated in the notice mailed pursuant to
Subsection (C), Paragraph (5) above, unless provided otherwise by resolution of
the Council.
      (1)   Assessments may be paid in full within such period of not less than
thirty (30) days following the adoption of the resolution referred to in
Subsection (C), Paragraph (6) above, at such place or places as shall be
specified by the Council in such resolution, and, if so paid, may be allowed a
discount in such amount as shall be determined by the Council to be allocable
to the cost of financing the portion of the project to be financed with
assessments paid in installments, including, but not limited to, costs of
issuance of obligations, capitalized interest and debt service reserves for
obligations, legal and financing fees and expenses, the cost of municipal bond
insurance premiums, discount on the sale of obligations, and such other
expenses as are necessary or desirable in connection with the issuance of the
obligations.
      (2)   Assessments which are not paid in full as provided above may, in
the discretion of the Council, be made payable as nearly as practicable (a) in
equal principal installments to which shall be added interest on the unpaid
principal balance or (b) in equal annual installments of principal and
interest, with interest computed on the unpaid principal balance.
      (3)   In the discretion of the Council, assessments for projects payable
in installments may be made over a period not to exceed the lesser of (a) the
estimated useful life of the project or (b) thirty (30) years from the date of
approval of the final assessment roll pursuant to Subsection (C), Paragraph (6)
above.
      (4)   Unpaid assessments shall constitute a lien against the benefitted
properly in an amount equal to the unpaid principal balance of the assessment
together with (a) interest and penalties thereon to the date of payment, (b)
interest on the obligations issued to finance such assessments to the first
date on which such obligations can be redeemed without penalty, and (c) any
fees and expenses related to the collection of such assessments.
      (5)   Failure to pay assessments being collected using the uniform method
pursuant to Subsection (C), Paragraph (7) above, shall not give rise to
duplicate liens against the assessed parcels based on the sale of tax
certificates or the issuance of tax deeds against the affected parcel; the
amount of the assessment lien hereunder against a parcel shall be for the
unpaid amount of the assessment and the interest and fees associated therewith
as provided above.
      (6)   The lien against properties for unpaid assessments and interest and
expenses associated therewith as provided above shall be a lien coequal with
the lien of all state, county, and municipal taxes, and shall be superior in
dignity to all other liens, titles, and claims. Satisfaction of assessment
liens shall be evidenced by certificate of the City Clerk or the County Tax
Collector, recorded in the Official Records of the city and/or the county
relating to the property assessed. For the purposes of determining the amount
of a recorded special assessment lien in disbursing the proceeds from tax sale
deeds, the lien of record against any property shall be deemed to be the amount
due but not yet paid increased by the amount of any interest and cost of
collection if delinquent. No proceeds from tax sale deeds shall be used to pay
any assessment unless sufficient proceeds are available to pay in full the
assessment.
      (7)   Unpaid assessments shall bear interest at a rate of eight percent
(8%) per annum or, if obligations have been issued secured by the payment of
such assessments, then the unpaid assessments shall bear interest at a rate
equal to the greater of (a) eight percent (8%) per annum or, (b) the net
interest cost rate on such obligations plus one percent (1%) per annum, such
interest to accrue from the date of issuance of the obligations. For purposes
of this paragraph, "net interest cost rate" shall mean the "Net Interest Cost"
as shown on Line 20, Column (g), Form 8038-G, Department of the Treasury,
Internal Revenue Service, or a rate calculated in a comparable manner.
   (E)   Legal proceedings instituted upon failure of property owner to pay
special assessment or interest when due; foreclosure; service of process. If
the Council has not elected to use the uniform method with respect to any
assessments, the following provisions shall apply to such assessments. Each
annual assessment installment shall be paid upon the dates specified in the
notice mailed pursuant to Subsection (C), Paragraph (5) above, unless provided
otherwise by resolution of the Council, with interest upon all deferred
payments, until the entire amount of the assessment has been paid. Upon the
failure of any property owner to pay any annual installment due, or any part
thereof, or any annual interest upon deferred payments, the Council may cause
to be brought the necessary legal proceedings to enforce payment thereof with
all accrued interest and penalties, together with all legal costs incurred,
including reasonable attorneys' fees, to be assessed as part of the costs. In
the event of default in the payment of any installment of an assessment, or any
accrued interest on such assessment, the whole assessment, with the interest
and penalties thereon, shall immediately become due and payable and subject to
foreclosure. In the foreclosure of any special assessment, service of process
against unknown or nonresident defendants may be had by publication, as
provided by law. The foreclosure proceedings shall be prosecuted to a sale and
conveyance of the property involved in such proceedings as now provided by law
in suits to foreclose mortgages, or, in the alternative, such proceeding may be
instituted and prosecuted under Fla. Stat. Ch. 173, or as otherwise provided by
law.
   (F)   Council required to make new assessments until valid assessment is
made if special assessment is omitted or held invalid. If any assessment made
under the provisions of this section shall be either in whole or in part
annulled, vacated or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the Council
shall be satisfied that any such assessment is so irregular or defective that
the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the Council shall have omitted
to make such assessment when it might have done so, the Council shall take all
necessary steps to cause a new assessment to be made for the whole or any part
of any project or against any property benefitted by any project, following as
nearly as may be the provisions of this section, and in case such second
assessment shall be annulled, the Council shall obtain and make other
assessments until a valid assessment shall be made.
   (G)   Assessment roll sufficient evidence of assessment and other
proceedings of this subchapter; variance not material unless party objecting
materially injured thereby. Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings
in connection with the levy of any assessment under the provisions of this
subchapter shall not affect the validity of the assessment where the assessment
roll has been confirmed by the Council. The assessment roll as finally approved
and confirmed shall be competent and sufficient evidence that the assessment
was duly levied, that the assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all
other proceedings adequate to the adoption of the assessment roll were duly
had, taken and performed as required by this subchapter, and no variance from
the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that
the party objecting was materially prejudiced thereby. However, nothing in this
section shall relieve the Council or the City Clerk from the obligation to
notify the affected property owners of the assessments as required by this
subchapter.
   (H)   Other expenditures for projects. The city may pay out of its general
fund or out of any special fund that may be provided for that purpose, such
portion of the cost of any project as it may deem proper.
   (I)   Plats, plans and specifications. All assessment plats, plans and
specifications, cost estimates and records of the names and addresses of the
owners of property to be assessed shall be kept and maintained by the
engineering, public works, or other similar department of the city, or such
other office or officer of the city as may be specified by the Council from
time to time.
   (J)   Amendment. Before or after the issuance of Obligations as described in
this subchapter, the project or projects for which such obligations are
authorized may be amended or substituted by the amendment of the resolution
authorizing the obligations. If such amendment shall involve a change in the
location or nature of any project, or a change in the benefitted property or in
the amount of such benefit, the Council shall, before or after the amendment to
the resolution, proceed to amend the assessment roll and record the appropriate
notations in the official records of the city. The procedures set forth in
Subsection (C), Paragraph (5) above, shall be followed in making such amendment
to the assessment roll and the official records of the city. The assessments
levied as a result of such amendment or substitution of projects, together with
the assessments previously levied and not amended or substituted, shall be not
less than the amount necessary to provide for payment of the principal,
interest and applicable redemption and/or mandatory purchase premium with
respect to the obligations.

such obligations, the city is authorized to issue, or cause to be issued on
behalf of the city, as the case may be, bonds, notes, certificates, and other
forms of indebtedness (collectively, the "obligations") from time to time. Such
obligations may be issued in bearer form or fully registered form; may be
delivered by means of physical certificates or a book-entry system, or any
combination thereof; may be in such denomination or denominations; may bear
interest at such rate or rates not exceeding the maximum rate allowed by law,
payable on a current basis or at maturity; and may mature at such time or times
(not exceeding two (2) years after the last special assessment installment
payment date for obligations secured solely by special assessments); all as
shall be determined by the Council at or prior to the time of sale of the
obligations. The obligations may be made redeemable or subject to mandatory
tender for purchase before maturity, at the option of the city or the holders
thereof, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as shall
be fixed by the Council prior to their issuance. The Council shall determine
the place or places of payment of the principal, redemption premium, if any,
and interest on the obligations, which may be at the office of the City Clerk,
or any bank or trust company within or without the State of Florida. The
obligations shall be signed by the manual or facsimile signature of the Mayor,
and attested by the manual or facsimile signature of the City Clerk, and may

which is manually executed thereon; and shall have the seal of the city
affixed, imprinted, reproduced or lithographed thereon; all as shall be
prescribed in the resolution or resolutions authorizing the issuance of the
obligations. The obligations may be delivered to any contractor for payment of
his work in constructing projects, or may be sold at public or private sale at
such price or prices as the Council shall determine.

in excess of the aggregate amount of the assessments to be levied against the
property specially benefitted by the projects. A special fund, known as
"Special Assessment Bonds, Series , Sinking Fund," shall be used for the
payment of the principal, redemption and/or mandatory purchase premium and
interest on such obligations. All the proceeds collected by the city with
respect to the assessment liens for the project shall be deposited and held in
such Fund. Any surplus remaining after payment of all such obligations may be
used (a) to reimburse the city for any moneys expended or advanced to pay the
cost of the project for which the assessments were levied or to make payments
of debt service on the obligations, (b) to rebate to the owners of properties
assessed a pro rata portion of the amounts originally assessed, (c) to pay the
cost of other improvements benefitting the properties assessed, (d) to pay for
other capital improvements in the city, or (e) for other lawful municipal
purposes.
      (2)   Financing of multiple projects. The city is hereby authorized to
finance multiple projects with a single issuance of obligations, and to issue
obligations prior to the equalization, approval and confirmation of the
assessment roll for a project. The city shall not be required to let contracts
for any projects before adoption of any resolution authorizing the issuance of
obligations. It shall not be necessary for specially benefitted property to
connect to any utility projects before assessments may be collected therefore,
as long as connections are or will, within a reasonable time after completion
of the project, be available from the city. The City Clerk shall not be
required to certify in regard to any obligations that the amount of assessment
liens levied as security for any obligations are equal to the amount of the
obligations.

Collector. The duties of the Property Appraiser and Tax Collector under the
Uniform Assessment Collection Act are ministerial.
      (5)   The purpose of this subchapter is to: (1) provide procedures and
standards for the imposition of Assessments within the City by resolution under
the general home rule powers of a City to impose special assessments, and (2)
authorize a procedure for the funding of public services, facilities, programs,
or Local Improvements providing special benefit to subsequently identified
property within the City.
(Ord. 2017-35, passed 5-4-17)
§ 56.41 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Creation of assessment areas.
      (1)   The Council is hereby authorized to create Assessment Areas in
accordance with the procedures set forth herein to include property located
within the City that is specially benefitted by the services, facilities,
programs, or Local Improvements proposed for funding from the proceeds of
Assessments to be imposed therein.
      (2)   Either the Initial Assessment Resolution proposing each Assessment
Area or the Final Assessment Resolution creating each Assessment Area shall
include brief descriptions of the proposed services, facilities, programs, or
Local Improvements, a description of the property to be included within the
Assessment Area, and specific legislative findings that recognize the special
benefit to be provided by each proposed service, facility, program, or Local
Improvements to property within the Assessment Area.
      (3)   At its option, the Council may establish a process pursuant to
which the owners of property may petition for creation of an Assessment Area to
fund services, facilities, programs, or Local Improvements. Notwithstanding any
petition process established pursuant to this section, the Council shall retain
the authority to create Assessment Areas without a landowner petition.
   (B)   Revisions to assessments. If any Assessment made under the provisions
of this subchapter is either in whole or in part annulled, vacated, or set
aside by the judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction, or if the Council
is satisfied that any such Assessment is so irregular or defective that the
same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the Council has omitted to include
any property on the Assessment Roll which property should have been so
included, the Council may take all necessary steps to impose a new Assessment
against any property benefited by the Service Costs, Capital Costs or Project
Costs, following as nearly as may be practicable, the provisions of this
subchapter, and in case such second Assessment is annulled, vacated, or set
aside, the Council may obtain and impose other Assessments until a valid
Assessment is imposed.
   (C)   Procedural irregularities. Any informality or irregularity in the
proceedings in connection with the levy of any Assessment under the provisions
of this subchapter shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval
thereof, and any Assessment, as finally approved, shall be competent and
sufficient evidence that such Assessment was duly levied, that the Assessment
was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to such
Assessment were duly had, taken, and performed as required by this subchapter;
and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it
be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Subsection, any party objecting to an
Assessment imposed pursuant to this subchapter must file an objection with a
court of competent jurisdiction within the time periods prescribed herein.
   (D)   Correction of errors and omissions.
      (1)   No act of error or omission on the part of the Property Appraiser,
Tax Collector, City Manager, City Council, their deputies, employees, or
designees, shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of
an Assessment imposed by the Council under the provision of this subchapter.
      (2)   When it shall appear that any Assessment should have been imposed
under this subchapter against a lot or parcel of property specially benefited
by the provision of a service, facility, program, or Local Improvement, but
such property was omitted from the Assessment Roll, the Council may, upon
provision of appropriate notice as set forth in this section, impose the
applicable Assessment for the Fiscal Year in which such error is discovered.
Such total Assessment shall become delinquent if not fully paid upon the
expiration of 60 days from the date of the adoption of said resolution. The
Assessment so imposed shall constitute a lien against such property equal in
rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal
taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other
prior liens, mortgages, titles and claims in and to or against the real
property involved and may be collected as provided in §
56.45 hereof.
      (3)   The City Manager shall have the authority at any time, upon his or
her own initiative or in response to a timely filed petition from the Owner of
any Assessed Property, to correct any error in applying the Assessment
apportionment method to any particular property not otherwise requiring the
provision of notice pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Any such
correction that reduces an Assessment shall be considered valid ab initio and
shall in no way affect the enforcement of the Assessment imposed under the
provisions of this subchapter. Any such correction which increases an
Assessment or imposes an Assessment on omitted property shall first require
notice to the affected owner in the manner described in §§
56.42(E) and
56.43(E) hereof, as applicable, providing the date, time and place that the
Council will consider confirming the correction and offering the owner an
opportunity to be heard. All requests from affected property owners for any
such changes, modifications or corrections shall be referred to, and processed
by, the City Manager and not the Property Appraiser or Tax Collector.
      (4)   After the Assessment Roll has been delivered to the Tax Collector
in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes,
modifications, or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance with the
procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the Tax Roll
upon timely written request and direction of the City Manager.
   (E)   Lien of assessments.
      (1)   Upon the adoption of the Assessment Roll, all Assessments shall
constitute a lien against such property equal in rank and dignity with the
liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special
assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall be superior
in dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims, until paid.
      (2)   The lien for an Assessment shall be deemed perfected upon adoption
by the Council of the Final Assessment Resolution or the Annual Rate
Resolution, whichever is applicable. The lien for an Assessment collected under
the Uniform Assessment Collection Act shall attach to the property as provided
by law. The lien for an Assessment collected under the alternative method of
collection provided in §
56.44(B) shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the Council of the Final
Assessment Resolution or the Annual Rate Resolution, whichever is applicable,
and shall attach to the property on such date of adoption.
   (F)   Authorization for exemptions and hardship assistance.
      (1)   The Council, in its sole discretion, shall determine whether to
provide exemptions from payment of an Assessment for Government Property or
other property whose use is wholly or partially exempt from ad valorem taxation
under Florida law.
      (2)   The Council, in its sole discretion, shall determine whether to
provide a program of hardship assistance, either through monetary contributions
or extended payment terms, to City residents who are living below or close to
the poverty level and are at risk of losing title to their homes as a result of
the imposition of an Assessment.
      (3)   The Council shall designate the funds available to provide any
exemptions or hardship assistance. The provision of an exemption or hardship
assistance in any one year shall in no way establish a right or entitlement to
such exemption or assistance in any subsequent year and the provision of funds
in any year may be limited to the extent funds are available and appropriated
by the Council. Any funds designated for exemptions or hardship assistance
shall be paid by the City from funds other than those generated by the
Assessment.
      (4)   Any shortfall in the expected Assessment proceeds due to any
hardship assistance or exemption from payment of the Assessments required by
law or authorized by the Council shall be supplemented by any legally available
funds, or combination of such funds, and shall not be paid for by proceeds or
funds derived from the Assessments. In the event a court of competent
jurisdiction determines any exemption or reduction by the Council is improper
or otherwise adversely affects the validity of the Assessment imposed for any
Fiscal Year, the sole and exclusive remedy shall be the imposition of an
Assessment upon each affected Tax Parcel in the amount of the Assessment that
would have been otherwise imposed save for such reduction or exemption afforded
to such Tax Parcel by the Council.
(Ord. 2017-35, passed 5-4-17)
§ 56.42 SERVICE ASSESSMENTS.
   (A)   General authority.
      (1)   The Council is hereby authorized to impose an annual Service
Assessment to fund all or any portion of the Service Cost on benefitted
property at a rate of assessment based on the special benefit accruing to such
property from the City's provision of the subsequently identified service,
facility, or program.
      (2)   The amount of the Service Assessment that is imposed each Fiscal
Year against each parcel of Assessed Property shall be determined pursuant to
an apportionment methodology based upon a classification of property designed
to provide a fair and reasonable apportionment of the Service Cost among
properties on a basis reasonably related to the special benefit provided by the
service, facility, or program funded with assessment proceeds.
      (3)   Nothing contained in this subchapter shall be construed to require
the imposition of Assessments against Government Property.
      (4)   All Service Assessments shall be imposed in conformity with the
procedures set forth in this §
56.42.
   (B)   Initial assessment resolution.  The first step for the initial
imposition of a Service Assessment shall be the Council's adoption of an
Initial Assessment Resolution (A) describing the property to be located within
any proposed Assessment Area; (B) containing a brief and general description of
the services, facilities, or programs to be provided; (C) determining the
Service Cost to be assessed; (D) describing the method of apportioning the
Service Cost and the computation of the Assessments for specific properties;
(E) establishing an estimated assessment rate for the upcoming Fiscal Year; (F)
establishing a Maximum Assessment Rate, if desired by the Council; (G)
authorizing the date, time, and place of a public hearing to consider the
adoption of the Final Assessment Resolution for the upcoming Fiscal Year; and
(H) directing the City Manager to (1) prepare the initial Assessment Roll, as
required by §
56.42(C) hereof, (2) publish the notice required by §
56.42(D) hereof, and (3) mail the notice required by §
56.42(E) hereof.
   (C)   Service assessment roll.
      (1)   The City Manager shall prepare, or direct the preparation of, the
initial Assessment Roll for the Service Assessments, which shall contain the
following:
         (a)   A summary description of all Assessed Property conforming to the
description contained on the Tax Roll.
         (b)   The name of the Owner of the Assessed Property.
         (c)   The number of Assessment Units attributable to each parcel.
         (d)   The estimated maximum annual assessment for each Assessment
Unit.
         (e)   The amount of the Service Assessment to be imposed against each
Assessed Property.
      (2)   Copies of the Initial Assessment Resolution and the preliminary
Assessment Roll shall be available in the office of the City Manager and open
to public inspection. The foregoing shall not be construed to require that the
Assessment Roll be in printed form if the amount of the Service Assessment for
each parcel of property can be determined by use of a computer terminal
available to the public.
   (D)   Notice by publication.  Upon completion of the initial Assessment Roll
and each year thereafter, the City Manager shall publish notice of a public
hearing to adopt the Final Assessment Resolution and approve the aforementioned
initial Assessment Roll. The published notice shall conform to the requirements
set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act.
   (E)   Notice by mail.
      (1)   For the initial Fiscal Year in which a Service Assessment is
imposed by the Council against Assessed Property pursuant to the Uniform
Assessment Collection Act and in addition to the published notice required by §
56.42(D), the City Manager shall provide notice of the proposed Service
Assessment by first class mail to the owner of each parcel of property subject
to a Service Assessment.
      (2)   The mailed notice shall conform to the requirements set forth in
the Uniform Assessment Collection Act.
      (3)   Notice shall be deemed mailed upon delivery thereof to the
possession of the United States Postal Service. Failure of the Owner to receive
such notice due to mistake or inadvertence, shall not affect the validity of
the Assessment Roll nor release or discharge any obligation for payment of a
Service Assessment imposed by the Council pursuant to this subchapter.
      (4)   Notice by mail for Fiscal Years after the initial Fiscal Year shall
be controlled by §
56.42(H)(6) hereof.
   (F)   Final assessment resolution.
      (1)   The last step for the imposition of a Service Assessment for the
initial Fiscal Year shall be the Council's adoption of a Final Assessment
Resolution.
      (2)   At the time named in the notices required by §
56.42(D) and (E) or to such time as an adjournment or continuance may be taken
by the Council, the Council shall receive any written objections of interested
persons and may then, or at any subsequent meeting of the Council, adopt the
Final Assessment Resolution which shall (A) create any Assessment Area; (B)
confirm, modify, or repeal the Initial Assessment Resolution with such
amendments, if any, as may be deemed appropriate by the Council; (C) establish
the Maximum Assessment Rate, if desired by the Council and set the rate of
assessment to be imposed in the upcoming fiscal year; (D) approve the initial
Assessment Roll, with such amendments as it deems just and right; and (E)
determine the method of collection.
      (3)   All parcels assessed shall derive a special benefit from the
service, facility, or program to be provided or constructed and the Service
Assessment shall be fairly and reasonably apportioned among the properties that
receive the special benefit.
      (4)   All objections to the Final Assessment Resolution shall be made in
writing, and filed with the City Manager at or before the time or adjourned
time of such hearing.
      (5)   The Final Assessment Resolution shall constitute the Annual Rate
Resolution for the initial Fiscal Year in which Assessments are imposed or
reimposed hereunder.
   (G)   Effect of final assessment resolution. The Service Assessments for the
initial Fiscal Year shall be established upon adoption of the Final Assessment
Resolution. The adoption of the Final Assessment Resolution shall be the final
adjudication of the issues presented (including, but not limited to, the method
of apportionment and assessment, the Maximum Assessment Rate, the initial rate
of assessment, the initial Assessment Roll, and the levy and lien of the
Service Assessments), unless proper steps are initiated in a court of competent
jurisdiction to secure relief within 20 days from the date of Council action on
the Final Assessment Resolution. The initial Assessment Roll, as approved by
the Final Assessment Resolution, shall be delivered to the Tax Collector, or
the Property Appraiser if so directed by the Tax Collector, or if an
alternative method is used to collect the Service Assessments, such other
official as the Council by resolution shall designate.
   (H)   Subsequent year adoption procedures.
      (1)   Annually, during the budget adoption process, the Council shall
determine whether to reimpose a Service Assessment for each Fiscal Year
following the initial Fiscal Year. If the Council elects to reimpose a Service
Assessment, the procedures in this §
56.42(H) shall be followed.
      (2)   The first step for the reimposition of an annual Service Assessment
after the initial Fiscal Year shall be the adoption of a Preliminary Rate
Resolution by the Council (1) containing a brief and general description of the
services, facilities, or programs to be provided; (2) determining the Service
Cost to be assessed for the upcoming Fiscal Year; (3) establishing the
estimated assessment rate for the upcoming Fiscal Year; (4) establishing or
increasing a Maximum Assessment Rate, if desired by the Council; (5)
authorizing the date, time, and place of a public hearing to receive and
consider comments from the public and consider the adoption of the Annual Rate
Resolution for the upcoming Fiscal Year; and (6) directing the City Manager to
(a) update the Assessment Roll, (b) provide notice by publication and first
class mail to affected Owners in the event circumstances described in
subsection (H)(6) so require, and (c) directing and authorizing any
supplemental or additional notice deemed proper, necessary or convenient by the
City.
      (3)   The second step for the reimposition of an annual Service
Assessment after the initial Fiscal Year shall be the adoption of an Annual
Rate Resolution by the Council. At the public hearing established in the
Preliminary Rate Resolution or to which an adjournment or continuance may be
taken by the Council, the Council shall receive any oral or written objections
of interested persons and may then, or at any subsequent meeting of the
Council, adopt the Annual Rate Resolution, which shall (1) establish the rate
of assessment to be imposed in the upcoming Fiscal Year and (2) approve the
Assessment Roll for the upcoming Fiscal Year with such adjustments as the
Council deems just and right. The Assessment Roll shall be prepared in
accordance with the method of apportionment set forth in the Initial Assessment
Resolution, or any subsequent Preliminary Rate Resolution, together with
modifications, if any, that are provided and confirmed in the Final Assessment
Resolution or any subsequent Annual Rate Resolution.
      (4)   Nothing herein shall preclude the Council from providing annual
notification to all Owners of Assessed Property in the manner provided in §
56.42(D) and (E) or any other method as provided by law.
      (5)   The Council may establish or increase a Maximum Assessment Rate in
an Initial Assessment Resolution or Preliminary Rate Resolution and confirm
such Maximum Assessment Rate in the Final Assessment Resolution or Annual Rate
Resolution in the event notice of such Maximum Rate Assessment has been
included in the notices required by §
56.42(D) and (E).
      (6)   In the event (1) the proposed Assessment for any Fiscal Year
exceeds the rates of assessment adopted by the Council, including a Maximum
Assessment Rate, if any, that were listed in the notices previously provided to
the Owners of Assessed Property, (2) the purpose for which the Assessment is
imposed or the use of the revenue from the Assessment is substantially changed
from that represented by notice previously provided to the Owners of Assessed
Property, (3) Assessed Property is reclassified or the method of apportionment
is revised or altered resulting in an increased Assessment from that
represented by notice previously provided to the Owners of Assessed Property,
or (4) an Assessment Roll contains Assessed Property that was not included on
the Assessment Roll approved for the prior Fiscal Year, notice shall be
provided by publication and first class mail to the Owners of such Assessed
Property as provided by law. Such notice shall substantially conform with the
notice requirements set forth in §
56.42(D) and (E) and inform the Owner of the date, time, and place for the
adoption of the Annual Rate Resolution. The failure of the Owner to receive
such notice due to mistake or inadvertence, shall not affect the validity of
the Assessment Roll nor release or discharge any obligation for payment of a
Service Assessment imposed by the Council pursuant to this subchapter.
      (7)   As to any Assessed Property not included on an Assessment Roll
approved by the adoption of the Final Assessment Resolution or a prior year's
Annual Rate Resolution, the adoption of the succeeding Annual Rate Resolution
shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented as to such Assessed
Property (including, but not limited to, the determination of special benefit
and fair apportionment to the Assessed Property, the method of apportionment
and assessment, the rate of assessment, the establishment or increase of a
Maximum Assessment Rate, the Assessment Roll, and the levy and lien of the
Assessments), unless proper steps are initiated in a court of competent
jurisdiction to secure relief within 20 days from the date of the Council
action on the Annual Rate Resolution. Nothing contained herein shall be
construed or interpreted to affect the finality of any Assessment not
challenged within the required 20-day period for those Assessments previously
imposed against Assessed Property by the inclusion of the Assessed Property on
an Assessment Roll approved in the Final Assessment Resolution or any
subsequent Annual Rate Resolution.
      (8)   The Assessment Roll, as approved by the Annual Rate Resolution,
shall be delivered to the Tax Collector as required by the Uniform Assessment
Collection Act, or if the alternative method described in §
56.44(B) is used to collect the Assessments, such other official as the Council
by resolution shall designate. If the Assessment against any property shall be
sustained, reduced, or abated by the court, an adjustment shall be made on the
Assessment Roll.
   (I)   Interim service assessments.
      (1)   An interim Service Assessment may be imposed against all property,
for which a Certificate of Occupancy is issued, after adoption of the Annual
Rate Resolution. The amount of the interim Service Assessment shall be
calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall be one twelfth of the annual rate
for such property computed in accordance with the Annual Rate Resolution for
the Fiscal Year for which the interim Service Assessment is being imposed. Such
monthly rate shall be imposed for each full calendar month remaining in the
Fiscal Year. In addition to the monthly rate, the interim Service Assessment
may also include an estimate of the subsequent Fiscal Year Service Assessment.
      (2)   No Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued until full payment of
the interim Service Assessment is received by the City. Issuance of the
Certificate of Occupancy without the payment in full of the interim Service
Assessment shall not relieve the Owner of such property of the obligation of
full payment. Any interim Service Assessment not collected prior to the
issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy may be collected pursuant to the
Uniform Assessment Collection Act as provided in §
56.44(A) of this subchapter or by any other method authorized by law. Any
interim Service Assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the
Certificate of Occupancy was issued and shall constitute a lien against such
property as of that date. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the
liens of all state, City, district or municipal taxes and special assessments,
and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and
claims in and to or against the real property involved and shall be deemed
perfected upon the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy.

if so directed by the Tax Collector, or if an alternative method is used to
collect the Capital Assessments, such other official as the Council by
resolution shall designate.
   (H)   Subsequent year adoption procedures.
      (1)   Annually, during the budget adoption process, the Council shall
adopt an Annual Rate Resolution for each Fiscal Year in which Capital
Assessments will be imposed to fund the Capital Cost or Project Cost of a Local
Improvement. The Annual Rate Resolution shall (1) establish the rate of
assessment to be imposed in the upcoming Fiscal Year and (2) approve the
Assessment Roll for the upcoming Fiscal Year with such adjustments as the
Council deems just and right. The Assessment Roll shall be prepared in
accordance with the method of apportionment set forth in the Initial Assessment
Resolution, as confirmed or amended by the Final Assessment Resolution. Failure
to adopt an Annual Assessment Resolution during the budget adoption process for
a Fiscal Year may be cured at any time.
      (2)   In the event (1) the proposed Capital Assessment for any Fiscal
Year exceeds the Maximum Assessment Rate included in notice previously provided
to the Owners of Assessed Property, (2) the purpose for which the Capital
Assessment is imposed is substantially changed from that represented by notice
previously provided to the Owners of Assessed Property, (3) Assessed Property
is reclassified or the method of apportionment is revised or altered resulting
in an increased Capital Assessment from that represented by notice previously
provided to the owners of Assessed Property, or (4) an Assessment Roll contains
Assessed Property that was not included on the Assessment Roll approved for the
prior Fiscal Year, notice shall be provided by publication and first class mail
to the Owner of such Assessed Property as provided by law. Such notice shall
substantially conform with the notice requirements set forth in §
56.43(D) and (E) and inform the Owners of the date, time and place for the
adoption of the Annual Rate Resolution. The failure of an Owner to receive such
supplemental notice due to mistake or inadvertence, shall not affect the
validity of the Assessment Roll nor release or discharge any obligation for
payment of a Capital Assessment imposed by the Council pursuant to this
subchapter.
      (3)   As to any Assessed Property not included on an Assessment Roll
approved by the adoption of the Final Assessment Resolution or a prior year's
Annual Rate Resolution, the adoption of the succeeding Annual Rate Resolution
shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented as to such Assessed
Property (including, but not limited to, the determination of special benefit
and fair apportionment to the Assessed Property, the method of apportionment
and assessment, the rate of assessment, the establishment or increase of a
Maximum Assessment Rate, the Assessment Roll, and the levy and lien of the
Assessments), unless proper steps are initiated in a court of competent
jurisdiction to secure relief within 20 days from the date of the Council
action on the Annual Rate Resolution. Nothing contained herein shall be
construed or interpreted to affect the finality of any Assessment not
challenged within the required 20-day period for those Assessments previously
imposed against Assessed Property by the inclusion of the Assessed Property on
an Assessment Roll approved in the Final Assessment Resolution or any
subsequent Annual Rate Resolution.
      (4)   The Assessment Roll, as approved by the Annual Rate Resolution,
shall be delivered to the Tax Collector as required by the Uniform Assessment
Collection Act, or the Property Appraiser if so directed by the Tax Collector,
or if an alternative method described in §
56.44(B) is used to collect the Capital Assessments, such other official as the
Council by resolution shall designate. If the Capital Assessment against any
property shall be sustained, reduced, or abated by the Council, an adjustment
shall be made on the Assessment Roll.
(Ord. 2017-35, passed 5-4-17)
§ 56.44 COLLECTION AND USE OF ASSESSMENTS.
   (A)   Method of collection.
      (1)   Unless otherwise directed by the Council, the Assessments shall be
collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, and the City shall
comply with all applicable provisions of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act.
The Resolution of Intent required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act may
be adopted either prior to or following the Initial Assessment Resolution;
provided however, that the Resolution of Intent must be adopted prior to
January 1 (or March 1 with consent of the Property Appraiser and Tax Collector)
of the year in which the Assessments are first collected on the ad valorem tax
bill. Any hearing or notice required by this subchapter may be combined with
any other hearing or notice required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act.
      (2)   The amount of an Assessment to be collected using the Uniform
Assessment Collection Act for any specific parcel of benefitted property may
include an amount equivalent to the payment delinquency, delinquency fees and
recording costs for prior years' assessment for a comparable service, facility,
program, or Local Improvement provided, (1) the collection method used in
connection with the prior year's assessment did not employ the use of the
Uniform Assessment Collection Act, (2) notice is provided to the Owner, and (3)
any lien on the affected parcel for the prior year's assessment is supplanted
and transferred to such Assessment upon certification of a non-ad valorem roll
to the Tax Collector by the City.
   (B)   Alternative method of collection. In lieu of using the Uniform
Assessment Collection Act, the City may elect to collect the assessment by any
other method which is authorized by law or provided as follows:
      (1)   The City shall provide Assessment bills by first class mail to the
Owner of each affected parcel of property, other than government property. The
bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include (a) a brief explanation
of the Assessment, (b) a description of the Assessment Units used to determine
the amount of the Assessment, (c) the number of Assessment Units attributable
to the parcel, (d) the total amount of the parcel's Assessment for the
appropriate period, (e) the location at which payment will be accepted, (f) the
date on which the Assessment is due, and (g) a statement that the Assessment
constitutes a lien against Assessed Property equal in rank and dignity with the
liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad
valorem assessments.
      (2)   A general notice of the lien resulting from imposition of the
Assessments shall be recorded in the official records of City of Palm Bay,
Florida. Nothing herein shall be construed to require that individual liens or
releases be filed in the official records.
      (3)   The City shall have the right to collect all delinquent Assessments
in the manner provided by law. An assessment shall become delinquent if it is
not paid within thirty (30) days from the due date. The City or its agent shall
notify any property owner who is delinquent in payment of an Assessment within
sixty (60) days from the date such Assessment was due. Such notice shall state
in effect that the City or its agent will initiate a foreclosure action and
cause the foreclosure of such property subject to a delinquent assessment in a
method now or hereafter provided by law for foreclosure of mortgages on real
estate, or otherwise as provided by law.
      (4)   All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees
and title search expenses, related to any foreclosure action as described
herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. At the
sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the City may be the purchaser to
the same extent as an individual person or corporation. The City may join in
one foreclosure action the collection of Assessments against any or all
property assessed in accordance with the provisions hereof. All delinquent
property owners whose property is foreclosed shall be liable for an apportioned
amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the City and its agents,
including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent
assessments and any other costs incurred by the City as a result of such
delinquent Assessments including, but not limited to, costs paid for draws on a
credit facility and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition
to, the costs of the action.
      (5)   In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent Assessment and the costs,
fees and expenses attributable thereto, may be collected pursuant to the
Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided however, that (a) notice is
provided to the owner in the manner required by law and this article, and (b)
any existing lien of record on the affected parcel for the delinquent
Assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from certification of the
Assessment Roll to the Tax Collector.
   (C)   Government property.  In lieu of using the Uniform Assessment
Collection Act to collect Assessments from Government Property, the City may
elect to use any other method authorized by law or provided by this Subsection
as follows:
      (1)   The City shall provide Assessment bills by first class mail to the
Owner of each affected parcel of Government Property. The bill or accompanying
explanatory material shall include (1) a brief explanation of the Assessment,
(2) a description of the unit of measurement used to determine the amount of
the Assessment, (3) the number of units contained within the parcel, (4) the
total amount of the parcel's Assessment for the appropriate period, (5) the
location at which payment will be accepted, and (6) the date on which the
Assessment is due.
      (2)   Assessments imposed against Government Property shall be due on the
same date as all other Assessments and, if applicable, shall be subject to the
same discounts for early payment.
      (3)   An Assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30
days from the date any installment is due. The City shall notify the Owner of
any Government Property that is delinquent in payment of its Assessment within
60 days from the date such Assessment was due. Such notice shall state that the
City will initiate a mandamus or other appropriate judicial action to compel
payment.
      (4)   All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees
and title search expenses, related to any mandamus or other action as described
herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. All
delinquent owners of Government Property against which a mandamus or other
appropriate action is filed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the City, including reasonable
attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent Assessments and any other costs
incurred by the City as a result of such delinquent Assessments and the same
shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action.
      (5)   As an alternative to the foregoing, an Assessment imposed against
Government Property may be collected on the bill for any utility service
provided to such Government Property. The Council may contract for such billing
services with any utility not owned by the City.

§ 56.45 ISSUANCE OF OBLIGATIONS.
   (A)   General authority.

the Project Cost thereof.
      (2)   If issued, the principal of and interest on each series of

Council, the City may agree, by resolution, to budget and appropriate funds to
make up any deficiency in the reserve account established for the Obligations
or in the payment of the Obligations, from other non-ad valorem revenue
sources. The Council may also provide, by resolution, for a pledge of or lien
upon proceeds of such non-ad valorem revenue sources for the benefit of the
holders of the Obligations. Any such resolution shall determine the nature and
extent of any pledge of or lien upon proceeds of such non-ad valorem revenue
sources.
   (B)   Terms of the obligations. If issued, the Obligations shall be dated,
shall bear interest at such rate or rates, shall mature at such times as may be
determined by resolution of the Council, and may be made redeemable before
maturity, at the option of the City, at such price or prices and under such
terms and conditions, all as may be fixed by the Council. Said Obligations
shall mature not later than 40 years after their issuance. The Council shall
determine by resolution the form of the Obligations, the manner of executing
such Obligations, and shall fix the denominations of such Obligations, the
place or places of payment of the principal and interest, which may be at any
bank or trust company within or outside of the State of Florida, and such other
terms and provisions of the Obligations as it deems appropriate. The
Obligations may be sold at public or private sale for such price or prices as
the Council shall determine by resolution. The Obligations may be delivered to
any contractor to pay for construction of the Local Improvements or may be sold
in such manner and for such price as the Council may determine by resolution to
be for the best interests of the City.
   (C)   Variable rate obligations.  At the option of the Council, Obligations
may bear interest at a variable rate.
   (D)   Temporary obligations. Prior to the preparation of definitive
Obligations of any series, the Council may, under like restrictions, issue
interim receipts, interim certificates, or temporary Obligations, exchangeable
for definitive Obligations when such Obligations have been executed and are
available for delivery. The Council may also provide for the replacement of any
Obligations which shall become mutilated, destroyed or lost. Obligations may be
issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions

of the Capital Assessments, the proceeds of the notes and such other legally
available money as the Council deems appropriate by resolution. Said notes
shall mature within five years of their issuance and shall bear interest at a
rate not exceeding the maximum rate provided by law. The Council may issue
Obligations or renewal notes to repay the notes. The notes shall be issued in
the same manner as the Obligations.
   (F)   Taxing power not pledged.  Obligations issued under the provisions of
this subchapter shall not be deemed to constitute a general obligation or
pledge of the full faith and credit of the City within the meaning of the
Constitution of the State of Florida, but such Obligations shall be payable
only from Pledged Revenue in the manner provided herein and by the resolution
authorizing the Obligations. The issuance of Obligations under the provisions
of this subchapter shall not directly or indirectly obligate the City to levy
or to pledge any form of ad valorem taxation whatever therefor. No holder of
any such Obligations shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of the ad
valorem taxing power on the part of the City to pay any such Obligations or the
interest thereon or to enforce payment of such Obligations or the interest
thereon against any property of the City, nor shall such Obligations constitute
a charge, lien or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the
City, except the Pledged Revenue.
   (G)   Trust funds. The Pledged Revenue received pursuant to the authority of
this subchapter shall be deemed to be trust funds, to be held and applied
solely as provided in this subchapter and in the resolution authorizing
issuance of the Obligations. Such Pledged Revenue may be invested by the City,
or its designee, in the manner provided by the resolution authorizing issuance
of the Obligations. The Pledged Revenue upon receipt thereof by the City shall
be subject to the lien and pledge of the holders of any Obligations or any
entity other than the City providing credit enhancement on the Obligations.
   (H)   Remedies of holders. Any holder of Obligations, except to the extent
the rights herein given may be restricted by the resolution authorizing
issuance of the Obligations, may, whether at law or in equity, by suit, action,
mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the
laws of the State of Florida or granted hereunder or under such resolution, and
may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by this part, or
by such resolution, to be performed by the City.
   (I)   Refunding obligations.  The City may, by resolution of the Council,
issue Obligations to refund any Obligations issued pursuant to this subchapter,
or any other obligations of the City theretofore issued to finance the Project
Cost of a Local Improvement and provide for the rights of the holders hereof.
Such refunding Obligations may be issued in an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of the principal of, redemption premium, if any, and interest on
the outstanding Obligations to be refunded. If the issuance of such refunding
Obligations results in an annual Assessment that exceeds the estimated maximum
annual Capital Assessments set forth in the notice provided pursuant to §
56.43(E) hereof, the Council shall provide notice to the affected property
owners and conduct a public hearing in the manner required by §
56.43 of this subchapter.

hearings, weigh evidence, draw conclusions from the facts, and apply the law to
the facts. Quasi-judicial matters include, but may not necessarily be limited
to, the following:
      (1)   Site specific rezoning of land which rezoning will have an impact
on a limited number of persons or property owners where the decision is
contingent on fact(s) arrived at from distinct alternatives presented at a
hearing and where the decision can be functionally viewed as policy application
rather than policy setting;

Board or Special Magistrate for Code Enforcement;

a decision is rendered to grant or grant with conditions the relief sought by
the applicant, then the second reading shall be procedural in nature with the
Quasi-Judicial Body ratifying and affirming its prior decision. If new evidence
is introduced which, if brought to the attention of the Quasi-Judicial Body at
the first reading, would have had a material impact on its decision, the Quasi-
Judicial Body may re-open the quasi-judicial hearing. If the Quasi-Judicial
Body re-opens the quasi-judicial hearing, it shall be scheduled for a date and
time certain and provide notice to all parties.
(Ord. 2015-22, passed 5-7-15; Am. Ord. 2025-26, passed 7-17-25)
§ 59.05 PROCEDURES FOR QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS.
   (A)   The following is a guideline for conducting quasi-judicial hearings:
      (1)   All testimony shall be under a sworn oath to tell the truth. The
oath shall be contained on a speaker's card. All persons wishing to speak on a
quasi-judicial item shall submit a speaker's card containing said oath to the
clerk on duty.
      (2)   The Presider shall call the cases on the agenda but shall not be
bound by the order in which the cases appear on the agenda.
      (3)   The Presider will introduce the case and, if appropriate, defer to
the City Manager (or designee) or City Attorney (or board counsel) for either
an explanation of the matter or the reading of the ordinance or resolution
caption.
      (4)   The Presider shall have the option of determining the order to
expedite the proceedings. However, all parties shall be provided the
opportunity to present their case. In the event the quasi-judicial matter
constitutes a public hearing, the general order of the presentation of evidence
shall be as follows:
         (a)   The applicant, having the burden of persuasion and the burden of
proof, shall proceed to present its case first by providing any factual and
expert witness(es) to testify and submitting relevant evidence for the Quasi-
Judicial body's consideration (maximum thirty (30) minutes);
         (b)   City staff and any staff consultants shall then present the
opinion of the City or any other relevant information necessary for the Quasi-
Judicial body's consideration (maximum thirty (30) minutes).
         (c)   Any aggrieved or adversely affected person who has complied with
the notice requirement set forth in §
59.03 shall be permitted to present factual and expert witness testimony and
relevant evidence for the Quasi-Judicial body's consideration (maximum thirty
(30) minutes);
         (d)    Cross-examination of witnesses by the applicant, City staff or
any aggrieved or adversely affected person shall be permitted during testimony
to the extent requested and necessary in furtherance of due process
requirements (maximum fifteen (15) minutes per witness);
         (e)   Any other person who has taken an oath upon statement of his/her
name and address for the record shall present any factual or expert testimony
relevant to the matter being considered (maximum three (3) minutes per person);
         (f)   Closing argument/rebuttal shall then be given by the applicant;
witnesses may be called during rebuttal (maximum ten (10) minutes);
         (g)   The Quasi-Judicial Body may modify the time limits specified in
this subsection (4) on its own motion or upon request of a party to the
proceeding. A request for a modification shall detail the additional time
desired and the subjects to be discussed during the additional time. A request
for a modification of time should be considered by the Quasi-Judicial Body to
assure all parties have an opportunity to participate without undue repetition,
delay and in furtherance of due process.
      (5)   Any natural person or party may represent himself/herself or may be
represented by an attorney. The statements or arguments of the attorney are not
considered evidence. The attorney need not be sworn.
         (a)   In the event any party (other than a corporation or the City)
chooses to be represented by a non-attorney, such party shall file a written,
notarized power of attorney with the clerk at least five (5) calendar days
prior to the hearing stating that the person appearing has the full power and
authority to act on behalf of the party in the matter.

provided the officer is listed as a current officer of an active corporation
with the Secretary of State and identifies himself/herself in that corporate
capacity.
      (6)   The parties may:
         (a)   Call and examine witnesses;
         (b)   Introduce exhibits;
         (c)   Cross-examine opposing witnesses;

the Quasi-Judicial Body desires to ask, it shall reopen the public hearing,
pose the question and allow the applicant, any aggrieved or adversely affected
person, and the City the opportunity to respond to the question posed prior to
closing the public hearing again and resuming deliberations.
      (8)   Neither the Federal Rules of Evidence nor the Florida Evidence Code
shall apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and govern said
proceedings at all times. The following evidentiary rules should be considered
when the Quasi-Judicial Body receives testimony and evidence at the hearing:
         (a)   All relevant evidence shall be admitted. The Quasi-Judicial body
may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.
         (b)   Hearsay evidence may be accepted for the purpose of either
supplementing or explaining any direct evidence, provided it is not offered to
prove the truth of the matter asserted, but such hearsay evidence shall not, in
and of itself, be considered sufficient to support a finding or decision unless
the evidence would be admissible over objections in any civil litigation
proceeding in a state or federal court in Florida.
         (c)   Lay testimony is permissible and may constitute competent
substantial evidence so long as it is fact-based. Mere generalized statements
of opposition do not constitute competent substantial evidence.
         (d)   The opinions and recommendations of professional City staff
members including, but not limited to, City growth management staff, the City
engineer, law enforcement and fire personnel, and other qualified staff members
may constitute competent substantial evidence, provided such opinions and
recommendations are related to the city staff person's professional expertise
and qualifications. The opinions of other duly qualified professionals and
experts of may also be similarly considered competent substantial evidence.
         (e)   Reports and detailed written evidence shall be submitted to the
clerk at least eight (8) business days before a hearing, to the extent
feasible, to allow the Quasi-Judicial Body, the parties and interested persons
the opportunity to review the documentation prior to the hearing.
      (9)   If, after notice of hearing, a party does not appear, the hearing
may be conducted, and an order entered, in the absence of the party.
      (10)   The Quasi-Judicial body shall have the authority to issue any and
all orders to afford the proper relief, and this authority shall include the
authority to grant continuances to a date-certain upon good cause shown.
      (11)   At the conclusion of the presentation of the evidence and the
taking of testimony, the Quasi-Judicial body shall close the public hearing and
proceed to deliberate. The Quasi-Judicial body shall endeavor to make a

affected by the failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this
ordinance.
   (F)   In addition to all other penalties in this section, an employer who
has retained a lobbyist(s) to lobby in connection with a competitive
solicitation shall be deemed non-responsive unless the employer, in responding
to the competitive solicitation, certifies that each lobbyist retained has
timely filed the registration or amended registration required under this
ordinance. If, after awarding a contract in connection with the solicitation,
the City learns that the certification was erroneous, and upon investigation
determines that the error was willful or intentional on the part of the
employer, the City may, on that basis, exercise any contractual right to
terminate the contract for convenience.

      (2)   The vehicle was stolen at the time that it would otherwise have
been subject to seizure and impoundment; or
      (3)   The vehicle was operating as a common carrier at the time it would
otherwise have been subject to seizure and impoundment; or
      (4)   The vehicle was seized pursuant to the Florida Contraband
Forfeiture Act.
   (D)   Hearings, administrative fee.
      (1)   In order to be entitled to a preliminary hearing, the owner of the
vehicle or his/her agent/ representative must submit a written request for a
preliminary hearing to the Police Chief or his/her designee within five (5)
business days of receipt of the written notice. If the City does not receive
such a request within the specified time period, then this shall constitute a
waiver of such hearing by the owner.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the written request from the vehicle owner or his/
her agent/representative for a preliminary hearing, the Police Chief or his/her
designee shall schedule the hearing within five (5) days, excluding Saturdays,
Sundays, and legal holidays, before a Special Magistrate of the City of Palm
Bay. The owner shall be given written notice of the date, time, and location of
the hearing, and this notice shall be delivered to the address provided by the
owner.
      (3)   At the hearing, the City shall have the burden to show that there
is probable cause to believe that the motor vehicle is subject to impoundment
and continued seizure. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the
hearing and hearsay evidence, including the police report, is admissible.
      (4)   At the hearing, if the Special Magistrate determines that there is
probable cause to believe that the motor vehicle is subject to impoundment and
continued seizure, he/she shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle
unless the vehicle owner or his/her agent or authorized representative pays the
City an administrative fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) plus the towing and
storage costs, or posts with the City a bond in the form of a money order or
certified check in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) plus the
accumulated costs of towing and storing the vehicle. If the Special Magistrate
determines that there is probable cause to believe that the motor vehicle is
subject to impoundment and continued seizure, the City shall schedule a final
hearing unless the administrative fee plus any towing and storage costs as
determined by the Special Magistrate have been paid. If after the preliminary
hearing there is a finding of no probable cause, the vehicle shall be released
forthwith to the owner or his/her agent or authorized representative without
the imposition of penalties or fees.
   (E)   Final hearings.
      (1)   In the event that a preliminary hearing is not requested within the
five (5) day period as set forth above, or if the Special Magistrate determines
at a preliminary hearing that there is probable cause to believe that the motor
vehicle is subject to impoundment and continued seizure and the administrative
fee plus any towing and storage costs as determined by the Special Magistrate
have not been paid, the City shall schedule a final hearing. The City shall
notify by certified mail, return receipt requested, the vehicle owner of record
of the date, time, and location of a final hearing to be conducted pursuant to
this section. The final hearing shall be scheduled and held, unless waived by
the vehicle owner or continued by order of the Special Magistrate, no later
than forty-five (45) days after the date that the vehicle was seized and
impounded. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the final hearing.
   (2)   The City shall have the burden to show by a preponderance of the
evidence that:
         (a)   The vehicle was seized and impounded pursuant to division (A)
above; and
         (b)   The owner of the vehicle either knew, or should have known,
after a reasonable inquiry, that the vehicle was being used or was likely to be
used in violation of division (A) above.
      (3)   If an owner fails to attend the final hearing, and the Special
Magistrate finds that the City has complied with the notice procedures as set
forth herein, then such failure to attend shall constitute a waiver of the
owner's right to a final hearing and it shall be deemed admitted that the
seized vehicle was used in violation of division (A) above.
      (4)   At the hearing, if the Special Magistrate finds that the vehicle is
subject to impoundment and seizure pursuant to division (A) above, and that
none of the exceptions set forth in division (C) above apply, then the Special
Magistrate shall enter an Order finding the owner of record of the vehicle
civilly liable to the city for an administrative fee not to exceed one hundred
dollars ($100.00), plus towing and storage costs. The seized vehicle shall
remain impounded until the administrative penalty plus any towing or storage
costs are satisfied.
      (5)   If the Special Magistrate finds that the City did not meet its
burden of proof or that one (1) of the exceptions of division (C) above
applies, the vehicle shall be returned to the owner forthwith along with any
bond posted.
   (F)   The City Attorney, or his designee, is hereby authorized to enter into
settlement agreements as may be appropriate to accomplish the objectives of
this section. In addition, nothing herein shall prohibit the City from
releasing a motor vehicle seized under the provisions of this section, if such
release is determined to be in the best interests of the City. Nothing herein
shall be construed to prohibit the City from enforcing the provisions of this
section against a vehicle initially seized pursuant to the Florida Contraband
Forfeiture Act (but not both) if in the best interest of the City.
   (G)   Unclaimed seized vehicles. Unclaimed seized vehicles may be subject to
disposal pursuant to Fla. Stat. Chapter 705.
   (H)   The owner of the vehicle which was seized and impounded may appeal a
ruling or order of the Special Magistrate by proceedings in the Circuit Court
for Brevard County in accordance with Rule 9.190 of the Florida Rules of
Appellate Procedure. An appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the
execution of the order to be appealed. The nature of the appeal shall be from a
final administrative order.

such public nuisance.
      (2)   All complaints shall be filed with the Nuisance Abatement
Coordinator. The Nuisance Abatement Coordinator shall review each complaint

occurrences, to the City Attorney.
   (B)   (1)   The City Attorney shall review all complaints received from the

(10) days from the date of the notice to contact the Nuisance Abatement
Coordinator to indicate what action will be taken to abate the nuisance upon
the premises. Failure of the owner to receive this notice of violation shall
not invalidate any further proceedings hereunder.
      (2)   If a recurring public nuisance or emergency situation exists, the
Nuisance Abatement Coordinator shall not be required to provide a courtesy
notice of violation, but instead the City Manager may prepare and serve a
statement of violation and notice of hearing as provided below.

Coordinator, fail to commit to a course of action designed to abate the
nuisance upon the property, or should there be any further incidents or
occurrences which constitute a nuisance upon the property, a hearing date shall
be scheduled before the Board. Such hearing shall be held no sooner than ten
(10) days after the notice of hearing is sent to the owner of the place or
premises at the owner's last known address. The Nuisance Abatement Coordinator

time, and manner in which service was made.

properly noticed under this subchapter and has failed to appear. Any findings
or orders entered by the Special Magistrate are valid and binding upon each
respondent who has been properly noticed.
      (1)   The Special Magistrate has discretion to continue a hearing to
receive additional evidence, testimony, or for any other reason the Special
Magistrate deems appropriate.
      (2)   All findings of the Special Magistrate shall be based on a
preponderance of the evidence. Hearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of
supplementing or explaining other evidence, but it shall not be sufficient to
support a finding unless it would be admissible in a civil action. The burden
of proof shall be on the complaining party.
      (3)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the Special Magistrate shall
issue findings of fact based on evidence in the record and conclusions of law
and shall issue an order affording the proper relief consistent with the powers
granted by Florida Statutes and by this section. The order shall be stated
orally at the meeting and shall be reduced to writing and mailed to the alleged
violator within ten (10) days after the hearing.
      (4)   If the Special Magistrate declares a place or premises to be a
public nuisance, it may enter an order immediately prohibiting:
         (a)   The maintaining of the nuisance;
         (b)   The operating or maintaining of the place or premises;
         (c)   The conduct, operation, or maintenance of any business or
activity on the premises which is conducive to such nuisance; or
         (d)   Any other measures or conditions the Special Magistrate deems

public nuisance before the Board, the City as the prevailing party shall be
entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs associated with
the investigation, hearing and prosecution on the public nuisance through all
appellate proceedings, including the costs of recording any order, notice or
agreement.
(Ord. 2022-32, passed 3-3-22)
§ 93.27 PENALTIES; FINES; LIENS; RECORDING.
   (A)   The Nuisance Abatement Coordinator shall file an affidavit of
noncompliance with the recording secretary reflecting that an order of the
Special Magistrate has not been complied with and schedule a hearing before the
Special Magistrate.
   (B)   The Special Magistrate, upon notification that a nuisance has not been
abated or, upon finding that a recurring public nuisance exists, may order the
owner or operator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this section for each
day the nuisance continues past the date set by the Special Magistrate for
abatement, or, in the case of a recurring nuisance, for each day the recurring
nuisance continues past the date of notice to the owner or operator of such
recurring nuisance. If a finding of a recurring nuisance has been made as
provided herein, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the order
imposing the fine.
   (C)   A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00) per day for a first occurrence of a public nuisance and
shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for a recurring public
nuisance. However, total fines imposed in any action brought pursuant to this
subchapter shall not exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00). ln
determining the amount of the fine, if any, the Board shall consider the
following factors:
      (1)   The gravity of the public nuisance;
      (2)   Any actions taken by the owner to correct the public nuisance; and
      (3)   Any previous nuisances maintained or permitted by the owner.
   (D)   A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the
public records of the county, and thereafter shall constitute a lien against
the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal
property owned by the owner. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may
be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this
state, including levy against personal property, but such order shall not be
deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed
pursuant to this subchapter shall continue to accrue until the owner comes into
compliance or until the judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien
filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a
fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the city, and the city
may execute a satisfaction or release of a lien in the same manner as provided
under §§ 52.090 and 52.091 of this Code or may otherwise seek to foreclose on
the lien. Any lien recorded against real property may be foreclosed by the city
and the owner of such real property shall be liable for all costs, including a
reasonable attorney's fee, associated with the recording of all orders and
foreclosure. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this part may be
foreclosed on real property, which is a homestead under Section 4, Article X of
the State Constitution.
   (E)   If the Special Magistrate should find that the nuisance is based upon
a stolen property nuisance against a property owner operating an establishment
where multiple tenants, on one (1) site, conduct their own retail businesses,
the property owner shall not be subject to a lien against the owner's property
or the prohibition of operation provision if the property owner elects to evict
the business declared to be a nuisance within ninety (90) days after
notification by registered mail to the property owner of a second stolen
property conviction of the tenant.
   (F)   The Special Magistrate may authorize the City to file a complaint
under Fla. Stat. § 60.05, seeking a permanent injunction against any nuisance
as described in this subchapter. This section does not restrict the right of
any person to proceed under Fla. Stat. § 60.05, against any public nuisance.
(Ord. 2022-32, passed 3-3-22)
§ 93.28 APPEAL.
   An aggrieved party, including the local governing body, may appeal a final
administrative order of the Special Magistrate to the circuit court. Such an
appeal shall not be a hearing de novo, but shall be limited to appellate review
of the record created before the Special Magistrate. An appeal shall be filed
within 30 days of the execution of the order to be appealed.
(Ord. 2022-32, passed 3-3-22)
§ 93.99 PENALTY.
   Violation of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements
shall be punishable as provided in §
10.99. Each day a violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.

shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to the City Manager.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the City Manager ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, photography, videotaping,

or a registered sex offender or predator, such fact shall not automatically
exclude such contract-employee from service in or to the City. The information
shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering the nature of the
employment. The City reserves the right, in its sole and exclusive discretion,
to reject any contract-employee based upon any lawful reason.
   (D)   The City shall retain the right to verify the information contained on
the application and shall require the contract-employee to present his or her
driver's license or state-issued identification card prior to sitting for a
photograph or being issued a City security card. The City shall retain the
right to request fingerprints of the contract-employee and/or conduct a
background investigation if it is deemed necessary, in the sole discretion of
the City.
   (E)   Except as provided for herein, this Chapter shall apply to all those
who are engaged in a business relationship with the City, regardless of whether
such business arrangement is pursuant to a written contract.
      (1)   SERVICE PROVIDER EXCEPTION. The provisions of this Chapter do not
apply to those who provide a service to the City, where the City is the
consumer of such service and the contractor is repairing, maintaining or
installing its equipment which has been leased or sold to the City (i.e., a
repairman coming into a City office to repair a copy machine, Waste Management
emptying dumpsters, etc.) and the contract-employee has no significant contact
with the public, regardless of the existence of a contract or other business
arrangement.
      (2)   DELIVERY PERSON EXCEPTION. The provisions of this Chapter do not
apply to those who provide a service to the City where the City is a recipient
of routine deliveries (i.e., the FedEx driver) regardless of the existence of a
contract or other business arrangement.
      (3)   LARGE EMPLOYER EXCEPTION. The provisions of this Chapter do not
apply to the employees of any contractor whose business has more than five
hundred (500) employees and which can document at least one other governmental
client which is a county, a county school board, a sheriff's office, a
municipality with a population of more than 70,000 persons, the State of
Florida or an agency thereof (i.e., Water Management District, County Housing
Authority, etc.) or the Federal Government or an agency thereof.
         (a)   To qualify for this exemption, the contractor shall issue its
own identification cards to its employees, which complies with the minimum
requirements set forth in subsection (A), above (except for the word
"CONTRACTOR" and the expiration date). A determination as to whether the
company-issued identification card is sufficient shall be in the sole
discretion of the City.
         (b)   The purpose of this exemption is that any business of this size,
with other governmental contracts, is presumed by the City to have screened its
employees and verified that they are not a danger to the citizens of the City,
and the City is confident that the large employer's identification card is
sufficient to inform the public of the worker's identity.
         (c)   In the event a business qualifying for the exemption set forth
herein is or becomes, in the sole discretion of the City Council, suspected of
not maintaining adequate employee screening to protect the citizens of the
City, the Council may, by motion and a majority vote, revoke the "large
employer exemption" for such contractor.
         (d)   In the event a "large employer exemption" is not granted or is
revoked for any particular contractor, that contractor shall have no recourse
against the City and must comply with the provisions of this Chapter and obtain
City issued security cards for each of its employees.
      (4)   CHARTER SCHOOL EXCEPTION. The provisions of this Chapter do not
apply to the employees of Charter Schools USA which is the long-term provider
of education services to the Palm Bay Municipal Charter School Authority,
provided that such employees:
         (a)   Have completed the required background investigation required by
Fla. Stat. § 1012.465 (the Jessica Lunsford Act); and
         (b)   Possess and display a photo identification card issued by
Charter Schools USA.
      (5)   The City's Risk Manager may authorize narrow exceptions for a
contractor which identifies specific job assignment where the wearing of a
security card poses an unusual risk of harm, provided all of the following are
met:
         (a)   The contract-employee must possess a City issued security card
on his or her person at all times and must display it at all times that he or
she is not actively engaged in the identified high-risk job assignment;
         (b)   The contract-employee must be wearing a uniform or a shirt that
identifies the name of his or her employer; and
         (c)   The excepted high-risk job assignment must not involve any
significant public contact.
   (F)   Reference to a "City issued security card" within this Chapter shall
apply equally whether the contract-employee is issued a security card from the
City or an identification card from his or her company employer pursuant to
subsection (E)(3), above.
   (G)   The following are terms and conditions applicable to contract-
employees:
      (1)   A contract-employee shall have the City issued security card
attached to his or her person, located on the front-side of such contract-
employee at the beltline or above, with the front of the card plainly visible.
Such contract-employee shall not hide the card or otherwise make it less than
plainly visible at any time, especially when a citizen is attempting to see the
picture and information contained thereupon. The contract-employee shall
present the security card for inspection to any individual identifying
themselves as a City employee and displaying his or her own City issued
security card.
      (2)   A contract-employee shall surrender his or her City issued security
card upon resigning from his or her employment or otherwise ceasing to
regularly work in the City of Palm Bay. The contractor shall remain responsible
for ensuring that its employees surrender such City issued security card upon
separation from service and will deliver such card to the Human Resources
Department.
      (3)   In the event a contract-employee loses his or her City issued
security card, it shall be reported immediately to the Human Resources
Department. The contract-employee will cooperate in documenting the lost card
including, but not limited to, the filing of a police report. A replacement
City issued security card will be provided at no cost to the contractor or the
contract-employee for the first replacement card within a two-year period.
Subsequent replacement cards within that time period for the same contract-
employee may involve a fee to be established by the City.
      (4)   In the event a contract-employee is at his or her worksite without
a City issued security card, the contract-employee may be directed by any law
enforcement officer to immediately leave the worksite. Failure of the contract-
employee to leave the worksite upon direction of a law enforcement officer
shall constitute a criminal offense punishable as set forth in §
10.99.
      (5)   It is the contractor's responsibility to ensure that the contracted
work gets completed as required by the contract. The contract-employee shall
not return to the worksite without a City issued security card.
   (H)   A contractor shall be fully and completely responsible to ensure that
any subcontractor engaged to fulfill the terms of the contract fully complies
with the provisions of this Chapter.
   (I)   Any contractor (including any subcontractor) who knowingly violates
the provisions of this Chapter shall be guilty of a criminal offense punishable
as set forth in §
10.99.
   (J)   The provisions of this Chapter shall not be enforced upon a
declaration pursuant to
Chapter 53, and shall automatically be suspended during the aftermath of the
emergency until the next regularly scheduled City Council meeting where
business is transacted. This Chapter shall remain suspended subsequent to that
Council meeting if the suspension is approved by a motion and an affirmative
vote of a majority of the Council members present.
   (K)   It is the intention of the City Council that this Chapter apply
equally to current contractors as well as future contractors. This Chapter
shall be incorporated by reference in all future contracts approved by the
City.

§ 100.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   This ordinance regulates and promotes the proper use of fertilizers by
any applicator; requires proper training of commercial and institutional
fertilizer applicators; establishes training and licensing requirements;
establishes a prohibited application period; specifies allowable fertilizer
application rates and methods; fertilizer-free zones; low maintenance zones;
and exemptions.
   (B)   This ordinance requires the use of Best Management Practices which
provide specific management guidelines to minimize negative secondary and
cumulative environmental effects associated with the misuse of fertilizers.
These secondary and cumulative effects have been observed in and on Palm Bay's
natural and constructed stormwater conveyances, ponds, canals, creeks,
estuaries and other water bodies. Collectively, these water bodies are an asset
critical to the environmental, recreational, cultural and economic well-being
of Palm Bay residents and the health of the public. Overgrowth of algae and
vegetation hinder the effectiveness of flood attenuation provided by natural
and constructed stormwater and drainage conveyances. Regulation of nutrients,
including both phosphorus and nitrogen contained in fertilizer, will help
improve and maintain water and habitat quality.
(Ord. 2014-16, passed 5-15-14)
§ 100.02 DEFINITIONS.

standing on the soil causes the release of free water.
   SLOW RELEASE, CONTROLLED RELEASE, TIMED RELEASE, SLOWLY AVAILABLE, OR WATER
INSOLUBLE NITROGEN.  Nitrogen in a form which delays its availability for plant

Communications Facilities in Public Rights-of-Way Ordinance."
(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)
§ 101.02 FINDINGS, INTENT AND SCOPE.
   (A)   The city hereby makes and declares the following findings and declares
its legislative intent as follows:
      (1)   The public rights-of-way within the City of Palm Bay are a unique
and physically limited resource and important amenity that are critical to the
travel and transport of persons and property in the city.
      (2)   The demand for telecommunications services has grown exponentially
in recent years, requiring the continual upgrading of telecommunications
equipment and services to satisfy such demand.
      (3)   The placement of telecommunications equipment and facilities in the
public rights-of-way to satisfy the demand for telecommunications services
raises important issues with respect to the city's responsibility to manage its
public rights-of-way.
      (4)   The public rights-of-way must be managed and controlled in a manner
that enhances the health, safety and general welfare of the city and its
citizens.
      (5)   The use and occupancy of the public rights-of-way by providers of
communications services must be subject to regulation which can ensure minimal
inconvenience to the public, coordinate users, maximize available space, reduce
maintenance and costs to the public, and facilitate entry of an optimal number
of providers of cable, telecommunications, and other services in the public
interest.
      (6)   Fla. Stat. § 166.041 provides for procedures for adoption of an
ordinance which is a regulation of general and permanent nature and enforceable
as local law.
      (7)   Fla. Stat. § 337.401 provides that because federal and state law
require the nondiscriminatory treatment of providers of telecommunications
services and because of the desire to promote competition among providers of
communications services, it is the intent of the Florida Legislature that
municipalities and counties treat providers of communications services in a
nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner when imposing rules or
regulations governing the placement or maintenance of communications facilities
in the public roads or rights-of-way.
      (8)   The city finds that, to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, it is necessary to (i) provide for the placement or
maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way within the
city limits, (ii) adopt and administer reasonable rules, regulations and
general conditions not inconsistent with applicable state and federal law,
(iii) manage the placement and maintenance of communications facilities in the
public rights-of-way by all communications services providers, (iv) minimize
disruption to the public rights-of-way, and (v) require the restoration of the
public rights-of-way to original condition.
      (9)   The city's intent is that these rules and regulations must be
generally applicable to all providers of communications services and,
notwithstanding any other law, may not require a provider of communications
services to apply for or enter into an individual license, franchise, or other
agreement with the city as a condition of placing or maintaining communications
facilities in its roads or rights-of-way.
      (10)   It is also the city's intent to exercise the city's retained
authority to regulate and manage the city's roads and rights-of-way in
exercising its police power over communications services providers' placement
and maintenance of facilities in the public rights-of-way in a non
discriminatory and competitively neutral manner.
   (B)   This chapter shall apply to any public or private entity who seeks to
construct, place, install, maintain or operate a communications system or
facilities, as such terms are defined herein, in the public rights-of-way,
unless otherwise exempt by operation of applicable state or federal law. This
chapter shall equally apply to a city owned or controlled communications system
except to the extent such facilities are utilized on an internal, non-
commercial basis by the city or any of its agencies, departments or bureaus.
(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)

their derivations shall have the meanings ascribed herein. Where not
inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the
future tense, words in the plural include the singular, and words in the
singular include the plural. The words "shall," "will" and "must" are

or where none is ascribed shall be construed to mean the common and ordinary
meaning.
      ABANDONMENT means the permanent cessation of all uses of a communications
facility; provided that this term shall not include cessation of all use of a
facility within a physical structure where the physical structure continues to
be used. By way of example, and not limitation, cessation of all use of a cable
within a conduit, where the conduit continues to be used, shall not be
"abandonment" of a facility in the public rights-of-way.
      AFFILIATE means each person, directly or indirectly, controlling,
controlled by, or under common control with a communications services provider
that is registered with the city; provided that AFFILIATE shall in no event
mean any limited partner, member, or shareholder holding an interest of less

by ordinance which may require that a new utility pole replacing an existing
utility pole be of substantially similar design, material, and color, or that
ground-mounted equipment meet reasonable spacing requirements. The term
includes objective design standards adopted by ordinance which may require a
small wireless facility to meet reasonable location context, color, stealth,
and concealment requirements; however, the city may waive the design standards
upon a showing that the design standards are not reasonably compatible for the
particular location of a small wireless facility or that the design standards
impose an excessive expense. The waiver must be granted or denied within 45
days after the date of the waiver request.

communications services provider's facilities in the public rights-of-way,
including, but not limited to, the horizontal and vertical location of
facilities located at least every 100 feet and at any alignment change.

other appropriate state agency or department, authorizing the company to do
business in the State of Florida; and
      (9)   evidence of the applicant's insurance coverage as required under
this chapter.
   (B)   The city shall review the information submitted by the applicant. Such
review shall be by the public works director or his or her designee. If it is
found that the applicant complied with the requirements in §
101.04(A) above, the registration shall be effective and the city shall notify
the applicant of the effectiveness of registration in writing. If the city
determines that the applicant is not in compliance, the city shall notify the
applicant in writing of the non-effectiveness and denial of registration and
the reasons therefor. The city shall so reply to an applicant within thirty
(30) days after receipt of the registration and required information from the
applicant. Non-effectiveness and denial of registration shall not preclude an
applicant from reapplying or filing subsequent applications for registration
under the provisions of this section.
   (C)   An effective registration does not, and shall not be construed to,
convey equitable or legal title in the public rights-of-way to any
communications services provider. Registration under this ordinance governs
only the placement or maintenance of a communications system or communications
facilities in the public rights-of-way. Other ordinances, codes or regulations
may apply to the placement or maintenance in the public rights-of-way of
facilities that are not part of a communications system. Registration does not
excuse a communications services provider from obtaining appropriate access or
pole attachment agreements before locating its facilities on those facilities
or property belonging to the city or another person. Registration does not
excuse a communications services provider from complying with all other
applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, including the rules,
regulations and general conditions set forth in this chapter.
   (D)   A communications services provider may cancel a registration upon
written notice to the city stating that it will no longer place or maintain a
communications system or any communications facilities in the public rights-of-
way and will no longer have a need to apply for development permits to perform
construction or other work in the public rights-of-way. A communications
services provider cannot cancel a registration if it intends to continue
placing or maintaining a communications system or any communications facilities
in the public rights- of-way.
   (E)   Registration, in and of itself, does not establish a right to place or
maintain or a priority for the placement or maintenance of a communications
system or any facility in the public rights-of-way, but shall establish for the
communications services provider a right to apply for a development permit from
the city. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or
replacement of this chapter and further subject to any additional city
ordinances, as well as any State or Federal laws that may be enacted.
Registration does not excuse or exempt a communications services provider from
having to obtain on occupational license from the city in accordance with the
City Code.
   (F)   A communications services provider shall renew its registration with
the city by April 1 of even numbered years in accordance with the registration
requirements in this chapter, except that any communications services provider
that initially registers during the even numbered year when renewal would be
due or the odd numbered year immediately preceding such even numbered year
shall not be required to renew its registration until the next even numbered
year. Within thirty (30) days of any change in the information required to be
submitted pursuant to subsection (1), a communications services provider shall
provide updated information to the city. If no information in the then-existing
registration has changed, the renewal may state that no information has
changed. Failure to renew a registration may result in the city restricting the
issuance of additional development permits until the communications services
provider has complied with the registration requirements of this chapter.
   (G)   In accordance with applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, a
development permit is required for a communications services provider to place
or maintain a communications facility in the public rights-of-way. An effective
registration shall be a condition of obtaining such a permit. Notwithstanding
an effective registration, all permitting requirements shall apply, including
the requirement to pay for any such permits unless otherwise provided by
resolution or ordinance of the city. A permit may be obtained by or on behalf
of the communications services provider having an effective registration if all
permitting requirements of the city and other provisions of this chapter are
met.
   (H)   A reseller, which by definition does not place or maintain
communications facilities in the public rights-of-way, is not required to
register with the city.
(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)
§ 101.05 NOTICE OF TRANSFER, SALE OR ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS.
   If a communications services provider transfers, sells or assigns its system
or any facilities located in the public rights-of-way incident to a transfer,
sale or assignment of the communications services provider's assets, the
transferee, buyer or assignee shall be obligated to comply with the provisions
set forth in this chapter. Written notice of any such transfer, sale or
assignment shall be provided by the communications services provider to the
city within thirty (30) days after the effective date of such transfer, sale or
assignment. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is not currently registered
with the city, then the transferee, buyer or assignee must register as provided
in §
101.04 within sixty (60) days of the effective date of such transfer, sale or
assignment. If any applications for development permits are pending under the
communications services provider's name as of the date the city receives
written notice of the transfer, sale or assignment, then the city shall
consider the transferee, buyer or assignee as the new applicant unless
otherwise notified by the communications services provider.
(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)
§ 101.06 RULES, REGULATIONS AND GENERAL CONDITIONS TO PLACEMENT OF
COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT- OF-WAY.
   As a condition of allowing the placement or maintenance of a communications
system or any communications facility in the public rights-of-way, and under
additional authority granted pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ch. 337, the city hereby
imposes the following rules, regulations and general conditions. Unless
otherwise provided in this
Chapter 101, these rules, regulations and general conditions shall apply to all
communications services providers, including those that are pass-through
providers irrespective of whether they place and maintain only conduit, dark
fiber or pass-through facilities.
   (A)   Rules on utilization of the public rights-of-way.
      (1)   Compliance with laws. A communications services provider shall at
all times be in full compliance with and abide by all applicable Federal, State
and local laws, codes and regulations in placing or maintaining a
communications system and facilities in the public rights-of-way.
      (2)   Due care. A communications services provider shall use and exercise
due caution, care and skill in performing work in the public rights-of-way and
shall take all reasonable steps to safeguard work site areas.
      (3)   Permits. A communications services provider shall not commence to
place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way until all
applicable permits have been issued by the city and other appropriate
authority, except in the case of an emergency. The term "emergency" shall mean
a condition that affects the public's health, safety or general welfare, which
includes an unplanned out-of-service condition of a pre-existing service. The
communications services provider shall provide prompt notice to the city of the
placement or maintenance of a communications facility in the public rights-of-
way in the event of an emergency and shall, after-the-fact, be required to
submit plans and record drawings and as-built surveys, if required by the
public works director or his designee, showing the placement or relocation of a
communications facility undertaken in connection with the emergency.
      (4)   Application for development permit. Prior to the issuance of a
development permit to allow the placement or maintenance of a communications
system or facility in the public rights-of-way, the city has the right to first
review and consider and the communications services provider shall provide all
of the following:
         (a)   The expected dates and times when the facility will be installed
and the estimated time needed for construction and placement of the proposed
facility;
         (b)   The location of the proposed facility, the public rights-of-way
affected and a description of the facility, including the type of facility
(e.g. conduit, fiber, twisted pair, etc.), the number of fibers or other cable
being installed, and the approximate size of the facility (e.g. length, height,
width and diameter); and
         (c)   Plans, drawings, photographs, and schematics (including cross
section layout) prepared by a qualified engineer or technician showing where
the facility is proposed to be located in the public rights-of-way and showing
any known communications facilities or utility facilities in such public
rights-of-way.
      (5)   Revised plans. If the plans or drawings submitted showing the
proposed location for installation of the facility in the public rights-of-way
require revision for any reason prior to commencing construction, the
communications services provider shall promptly submit revised plans and
drawings to the public works director or his designee.
      (6)   Power to restrict area. To the extent not otherwise prohibited by
State or Federal law, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the
placement of new or additional communications facilities within a particular
area of the public rights-of way and deny the issuance of a development permit.
      (7)   Limited purpose of development permit. A development permit issued
by the city constitutes authorization to undertake only certain activities in
public rights-of-way in accordance with this chapter, and does not create any
property right or other vested interest, or grant authority to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way.
Development permits shall be granted only for specific routes or locations in
the public rights-of-way and for such term as described in the permit. The
city's issuance of a development permit shall not be construed as a warranty
that the placement of any communications facility is in compliance with
applicable codes, regulations or laws.
      (8)   Responsibility for contractors. Every communications services
provider that is registered with the city shall be liable for the actions of
contractor(s) hired by them to perform the placement or maintenance of
facilities in the public rights-of-way and shall be responsible for making sure
that such contractor meets and complies fully with the rules, regulations and
general conditions set forth in this chapter.
   (B)   Regulations on the placement or maintenance of communications
facilities.
      (1)   Provision and form of record drawings and as-built surveys. Within
forty-five (45) days after completion of any placement or maintenance of a
communications facility in the public rights-of-way, the communications
services provider shall provide the city with record drawings showing the final
location of such facility in the public rights-of-way. Upon request by the
public works director or his designee, the communications services provider
shall also provide the city with as-built surveys within forty-five (45) days
after completion of any placement or maintenance of a communications facility
in the public rights-of-way. The record drawings and as-built surveys shall be
provided to the city at no cost.
      (2)   Production and filing of as-builts. Every communications services
provider that is registered with the city shall produce and keep on file at its
principal place of business an accurate and complete set of as-builts of all
facilities placed and maintained in the public rights-of-way. The location and
identification of facilities and the production of as-builts shall be at the
sole expense of the communications services provider. Within thirty (30) days
of any written request by the public works director or his designee, the
communications services provider must provide to the city, at no cost, copies
of complete sets of as-builts for the indicated public rights-of-way. The
failure of the communications services provider to produce, keep on file, or
provide to the city as-builts as required under this chapter is sufficient
grounds for the city to deny the issuance of development permits in the future.
      (3)   Removal of facilities placed without permit. Any communications
facilities placed in the public rights-of-way by the communications services
provider without first having obtained the required development permits shall
be removed within thirty (30) days of written notice by the city to remove the
same and in default of compliance with such notice, such facilities may be
removed by order of the public works director or his designee and the cost of
removal shall be borne and paid by the communications services provider upon
demand.
      (4)   Underground. The placement or maintenance of all communications
facilities shall be underground unless otherwise approved in writing by the
public works director or his designee. Communications facilities shall be
placed between the property line and the curb line of all streets and avenues
and shall not be within the roadway or the roadway recovery area unless
specifically approved in writing by the public works director or his designee.
All communications facilities shall have consistent alignment parallel with the
edge of pavement, a thirty-six inch (36") depth of cover for and shall have two
feet (2') of horizontal clearance from other underground utilities and their
appurtenances. Where approved by the public works director or his designee,
facilities to be placed in the street shall be laid according to the permanent
grade of the street and at a depth below the surface of the permanent grade as
each is determined by the public works director or his designee.
      (5)   Above-ground approval. The placement or maintenance of facilities
above-ground, including new poles and aerial wires, is subject to written
approval by the public works director or his designee. Attachment to any pole
or other above-ground structure must be pursuant to a valid and effective pole
attachment agreement or similar instrument. Location on any pole or other
above-ground structure shall not be considered a vested interest of the
communications services provider and such poles or structures, if owned by the
communications services provider, shall be removed or modified by the
communications services provider at its own expense whenever the city or other
governmental authority determines that the public convenience would be enhanced
thereby. The lowest placement of any communications facility on any pole or
other above-ground structure in the public rights-of-way shall not be less than
eighteen (18) feet from the ground. The communications services provider shall,
at such time as the electric utility facilities or other communica tions
facilities are placed underground or are required by the city to be placed
underground, concurrently place its communications facilities underground
without cost to the city.
      (6)    New poles or above-ground structures. The placing of any new pole
or other above-ground structure to support communications facilities is subject
to the approval of the public works director or his designee and shall be done
under the supervision of the public works director or his designee. No such
pole or other above-ground structure shall be placed in any gutter or drainage
area and must be behind the curb to avoid damage to any sidewalk. In areas of
the city where either electric utility wires or other communications facilities
are above ground and such facilities are moved, either voluntarily or at the
direction of the city, to a new pole or other above-ground structure, the
communications services provider shall likewise move all its above-ground
facilities on such poles or structures to such new pole or structure within
thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from either the city or the
owner of the new pole or structure, without cost to the city.
      (7)   Placement and maintenance standards. The placement or maintenance
of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be performed in
accordance with standards and requirements of the following, as is applicable
and as each is in force at the time of the respective placement or maintenance
of a communications system or facility:
         (a)   the Florida Department of Transportation Utilities Accommodation
Guide;
         (b)   the State of Florida Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for
Design Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways;
         (c)   the Trench Safety Act (Fla. Stat. Ch. 553);
         (d)   the Underground Facility Damage Prevention and Safety Act (Fla.
Stat. Ch. 556);
         (e)   the National Electrical Code or the ANSI National Electrical
Safety Code; and
         (f)   the "Safety Rules for the Installation and Maintenance of
Electrical Supply and Communication Lines" established by the Department of
Commerce, Bureau of Standards of the United States.
      (8)   Sunshine State One-Call. Every communications services provider
shall utilize, and if permissible, maintain membership in the utility
notification one call system administered by Sunshine State One-Call of
Florida, Inc.
      (9)   Safety and minimal interference. All placement and maintenance of
communication facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be subject to the
City Code and other regulations of the city pertaining thereto, and shall be
performed with the least possible interference with the use and appearance of
the public rights-of-way and the rights and reasonable convenience of the
property owners who abut or adjoin the public rights-of-way and in compliance
with the rules and regulations of the Florida Department of Transportation. The
communications services provider shall at all times employ reasonable care and
use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents
which are likely to cause damage or injury or be a nuisance to the public.
Suitable barricades, flags, lights, flares, or other devices shall be used at
such times and places as are reasonably required for the safety of all members
of the public. All placement and maintenance shall be done in such a manner as
to minimize to the greatest extent any interference with the usual travel on
such public rights-of-way. The use of trenchless technology (i.e.,
microtunneling and horizontal directional drilling techniques) for the
installation of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way as well
as joint trenching or the co-location of facilities in existing conduit is
strongly encouraged, and should be employed wherever and whenever feasible.
      (10)   Correction of harmful conditions. If, at any time, the city or
other authority of competent jurisdiction reasonably determines that any
communications facility is, or has caused a condition that is, harmful to the
health, safety or general welfare of any person, then the communications
services provider shall, at its own expense, promptly correct or eliminate all
such facilities and conditions. In an emergency, as determined by the public
works director or his designee, when the communications services provider is
not immediately available or is unable to provide the necessary immediate
repairs to any communications facility that is damaged or malfunctioning, or
has caused a sunken area or other condition and, in the public works director
or his designee's sole discretion, is deemed a threat to public safety, then
the city, when apprised of such an emergency, shall have the right to remove,
make repairs to or eliminate same with the total cost being charged to and paid
for by the communications services provider upon demand.
      (11)   Remedy of hazardous conditions. If, at any time, a condition
exists that the city or other authority of competent jurisdiction reasonably
determines is an emergency that is potentially hazardous or life threatening to
any person or is a threat to the health or safety of the general public, and to
remedy such condition the city or other authority of competent jurisdiction
reasonably determines that a communications services provider must temporarily
relocate or temporarily shut off service or transmissions through a specific
facility, then the city, as an appropriate exercise of its police powers, may
order the communications services provider to immediately perform such
temporary relocation or shut off until the condition has been remedied, and to
do so at its own expense and without liability to or recourse against the city.
In such an emergency, when the communications services provider is not
immediately available or is unable to provide the necessary immediate
relocation or shut off of the specific communications facility, then the city
shall have the right to perform, or cause to be performed, such temporary
relocation or shut off until the condition has been remedied with the total
cost being charged to and paid for by the communications services provider upon
demand.
      (12)   Interference with other facilities. A communications services
provider shall not, in violation of any applicable laws or regulatory
standards, design, place or maintain its communications facilities in a manner
that will interfere with the signals or facilities of any municipal or county
police, fire or rescue department, the facilities of any public utility, or the
communications facilities of another communications service provider, including
any cable service provider.
      (13)   Relocation or removal of facilities. Except in cases of emergency,
a communications services provider, at its own expense, shall:
         (a)   Upon thirty (30) days written notice, relocate or remove, as
specified in said notice, its communications facility in the event the city
finds that the particular facility is unreasonably interfering in some way with
the convenient, safe or continuous use, or the maintenance, improvement,
extension or expansion of any public rights-of-way. The city shall provide the
communications services provider with a notice and order as provided for in
Fla. Stat. § 337.404, or any subsequently enacted law of the State of Florida,
in the event it charges the communications services provider for the cost and
expense of relocating or removing such facility pursuant to this paragraph.
         (b)   Within a reasonable period of time from the date of written
notice from the city, but not more than one hundred twenty (120) days
thereafter, relocate or remove, as specified in said notice, its communications
facility in the event the public works director or his designee determines it
necessary for the construction, completion, repair, relocation or maintenance
of a city project, because the particular communications facility is
interfering with or adversely affecting the proper operation of street light
poles, traffic signals, or any communications system belonging to the city or
an agency thereof or because the particular communications facility is
interfering with the signals or facilities of the Palm Bay Police Department,
Palm Bay Fire Department, or the City of Palm Bay Utilities Department. In the
event the city issues any such written notice to the communications services
provider pursuant to this paragraph, and the communications services provider
fails to cause the aforementioned relocation or removal as required herein, the
city shall be entitled to relocate or remove such facilities without further
notice to the communications services provider and the total cost and expense
shall be charged to the communications services provider.
      (14)   Temporary raising or lowering of facilities. A communications
services provider, upon request of any person holding a validly issued building
or moving permit from the city to temporarily encroach on or perform moving
operations in or across the public rights-of-way, shall temporarily raise or
lower its communications facilities to accommodate such temporary encroachment
or move. The expense of such temporary raising or lowering of facilities shall
be paid by the person requesting the same, and the communications services
provider shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The
communications services provider shall be given not less than twenty (20) days
advance written notice from such person to arrange for the temporary
relocation, which notice must detail the time and location of the permitted
activity, and not less than twenty-four (24) hours advance notice from the
permit holder advising of the actual operation. The city is not subject to, nor
shall it be liable for, any such expense or notice requirement for the moving
of houses or structures performed by the city or its contractors.
      (15)   Coordination. In an effort to minimize the adverse impact on the
public rights-of- way and other municipal improvements, a communications
services provider may be required by the public works director or his designee
to coordinate the placement or maintenance of its facilities with any work,
construction, installation in or repairs of the subject public rights-of-way or
other facilities therein that is occurring or is scheduled to occur within a
reasonable time from application for a development permit as determined by the
public works director or his designee. Every communications services provider
shall make space in its trench and/or conduit within the public rights-of-way
available to other providers consistent with the federal requirements of 47
U.S.C. 224. Every communications services provider shall utilize existing
conduits, pathways and other facilities whenever possible, and shall not place
or maintain any new, different, or additional poles, conduits, pathways or
other facilities, whether in the public rights-of-way or on privately-owned
property, until written approval is obtained from the city or other appropriate
governmental authority, and, where applicable, from the private property owner.
      (16)   Co-location and joint use. A communications services provider, in
an effort to minimize the adverse impact on the useful life of the public
rights-of-way, shall, whenever possible, enter into joint use agreements with
the city and other parties who have registered with, or who are expressly
authorized by, the city to use its public rights-of-way; provided that the
terms of such agreements are satisfactory to the communications services
provider. Nothing herein contained shall mandate that the communications
services provider enter into joint use agreements with parties other than the
city or an agency of the city. However, prior to placement of any new or
additional underground conduit in the public rights-of-way, a communications
services provider is required to certify in writing to the public works
director or his designee that it has made appropriate inquiry to all existing
utilities and other entities possessing a right to occupy the public rights-of-
way as to the availability of existing or planned conduit that the particular
communications services provider could reasonably utilize to meet its needs,
and that no such conduit is available or planned at a reasonable cost by any
other entity on the time schedule reasonably needed. The communications
services provider shall not be permitted to perform any placement or
maintenance of facilities in those segments of the public rights-of-way where
there exists vacant or available conduit, dark fiber or surplus fiber owned by
the city, an agency of the city or another governmental body which is or,
through a reasonable amount of effort and expense, can be made compatible with
the communications services provider's system or network. Under such
circumstances the communications services provider shall have the opportunity
to enter into a use agreement or lease arrangement with the city or an agency
of the city at or below reasonable and prevailing market rates for such conduit
or fiber or, where owned by another governmental body, shall, in good faith,
first exhaust all means of obtaining use of such conduit or fiber before
applying for a development permit from the city.
      (17)    Maintenance-of-Traffic. In the event that placement or
maintenance of communications facilities conducted by the communications
services provider requires streets or traffic lanes to be closed or obstructed,
the communications services provider must, pursuant to the requirements of
existing or subsequently enacted city ordinances, obtain all necessary permits
from city, and shall obtain approval of its maintenance-of-traffic plan from
the public works director or his designee.
      (18)   Restoration of the public rights-of-way. After completion of any
placement or maintenance of a communications facility in the public rights-of-
way or each phase thereof, the Communications services provider shall, at its
own expense and in a manner reasonably acceptable to the city, restore without
delay the public rights-of-way so disturbed to its original condition
immediately prior to the placement or maintenance work. If the communications
services provider fails to make such restoration within thirty (30) days
following the completion of such placement or maintenance, the city may perform
such restoration and charge the costs of the restoration to the communications
services provider in accordance with Fla. Stat. § 337.402, as it may be
amended. The communications services provider shall, to the satisfaction of the
public works director or his designee, maintain and correct any restorations
made pursuant hereto for a period of twelve (12) months following the date of
its completion. Failure to comply with this subsection shall be deemed
sufficient grounds for denial of any future development permits for the
placement or maintenance of communications facilities.
   (C)   General conditions on the utilization of the public rights-of-way and
the placement or maintenance of communications facilities.
      (1)   City not liable. Except for acts of willful misconduct or gross
negligence and to the extent permitted by applicable law, neither the city nor
its officials, boards, Councils, consultants, agents, employees or independent
contractors shall have any liability to the communications services provider
for any claims for any damages, costs, expenses or losses resulting from the
city's breakage, removal, alteration or relocation of any facilities of any
communications services provider which arose out of or in connection with any
emergency or disaster situation or was, in the sole discretion of the public
works director or his designee, deemed necessary to facilitate any public works
project, public improvement, alteration of a city structure, change in the
grade or line of any public rights-of-way, or the elimination, abandonment or
closure of any public rights-of-way or was found by City Council to be in the
best interest of the health, safety or general welfare of the public; nor shall
any charge be made by the communications services provider against the city for
any damages, costs, expenses or losses related thereto.
      (2)   No exemption from permits. Nothing in this chapter shall exempt any
communications services provider from obtaining development permits for work
done within the public rights-of-way.
      (3)   Subject to police powers. The rights of the communications services
provider shall be subject to all lawful exercise of police power by the city,
and to such other reasonable regulation of the public rights-of-way as the city
shall hereafter by resolution or ordinance provide in the interest of the
health, safety and general welfare of the public. Any inconsistency or
ambiguity between the provisions of this Chapter 101 and any lawful exercise of
the city's police power shall be resolved in favor of the latter.
      (4)   City inspection. The city shall have the right to make such
inspections of a communications system or facilities placed or maintained in
the public rights-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with this
chapter. This chapter shall not be construed to create or hold the city
responsible or liable for any damage to persons or property by reason of any
inspection by the city of the placement or maintenance of a communications
system or facility as authorized herein or failure by the city to so inspect.
      (5)   Access to manholes. The city, in the proper exercise of its
municipal powers and duties with respect to the public rights-of-way, shall
have access at any time to all hand holes and manholes in the city belonging to
a communications services provider. Before accessing any manhole, the city will
make a reasonable good faith effort to provide the communications services
provider prior notice to afford an opportunity to have trained personnel
present, unless determined by the city to be an emergency situation.
      (6)   Compatibility, capacity and interference issues. To properly manage
and control the use of the public rights-of-way, and to protect the health,
safety and general welfare of the public, the city, in its legislative and
regulatory role, shall be the final authority on permitting a communications
system or facility to be placed in the public rights-of-way and shall exercise
such authority in a non-discriminatory manner. It shall be in the sole
discretion of the City Attorney whether an easement is compatible with or
allows for its use by a communications system or facility. It shall be in the
sole discretion of the public works director or his designee, based on the
nature, design, size, configuration or proposed location of any communications
system or facility, whether there is sufficient capacity in a particular
section of the public rights-of-way or whether such system or facility will
interfere with the facilities or equipment of any municipality, county, public
utility, cable operator, or other communications service provider.
      (7)   No warranty of fitness or suitability. The city makes no express or
implied warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability, or
availability of the public rights-of-way for any communications system or
facility or its right to authorize the placement or maintenance of any
communications system or facility in the public rights-of-way. Any performance
of work, costs incurred or services rendered by a communications services
provider shall be at such provider's sole risk. Nothing in this chapter shall
affect the city's authority to acquire or add public rights-of-way, or to
vacate or abandon public rights-of-way as provided for in the City Code or
applicable law. The city makes no express or implied warranties or
representations regarding the availability of any acquired, added, vacated or
abandoned public rights-of-way for a communications system or facility.
      (8)   Annexations. Upon the annexation of any territory to the City of
Palm Bay, the provisions of this chapter and the rules, regulations and general
conditions contained herein shall extend to the territories so annexed; and all
facilities placed, maintained, owned or operated by any communications services
provider extending into or already located in the public rights-of-way of the
territory so annexed, shall thereafter be subject to all terms hereof, as the
same may be amended from time to time.
(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)
§ 101.07 DUTY TO NOTIFY CITY OF RESELLERS; CONDITIONAL USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-
WAY.
   Within thirty (30) days of any registered communications services provider
using its facilities to carry the communication services of any reseller, such
communications services provider shall notify the city of the name and address
of such reseller. A reseller's lease, interconnection or other use of
facilities belonging to a communications services provider duly registered in
accordance with §
101.04 and properly permitted to place or maintain its facilities in the public
rights-of-way, does not, and shall not, afford such reseller any right, claim
or cause of action to impede the lawful exercise of the city's rights or police
powers, including, but not limited to, requiring the registered communications
services provider to remove such facilities from the public rights-of-way.
(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)
§ 101.08 WIRELESS FACILITIES.
   (A)   Generally. The placement of telecommunication towers and antennae
anywhere in the corporate limits of the city shall in all cases be subject to
the city's zoning and land use regulations, including those set forth in §§
35.110 through
35.114, Palm Bay Code. Where placement of a wireless antenna in the public
rights-of-way has been approved by the city and to the extent not inconsistent
with any city zoning and land use regulations, a wireless antenna attached to a
permitted and legally maintained vertical structure in the public rights-of-
way, such as a light pole or utility pole, shall, unless otherwise agreed to by
the city in writing:
      (1)   not extend more than ten feet (10') above the highest point of the
vertical structure;
      (2)   not have any type of lighted signal, lights, or illuminations
unless required by an applicable federal, state, or local rule, regulation or
law;
      (3)   comply with any applicable Federal Communications Council Emissions
Standards;
      (4)   comply with any applicable local building codes in terms of design,
construction and installation; and
      (5)   not contain any commercial advertising thereon.
   (B)   Small wireless facilities in public rights-of way. The city hereby
adopts the following rules that will apply to the collocation of small wireless
facilities in public rights-of-way for all applications filed on or after July
1, 2017:
      (1)   General conditions. Applicants seeking permission to collocate or
install small wireless facilities within public rights-of-way shall comply with
the registration, insurance coverage, indemnification, performance bonds,
security funds, force majeure, abandonment, city liability, and city warranties
provisions contained in this Chapter 101; provided, however, that the review
timeframes and denial criteria of this §
101.08(B) shall control.
      (2)   Filing, review, and processing of applications. The city shall
accept applications for permits and shall process and issue permits for the
collocation of small wireless facilities in public rights-of-way subject to the
following requirements:
         (a)   The applicant shall as a part of its application provide
information necessary to demonstrate the applicant's compliance with the
applicable provisions of
Chapter 101 for the placement of small wireless facilities in the locations
identified in the application, and shall bear the burden of demonstrating
compliance therewith.
         (b)   Within fourteen (14) days after the date of filing the
application, the city may request that the proposed location of a small
wireless facility be moved to another location in the right-of-way and placed
on an alternative city utility pole or support structure or may place a new
utility pole. The city and the applicant may negotiate the alternative
location, including any objective design standards and reasonable spacing
requirements for ground-based equipment, for thirty (30) days after the date of
the request. At the conclusion of the negotiation period, if the alternative
location is accepted by the applicant, the applicant must notify the city of
such acceptance and the application shall be deemed granted for any new
location for which there is agreement and all other locations in the
application. If an agreement is not reached, the applicant must notify the city
of such nonagreement and the city must grant or deny the original application
within ninety (90) days after the date the application was filed. A request for
an alternative location, an acceptance of an alternative location, or a
rejection of an alternative location must be in writing and provided by
electronic mail.
         (c)   The city hereby limits the height of a small wireless facility
to 10 feet above the utility pole or structure upon which the small wireless
facility is to be collocated. Unless waived by the city, the height for a new
utility pole is limited to the tallest existing utility pole as of July 1,
2017, located in the same public right-of-way, other than a utility pole for
which a waiver has previously been granted, measured from grade in place within
five hundred feet (500') of the proposed location of the small wireless
facility. If there is no utility pole within five hundred feet (500'), the city
shall limit the height of the utility pole to fifty feet (50').
         (d)   Within fourteen (14) days after receiving an application, the
city must determine and notify the applicant by electronic mail as to whether
the application is complete. If an application is deemed incomplete, the city
must specifically identify the missing information. An application is deemed
complete if the city fails to provide notification to the applicant within
fourteen (14) days.
         (e)   The city shall process all applications on a nondiscriminatory
basis. If the city fails to approve or deny a complete application within 60
days after receipt of the application, the application is deemed approved. If
the city does not use the 30-day negotiation period provided herein, the
parties may mutually agree to extend the 60-day application review period. The
city shall grant or deny the application at the end of the extended period.
         (f)   A permit issued pursuant to an approved application shall remain
effective for 1 year unless extended by the city.
         (g)   The city shall notify the applicant of approval or denial by
electronic mail. The city shall approve a complete application unless it does
not meet the applicable provisions of this chapter.
         (h)   If the application is denied, the city shall specify in writing
the basis for denial, including the specific code provisions on which the
denial is based, and shall send the documentation to the applicant by
electronic mail on the day the city denies the application.
         (i)   The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the city
and resubmit the application within thirty (30) days after notice of the denial
is sent to the applicant. Failure by the applicant to timely resubmit the
application shall result in a final denial of the application. The city shall
approve or deny a timely filed revised application within thirty (30) days
after receipt or the application is deemed approved. Any subsequent review
shall be limited to the deficiencies cited in the denial.
         (j)   An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities
within the city's boundaries may, at the applicant's discretion, file a
consolidated application with the city and receive a single permit for the
collocation of up to 30 small wireless facilities. If the application includes
multiple small wireless facilities, the city may separately address small
wireless facility collocations for which incomplete information has been
received or which are denied.
         (k)   The city may deny a proposed collocation of a small wireless
facility in the public rights-of-way if the proposed collocation:
            1.    Materially interferes with the safe operation of traffic
control equipment.
            2.    Materially interferes with sight lines or clear zones for
transportation, pedestrians, or public safety purposes.
            3.    Materially interferes with compliance with the Americans with
Disabilities Act or similar federal or state standards regarding pedestrian
access or movement.
            4.    Materially fails to comply with the 2010 edition of the
Florida Department of Transportation Utility Accommodation Manual.
            5.   Fails to comply with applicable codes and the applicable
provisions of this chapter.
         (l)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
city may reserve space on city utility poles for future public safety uses. If
replacement of a city utility pole is necessary to accommodate the collocation
of the small wireless facility and the future public safety use, the pole
replacement is subject to the make-ready provisions of this ordinance and the
replaced pole shall accommodate the future public safety use.
         (m)   A structure granted a permit and installed pursuant to this §
101.08(B) shall comply with Fla. Stat. Ch. 333 and federal regulations
pertaining to airport airspace protections.
         (n)   The city does not require approval or fees for (i) routine
maintenance, (ii) replacement of existing wireless facilities with
substantially similar wireless facilities, or (iii) installation, placement,
maintenance, or replacement of micro wireless facilities that are suspended on
cables strung between existing utility poles in compliances with applicable
codes by or for a communications services provider authorized to occupy the
public rights-of-way and who is remitting taxes under Fla. Stat. Ch. 202.
      (3)   Collocation of small wireless facilities on city utility poles.
Collocation of small wireless facilities on city utility poles is subject to
the following requirements:
         (a)   The city shall not enter into an exclusive arrangement with any
person for the right to attach equipment to city utility poles.
         (b)   The rates and fees for collocations on city utility poles must
be nondiscriminatory, regardless of the services provided by the collocating
person.
         (c)   The city hereby levies, establishes, and sets an annual rate
that shall be paid by all those applicants who file an application to collocate
small wireless facilities on city utility poles in the amount of $150 per pole
per year. The initial payment shall be made as a condition of the granting of
the permit, with remaining annual payments to be made in all subsequent years
on the same date.
         (d)   Agreements between the city and wireless providers that are in
effect on July 1, 2017, and that relate to the collocation of small wireless
facilities in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless
facilities on city utility poles, remain in effect, subject to applicable
termination provisions. The wireless provider may accept the rates, fees, and
terms established under this subsection for small wireless facilities and
utility poles that are the subject of an application submitted after the rates,
fees, and terms become effective.
         (e)   For a city utility pole that supports an aerial facility used to
provide communications services or electric service by another, the parties
shall comply with the process for make-ready work under 47 U.S.C. s. 224 and
implementing regulations. The good faith estimate of the person owning or
controlling the pole for any make-ready work necessary to enable the pole to
support the requested collocation must include pole replacement if necessary.
         (f)   For a city utility pole that does not support an aerial facility
used to provide communications services or electric service by another, the
city shall provide a good faith estimate for any make-ready work necessary to
enable the pole to support the requested collocation, including necessary pole
replacement, within sixty (60) days after receipt of a complete application.
Make-ready work, including any pole replacement, must be completed within sixty
(60) days after written acceptance of the good faith estimate by the applicant.
Alternatively, the city may require the applicant seeking to collocate a small
wireless facility to provide a make-ready estimate at the applicant's expense
for the work necessary to support the small wireless facility, including pole
replacement, and perform the make-ready work. If pole replacement is required,
the scope of the make-ready estimate is limited to the design, fabrication, and
installation of a utility pole that is substantially similar in color and
composition. The city may not condition or restrict the manner in which the
applicant obtains, develops, or provides the estimate or conducts the make-
ready work subject to usual construction restoration standards for work in the
right-of-way. The replaced or altered utility pole shall remain the property of
the city.
         (g)   The city may not require more make-ready work than is required
to meet applicable codes or industry standards. Fees for make-ready work may
not include costs related to preexisting damage or prior noncompliance. Fees
for make-ready work, including any pole replacement, may not exceed actual
costs or the amount charged to communications services providers other than
wireless services providers for similar work and may not include any consultant
fee or expense.
      (4)   Placement of utility poles in the public rights-of-way in support
of collocation of small wireless facilities. A wireless infrastructure provider
may apply to the city to place utility poles in the public rights-of-way to
support the collocation of small wireless facilities. The application must
include an attestation that small wireless facilities will be collocated on the
utility pole or structure and will be used by a wireless services provider to
provide service within nine (9) months after the date the application is
approved by the city. The city shall accept and process the application in
accordance with §
101.08(B) and any applicable codes and other local codes governing the
placement of utility poles in the public rights-of-way.
      (5)   Application and enforcement of historic preservation zoning
regulations. Consistent with preservation of local zoning authority under 47
U.S.C. s. 332(c)(7), the requirements for facility modifications under 47
U.S.C. s. 1455(a), and the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended, this §
101.08(B) is subject to the provisions of Chapter 38, City Code, Historic
Preservation.
      (6)   Prohibited collocations, attachments, installations, and services
not authorized by §
101.08(B).  This §
101.08(B) does not authorize, and the city hereby prohibits, the following:
         (a)   This §
101.08(B) does not authorize a person to collocate or attach wireless
facilities, including any antenna, micro wireless facility, or small wireless
facility, on a privately-owned utility pole, a utility pole owned by an
electric cooperative or a municipal electric utility, a privately owned
wireless support structure, or other private property without the consent of
the property owner.
         (b)   The approval of the installation, placement, maintenance, or
operation of a small wireless facility pursuant to this §
101.08(B) does not authorize the provision of any voice, data, or video
services or the installation, placement, maintenance, or operation of any
communications facilities other than small wireless facilities in the public
right-of-way.
         (c)   This §
101.08(B) does not affect provisions relating to pass-through providers
contained in this ordinance and contained in Fla. Stat. §
337.401(6).
         (d)   This §
101.08(B) does not apply to the installation, placement, maintenance, or
replacement of micro wireless facilities on any existing and duly authorized
aerial communications facilities, provided that once aerial facilities are
converted to underground facilities, any such collocation or construction shall
be only as provided by the city's underground utilities ordinance.
         (e)   This §
101.08(B) does not authorize a person to collocate small wireless facilities or
micro wireless facilities on a city utility pole or erect a wireless support
structure in a location subject to covenants, conditions, restrictions,
articles of incorporation, and bylaws of a homeowners' association. This
paragraph does not apply to the installation, placement, maintenance, or
replacement of micro wireless facilities on any existing and duly authorized
aerial communications facilities.
(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)
§ 101.09 REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF DEVELOPMENT PERMITS.
   Subject to §
101.11, the city may revoke any development permit currently issued to a
communications services provider for work in the public rights-of-way or
suspend the issuance of development permits in the future to a communications
services provider for, in addition to any other circumstances provided for in
this chapter, one or more of the following reasons:
   (A)   a violation of permit conditions, including conditions set forth in
the permit, this Chapter 101, and other applicable codes or regulations
governing the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the
public rights-of-way;
   (B)   a misrepresentation or fraud made or committed on the part of the
communications services provider in the registration process or in the
application for a development permit;
   (C)   the failure to properly renew the registration or the ineffectiveness
of registration; or
   (D)   the failure to relocate or remove communications facilities as may be
required by the city pursuant to this Chapter 101.
   The public works director or his designee shall provide notice and an
opportunity to cure any violation of (A) through (D) above, each of which shall
be reasonable under the circumstances.
(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)
§ 101.10 INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION OF REGISTRATION.
   (A)   The city may terminate a registration if:
      (1)   a Federal or State authority suspends, denies, or revokes a
communications services provider's certification or license to provide
communications services;
      (2)   the communications services provider's placement or maintenance of
a communications facility in the public rights-of-way presents an extraordinary
danger to the general public or other users of the public rights-of-way and the
communications services provider fails to remedy the danger promptly after
receipt of written notice;
      (3)   the communications services provider ceases to use all of its
communications facilities in the public rights-of-way and has not complied with
§
101.21 herein; or
      (4)   the communications services provider fails to comply with any of
the rules, regulations or general conditions set forth in §
101.06 herein.
   (B)   Prior to termination of a registration, the communications services
provider shall be notified by the public works director or his designee with a
written notice setting forth all matters pertinent to the proposed termination,
including which of (1) through (4) above is applicable as the reason therefor.
The communications services provider shall have thirty (30) days after receipt
of such notice within which to eliminate the reason or within which to present
a plan, satisfactory to the public works director or his designee, to
accomplish the same. If not eliminated or if the plan presented is rejected,
the public works director or his designee shall provide written notice of such
rejection to the communications services provider and a final determination to
terminate registration. A final determination to terminate registration may be
appealed in accordance with the procedures set forth in §
101.11.
   (C)   In the event of termination, following any appeal period, the
communications services provider formerly registered shall: (1) notify the city
of the assumption or anticipated assumption by another registrant of ownership
of the communications services provider's facilities in public rights-of-way or
(2) provide the city with an acceptable plan for disposition of its
communications facilities in the public rights-of-way. If a communications
services provider fails to comply with this subsection (C), which determination
of non-compliance is subject to appeal as provided in §
101.11, the city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in
equity, including but not limited to taking possession of the facilities where
another person has not assumed the ownership or physical control of the
facilities or requiring the communications services provider within 90 days of
the termination, or such longer period as may be mutually agreed to between the
city and the communications services provider, to remove some or all of the
communications facilities from the public rights-of-way and restore the public
rights-of-way to their original condition prior to such removal.
   (D)   In any event, a communications services provider whose registration
has been terminated shall take such steps as are necessary to render safe every
portion of the communications facilities remaining in the public rights-of-way.
   (E)   In the event of termination of a registration, this section does not
authorize the city to cause the removal of communications facilities used to
provide another service for which the communications services provider or
another person who owns or exercises physical control over the communications
facilities holds a valid certification or license with the governing Federal or
State agency, if required for provision of such service, and who is registered
with the city, if required.
   (F)   The city's right to terminate a registration shall be in addition to
all other rights of the city, whether reserved in this chapter, or authorized
by other law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of the right to terminate
registration will affect or preclude any other right the city may have.
(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)
§ 101.11 APPEALS.
   Final determinations by appropriate city staff denying an initial
registration; denying an application for renewal of a registration; terminating
a registration; or denying, revoking or suspending any development permit are
subject to appeal. A notice of appeal of such decision may be filed with the
city's Manager within thirty (30) days of the date of the final, written
decision to be appealed. The City Manager shall have thirty (30) days from the
date the appeal is filed to review the matter and render a written decision to
uphold or reverse the final decision made by staff. If the City Manager upholds
the final decision of staff, the appellant may file a notice of appeal with the
City Clerk within thirty (30) days of the date of the written decision of the
Chief Administrative Officer. The City Clerk shall set the matter for hearing
before the City Council at any regular meeting of City Council scheduled within
forty-five (45) days of the date that the notice of appeal is filed with the
City Clerk, unless waived by the communications services provider. A ruling may
be made at the hearing or at the next regularly scheduled City Council meeting
and the communications services provider shall be notified of the decision in
writing within thirty (30) days thereof. Where a notice of appeal to the City
Manager or the City Clerk is not timely filed as provided herein, such right to
appeal shall be waived. Upon correction by the communications services provider
of the circumstances that gave rise to a suspension or denial of a development
permit, the suspension or denial shall be lifted (the same does not apply to
the revocation of a development permit).
(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)
§ 101.12 FEES APPLICABLE TO THOSE NOT SUBJECT TO COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES TAX.
   While the Florida Legislature has prohibited municipalities from requiring
providers of communications services who have registered with the Florida
Department of Revenue from having to enter into franchise agreements or license
arrangements as a condition to placing or maintaining communications facilities
in the public rights-of-way, the city expressly reserves the right to require
the payment of consideration or regulatory fees by persons using or occupying
the public rights-of-way in other capacities. The city reserves the right to
require such payments based on the type of user and to the extent as follows:
   (A)   Dealer. Except as provided in paragraph (16) of §
101.06(B), a communications services provider who meets the definition of
dealer as set forth in this Chapter 101 and who has registered in accordance
with §
101.04 is not required to enter into a franchise agreement or license
arrangement with the city as a condition to placing or maintaining
communications facilities in the public rights-of-way, nor is a dealer required
to make payment of any franchise fees, license fees or other user fees to the
city as consideration for the use or occupancy of the public rights-of-way for
the provision of communication services.
   (B)   Pass-through provider and pass through facilities. A communications
services provider who meets the definition of pass-through provider as set
forth in this Chapter 101 and who is not subject to the City of Palm Bay's
Local Communications Services Tax imposed pursuant to Fla. Stat. §§ 202.19 and
202.20 shall pay the city the maximum annual amount allowed under Fla. Stat. §
337.401, as amended. For purposes of calculating payments hereunder, each
separate pole or tower installed or maintained by a pass-through provider for
purposes of supporting antennas for other over-the-air radio transmission or
reception equipment in the public rights-of-way shall comprise a separate
communications facility subject to assessment of a separate permit fee in the
amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per linear mile, or portion thereof,
up to the maximum amount allowed under Fla. Stat. § 337.401, whichever is
higher. The annual amount referred to above shall be due and payable on October
1 of every year beginning on October 1, 2017. Fees not paid within ten (10)
days after the due date shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per
month from the date due until paid. The acceptance of any payment required
hereunder by the city shall not be construed as an acknowledgment that the
amount paid is the correct amount due, nor shall such acceptance of payment be
construed as a release of any claim which the city may have for additional sums
due and payable or authorization to install any facilities in the public
rights-of-way.
   (C)   Other persons. All other persons, except government, are required to
pay the city, as consideration for the use or occupancy of the public rights-
of-way for the placement or maintenance of communications facilities, an amount
based on and in accordance with the fee provision in §
101.12(B), Palm Bay Code.
   (D)   Government. A government is not required to pay the city consideration
for the use or occupancy of the public rights-of-way for the placement or
maintenance of communications facilities, unless such facilities are being used
by such government or a communications services provider, including resellers,
to offer or provide communication services other than for such government's
internal non-commercial use, in which event the government, where not subject
to the City of Palm Bay's Local Communications Services Tax imposed pursuant to
Fla. Stat. §§ 202.19 and 202.20, is required to pay the city, as consideration
for the use or occupancy of the public rights-of-way by or through its
facilities placed therein after October 1, 2017, an amount based on and in
accordance with the fee provision in §
101.12(B), Palm Bay Code, or such other amount or rate of compensation as
mutually agreed to in writing by the government and the city.

§ 101.13 EXISTING COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY.
   A communications services provider with a facility in the public rights-of-
way as of the effective date of this
Chapter 101 has until October 1, 2017 to comply with the provisions of this
chapter, including, but not limited to, registration, or be in violation
thereof.
(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)
§ 101.14 INSURANCE.
   (A)   At all times during the use or occupancy of the public rights-of-way,
including any time during placement or maintenance of communications
facilities, the communications services provider shall obtain, pay all premiums
for, and maintain satisfactory to the city the types of insurance policies and
coverage limits described in this §
101.14. Nothing contained in this chapter shall limit a communications services
provider's liability to the city to the limits of insurance certified or
carried.
      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance valid in the State of
Florida, including contractual liability and products completed operations
liability coverage on an occurrence basis, which policy limit shall be in an
amount not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence, combined
single limit, for bodily injury, personal injury or death, or property damage
and in an amount not less than two million dollars ($2,000,000) policy
aggregate for each personal injury liability, broad form property damage
(without XCU exclusions), contractual liability and products-completed
operations liability.
      (2)   Business automobile liability insurance valid in the State of

property damage covering owned, leased, hired and non-owner vehicles.
      (3)   Workers' Compensation valid in the State of Florida which policy
limit shall be in an amount not less than the statutory limit for Workers'
Compensation.
      (4)   Employer's liability insurance valid in the State of Florida which

($1,000,000) each accident for employer's liability.
   (B)   All insurance providers used shall be admitted and duly authorized to
do business in the State of Florida and shall have assigned by A. M. Best
Company a minimum Financial Strength Rating of "A" and a minimum Financial Size
Category of "IX" (i.e., a size of $250,000,000 to $500,000,000 based on
capital, surplus, and conditional reserve funds). Insurance policies and
certificates issued by non-admitted insurance companies are not acceptable. All
liability policies shall name the city, its council members, officers, and
employees as additional insureds with respect to any covered liability arising
out of the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public
rights-of-way or other activities under this chapter. Each communications
services provider shall furnish annually to the city certificates showing proof
of all required insurance coverage. All liability coverage must be in
occurrence form and in accordance with the limits specified. Claims made
policies are not acceptable. No insurance policy shall be canceled, nor shall
the occurrence or aggregate limits set forth herein be reduced, until the city
has received at least thirty (30) days' advance written notice by registered,
certified or regular mail or facsimile of any cancellation, intent not to renew
or reduction in policy coverage. Each communications services provider shall be
responsible for notifying the city of such cancellation, intent not to renew or
reduction in coverage. All Certificate(s) of Insurance, including all
endorsements and riders, evidencing insurance coverage shall be submitted to
the city within thirty (30) days after the date of registration with the city
in order for a communications services provider to obtain development permits
required for construction in the public rights-of-way. Each communications
services provider shall, in the event of any such notice described above,
obtain, pay all premiums for, and file with the city, written evidence of the
issuance of replacement policies within thirty (30) days following receipt by
the city or the communications services provider of such notice.
   (C)   The Certificate(s) of Insurance forms must be properly executed by the
authorized representative of the insurance provider and must include all
endorsements, riders and notices. Each communications services provider shall
file and maintain with the city on an annual basis the required Certificate(s)
of Insurance. The Certificate(s) of Insurance must indicate the following:
      (1)   the policy number; name of insurance company; name and address of
the agent or authorized representative; name and address of insured; that the
policy coverage "pertains the requirements of §
101.14 of the Palm Bay Communications Right-of- Way Utilization Ordinance;"
policy expiration date; and specific coverage amounts; and
      (2)   any applicable deductibles or self-insured retentions; and
      (3)   that the city, its council members, officers and employees are
additional insureds; and
      (4)   that the city shall receive thirty (30) days' advance written
notice of cancellation, intent not to renew or reduction in coverage; and
      (5)   that the commercial general liability insurance policy is primary
as respects any other valid or collectible insurance that the city may possess,
including any self-insured retentions the city may have; and any other
insurance the city does possess shall be considered excess insurance only and
shall not be required to contribute with this insurance.
   (D)   Under extraordinary circumstances a communications services provider
may satisfy the insurance requirements of this chapter by providing
documentation of self-insurance that, in the sole discretion of the Director of
Human Resources and Risk Management, demonstrates incontrovertibly the adequacy
to defend and cover claims of any nature that might arise from the placement
and maintenance of facilities in the public rights-of-way. The communications
services provider must be authorized as a self-insurer by the Department of
Insurance under the laws of the State of Florida.

§ 101.15 INDEMNIFICATION.
   (A)   Except with respect to the willful misconduct, negligence or gross
negligence of the city, a communications services provider, by act of
registering with the city as such, shall be obligated, at its sole cost and
expense, to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the city, its officials,
Council members, agents and employees from and against any and all claims,
suits, causes of action, proceedings, liabilities and judgments for damages or
equitable relief, and costs and expenses arising out of or in connection with
the placement or maintenance of its communications facilities in the public
rights-of-way by the communications services provider or its agent or hired
contractor. This indemnification provision shall include, but not be limited
to, such damages and penalties arising out of claims (1) by any person
whatsoever on account of (i) bodily injury to a person or persons, (ii) death
of a person or persons or (iii) property damage, where any of the foregoing is
occasioned by the operations of the communications services provider, or
alleged to have been so caused or occurred or (2) involving the communications
services provider's violation of any easement or private property rights.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city from participating in
the defense of any litigation by its own counsel if in the city's reasonable
belief there exists or may exist a conflict, potential conflict or appearance
of a conflict.
   (C)   Indemnified costs and expenses shall include, but not be limited to,
all out-of-pocket expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees in defending against
any such claim, suit or proceeding, and shall also include the reasonable value
of any services rendered by the City Attorney or his assistants or any
consultants, agents and employees of the city. The city will attempt to notify
the communications services provider, in writing, within a reasonable time of
the city's receiving notice of any issue it determines may require
indemnification.
   (D)   Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed or
interpreted: (1) as denying the city, the communications services provider or
any person any remedy or defense available to them under the laws of the State
of Florida; or (2) as a waiver of sovereign immunity beyond the waiver provided
in Fla. Stat. § 768.28, as it may be amended.
   (E)   The indemnification requirements shall survive and be in effect after
the termination or cancellation of a registration.
(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)
§ 101.16 CONSTRUCTION BOND.
   (A)   Prior to issuance of any development permit where the type of work
allowed under the permit will require restoration of the public rights-of-way,
the communications services provider or the contractor performing such work on
its behalf shall obtain, pay for and file with the city a construction bond.
The construction bond shall serve to guarantee the timeliness and quality of
the construction and restoration work and to secure, and enable the city to
recover, all costs related to the restoration of the public rights-of-way in
the event the communications services provider or its contractor fails to make
such restoration to the city's satisfaction or causes damage to the public
rights-of-way during construction. The construction bond must name the city as
obligee and be in the face amount of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000)
conditioned upon the full and faithful completion of construction and
restoration of the public rights-of-way to its original condition. Six (6)
months following completion and inspection of the restoration of the public
rights-of-way satisfactory to the public works director or his designee, the
communications services provider or its contractor, as the case may be, may
reduce the face amount of the construction bond to five thousand dollars
($5,000) and, thereafter, may allow the bond to lapse in accordance with its
terms. However, for any subsequent work in the public rights-of-way, the
communications services provider or its contractor will be required to
replenish any existing construction bond or provide a new construction bond in
the face amount of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000). The construction bond
shall be in a form acceptable to the City Attorney and must be issued by a
surety having a rating reasonably acceptable to the public works director or
his designee and authorized by the Florida Department of Insurance to issue
surety bonds in this State.
   (B)   The construction bond must be issued as non-cancelable and be for a
term of not less than twelve (12) months. In the event the term of any
construction bond expires, or is reasonably expected to expire, prior to the
completion of construction, restoration and city inspection, the communications
services provider, or the contractor acting on its behalf, shall immediately
obtain, pay for, and file with the city a replacement bond.
   (C)   The city's requirement of a construction bond is not in lieu of any
additional bonds that may be required under this chapter or through the
permitting process. The city's right to recover under the construction bond
shall be in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved in this
chapter, or authorized by other law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a
right with respect to the construction bond will affect or preclude any other
right the city may have.
(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)
§ 101.17 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (A)   Before any communications services provider is permitted to begin the
placement or maintenance of an initial build, any substantial rebuild, upgrade
or extension of its communications system, or when construction plans show that
there would be at least one thousand (1,000) feet of open trenching in the
public rights-of-way at any given time, the communications services provider is
required to obtain, pay for, and file with the city a performance bond. The
performance bond must name the city as obligee and be in the face amount of two
hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) conditioned upon the full and
faithful compliance by the communications services provider with all
requirements, duties and obligations imposed by the provisions of the Palm Bay
Communications Right-of-Way Utilization Ordinance during, and through
completion of, the placement or maintenance project. The performance bond shall
be in a form acceptable to the City Attorney and must be issued by a surety
having a rating reasonably acceptable to the public works director or his
designee and authorized by the Florida Department of Insurance to issue
performance bonds in this state.
   (B)   The performance bond must be issued as non-cancelable and be for a
term consistent with the reasonably expected duration of the particular
placement or maintenance project (including restoration and city inspection),
but in no event less than eighteen (18) months. In the event the term of any
performance bond expires, or is reasonably expected to expire, prior to the
completion of such placement or maintenance project, including restoration and
city inspection, the communications services provider shall immediately obtain,
pay for, and file with the city a replacement bond.
   (C)   The city's requirement of a performance bond is not in lieu of any
additional bonds that may be required under this chapter or through the
permitting process. The city's right to recover under the performance bond
shall be in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved in this
chapter, or authorized by other law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a
right with respect to the performance bond will affect or preclude any other
right the city may have. Any proceeds recovered under the performance bond may
be used to reimburse the city for such additional expenses as may be incurred
by the city as a result of the communications services provider's failure to
comply with the responsibilities imposed by this chapter, including, but not
limited to, attorney's fees and costs of any action or proceeding, and the cost
of removal or abandonment of any property.
(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)
§ 101.18 SECURITY FUND.
   Every communications services provider shall make a twenty-five thousand
dollar ($25,000) cash deposit, or shall file with the city an irrevocable
letter of credit or acceptable equivalent in the same amount, which shall
serve, and be referred to, as the "Security Fund." The Security Fund shall be
conditioned upon the full and faithful compliance with and performance by the
communications services provider of all requirements, duties and obligations
imposed by the provisions of the Palm Bay Communications Right-of-Way
Utilization Ordinance at all times. The letter of credit shall be in a form and
issued by an institution acceptable to the city's Chief Financial Officer.
Should the city draw upon the Security Fund, it shall promptly notify the
communications services provider, and the communications services provider
shall promptly restore the cash deposit or letter of credit to the full amount.
The Security Fund shall be maintained until the later of (a) the effective date
of transfer, sale or assignment by the communications services provider of all
its facilities in the public rights-of-way, (b) twelve (12) months after the
removal or abandonment by the communications services provider of all of its
facilities in the public rights-of-way or (c) six (6) months after the
termination of registration, including any appeals undertaken pursuant to §
101.11 herein. Upon the later of these events the cash deposit will be returned
without interest or the letter of credit may be cancelled. In the event a
communications services provider fails to perform any requirement, duty or
obligation imposed upon it by the provisions of this chapter, there shall be
recoverable, jointly and severally from the Security Fund, any damages or loss
suffered by the city as a result, including the full amount of any
compensation, indemnification or cost of removal, relocation or abandonment of
any facilities in public rights-of-way, plus a reasonable allowance for
attorneys' fees, up to the full amount of the Security Fund.
(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)
§ 101.19 ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   No provision of this chapter shall be deemed to bar the right of the
city to seek or obtain judicial relief from a violation of any provisions of
this chapter, the registration provisions, or any rule, regulation or general
condition provided for hereunder, whether administratively, judicially or both.
Neither the existence of other remedies identified in this chapter nor the
exercise thereof shall be deemed to bar or otherwise limit the right of the
city to recover fines, penalties or monetary damages (except where liquidated
damages are otherwise prescribed) for such violation by the communications
services provider. The remedies available to the city shall be cumulative and
in addition to any other remedies provided by law or equity. The laws of the
State of Florida shall govern with respect to any proceeding in law or equity
pertaining to the enforcement of this chapter or any cause of action arising
out of or in connection herewith.
   (B)   A communications services provider's failure to comply with provisions
of this chapter shall constitute a City Code violation and shall subject the
communications service provider to the code enforcement provisions and
procedures as provided in Chapter 52, §§
52.080-
52.092, Palm Bay Code, and may be punishable as provided in Fla. Stat. §
162.22, as it may be amended.
   (C)   In any proceeding before the City Council where there exists an issue
with respect to a communications services provider's performance of its
obligations pursuant to this chapter, the communications services provider
shall be given the opportunity to provide such information as it may have
concerning its compliance with the terms and conditions of this ordinance. The
city may find a communications services provider that does not demonstrate
compliance with the terms and conditions of this chapter in default and apply
any appropriate remedy or remedies as authorized by this ordinance. In
determining which remedy is appropriate, the City Council shall take into
consideration the nature of the violation, the person bearing the impact of the
violation, the nature of the remedy required in order to prevent further
violations, and such other matters as the City Council determines are
appropriate to the public interest.
   (D)   The public works director or his designee shall be responsible for
administration and enforcement of this chapter, and is authorized to give any
notice required herein or by law.
   (E)   Failure of the city to enforce any requirements of this chapter shall
not constitute a waiver of the city's right to enforce that violation or
subsequent violations of the same type or to seek appropriate enforcement
remedies.
(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)
§ 101.20 ABANDONMENT OF A COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY.
   (A)   Upon abandonment of any facility owned by a communications services
provider in the public rights-of-way, the communications services provider
shall notify the city within sixty (60) days.
   (B)   The city may direct the communications services provider, by written
notice, to remove all or any portion of such abandoned communications facility
at the communications services provider's sole expense if the city determines
that the abandoned communications facility's presence interferes with the
public health, safety or welfare, which shall include, but shall not be limited
to, a determination that such communications facility: (1) compromises safety
at any time for any public rights-of-way user; (2) compromises the safety of
other persons performing placement or maintenance of communications facilities
in the public rights-of-way; (3) prevents another person from locating other
facilities in the area of the public rights-of-way where the abandoned
communications facility is located when other alternative locations are not
reasonably available; or (4) creates a maintenance condition that is disruptive
to the use of the public rights-of-way. In the event of (2), the city may
require the third person to coordinate with the communications services
provider that owns the existing communications facility for joint removal and
placement, where agreed to by the communications services provider.
   (C)   If the communications services provider fails to remove all or any
portion of an abandoned communications facility as directed by the city within
the time period specified in the written notice, which time period must be
reasonable under the circumstances, the city may perform such removal and
charge the cost of the removal against the communications services provider.
   (D)   In the event that the city does not direct the removal of the
abandoned communications facility, the communications services provider, by its
notice of abandonment to the city, shall be deemed to consent to the alteration
or removal of all or any portion of such abandoned facility by the city or
other person, provided that the cost of the alteration or removal is not borne
by the communications services provider.
(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)
§ 101.21 RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.
   The city hereby expressly reserves all of the following rights:
   (A)   To exercise its municipal home rule powers, now or hereafter, to the
fullest extent allowed by law with regard to the access, use and regulation of
the public rights-of-way.
   (B)   To amend this chapter as it shall find necessary in the lawful
exercise of its municipal authority.
   (C)   To adopt or enact by resolution or ordinance, in addition to the
provisions contained herein and in any existing applicable ordinances, such
additional reasonable regulations as City Council finds necessary in the
exercise of the city's police powers.
   (D)   To exercise the power of eminent domain, consistent with applicable
federal and state law, to acquire property that may include that property owned
or leased by a communications services provider.
   (E)   As and when deemed necessary by City Council to be in the interest of
the city or its residents, to abandon portions of the public rights-of-way
within the proper exercise of its municipal authority and without notice to or
the consent of any communications services provider. The city shall not be
responsible for any costs, damages, loss or other expense to the communications
services provider as a result of the city's abandonment of any public rights-
of-way.
   (F)   To place and maintain, and franchise or permit to be placed or
maintained, sewer, gas, water, electric, storm drainage, communications, and
other types of facilities, cables or conduit, and to do, and to permit to be
done, any underground and overhead installation or improvement that may be
deemed necessary or proper by the city in the public rights-of-way occupied by
any communications services provider.
   (G)   Without limitation, the right to alter, change, or cause to be
changed, the grading, installation, relocation, or width of any public rights-
of-way within the city limits and within said limits as the same may from time
to time be altered.
   (H)   To require a reseller to register in accordance with §
101.04 to the extent such reseller wants the right to place or maintain
facilities in the public rights-of-way. Any person using or leasing facilities
owned by a registered communications services provider is not, therefore,
entitled to any rights to place or maintain communications facilities in the
public rights-of-way, unless such person themselves registers with the city.

   (A)   It is the intent of this chapter to protect and preserve the good
order, health, safety, welfare, and morals of the citizens of Palm Bay by
prohibiting a person from intentionally or recklessly appearing or being nude,
or causing another person to appear or be nude, in a public place and in other

suggests otherwise.
   BREAST. A portion of the human female mammary gland (commonly referred to as
the female breast) including the nipple and areola (the darker colored area of
the breast surrounding the nipple) and an outside area of such gland wherein
such outside area is reasonably compact and contiguous to the areola and
contains at least the nipple and the areola and one-quarter (1/4) of the
outside surface area of such gland.
   BUTTOCKS. The area at the rear of the human body (sometimes referred to as
the gluteus maximus) which lies between two (2) imaginary straight lines
running parallel to the ground when a person is standing, the first or top such
line being one-half (1/2) inch below the top of the vertical cleavage of the
nates (i.e., the prominence formed by the muscles running from the back of the
hip to the back of the leg) and the second or bottom such line being one-half
(1/2) inch above the lowest point of the curvature of the fleshy protuberance
(sometimes referred to as the gluteal fold), and between two (2) imaginary
straight lines, one (1) on each side of the body (the "outside lines"), which
outside lines are perpendicular to the ground and to the horizontal lines
described above and which perpendicular outside lines pass through the
outermost point(s) at which each nate meets the other side of leg.
Notwithstanding the above, buttocks shall not include the leg, the hamstring
muscle below the gluteal fold, the tensor fasciae latae muscle or any of the
above-described portion of the human body that is between either: the left
inside perpendicular line and the left outside perpendicular line, or the right
inside  perpendicular line and the right outside perpendicular line. For the
purpose of the previous sentence the left inside perpendicular line shall be an
imaginary straight line on the left side of the anus: that is perpendicular to
the ground and to the horizontal lines described above, that is one-third (1/3)
of the distance from the anus to the left outside line, and the right inside
perpendicular line shall be an imaginary straight line on the right side of the
anus that is perpendicular to the ground and to the horizontal lines described
above, and that is one-third (1/3) of the distance from the anus to the right

conduct of being nude is used for their profit or where being nude is used for
the promotion of business or is otherwise for commercial gain.

§ 102.04 FINDINGS.
   In addition and supplemental to the findings and determinations contained in
the recitals ("Whereas" clauses) of Ordinance 2007-31, passed April 30, 2007,
which are incorporated by reference into this section, it is the intent of the
citizens of Palm Bay to regulate the conduct of appearing nude in public places
for the purpose of regulating nudity and other conduct, that considering what
has happened in other communities, the acts prohibited in §
102.05, as may be amended from time to time, encourage or create the potential
for the conduct of adverse secondary effects such as, but not limited to,
prostitution, attempted rape, rape, assault, and the spread of sexually
communicable diseases; that actual and simulated nudity and sexual conduct in
public places, begets and has the potential for begetting undesirable and
unlawful behavior; that sexual, lewd, lascivious, and salacious conduct results
in violation of law and creates dangers to the health, safety, morals, and
welfare of the public and those who engage in such conduct; and, it is the
intent of § 102.05, as may be amended from time to time, to specifically
prohibit nudity, gross sexuality, or the simulation thereof.

§ 102.05 NUDITY PROHIBITED IN PUBLIC PLACES.

public place or in any other place which is readily visible to the public or
expose or cause another person to expose to public view their genitals, vulva,
penis, pubic area, or buttocks, or any simulation thereof, except as provided
in § 102.07. It shall also be unlawful for any person or entity maintaining,
owning, or operating any public place to encourage, suffer or allow any person
to appear nude in such public place, except as provided in § 102.07.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person to appear knowingly,
intentionally, or recklessly expose, or cause a female person to expose her
breasts or any simulation thereof to public view. Each female person may
determine which one-quarter (1/4) of her breast surface area (see definition of
breast) contiguous to and containing the areola is to be covered.
(Ord. 2024-38, passed 9-19-24)
§ 102.06 PUBLIC SEXUAL CONDUCT PROHIBITED.

portion of the buttocks is visible from any vantage point.
   (B)   No person shall engage in and no person or entity maintaining, owning,
or operating a public place shall encourage, allow, or permit any sexual
intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation,
lap dancing, straddle dancing, any sexual act which is prohibited by law,
touching, caressing, or fondling of the breasts, buttocks, anus, or genitals,
or the simulation thereof.

presentations, or other non-live performances.

   (A)   The prohibitions of §
102.06 shall not apply:
      (1)   When a person appears nude in a place provided or set apart for
nudity, as defined by this chapter, provided:
         (a)   Such person is nude for the sole purpose of performing the legal
function(s) that are customarily intended to be performed within such place
provided or set apart for nudity; and
         (b)   Such person is not nude for the purpose of obtaining money or
other financial gain for such person or for another person or entity.
      (2)   When the conduct of being nude cannot legally be prohibited by this
chapter because:
         (a)   It constitutes a part of a bona fide live communication,
demonstration, or performance by a person wherein such nudity is expressive
conduct incidental to and necessary for the conveyance or communication of a
genuine message or public expression and is not a mere guise or pretense
utilized to exploit the conduct of being nude for profit or commercial gain
(see, Board of City Commissioners v. Dexterhouse, 348 So. 2d 916 (Fla. 2nd DCA
1977)), and as such is protected by the United States Constitution or Florida
Constitution; or
         (b)   It is otherwise protected by the United States Constitution or
Florida Constitution.

§ 102.99 PENALTY.

jurisdiction of misdemeanors by the prosecuting attorney thereof and, upon
conviction, shall be punished by a fine not to exceed five hundred ($500.00)
dollars or by imprisonment not to exceed sixty (60) days or by both such fine
and imprisonment as provided in Florida Statutes or other applicable law. Each
incident or separate occurrence of an act that violates §§
102.01 through
102.07 shall be deemed a separate offense.

§ 106.05 FEE TO BE IMPOSED ON IMPACT GENERATING LAND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY.
   (A)   Fee obligation at commencement of land development activity; fee
determined and paid at issuance of building permit.
      (1)   After the effective date of this subchapter, any person who shall
commence any impact-generating land development activity as herein defined
shall be obligated to pay an impact fee upon the commencement of such land
development activity. The fee shall be determined and paid to the city at the
time of issuance of a building permit for the development. If the building
permit is for less than the entire development, the fee shall be computed
separately for the amount of development covered by the permit. If the fee is
exacted for impact generating land development activity that increases impact
because of a change or increase in use, the fee shall be determined by
computing the difference in the fee schedule between the new land development
activity and the existing land development activity.
      (2)   Any developer who prior to the effective date of this subchapter
agreed as a condition of development approval to pay impact fees, shall be
responsible for the payment of the fees under the terms of such agreement and
the payment of such fees by the developer will be offset against any impact
fees otherwise due at later stages of the land development activity for which
the fee was paid. Any portion of impact fees agreed to be paid pursuant to a
prior agreement that is greater than the fee established in this subchapter
shall be refunded.
      (3)   Any land or facilities agreed to be dedicated to the city as a
condition of development approval shall be dedicated by either easement or
deed, at the discretion of the City Manager, no later than the time of building
permit issuance.
   (B)   Fee agreement providing for payment of fee. At any time prior to
issuance of a building permit, the owner of property may enter into a fee
agreement with the city providing for a credit or payment of the fee pursuant
to the terms of this subchapter.
   (C)   Establishment of fee schedule.
      (1)   Any person who shall initiate any new impact-generating land
development activity, except those preparing an individual assessment of fiscal
impact or those receiving an interpretation of the impact of their proposed
land development activity shall pay an impact. Impact fees shall be established
by the City Council by resolution.
      (2)   If a building permit is requested for mixed uses, then the fee
shall be determined according to the impact fee schedule within the resolution
by apportioning the space committed to uses specified on the schedule.
      (3)   Biannually, and at the same time the City Council reviews the
budget and capital improvement element of the Palm Bay Comprehensive Plan, the
City Manager shall recommend to the City Council whether any changes should be
made to the impact fee schedule to reflect changes in the factors that affect
the fee schedule. The purpose of this review is to analyze the effects of
inflation on the actual costs of facilities and to insure that the fee charged
new impact generating land development activity will not exceed its pro rata
share for the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of facilities necessitated
by its presence.
(Ord. 2024-40, passed 9-19-24)
§ 106.06 INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT OF FISCAL IMPACT.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   The impact fee shall be computed by the use of an individual
assessment of fiscal impact if:
         (a)   The type of land development being commenced is not one of those
types listed on the fee schedule in §
106.05(C); or
         (b)   The feepayer chooses to have the amount of the fee determined by
the use of an individual assessment of fiscal impact; or
         (c)   The city staff's analysis of the proposed land development
activity concludes that the nature, timing or location of the proposed
development makes it likely to generate impacts costing substantially more to
remediate than the amount of the fee that would be generated by the use of the
fee schedule.
      (2)   The developer shall be responsible for preparation of the
individual assessment of fiscal impact if the developer chooses to conduct the
analysis. The City Manager shall be responsible for preparation of the
individual assessment of fiscal impact if the type of land development being
proposed is interpreted not to be one of those types listed in the fee schedule
or analysis of the proposed land development activity concludes that the
nature, timing or location of the proposed development make it likely to
generate impacts costing substantially more than the amount of the fee
generated by the use of the fee schedule. The person who prepares the
individual assessment of fiscal impact shall be a qualified professional in the
preparation of impact analysis and shall be approved by the City Manager on the
basis of professional training and experience. If the City Manager is
responsible for preparation of the assessment, the City Manager may request the
developer to prepare the individual assessment of fiscal impact, and credit the
cost for such preparation against the impact fee.
   (B)   Park component. The individual assessment of fiscal impact for the
park component shall determine if the proposed land development activity is
designed or located so that the occupants of the development will use capital
park facilities less than that projected in the park component.
   (C)   Police component. The individual assessment of fiscal impact for the
police component shall determine if the proposed land development activity is
designed or located so that the development will not demand the use of capital
police facilities from that projected in the police component.
   (D)   Fire component. The individual assessment of fiscal impact for the
fire component shall determine if the proposed land development activity is
designed or located so that the development will not demand the use of capital
fire facilities other than that projected in the fire component.
   (E)   Procedure for review of application for assessment of fiscal impact.
      (1)   An individual assessment of fiscal impact shall be undertaken
through the submission of an application of assessment of fiscal impact for the
facility component for which an assessment is requested. A developer may submit
such an application at his discretion. The city shall submit such an
application for any proposed land development activity interpreted as not one
of those types listed on the fee schedule, and for any proposed land
development activity for which it concludes the nature, timing, or location of
the proposed development make it likely to generate impacts costing
substantially more to remediate than the amount of the fee that would be
generated by the use of the fee schedule.
      (2)   Within twenty (20) days of receipt of an application of assessment
of fiscal impact, the City Manager shall determine if the application is
complete. If the City Manager determines that the application is not complete,
a written statement specifying the deficiencies shall be mailed to the person
submitting the application. The application shall be deemed complete if no
deficiencies are specified. The City Manager shall take no further action on
the application until it is deemed complete.
      (3)   When the City Manager determines the application is complete, a
written decision shall be rendered in thirty (30) days on whether the fee
should be modified, and if so, what the amount should be.
      (4)   If on the basis of generally recognized principles of impact
analysis it is determined the data, information and assumptions used by the
applicant to calculate the assessment of fiscal impact for either the park,
police or fire component satisfies the requirements of this section, the fee
determined in the assessment of fiscal impact shall be deemed the fee due and
owing for the proposed land development activity. The adjustment shall be set
forth in a fee agreement which shall be entered into pursuant to § 
106.05(B).
   (F)   Appeal of decision on application of assessment of fiscal impact. Any
person may appeal the City Manager's decision on the applicant's application
for assessment of fiscal impact, or on an application for assessment of fiscal
impact initiated by the city staff on any proposed land development activity,
by filing a petition with the City Council. In reviewing the City Manager's
decision, the City Council shall make written findings of fact and conclusions
of law and use the standards established in divisions (B) through (D) above,
whichever is applicable.
(Ord. 2024-40, passed 9-19-24)
§ 106.07 CREDITS; EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   Any person who shall initiate any impact-generating land
development activity may apply for a credit against any fee for capital park,
police or fire facility impacts proposed to be paid pursuant to the provisions
of this subchapter for any contribution, payment, construction, or dedication
of land accepted and received by the city for capital park, police or fire
facilities, as defined in § 106.03, including any contribution, payment,
construction or dedication made pursuant to a development order issued by the
city pursuant to its local development regulations, F.S. § 380.06, or any
additional development requirement imposed by the Florida Land and Water
Adjudicatory Commission on a development of regional impact.
      (2)   Credit for contributions, payments, construction or dedications of
an impact fee component shall not be transferable to another component. Credit
shall be transferable within the same component and within the same
development. No credit shall be greater than the fee imposed for the land
development.
   (B)   Credit for park component.  For any credit against any park fee
proposed to be paid, the contribution, payment, construction or dedication
shall be credited for one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value for

facility identified as part of the parks and open space element of the Palm Bay
Comprehensive Plan and determined by the city to be needed for expansion of its
park capital facilities.
   (C)   Credit for police component. For any credit against any police fee to

City Manager shall send a written statement to the applicant outlining the
deficiencies. The City Manager shall take no further action on the proposed
application for credit agreement until all deficiencies have been corrected or
otherwise settled.
      (3)   Once the City Manager determines the proposed application for

(20) days if it meets the standards set forth in section §
106.08(B) through (F), whichever is applicable.
      (4)   If the application for credit agreement is approved by the City
Manager, a credit agreement shall be prepared and signed by the applicant and

(Ord. 2024-40, passed 9-19-24)
§ 106.08 USE OF FUNDS.
   (A)   Intent. Any fees collected under this subchapter are expressly
designated for the accommodation of impacts reasonably attributable to the
proposed development as hereinafter provided in this section.
   (B)   Establishment of trust fund and trust accounts.  The Palm Bay Impact
Fee Trust Fund is established for the purpose of ensuring that the fees
collected pursuant to this subchapter are designated for the accommodation of
impacts reasonably attributable to the proposed land development activity. The
impact fee trust fund shall be divided into three (3) trust accounts, one (1)
for the park component, one (1) for the police component and one (1) for the
fire component.
   (C)   Expenditure of fees in trust accounts.
      (1)   Park impact component.
         (a)   Proceeds collected from the community park impact component of
the fee and all interest accrued on such funds shall be used for capital park
facilities, within the city. In locating and constructing park capital
facilities, the city shall be guided by the standards of the Palm Bay
Comprehensive Plan.
         (b)   Proceeds collected from the urban district impact component of
the fee and all interest accrued on such funds shall be used for urban district
park capital facilities within the city.

fire capital facilities within the city.
      (4)   Proceeds collected from the parks, police and fire impact component
of the fee and all interest accrued on such funds may also be used for periodic
engineering and planning studies to update the fee structure as may be required
from time to time.
   (D)   Investment of fees in interest bearing accounts. Any proceeds in each
of the trust accounts on deposit, not immediately necessary for expenditure,
shall be invested in interest bearing assets. All income derived from these
investments shall be retained in the applicable trust account.
   (E)   Annual recommendation for expenditure of fees. At least once each year
the City Manager or his designee shall propose appropriations to be spent from
the individual trust accounts to the City Council. After review of the City
Manager's recommendation, the City Council shall either approve, modify, or
deny the recommended expenditures of the trust account monies. Any amounts not
appropriated from the trust accounts together with any interest earnings shall
be carried over in the specific trust account to the following fiscal period.
   (F)   Return of fees if not spent for capital improvements.
      (1)   Any fees collected shall be returned to the feepayer or his
successor in interest if the fees have not been spent within seven (7) years
from the date the building permit for the development was issued, along with
interest of six (6%) percent a year. Provided, however, that the City Council
may by resolution extend for up to three (3) years the date at which fees must
be refunded. Such an extension shall be made upon a finding that within such
three (3) year period, specific capital improvements are planned and evidenced
by the adoption and incorporation into the city's comprehensive plan, that
these capital improvements shall be constructed within the next three (3)
years, that these improvements are reasonably attributable to the feepayer's
land development activity, and that the fees whose time of refund is extended
shall be spent for these capital improvements. Fees shall be deemed to be spent
on the basis of the first fee collected shall be the first fee spent.
      (2)   The refund of fees shall be undertaken through the following
process:
         (a)   A refund application shall be submitted within one (1) year
following the end of the sixth year from the date on which the building permit
was issued on the proposed development. If the time of refund has been extended
pursuant to this division (F), the refund application shall be submitted within
one (1) year following the end of this extension.
         (b)   The refund application shall include the following information:
            1.   A copy of the dated receipt issued for payment of the fee;
            2.   A copy of the building permit;

of the fee; and if applicable;
            4.   Evidence that the applicant is the successor in interest to
the feepayer.
      (3)   Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the refund application, the
City Manager shall determine if it is complete. If the City Manager determines
the application is not complete, a written statement specifying the
deficiencies shall be mailed to the person submitting the application. Unless
the deficiencies are corrected, the City Manager shall take no further action
on the refund application.
      (4)   When the City Manager determines the refund application is
complete, the refund shall be approved within thirty (30) days if it is
determined the feepayer or any successor in interest has paid a fee that the
city has not spent within the period of time permitted under this section. The
refund shall include the fee paid plus interest of six (6%) percent a year.
      (5)   Any feepayer, or any successor in interest, may appeal the decision

§ 106.20 AUTHORITY AND APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   The City Council has the authority to adopt this subchapter pursuant
to Fla. Const. Art VIII, F.S. Ch. 166 and §§ 163.3201, 163.3202, and 380.06
(16).
   (B)   This subchapter shall apply to all lands within the municipal
boundaries of the city.
(Ord. 2024-40, passed 9-19-24)
§ 106.21 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   Planning for the necessary capacity expansion of the city's major
transportation system to ensure the safety and efficiency of the city's roads
and to provide for the health, safety, welfare, and economic well-being of the
citizens of the city is the mandated responsibility of the city pursuant to
F.S. §§ 163.3161 et seq., the Florida Local Government Comprehensive Planning
and Land Development Regulation Act, and F.S. §§ 166.011 et seq., the Municipal
Home Rule Powers Act.
   (B)   This subchapter is intended to implement and be consistent with the
city comprehensive plan adopted pursuant to F.S. §§ 163.3161 et seq., the
Florida Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation
Act.
   (C)   This objective is accomplished by requiring all new land development
activity generating traffic that places additional demand on the major
transportation system to contribute its proportionate share of the funds, land,
or public facilities to accommodate any transportation impacts having a
rational nexus to the proposed development and for which the need is reasonably
attributable to the proposed development.
   (D)   It is not the purpose of this subchapter for the city to collect any
funds, land or public facilities from new land development activity generating
traffic in excess of the actual amount necessary to offset the increased demand
on the major transportation system generated by the new land development
activity generating traffic. This subchapter is intended to be consistent with
the principles for allocating a fair share of the cost of the new public
facilities to new users as established in Contractors and Builders Association
of Pinellas County v. City of Dunedin, 324 So. 2d 314 (Fla. 1976), and
Homebuilders and Contractors Association of Palm Beach County v. Palm Beach
County, 446 So. 2d 140 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983).

§ 106.24 FEE TO BE IMPOSED ON LAND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY GENERATING TRAFFIC.
   (A)   Fee determined and paid at issuance of building permit.
      (1)   After the effective date of this subchapter, any person who shall
commence any land development activity generating traffic that creates an
increased demand on the major road network system shall be obligated to pay a
fair share transportation facilities impact fee upon the commencement of such
land development activity generating traffic in the manner and the amount set
forth herein. The impact fee shall be determined and paid to the city at the
time of issuance of a building permit for the development unless otherwise
provided herein. No building permit shall be final until any applicable impact
fee has been paid and the development complies with all provisions of this code
of ordinances. If the building permit is for less than the entire development,
the impact fee shall be computed separately for the amount of development
covered by the building permit. The obligation to pay the impact fee shall run
with the land. If the impact fee is due to be paid for land development
activity generating traffic that increases the impact because of a change or
increase in use, the impact fee shall be determined by computing the difference
in the fee schedule between the new land development activity generating
traffic and the existing land development activity.
         (a)   Agreement in lieu of payment.
            1.   In lieu of payment at the time of issuance of the building
permit, non-residential, mixed use and multi-family land development activity
may defer payment until the time of the certificate of occupancy, providing
such payment is guaranteed through the execution of an Impact Fee Payment
Agreement. In this case, the city will not issue the Certificate of Occupancy
until the impact fee due has been paid.
            2.   The developer shall be required to pay the impact fee rates
applicable at the time the payment is made.
         (b)   Shell building. In those instances where a developer has
constructed a non-residential shell building, the payment may be deferred until
the time of occupancy or three (3) years from the date of the Certificate of
Occupancy, whichever comes first, providing such payment is guaranteed through
the execution of an Impact Fee Payment Agreement.
         (c)   Economic development incentives. The City Council may, by
resolution, establish criteria for impact fee mitigation.
         (d)   Early payment. Payments made in full prior to issuance of a
building permit may be made. Such payment amount shall be calculated based on
the applicable fees effective at the time of payment. Fee increases following
such payment shall not be retroactive for the project paying such fees. Any
differential due at building permit issuance because of change in use or size
of the project shall be calculated at the time of permit issuance. Such early
payments are not subject to refund but may be credited to the land for a future
project.
      (2)   Any developer who, prior to the effective date of this subchapter,
agreed as a condition of development approval to pay city transportation impact
fees, shall be responsible for the payment of the impact fees under the terms
of such agreement, and the payment of such impact fees by the developer to the
city will be offset against any transportation impact fees otherwise due at
later stages of the land development activity for which the impact fee was
paid. Any portion of transportation impact fees agreed to be paid to the city
pursuant to a prior agreement that are greater than the impact fee established
in this subchapter shall be refunded.
      (3)   Any traffic-related land agreed to be dedicated to the city as a
condition of development approval shall be dedicated by either easement deed or
warranty deed, at the option of the city, no later than the time of building
permit issuance, and shall be eligible for a credit in accordance with the
provisions of §
106.07.
   (B)   Fee agreement providing for credit towards the payment of fee. At any
time prior to issuance of a building permit, the developer may enter into a fee
agreement with the city providing for a credit towards the payment of the
impact fee pursuant to the terms of this chapter.
   (C)   Establishment of fee schedule.
      (1)   Any developer who is issued a building permit, except those
preparing an individual traffic impact analyses of their proposed land
development activity, shall pay an impact fee. Impact fees shall be established
by the City Council by resolution.
      (2)   Biannually, and at the same time the City Council reviews the
budget and capital improvement element of the city comprehensive plan, the City
Manager or his designee shall recommend to the City Council whether any changes
should be made to the impact fee schedule to reflect changes in the factors
that affect the impact fee schedule. The purpose of this review is to insure
that the impact fee charged of new land development activity generating traffic
will not exceed its pro rata share for the reasonably anticipated expansion
costs of transportation facilities necessitated by its presence.
(Ord. 2024-40, passed 9-19-24)
§ 106.25 INDIVIDUAL TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   The impact fee shall be computed by the use of an individual
traffic impact analysis of land development activity generating traffic on the
major road network system, if:
         (a)   The type of land development being commenced is not one of those
types listed on the impact fee scheduled in §
106.05(C); or
         (b)   The feepayer chooses to have the amount of the impact fee
determined by the use of an individual traffic impact analysis; or
         (c)   The city's analysis concludes that the proposed development is
likely to generate impacts costing more to remediate than the amount of the
impact fee established by the impact fee schedule.
      (2)   The developer shall be responsible to prepare the individual
traffic impact analysis if the developer chooses to conduct the analysis. The
city shall prepare the individual traffic impact analysis if the proposed
development is interpreted not to be one listed in the impact fee schedule or
if the analysis of the proposed development concludes that it is likely to
generate impacts costing substantially more than the amount of the impact fee
established by the impact fee schedule. The person who prepares such analysis
shall be a qualified professional in the preparation of impact analysis and
shall be approved by the City Manager or his designee on the basis of
professional training and experience. If the city is responsible to prepare the
individual traffic impact analysis, it may require the developer to prepare it
and credit the cost of such preparation against the impact fee. If the city
pays such cost, it shall be deducted from the cost of the developer's impact
fee.
   (B)   Procedure for review of application for traffic impact analyses.
      (1)   The individual traffic impact analysis shall be undertaken through
the submission of an application of traffic impact analysis which shall include
the following information:
         (a)   The projected trip generation rates for the proposed land
development activity. Trip generation rates shall be assessed on an average
daily trip. The trip generation rates shall be based upon either local
empirical surveys of trip generation rates for the same or similar land use
types or state or national trip generation rate information, if applicable; and
         (b)   The proposed trip length of the trips generated from the
proposed land development activity onto the major road network system. Trip
length information shall be based upon local empirical surveys of similar land
use types or trip length data compiled by the City Manager or his designee for
average trip length for similar land use types; and
         (c)   The proposed percentage of new trips on the major road network
system which are generated by the proposed land development activity. The
percentage of new trips shall be based upon local empirical surveys of similar
land use types or state or national percentage of new trips information if
applicable or other reliable percentage of new trips information acceptable to
the City Manager, if applicable; and
         (d)   An assessment of the capital expansion of the major road network
system necessitated by the proposed land development activity if it is to be
maintained at level of service C on an average annual basis. Practices and
methodological procedures generally accepted in the transportation planning and
engineering profession acceptable by the City Manager or his designee shall be
used to determine the capital expansion of the major road network system
necessitated by the proposed land development activity; and
         (e)   An assessment of the costs for providing the capital expansion
necessitated by the proposed land development activity. The cost figures used
shall be based upon recent empirical information of the costs in the city for
the construction of a lane mile and shall include related right-of-way costs,
and the planning, design, and engineering costs for the necessary capital
improvements; and
         (f)   An assessment of the projected gas and license tax revenues or
any other revenues that will be derived from the proposed land development
activity that can be reasonably determined to be available to pay for new
capital improvements to the major road network system over the planning
horizon; and
         (g)   The amount of any shortfall between the projected gas, license
tax, any other revenues, and the capital expansion costs for the major road
network system necessitated by the new land development activity generating
traffic. Any shortfall shall be considered the proposed fair share
transportation facilities impact fee for the proposed land development
activity.
      (2)   Within twenty (20) days of receipt of an application of traffic
impact analysis or a revised application, the City Manager or designee shall
determine if it is complete. If the City Manager or designee determines that an
application or revised application is not complete, they shall send a written
statement specifying the deficiencies by mail to the person submitting the
application. Unless the deficiencies are corrected, the City Manager or
designee shall take no further action on the traffic impact analysis.
      (3)   When the City Manager or his designee determines the application is
complete, within thirty (30) days he shall review it and render a written
report indicating whether the fee stated in §
106.05(C) is to be varied to accommodate the activity generated by the proposed
development.
      (4)   If, on the basis of generally accepted principles of traffic
engineering, it is determined in the traffic impact analysis that the city's
cost to accommodate the proposed land development activity is substantially
different than the fee stated in §
106.05(C), the amount of the fair share transportation facilities impact fee
shall be varied from that established in the impact fee schedule to an amount
consistent with the amount determined in the traffic impact analysis.
   (C)   Appeal of decision on application of traffic impact analysis. Any
developer submitting an application for traffic impact analysis may appeal the
City Manager's findings in the report submitted pursuant to subsection (B)(3)
above, by filing a petition together with a thirty dollar ($30.00) application
fee with the City Council within thirty (30) days of the decision by the City
Manager. In reviewing the City Manager's findings, the City Council shall, at a
public hearing held within sixty (60) days from the date of the application,
make written findings of fact and conclusions of law based upon the standards
established in division (B) above.

§ 106.27 IMPACT FEE DISTRICT.
   There is established one (1) impact fee district which encompasses and is
equal to the municipal boundaries of the city.
(Ord. 2024-40, passed 9-19-24)
§ 106.28 USE OF FUNDS.
   (A)   Intent. Any impact fees collected under this chapter are expressly
designated for the accommodation of impacts reasonably attributable to the
increased demand of proposed land development activity generating traffic as
hereinafter provided in this section.
   (B)   Administrative costs. The city shall be entitled to actual
administrative costs not to exceed two percent (2%) of the funds collected as
compensation for the administrative expense of collecting and administering
these impact fee regulations. All remaining funds collected from impact fees
shall be deposited into the fair share transportation facilities impact fee
trust fund.
   (C)   Establishment of trust fund. There is established the Palm Bay Fair
Share Transportation Facilities Impact Fee Trust Fund for the purpose of
insuring that the impact fees collected pursuant to this subchapter are
designated for the accommodation of impacts reasonably attributable to the
proposed land development activity generating traffic.
   (D)   Expenditure of fees in trust fund. Proceeds from the trust fund and
interest accrued on such fund shall be used for capital expansion of the major
road network system and in a manner consistent with the city comprehensive
plan. Proceeds collected from the trust fund and all interest accrued on such
funds may also be used for periodic engineering and planning studies to update
the fee structure as may be required from time to time.
   (E)   Investment of fees in interest bearing accounts.  Any funds in the
trust fund on deposit, not immediately necessary for expenditure, shall be
invested in interest bearing accounts. All income derived from these
investments shall be retained in the trust fund. These monies shall be utilized
for the capital expansion of the major road network system.
   (F)   Annual recommendation for expenditure of fees. At least once a year,
at the time the annual city budget is reviewed, the City Manager shall propose
to the City Council appropriations to be spent from the trust fund. After
review of the City Manager's recommendation, the City Council shall either
approve, modify, or deny the recommended expenditures of the trust fund monies
for road improvements. Any amounts not appropriated from the trust fund
together with any interest earnings shall be carried over in the trust fund to
the next review period.
   (G)   Return of fees if not spent for capital improvements.
      (1)   Any impact fees collected shall be returned to the feepayer or his
successor in interest if the impact fees have not been spent within seven (7)
years from the date the building permit for the development was issued, along
with interest of six (6%) percent a year; except that the city shall retain
three (3%) percent of the fee to offset the costs of refunding. The City
Council may, by resolution, extend for up to three (3) years the date at which
fees must be refunded. Such an extension shall be made upon a finding that
within such three (3) year period, specific capital improvements are planned
and evidenced by the adoption and incorporation into the city's comprehensive
plan that these capital improvements shall be constructed within the next three
(3) years, that these improvements are reasonably attributable to the
feepayer's land development activity generating traffic, and that the impact
fees which time of refund is extended shall be spent for these capital
improvements. Impact fees shall be deemed to be spent on the basis of the first
impact fee collected shall be the first impact fee spent. The refund of impact
fees shall be undertaken through the following process:
         (a)   A refund application shall be submitted within one (1) year
following the end of the seven (7) years from the date on which the building
permit was issued on the proposed development. If the time of refund has been
extended pursuant to division (1) above, the refund application shall be
submitted within one (1) year following the end of this extension.
         (b)   The refund application shall include the following information:
            1.   A copy of the dated receipt issued for payment of the fee;
            2.   A copy of the building permit; and, if applicable;
            3.   Evidence that the applicant is the successor in interest to
the feepayer.
      (2)   Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the refund application, the
City Manager or designee shall determine if it is complete. If the City Manager
or designee determines the application is not incomplete, a written statement
specifying the deficiencies shall be mailed to the person submitting the
application. Unless the deficiencies are corrected, the City Manager or
designee shall take no further action on the refund application.
      (3)   When the City Manager or designee determines the refund application
is complete, the refund shall be approved within thirty (30) days if it is
determined the feepayer or any successor in interest has paid an impact fee
that the city has not spent within the period of time permitted under this
section. The refund shall include the impact fee paid plus interest of six (6%)
percent a year less the three (3%) percent administrative fee.
      (4)   Any feepayer or any successor in interest may appeal the decision
of a refund application by filing a petition with the City Council within
thirty (30) days of the decision. In reviewing the City Manager's decision, the
City Council shall use the standards established in division (G)(1)(a) above.
   (H)   Refund of impact fees paid upon non-commencement of development
activity.
      (1)   Any impact fees collected shall be returned to the feepayer or his
successor in interest if the developer so requests and upon cancellation of all
building permits. Such refund shall not include interest earned and a three
(3%) percent administrative fee shall be retained by the city. Impact fees may
be refunded for a period up to two (2) years from payment date. After that
period, no refunds can be requested.

(Ord. 2024-40, passed 9-19-24)
WATER AND WASTEWATER IMPACT FEES
§ 106.40 WATER AND WASTEWATER IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Adoption. The city hereby adopts and establishes pursuant to general
law, a water capital charge, and a wastewater capital charge as set forth in
division (A)(1) herein below, the purpose of which will be to finance capital
expenditures and the payment of city indebtedness associated with the expansion
of the city's water supply, treatment and transmission system, the wastewater
transmission, treatment, and effluent disposal system, and the reclaimed
treatment and transmission system.
      (1)   Implementation. The amount of each capital charge per equivalent
residential connection (ERC) shall be effective October 1, 2024, as follows:
 
Date         Water Capital Charge Wastewater Capital Charge
Oct. 1, 2024 $2,561.00            $3,300.00
 
   (B)   Applicability. Except for those customers who have previously paid
plant capacity charges to the previous owner of the utility and having
previously been connected to the system, the capital charges set forth herein
shall be paid by those new customers who (1) connect to said system; (2)
request service from the city; or (3) request an increase in water or
wastewater service capacity. The city may exempt any customer from the payment
of all or a portion of the water and wastewater capital charges to the extent
that the city accepts a permanent contribution in aid of construction related
to the water supply, treatment or transmission facilities or the wastewater
transmission, treatment, or effluent disposal facilities having a value of not
less than the portion of the water or wastewater capital charges being
exempted.
   (C)   Time of payment. All water and wastewater capital charges shall be
paid prior to connection of a structure or structures to be served by the city,
or such other time as may be specifically provided by city resolution, by city
ordinance, by agreement, or permit; provided, however, that the city may permit
installment payments for owners of existing single-family residences where
utility services are available for any water, or wastewater capital charges,
and main line extension charges upon such terms and conditions as the city
deems appropriate. Installment payments shall be paid in accordance with an
Installment Payment Agreement approved by the city and such Installment Payment
Agreement shall be and constitute a lien against the premises and shall become
effective and binding as a lien from the date the owner of the property and the
city enter into the said Installment Payment Agreement, such lien shall remain
a lien co-equal with the lien of all state, county, district and municipal
taxes, superior in dignity to all other liens, titles and claims, until paid
and shall bear interest annually at a rate not to exceed the legal rate allowed
for such liens and may be foreclosed pursuant to the procedure set forth in
F.S. Ch. 173. Furthermore, the balance due on any such installment agreement
shall become immediately due and payable upon the sale or transfer of interest
of the property by the customer to any other person or entity or upon
refinancing of the property. For the purposes of this chapter, transfer of
interest shall be defined as set forth in any Installment Payment Agreement
entered into pursuant to this chapter.
      (1)   When the utility applicant is not required to obtain a State of
Florida Department of Environmental Protection permit to connect proposed
water, wastewater, or reuse water treatment or transmission facilities to the
city's utility system, all utility charges and fees shall be paid at or before
the time of application for water, wastewater, or reuse service.
      (2)   When the applicant must obtain a Florida Department of
Environmental Protection permit to connect proposed facilities to the utility
system for a residential project equal to or greater than one hundred (100)
equivalent residential connections (ERCs), a payment in an amount equal to
twenty-five (25%) percent of the amount of capital connection charges as set
forth by City Code attributable to a proposed development to be ultimately
constructed shall be payable to the city within thirty (30) days after final
approval of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection application. In
the event a permit application is denied by the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection, the city shall, upon request of the applicant, refund
only the capital connection charges paid by the applicant for the denied permit
application. If a valid Department of Environmental Protection permit expires
prior to construction of the utility system and acceptance of conveyance
thereof by the city, or if a permit has expired, then the applicant shall be
entitled to a refund less a five (5%) percent administrative fee based on total
funds paid to the city. The city shall not be further obligated to the
applicant or the applicant's heirs, assigns or successors to provide the
utility capacity. Additionally, upon denial or expiration of a permit, and upon
request of the applicant, all bonds or letters of credit posted hereunder shall
be released by the city. The remainder seventy-five (75%) percent of all fees
and charges due the city for connecting the development to the utility system
is due and payable within five (5) business days after final plat approval by
the city. Residential projects of less than one hundred (100) equivalent
residential connections shall be exempt from the previously stated requirement.
      (3)   The city shall be entitled to recover all costs, including but not
limited to reasonable attorney's fees or collection service charges, incurred
in collecting delinquent utility fees and charges. Any fee or charge due under
this section which shall not be paid when due may be recovered by referring the
account to a third-party collection agency or by bringing an action at law.
      (4)   Commitments and permits are not transferable or negotiable for
properties other than as shown on the original application approved by the
city.
      (5)   No building permit shall be issued prior to the receipt of all
utility capital connection fees and charges, or such other time as may be
specifically provided for by ordinance, resolution, or agreement.
   (D)   Determination of equivalent residential connection factors for water
and wastewater services.
      (1)   For purposes of calculating and imposing the water and wastewater
capital charge provided for in this subsection, the ERC factor for any
particular connection shall be calculated and imposed in the manner provided as
follows:

      (2)   One equivalent residential connection (ERC) shall, for purposes of
this section, have an assigned value of 1.00. For wastewater service capacity,
one ERC is hereby established and determined to be equal to a flow of 210
gallons per day, average annual basis (210 GPD), or such other value as may be
later, approved or determined by the Florida Department of Environmental
Regulation.
      (3)   For water service capacity, one ERC is hereby established and
determined to be equal to a flow of two hundred twenty-five (225) gallons per
day, average annual basis (225 GPD).
      (4)   The "total equivalent residential connection value" for an
establishment shall be calculated by multiplying the ERC factor listed above by
the number of units. The minimum ERC factor for each non-residential
establishment shall be one (1).
      (5)   For all establishments not listed above, the total wastewater
equivalent residential connection (ERC) value for wastewater service capacity
shall be determined by multiplying the number of fixture units, as published in
the Standard Plumbing Code, by fifteen (15), and then dividing that numerator
by two hundred ten (210). For example:
         Total Wastewater ERC Value =
         Number of Fixture Units x 15
         210 GPD/ERC
         The wastewater capital charge shall be determined by using the
following formula:
         Total ERC Value x wastewater prevailing rate = wastewater capital
charge
      (6)   For all establishments not listed above, the total water equivalent
residential connection (ERC) value for water service capacity shall be
determined by multiplying the number of fixture units, as published in the
Standard Plumbing Code, by fifteen (15), and then dividing that numerator by
two hundred twenty-five (225). For example:
         Total ERC Value =
         Number of Fixture Units x 15
         225 GPD/ERC
         The water capital charge shall be determined by using the following
formula:
         Total ERC Value x water prevailing rate = water capital charge
      (7)   Connections that have not paid the wastewater capital charge and
are not specifically exempt from paying the wastewater capital charge are
required to pay a wastewater capital charge recovery usage component. The
wastewater capital charge recovery usage component shall be the rate as set
forth in Table 1 below per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water metered for
wastewater billing purposes. These charges will continue to be paid until such
time that the wastewater capital charges in effect at time of connection to the
system are satisfied.
      (8)   Connections that have not paid the water capital charge and are not
specifically exempt from paying the water capital charge are required to pay a
water capital charge recovery usage component. The water capital charge
recovery usage component shall be the rate as set forth in Table 1 below per
one thousand (1,000) gallons of water metered for water billing purposes. These
charges will continue to be paid until such time that the water capital charges
in effect at time of connection to the system are satisfied.
      (9)   The amount of each capital charge recovery usage component shall be
effective January 1, 2021, as follows:
 
Date            Water Capital Charge Recovery Wastewater Capital Charge
                Usage Component               Recovery Usage Component
January 1, 2021 $1.28                         $1.94
 
      (10)   The above ERC Schedule applies to establishments being connected
to the City of Palm Bay Utilities Water and Wastewater System.
   (E)   Capital improvement funds; establishment; expenditure guidelines;
application and pledge to revenue bonds.
      (1)   The water and water with reclaimed water capital charges and
capital charge recovery usage components collected pursuant to this tariff
shall be deposited into a fund called the "Connection Fee Fund". The wastewater
and wastewater with reclaimed water capital charges and capital charge recovery
usage component shall likewise be deposited into a fund called the "Connection
Fee Fund." The water and water with reclaimed water capital charges and capital
charge recovery usage component so deposited shall be used only for the
acquisition of the city's water system and all components thereof and additions
thereto, and the construction and acquisition of additions and extensions to
the city's water system and all components thereof including raw water supply
facilities, transmission facilities, mains, ground storage facilities, new
pumping facilities, water treatment plants, and distribution facilities in
order to provide additional water treatment capacity or water service capacity
to those new customers who connect to the city's water system. The wastewater
and wastewater with reclaimed water capital charges and capital charge recovery
usage component so deposited in the above-mentioned fund shall be used only for
the acquisition of the city's wastewater system and all components thereof and
additions thereto, and the construction and acquisition of additions and
extensions to the city's wastewater system and all components thereof,
including collection facilities, transmission facilities, treatment facilities,
and effluent disposal facilities, in order to provide additional sewage
treatment capacity, effluent disposal capacity, or wastewater service capacity
to those new customers who connect to the city's wastewater system. The
reclaimed water capital charges and capital charge recovery usage components
collected pursuant to this Tariff shall be deposited into a fund called the
"Connection Fee Fund." The reclaimed water capital charges and capital charge
recovery usage component so deposited shall be used only for the acquisition of
the city's reclaimed system and all components thereof and additions thereto,
and the construction and acquisition of additions and extensions to the city's
reclaimed system and all components thereof including filtration facilities,
disinfection facilities, storage tanks, transmission facilities, mains, remote
storage facilities, new pumping facilities, and distribution facilities in
order to provide additional reclaimed treatment capacity or reclaimed service
capacity to those new customers who connect to the city's reclaimed system.
      (2)   The city may by resolution provide for the application of some or
all of the water, wastewater, or reclaimed water capital charges to the payment
or security for the payment of revenue bonds issued in whole or in part for the
purpose set out in division (E)(1) hereof, provided that the amount of water or
wastewater capital charges applied to the payment of such bonds shall not
exceed the amount of bond proceeds actually expended for such purpose with
interest at the average rate borne by said bonds.
Such application or pledge may be made directly in the proceedings authorizing
such bonds or in an agreement with an insurer of bonds to assure such insurer
of additional security there for.
   (F)   Application; allocation of water or wastewater service capacity. The
city may require all information on said application that it deems reasonable
and necessary and may reject applications it determines are incomplete. Any
application for water or wastewater service shall contain a legal description
of the land constituting the service area for which the said permit is to be
issued. The legal description shall include only those lands owned by the
applicant for which the water or wastewater developer's agreement is to serve.
If any such person described hereinabove fails to apply for and purchase water
and/or wastewater service capacity under these rules, the City Council may
consider said failure in determining whether to grant or deny any connection to
the system. The City Council shall by separate ordinance establish rules for
the allocation of water and/or wastewater service capacity and may by
resolution establish a fee for application review payable by applicants.

sales shall be deposited, within 24 hours of receipt from patrons, in a
separate bank account, used only by the charity for bingo funds. No credit or

members conducting the session, and the number of patrons present. The
remainder of the VHS video portion of the tape shall show the numbers being

the VHS recording, but after the end of the session, a designated member of the
charity must make an audio statement once again setting forth the date, name of
the charity, names of the designated members who conducted the session, the
number of patrons present, plus the number and amount of prizes awarded, and
the numbers of the checks used to pay prizes to patrons. Two of the designated
members must state on the audio portion of the VHS recording their names and a
statement that the information stated regarding their session is accurate. In
addition, those two designated members must sign-off before close of the
session as to the accuracy of the receipts, expenditures and all other
bookkeeping records relating to that session. Sign-off forms shall be as
prescribed by the city.
   (C)   All bookkeeping records, including, but not limited to, all the
written records, sign-off forms, bank statements, cancelled checks, check
books, duplicate receipts, deposit tickets and receipts, and all leases and
agreements shall be maintained on the premises of the bingo hall for a period
of no less than three years. All VHS tapes of the sessions must be labeled with

than $1,000 in any one week, may spend a maximum of 25% of the gross receipts,
less prizes which are attributable to sessions, for payment of authorized
expenses. In no event shall the charity expend bingo proceeds for any purpose
other than prizes attributable to such sessions and authorized expenses as
defined herein. All other bingo proceeds must be utilized for charitable
purposes by the charity. Charities permitted to conduct bingo in a bingo hall
with annual gross receipts of $52,000 or less per year and which do not have
gross receipts of over $1,000 in any one week, may deduct the actual cost of
authorized expenses and the amount of prizes attributable to sessions, with the

§ 110.59 FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS; BOOKKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.

accordance with generally-accepted accounting practices. Funds of for-profit
bingo organizations must be kept in a separate and distinct bank account with
the words “For-Profit Bingo Account - Palm Bay” in its name. No interested
party in for-profit bingo organizations, or any spouse, parent, relative to the
third degree, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law,
sibling or child of an interested party in for-profit bingo organizations may
be a designated member of any charity conducting bingo in a bingo hall. All
money received from any source by for-profit bingo organizations must be
deposited into the bank account within 24 hours of receipt. All authorized
expenditures made by for-profit bingo organizations shall be paid by pre-
printed, consecutively numbered checks written on the bank account of the for-
profit bingo organization. All checks written on the account must show the
legal name of the payee and the payee's social security or federal tax I.D.
number. All bookkeeping records, including, but not limited to, bank
statements, cancelled checks, check books, deposit tickets and receipts, and
all leases and agreements shall be maintained by the for-profit bingo
organizations on the premises of the bingo hall for a period of no less than
three years.
   (B)   Because it is the intent of the state law regulating bingo that all
profits from bingo operations are to go to charity, for-profit bingo
organizations must not charge for the rental or sale of property or equipment
or supplies any more than is ordinary and customary in the county area for the
sale or rental of property, equipment or supplies under similar circumstances.
Rental terms for equipment must be compared to long-term rentals rather than
short-term or transitory rentals, and because rental of property and equipment
is utilized by more than one charity in the bingo hall, the cost for rental of
property and equipment must be equitably divided among the various charities
operating within such bingo hall.
   (C)   All bookkeeping records of for-profit bingo organizations shall be
available for inspection, auditing and copying by the city and by state and
county law enforcement personnel at all times that the bingo hall is open for
business upon verbal request, or at any other time mutually agreed upon. In the
event an audit by a Florida Certified Public Accountant (CPA), designated by
the city, reveals charges to the charities in excess of those which are
ordinary and customary in the county area, as determined by such CPA, the for-
profit bingo organization shall equitably refund the difference to the
charities operating in the bingo hall. In the event a for-profit bingo
organization wishes to appeal the determination of the CPA, it may file a
notice of appeal with the City Clerk along with a certified audit by a CPA upon
which the for-profit bingo organization is basing its appeal. A hearing before
the City Council shall be held within 30 days of receipt by the City Clerk of
the notice of appeal and the certified audit. The city shall hire a third CPA
to review the audits previously performed and any other records deemed
appropriate by such CPA, and the city shall base the results of the appeal on
all the reports of the CPA presented to the city. If a not-profit bingo
operation wishes to appeal any determination made by the City Council under
this section, it may appeal such determination to the court of appropriate
jurisdiction in the county.

   (A)   If the city determines that it may not issue a permit to the applicant
under the provisions of this chapter, without specific authorization from the
City Council or under the provisions of §
110.61 relating to incomplete applications or applications not accompanied by
the required fee, the city shall notify the applicant by hand delivery or by
certified mail of the city's intention to deny the permit within 15 days after

and the reason(s) for the denial of the permit. The applicant shall have the
right to appeal the city's determination to deny the permit to the City Council
by filing with the City Clerk a notice of appeal within ten days of receipt by
applicant of notice of intent to deny. If an applicant appeals a determination
by the city to deny a permit based upon failure to submit a properly completed
application or for failure to submit the required fee, the City Council, within
15 days of such appeal, shall hold a hearing to determine whether such
application is sufficiently complete to comply with the requirements of §
110.61 and/or the required fee was submitted with such application. If the City
Council determines that such application is sufficiently complete to comply
with the requirements of §
110.61, and the required fee was submitted therewith, City Council shall direct

grant the applicant a specific time period, not to exceed 20 days, within which
to submit a properly completed application and/or submit the required fee.
   (B)   If an applicant appeals a determination by the city to deny a permit
or renewal of a permit based upon any grounds other than an incomplete
application or failure to submit the required fee, the City Council, within 15
days of such appeal, shall hold a hearing to determine whether issuance or
renewal of the permit would be detrimental to the public health, safety or
welfare. In determining whether issuance or renewal of the permit would be
detrimental to public health, safety or welfare, the City Council shall
consider whether the factor(s) which caused the city to not issue a permit
without specific authorization from the City Council are related to the bingo
operation or involvement by the Applicant or any interested party thereof in
bingo games and if such factor(s) evidence a disregard for the health, safety
or welfare of such applicant's or permittee's patrons, charities or employees,
or of persons residing or doing business nearby, or a disregard for or
violation of the financial constraints of this subchapter or of state law by
either the charity or the for-profit bingo organization. If the City Council
determines that a factor that caused the city to not issue a permit without
specific authorization from the City Council is related to the use, operation
or involvement by the applicant or an interested party thereof in the bingo
hall for which a permit application is made or the use or operation by the
applicant or an interested party thereof in any other bingo hall and that such
factor evidences a disregard for the health, safety or welfare of such bingo
hall's patrons, charities or employees or of persons residing or doing business

have the meanings ascribed to them, except where the context clearly indicates
a different meaning.

administer, control and review false alarm reduction efforts and administer the
provisions of this ordinance.
   ALARM COMPANY. A person subject to the licensing requirements, or a company
engaged in selling, leasing, installing, servicing or monitoring alarm systems.
This person shall be licensed in compliance with city, county and state laws.
   ALARM PERMIT. A permit issued by the City allowing the operation of an alarm
system within the City.
   ALARM SIGNAL. A detectable signal; audible or visual, generated by an alarm
system, to which law enforcement is requested to respond.
   ALARM SYSTEM. Any single device or assembly of equipment designed to signal
the occurrence of an illegal or unauthorized entry or other activity requiring
immediate attention and to which law enforcement is requested to respond, but
does not include motor vehicle or boat alarms, fire alarms, domestic violence
alarms, or alarms designed to elicit a medical response.
   ALARM USER. Any person, corporation, partnership, proprietorship,
governmental or educational entity or any other entity owning, leasing, or
operating an alarm system, or on whose premises an alarm system is maintained
for the protection of such premises.
   ALARM USER AWARENESS CLASS. A class conducted for the purpose of educating
Alarm Users about the responsible use, operation, and maintenance of alarm
systems and the problems created by false alarms.
   AUTOMATIC DIAL PROTECTION DEVICE. An automatic dialing device or an
automatic telephone dialing alarm system and shall include any system which,
upon being activated, automatically initiates to the Police Department a
recorded message or code signal indicating a need for law enforcement response.
   CANCELLATION. The process where response is terminated when the alarm
company (designated by the Alarm User) notifies the Police Department that
there is not an existing situation at the alarm site requiring police response

   FALSE ALARM. The activation of an alarm system through mechanical or
electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of
the Alarm User, his or her employees or agents, or signals activated to summon

location. An alarm is false within the meaning of this definition when, upon
inspection by the Police Department, evidence indicates that no unauthorized
entry, robbery, or other such crime was committed or attempted in or on the
premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a false alarm shall not include an alarm which
can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated by unusually
violent conditions of nature nor does it include other extraordinary
circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the Alarm User.

(ANSI) approved Security Industry Association (SIA) CP-01 Control Panel
Standard, as may be updated from time to time, that details recommended design
features for security system control panels and their associated arming and
disarming devices to reduce false alarms. Control panels built and tested to
this standard by a nationally recognized testing organization, will be marked
to state: "Design evaluated in accordance with SIA CP-01 Control Panel Standard
Features for False Alarm Reduction".
   VERIFY. An attempt by the monitoring company, or its representative, to
contact the alarm site and/or Alarm User by telephone and/or other electronic
means, whether or not actual contact with a person is made, to attempt to
determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law enforcement
dispatch, in an attempt to avoid an unnecessary alarm dispatch request. For the
purpose of this ordinance, telephone verification shall require as a minimum
that a second call, also known as Enhanced Call Verification, be made to a
different number if the first attempt fails to reach an Alarm User who can
properly identify themselves to attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is
valid before requesting law enforcement dispatch.

to grant or deny a permit for a special event on city-owned property, a special
event on non-city owned property, parade, block party, or demonstration. The
City Manager shall treat all applicants uniformly in a just, fair, and
nondiscriminatory manner, bearing in mind that the time, place, duration, and
manner of the proposed uses shall be subordinate to the public health, safety,
and welfare. The criteria provided below for each type of event shall be used
by the City Manager in determining whether the proposed activity is best suited
for the time, place, and manner.

For special events on city-owned property, the City Manager will take the
following into consideration when determining whether to issue a permit:

event.

existing valid permit.

and Public Works Departments that they would be unable to provide normal
services for the remainder of the city.
         (c)   Whether the parade route will prevent the Police and Fire
Departments from providing emergency services to surrounding properties.

vehicles in the assembly and disbanding areas will interfere with the Police
and Fire Departments from providing emergency services to the surrounding
properties.

expression, this section sets forth rules governing the permitting of
demonstrations. The permit requirements for a demonstration are designed to
protect the health, safety, and welfare of those participating in
demonstrations or affected by demonstrations while ensuring the prevention of
any censure of messages. For demonstrations, the City Manager will take the
following into consideration when determining whether to issue a permit:
         (a)   The location of the demonstration.
         (b)   Whether the grouping of people at the chosen location will
prevent the ingress and egress to property.
         (c)   Whether the demonstrators will be able to follow all other
applicable laws at the chosen location.
         (d)   Whether grouping of people at the chosen location will prevent
the Police and Fire Departments from responding to emergency situations in the
surrounding area.

non-city-owned property, the City Manager will take the following into
consideration when determining whether to issue a permit:

When a seller is given notice to cease selling fireworks that require permits,
upon notification by the appropriate agency that sales are to cease, the seller
shall take appropriate action to secure its fireworks inventory immediately and
to prevent further sales by securing the fireworks in an appropriate off-site,
locked facility that meets state and local fire code standards. As an
alternative to securing the fireworks off site, the seller shall stop all sales
until such time as the required permits are obtained and during this time,
store the inventory on-site if the location is secure and meets state and local

application or agreement for solid waste service accepted by the city will be
furnished to the applicant on request. The applicant shall furnish the correct
name and street address or lot and block number at which solid waste services
are to be rendered. Applications or agreements and the applicable deposits
shall not be required for customers of the city’s exclusive franchise collector

more than ninety (90) days delinquent in payment for those solid waste
services.
   (B)   Withholding Service. The city may withhold or discontinue solid waste
services rendered under application made by any member or agent of a household,
organization, or business unless all prior indebtedness to the city of that
member or agent for solid waste service has been settled in full in accordance
with city policy. Service may also be discontinued for any violation made by
the customer of any rule or regulation set forth in this chapter.
   (C)   Continuity of Service. The city will at all times use reasonable
diligence to provide continuous solid waste services and, having used
reasonable diligence, shall not be liable to the customer for failure or
interruption of continuous solid waste services. The city shall not be liable
for any act or omission caused directly or indirectly by strikes, labor
trouble, accidents, litigation, breakdowns, shutdowns for emergency repairs or
adjustments, acts of sabotage, enemies of the United States, wars, United
States, State, municipal or other governmental interferences, acts of God or
other causes beyond its control.
   (D)   Protection of City’s Property. The customer shall exercise reasonable
diligence to protect the city’s property on the customer’s premises and shall
knowingly permit no one, but the city’s agent or persons authorized by law, to
have access to the city’s refuse containers. In the event of any loss or damage
to property of the city caused by or arising out of carelessness, neglect, or
misuse by the customer, the cost of making good such loss or repairing such
damage shall be paid by the customer.
   (E)   Access To Premises. The duly authorized agents of the city shall have
access at all reasonable hours to the premises of the customer for the purpose
of collecting or servicing the city’s refuse containers, or removing the city’s
refuse containers under or termination of the city’s agreement with the
customer and under such performance shall not be liable for trespass.
   (F)   Billing Periods. Bills for solid waste services will be rendered
monthly, or as otherwise stated, in the rate schedule and shall become due when
rendered and be considered as received by the customer when mailed or provided
to the solid waste service address or some other place mutually agreed upon.
Non-receipt of bills by the customer shall not release or diminish the
obligation of the customer with respect to payment thereof.
   (G)   Delinquent Bills. Bills are due when rendered and become delinquent if
not paid within fifteen (15) days after the bill has been mailed or provided to
the customer for payment. Solid waste services may not be discontinued until
ten (10) working days after a written notice of the delinquency in payment has
been mailed or presented to the customer. Solid waste services shall be
restored only after the city has received payment for all past-due bills and
charges from the customer. There shall be no liability of any kind against the
city for the discontinuance of solid waste services to a customer for that
customer’s failure to pay the bills on time. Partial payment of a bill of the
solid waste services rendered will not be accepted by the city, except by the
city’s agreement thereof.
   (H)   Payment of Solid Waste Service Bills Concurrently. When solid waste
services are provided by the city, payment of any solid waste service bill
rendered by the city to a customer shall not be accepted by the city without
the simultaneous or concurrent payment of any other water, wastewater or
stormwater bill rendered by the city. The city may discontinue solid waste
service to the customer’s premises for non-payment of any other water,
wastewater or stormwater bill or if payment is not made concurrently. The city
shall not reestablish solid waste service until such time as all solid waste,
water, wastewater or stormwater service bills and all charges are paid.

premises supplied by the city with solid waste service, written notice thereof
shall be given at the office of the city not less than three (3) days prior to
the date of change by the outgoing customer. The outgoing customer shall be
held responsible for all solid waste services rendered on such premises until
such written notice is so received by the city and the city has had reasonable
time to discontinue the solid waste services. However, if such written notice
has been received, the application of such a succeeding occupant for solid
waste services will automatically terminate the prior account. The customer’s
deposit may be transferred from one service location to another, if both
locations are supplied solid waste services by the city. The customer’s deposit
may be transferred from one name to another as long as the customer makes a
written request.
   (K)   Adjustment of Bills. When a customer has been overcharged or
undercharged as a result of incorrect application or the rate schedule or other
similar reasons, the amount may be credited or billed to the customer in
accordance with the policies of the city.
   (L)   Suspension of Service. A customer who will be away from the serviced
property for more than two months may request a suspension of service and

§ 150.51 CUSTOMER DEPOSITS.
   (A)   Establishment of Credit. Before rendering solid waste services, the
city shall require an applicant for service to satisfactorily establish credit,
but such establishment of credit shall not relieve the customer from complying
with the city’s rules for prompt payment. Credit will be deemed so established
if:
      (1)   The applicant for service furnishes a satisfactory guarantor to
secure payment of bills for service requested.
      (2)   The applicant pays a cash deposit.
      (3)   The applicant for service furnishes an irrevocable letter of credit
from a bank or a surety bond.
   Any such deposit received by the city shall be held in a non-interest
bearing account. Deposits shall not be refunded until any and all outstanding
charges for solid waste services against the account for which it is deposited
have been paid in full. The deposits required under this section shall be
applied against the final bill prepared for termination of the account. If the
deposit exceeds the final bill, and no other outstanding fees or charges exist,
then the balance of the deposit shall be refunded. If a customer has a record
of timely payment over a continuous thirty-six (36) month period, then the city
shall return that deposit.
   (B)   Amount of Deposit. The amount of initial deposit for each customer
shall be set at the prevailing rate established pursuant to resolution.
   (C)   Deposit Waiver. As established in the Utility Deposit Policy, the
applicant may apply for a credit screening to determine if a deposit is
required or if the amount of the deposit can be reduced or waived. Actual cost
of a credit check fee when provided by a third-party will be imposed upon the
applicant.
      Third-Party Credit Check Fee: $5.00
   (D)   Additional Deposit. The city may require a new deposit, where
previously waived or returned, or an additional deposit in order to secure
payment of current bills provided. The city shall provide the customer with
reasonable written notice of not less than thirty (30) days where such request
or notice is separate and apart from any bill for service. The total amount of
the required solid waste deposit shall not exceed an amount equal to two times
the monthly charge for solid waste service.

   (A)   There shall be a charge for discontinuing and reestablishing from the

charge when the original service is established.

subsequent to a customer requested discontinuance, shall be set at the
prevailing rate established by resolution for reestablishment of service that
occur both during normal working hours and after normal working hours.

(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 172.002 BUILDING PERMITS REQUIRED.
   (A)   No building or other structure shall be erected, moved, added to, or
structurally altered without a permit issued by the Building Official. No
building permit shall be issued except in conformity with the provisions of
this chapter, except after written order pursuant to the provisions of §
172.025.
   (B)   The issuance of a permit upon plans and specifications shall not
prevent the Building Official from thereafter requiring the correction of
errors in such plans and specifications or preventing the building operations
being carried on thereunder when in violation of this chapter or any other
provision of this code of ordinances or any other city ordinance.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)

use or structure shall be used until the Building Official shall have issued a
certificate of occupancy stating that such land, building, or part thereof, and
the proposed use thereof are found to be in conformity with the provisions of
this chapter. Within three (3) days after notification that a building or
premises, or part thereof, is ready for occupancy or use, it shall be the duty
of the Building Official to make a final inspection thereof and to issue a
certificate of occupancy if the land, building or part thereof and the proposed
use thereof are found to conform with the provisions of this chapter, or, if
such certificate is refused, to state such refusal in writing with the cause.

Official. An inspection must be requested within the ninety (90) day extension
period, or the permit shall expire.
   (B)   Required inspections. If the work described in any permit issued by
the Building Official has begun, all required inspections shall be requested.

progress or an additional permit extension shall be required at least six (6)
months.

   (C)   Public notice.
      (1)   When a change of zoning classification of a single parcel is
proposed, or a group of not more than five hundred (500) parcels, of any
property within the city, a notice shall be mailed to each property owner whose
zoning classification is proposed to be changed, using owner's current address
of record, as maintained by the Tax Assessor, and be postmarked no later than
ten (10) days prior to the scheduled hearing. Prior to the effective date of
any zoning classification change, the City Council shall cause an affidavit to
be filed with the City Clerk certifying its compliance with the provisions of
this section. A failure to give notice shall not affect the validity of zoning
except as to the property of the complaining owner.
      (2)   When any proposed change of a zoning district boundary lies within
five hundred (500) feet of the boundary of an incorporated or unincorporated
area, notice shall be forwarded to the Planning Board or governing body of such
incorporated or unincorporated areas in order to give such body an opportunity
to appear at the hearing and express its opinion on the effect of the district
boundary change.
   (D)   Review procedures.
      (1)   Pre-application meeting. The applicant is required to schedule and
attend a pre-application meeting as provided for in §
172.010.
      (2)   Application submittal. Applications shall be filed as prescribed in
§

      (3)   Planning and Zoning Board. The Planning and Zoning Board reviews
the application at a public hearing and makes a recommendation based on the
review criteria stated below.
      (4)   City Council review. The City Council reviews the application at a
public hearing and makes a decision based on the review standards below.
   (E)   Review criteria for zoning map and LDC text amendments. In reviewing
proposed changes to the zoning map or LDC, the reviewing authorities shall
consider the following factors:
      (1)   Zoning map amendment factors of analysis:
         (a)   The applicant's need and justification for the change and
whether it aligns with the community's current or future needs;
         (b)   The effect of the change, if any, on a particular property and
surrounding properties;
         (c)   The amount of existing undeveloped land in the general area of
the city having the same classification as that requested;
         (d)   Whether the proposed amendment furthers the purpose of the
city's Comprehensive Plan, or other strategic plans applicable to the proposed
development and the provisions in the Land Development Code;
         (e)   Whether the requested district is substantially different from
that of the surrounding area; and
         (f)   Whether the request provides for a transition between areas of
different character, density or intensity.
      (2)   When considering rezones to higher density districts, the following
criteria shall also be considered:
         (a)   Existing or planned alternative transportation infrastructure
such as bike lanes, trails, transit, and sidewalks in the neighboring area to
the site; and
         (b)   The availability of nonresidential uses which can help meet the
daily needs of residents for goods, services, and employment.
      (3)   When considering applications to rezone sites to commercial
districts, the city should consider directing commercial activities to develop
at nodes, rather than along roadway corridors;
      (4)   Applications to rezone to Neighborhood Commercial (NC) should
consider the lack of neighborhood scale services available to the surrounding
community, especially grocery stores offering fresh foods;
      (5)   Applications to rezone property to non-industrial districts should
not encroach into areas designated for industrial use on the Future Land Use
Map;
      (6)   Location within a prime water recharge area and the potential
impact of the allowable uses in the district.
      If a request for a district boundary change is for a district more
liberal than the existing district, and the Planning and Zoning Board or the
City Council determines that the request should be denied, the Planning and
Zoning Board may recommend, or the City Council may change the district
classification for the property to any district classification that is less
restrictive than the requested zoning classification consistent with the Future
Land Use Map.
   (F)   Rehearing and administrative res judicata. When a proposed change in
district boundaries has been acted upon by the City Council and disapproved or
failed to pass, such proposed change, in the same or substantially similar
form, shall not be reconsidered by the City Council, for a period of six (6)
months. Such restriction shall not apply to the owner if the original request
was initiated by the City Council, Planning and Zoning Board, or any department
or agency of the city.

by the City Manager or designee.
   (D)   Applicability.
      (1)   All site plans are subject to compliance with the Zoning Code.
      (2)   Only the specific work area identified in a site plan, minor site

code requirements, unless the alteration or modification adversely impacts
safety, existing infrastructure, or another code requirement that stipulates
the area outside of the work area must comply with the current standards.
   (E)   Exemptions. The following are exempt from the site plan review;
however, shall comply with all other development regulations and building code
requirements.
      (1)   Detached single-family or duplex residence on a fee simple lot.
      (2)   Accessory structures to an established principal use meeting the
following criteria:
         (a)   The structure does not necessitate the expansion of the existing

         (b)   Does not impact the adequacy of the existing infrastructure
(e.g., utilize necessary parking spaces, remove/reduce stormwater, etc.); and
         (c)   The scope of work does not require modifying the existing site
engineering and can be regulated through the building permit review process.
   (F)   Revisions to approved plans (RTAP). Revisions to approved plans under
construction which do not increase the gross square footage of a building or
adversely impact compliance with the approved site plan and would not alter the
required infrastructure and improvements necessary to serve the site, may be
approved in writing provided such additions or modifications fully conform to
all existing city regulations. Prior to final acceptance of the site, as-built
drawings shall be submitted indicating such revisions, or modifications prior
to site acceptance.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 172.024 CONDITIONAL USES.
   (A)   Intent. Certain land uses, due to their unique functional
characteristics and the potentiality for their incompatibility with adjoining
land uses, require special consideration on an individual basis of their
suitability for location and development within particular zoning districts.
Such uses have been designated as conditional uses within appropriate zoning
district classifications set forth in
Chapter 173. It is the intent of this subchapter that such uses may be
permitted in the zoning district classifications only after affirmative
findings that they can be developed at particular locations in a compatible
manner.
   (B)   Application for conditional uses; fees. Written application for
conditional use shall be complete and made to the Land Development Division
using the application form provided by the city. Application must be filed not
later than the first day of the month preceding the scheduled hearing month.
The applicant shall be required to pay any fee as may be established to defray
processing and advertising costs related to review and hearing of the
application. An application shall be accepted only for a conditional use
specifically listed within the zoning district classification applying to the
subject property or as specifically provided for elsewhere in this chapter.
   (C)   Submittal requirements.
      (1)   Boundary survey.
      (2)   The applicant may submit a full site plan meeting the requirements

         (c)   Major access points into the site and internal circulation;
         (d)   Parking and service areas; and
         (e)   Landscape and irrigation plans depicting compliance with tree
protection and landscaping regulations.
      (3)   Description of the use and performance standards proposed to
mitigate potential impacts, including restrictions of the use of property;
plans for the provisions of utilities, including water, sewer and drainage
facilities; plans for protection of abutting properties; plans for cross access
or shared parking areas; hours of operation; and such other plans, tabulations
and other data to support the request.
   (D)   Public notice.
      (1)   Public notice shall be given as required by state statutes. Notice
of such hearing shall be posted on the property for which conditional use is
sought.
      (2)   A courtesy notice shall be mailed, at the applicant's expense, to
the property owners of record within a radius of five hundred (500) feet,
provided, however, that failure to mail or receive such courtesy notice shall
not affect any action or proceedings taken hereunder.
   (E)   Conditional use review.
      (1)   All applications for conditional uses shall be submitted to the
Planning and Zoning Board for study and written, advisory recommendations to
the City Council.
      (2)   The City Council shall review the application and may either grant
conditional uses with such conditions as are appropriate under this chapter or
other applicable code or ordinance provisions, or deny conditional uses when
not in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter.
      (3)   In granting any conditional use, the City Council may prescribe
appropriate conditions in conformity with this chapter. Violation of such
conditions, when made a part of the terms under which the conditional use is
granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.
   (F)   Review criteria. In its deliberations concerning the granting of a
conditional use, the City Council shall carefully consider the following
criteria:
      (1)   Adequate ingress and egress may be obtained to and from the
property, with particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety and
convenience, traffic flow and control, and access in case of fire or other
emergency.
      (2)   Adequate off-street parking and loading areas may be provided,
without creating undue noise, glare, odor or other detrimental effects upon
adjoining properties.
      (3)   Adequate and properly located utilities are available or may be
reasonably provided to serve the proposed development.
      (4)   Adequate screening or buffering will be provided to protect and
provide compatibility with adjoining properties.
      (5)   Signs, if any, and proposed exterior lighting will be designed and
arranged so as to promote traffic safety and to eliminate or minimize any undue
glare, incompatibility, or disharmony with adjoining properties.
      (6)   Yards and open spaces will be adequate to properly serve the
proposed development and to ensure compatibility with adjoining properties.
      (7)   The proposed use will not constitute a nuisance or hazard because
of the number of persons who will attend or use the facility, or because of
vehicular movement, noise, fume generation or type, of physical activity. The
use as proposed for development will be compatible with the existing or
permitted uses of adjacent properties.
      (8)   Development and operation of the proposed use will be in full
compliance with any additional conditions which the City Council may prescribe,
including, but not limited to, reasonable time limit within which the action
for which special approval is requested shall be begin or be completed, or
both.
   (G)   Effect of conditional use approval. The conditional use shall commence
within two (2) years of the date that the conditional use is granted, as
evidenced by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, certificate of
completion or business tax receipt, as applicable. One administrative extension
of one year may be approved by the City Manager, or designee, following a
written request by the applicant within sixty (60) days prior to the date of
expiration.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 172.025 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Purpose. The City Council shall hear petitions for variances from the
terms of the Land Development Code, as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owing to special conditions, the enforcement of the provisions
of the city's land development regulations would result in unnecessary
hardship. A hardship generally occurs when the physical characteristics of a
property are such that it cannot be used for any purpose permitted by the Land
Development Code. A hardship may be created by the surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions particular to that specific property. However, the
hardship cannot be self-imposed, or the result of the property owner's own
action. The establishment or expansion of a use otherwise prohibited shall not
be allowed by variance, nor shall a variance be granted because of the presence
of nonconformities in the zoning district or uses in an adjoining zoning
district.
   (B)   Variance submittal requirements. The application for variance approval
shall be accompanied by the following:
      (1)   Boundary survey;
      (2)   A site plan depicting existing and proposed development and
highlighting the requested variance.
         (a)   An application, on a form provided by the city, completed and
signed by the applicant and the owner or owner's agent, or contract purchaser
with the owner's written consent.
         (b)   A disclosure statement by the parties with at least five percent
(5%) interest in the subject property/project signed by the applicant and
notarized. The applicant, owner or owner's agent, or contract purchaser with
the owner's written consent, shall keep all information current during the
processing of the application.
         (c)   The particular provision of the LDRs which prevents the proposed
construction on the property.
         (d)   The existing zoning of the property, including any previously
approved conditions or modifications.
         (e)   The special circumstances, conditions, or characteristics of the
land, building or structure that prevent the use of the land in compliance with
the terms of this ordinance.
         (f)   The particular hardship which would result if the specified
provisions of the ordinance were to be applied to the subject property.
         (g)   The extent to which it would be necessary to vary the provisions
of this ordinance to permit the proposed construction on, or use of, the
property.
         (h)   A written response to the variance review criteria.
   (C)   Procedures.
      (1)   Application. An application for variance shall be made by the fee
owner of the property on a form prescribed by the city and shall be submitted
with a processing fee which shall be set and may be amended from time to time
by City Council in accordance with §
172.011.
      (2)   Staff review. The City Manager or designee shall review the
application in light of the applicant's response to the variance review
criteria contained below and forward a recommendation to the Planning and
Zoning Board.
      (3)   Planning and Zoning Board Review. Upon receipt of a recommendation
concerning disposition of a requested variance, the Planning and Zoning Board
shall hold a public hearing and may grant, deny or grant with conditions any
variance request upon finding that the request meets the review criteria.
      (4)   City Council. Upon receipt from the Planning and Zoning Board of a
recommendation concerning disposition of a requested variance, the City Council
shall hold a public hearing and may grant, deny or grant with conditions any
variance request upon finding that the request meets the review criteria.
      (5)   Conditions. In granting any variance, appropriate conditions may be
prescribed to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Land Development
Code and the code in general. Such conditions may include time limits for the
initiation of the variance, specific minimum or maximum limits to regular code
requirements, or any other conditions reasonably related to the requirements
and criteria of this chapter.
   (D)   Review criteria. The following criteria shall be used to determine the
justification for granting of relief from requirements of the development code.
All variance requests shall demonstrate the application of each criterion to
the specific case.
      (1)   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land, structure or building involved, and which are not applicable to other
lands, structures or buildings in the same land use category, zoning district
or situation.
      (2)   The special conditions and circumstances identified in division (D)
(1) above are not the result of actions of the applicant.
      (3)   Literal interpretation and enforcement of the Land Development Code
regulations would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
properties in the same land use category, zoning district or situation, and
would result in unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant.
      (4)   The variance, if granted, is the minimum variance necessary to make
possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure.
      (5)   Granting of the variance request will not confer on the applicant
any special privilege that is denied by the development code to other lands,
buildings or structures in the same land use category, zoning district or
situation.
      (6)   The granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general
intent and purpose of this code and will not be injurious to the surrounding
properties or detrimental to the public welfare.
      (7)   The variance represents a reasonable disposition of a claim brought
under the Bert J. Harris Private Property Rights Protection Act, chapter 95-
181, Laws of Florida, that a development order of the city has unreasonably
burdened the applicant's property, based upon the recommendations of the
special master appointed in accordance with the act, or the order of a court as
described in the act.
      Financial disadvantages or inconvenience to the applicant shall not
constitute conclusive evidence of unnecessary and undue hardship nor be grounds
to justify granting of a variance.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing criteria, variances may be granted under
the authority of the Americans with Disabilities Act as reasonable
accommodations based on the disabilities of any applicant or a member of the
applicant's household. For purposes herein, "reasonable accommodation" and
"disabilities" shall have the meanings provided under the Americans with
Disabilities Act.

      (11)   The conformity and compatibility of the planned unit development
within any adopted plan of the city.
      (12)   The conformity and compatibility of the proposed common recreation
and open space, residential and nonresidential uses within the proposed planned
unit development.
      (13)   Consistency of the preliminary development plan with Comprehensive
Plan goals, objectives, and policies.
         (a)   Internal compatibility. All uses proposed within a preliminary
development plan shall be compatible with other proposed uses; that is, no use
may have any undue adverse impact on any neighboring use, based on the
streetscape, treatment of pedestrian ways and circulation, motor vehicle
circulation, and the separation and buffering of parking areas and sections of
parking areas; the existence or absence of, and the location of, focal points
and vistas, open spaces, plazas, recreational areas and common areas, and use
of existing and proposed landscaping; use of the topography, physical
environment and other natural features; use and variety of building setback or
build-to lines, separations and buffering; use and variety of building
groupings, building sizes, architectural styles, and materials; variety and
design of dwelling types; particular land uses proposed, and conditions and
limitations thereon; and any other factor deemed relevant to the privacy,
safety, preservation, protection or welfare of any proposed use within the
preliminary development plan.
         (b)   External compatibility. All uses proposed within a preliminary
development plan shall be compatible with existing and planned uses of
properties for which it surrounds; that is, no internal use may have any
avoidable or undue adverse impact on any existing or planned surrounding use,
nor shall any internal use be subject to undue adverse impact from existing or
planned surrounding uses. An evaluation of the external compatibility of a
preliminary development plan should be based on the following factors: adjacent
existing and proposed uses, design of the development, traffic circulation, and
density and intensity.
         (c)   Intensity of development. The residential density and intensity
of use of a preliminary development plan shall be compatible with and shall
have no undue adverse impact upon the physical and environmental
characteristics of the site and surrounding lands and shall comply with the
policies and density limitations set forth in the Comprehensive Plan. Within
the maximum limitation of the Comprehensive Plan, the permitted residential
density and intensity of use in a preliminary development plan may be adjusted
upward or downward in consideration of the following factors: the availability
and location of public and utility services and facilities; the trip capture
rate of development; and the degree of internal and external connectedness of
streets.
         (d)   Usable open spaces, plazas and recreation areas. Usable open
spaces, plazas and recreation areas provided within a preliminary development
plan shall be evaluated based on conformance with the policies of the
Comprehensive Plan and the sufficiency of such areas to provide appropriate
recreational opportunities, protect sensitive environmental areas, conserve
areas of unique beauty or historical significance, enhance neighborhood design,
and encourage compatible and cooperative relationships between adjoining land
uses.
         (e)   Environmental constraints. The site of the preliminary
development plan shall be suitable for use in the manner proposed without
hazards to persons either on or offsite from the likelihood of increased
flooding, erosion or other dangers, annoyances or inconveniences. Condition of
soil, groundwater level, drainage and topography shall all be appropriate to
the type, pattern and intensity of development intended. The conditions and
requirements of the protection of resources article shall be met.
         (f)   External transportation access. A preliminary development plan
shall ensure access is located on, and provides access to, a major street
(arterial or collector) unless, due to the size of the preliminary development
plan and the type of uses proposed, it will not adversely affect the type or
amount of traffic on adjoining local streets. Access shall meet the standards
set in
Chapter 176 of the Land Development Code. Connection to existing or planned
adjacent streets is encouraged. The trip generation report shall be signed by a
professional engineer registered in the state when there is a difference
between the traffic report provided by the petitioner and the concurrency test.
         (g)   Internal transportation access. Every dwelling unit or other use
permitted in a preliminary development plan shall have access to a public
street directly or by way of a private road, pedestrian way, court or other
area that is either dedicated to public use or is a common area guaranteeing
access. Permitted uses are not required to front on a dedicated public road.
Private roads and other accessways shall be required to be constructed so as to
ensure that they are safe and maintainable.
         (h)   Provision for the range of transportation choices. Sufficient
off-street and on-street parking for bicycles and other vehicles, as well as
cars, shall be provided. Parking areas shall be constructed in accordance with
such standards as are approved by the City Commission to ensure that they are
safe and maintainable and that they allow for sufficient privacy for adjoining
uses. When there is discretion as to the location of parking in the project, it
is strongly encouraged that all motor vehicle parking be located at the rear or
interior side of buildings, or both. The design of a PDP should, whenever
feasible, incorporate appropriate pedestrian and bicycle accessways so as to
provide for a variety of mobility opportunities. Connection to all sidewalks,
greenways, trails, bikeways, and transit stops along the perimeter of the PDP
is required. Where existing perimeter sidewalks do not exist, sidewalks shall
be provided by the development.
   (I)   Amendments to the preliminary development plan. Except as otherwise
provided in this section, an amendment to an approved preliminary development
plan (except for an extension of a time limit) shall be accomplished only by a
new preliminary development plan application. Any proposed modifications to the
preliminary development plan shall be submitted to the City Manager or designee
for determination of departure in accordance with §
172.026, Administrative Variances. If determined to be a substantial deviation
from the approved preliminary development plan, the applicant must receive a
preliminary development plan approval from City Council for such deviation.
   The following types of amendments to the requirements of an approved PDP may
be authorized by the appropriate reviewing board during final development plan
review, provided such amendments meet the criteria set forth in this subchapter
for the development review process.
      (1)   Minor adjustments or shifts in the location and siting of
buildings, structures, parking bays, and parking spaces.
      (2)   Changes in the location of utility tie-ins and solid waste,
recycling, and yard trash containers.
      (3)   Reductions in the overall density or intensity of structural ground
coverage of the development.

perimeter features of the development.
      (7)   The addition of up to ten (10) new parking spaces.
      (8)   Any expansion of gross floor area or enlargement of the building
envelope that does not require the addition of required parking spaces or alter
standards of the PUD ordinance.
      (9)   Modifications that do not entail amendments to specific language
included within the PDP ordinance.

applicant shall be required to submit copies of all outside agency permits, as
may be required, with the site work permit application. Commencement of any
site work or construction, to include clearing and grading, prior to the
issuance of a site work permit is expressly prohibited. All required public
improvements shall be made at the applicant's expense, without reimbursement by
the city.
   (G)   Inspection of public improvements. The City Public Works Department
shall provide for the inspection of required public improvements during
construction and ensure their satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay

§ 172.055 PERFORMANCE AND MAINTENANCE BONDS.
   Approval of the preliminary plat and construction plans shall authorize the
subdivider to either complete construction of required improvements or bond the
required improvements in accordance with the procedures established herein
prior to submitting the final plat for approval by City Surveyor.
   (A)   Performance bond. As a condition for approval of a final plat by the
City Surveyor where public improvements have not been constructed and accepted
by the city, the subdivider shall be required to deposit with the City Clerk a
performance bond or other security binding the subdivider to payment to the
city to assure completion of all public improvements both on site and off site
as identified on the final plat.
      (1)   Where a performance bond is required, the subdivider shall submit
to the city a bond agreement for review and acceptance by the city. The
subdivider shall submit a non-expiring bond or other security in the amount of
one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the value of all public improvements
to be certified by the Engineer of Record and to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer and City Attorney.
      (2)   The City Manager or designee shall consider the value of the
performance bond and the value of all performance bonds held by the city to
determine whether to take on additional liability until such time the public
improvements are constructed. Upon approval by City Manager or designee, the
final plat shall be conditioned upon posting a performance bond or other
security with the City Clerk. The bond shall be executed by the subdivider as
principal and may have at least one (1) good and sufficient surety approved by
the city. It is the purpose and intent of this section that the subdivider
provide such security as the city shall deem to be reasonably necessary to
assure completion. The requirement of a surety on the bond shall be at the
discretion of the City Manager or designee. A performance bond not posted with
the City Clerk within the effective period of the preliminary plat shall render
the approved final plat null and void.
   (B)   Maintenance bonds. After completion of improvements and exception of
dedication, a two (2) year maintenance bond or other security will be required
in the amount of twenty-five percent (25%) of all dedicated public
improvements. The applicant shall be required to maintain all improvements in
the subdivision until acceptance of such improvements by the city in accordance
with the procedures established in §
172.057 of the Palm Bay Code of Ordinances. The Public Works Department shall
be responsible for the processing and release of maintenance bonds under this
section.
   (C)   Temporary improvement. The applicant shall build and pay for all costs
of temporary improvements required by the city and shall maintain the same for
the period specified by the city. Prior to construction of any temporary
facility or improvement, the applicant shall file with the local government a
separate suitable bond for temporary facilities, which bond shall ensure that
the temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained and removed.
   (D)   Release of performance bond. The city will not release nor reduce a
performance bond until the City Engineer has submitted a certificate stating
that all the required improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until
the applicant's engineer or surveyor has certified to the City Engineer and
City Surveyor, through the submission of a detailed "as-built" survey of the
subdivision, indicating location, dimensions, materials and other information
required by the City Engineer, that the layout of the line and grade of all
public improvements is in accordance with construction plans for the
subdivision. Upon such approval and recommendation, the city may issue the
certificate of completion, cause the maintenance bond to be posted, and accept
the improvements for dedication in accordance with the process and procedures
outlined in §
172.057 of the Palm Bay Code of Ordinances.

§ 172.056 DEFERRAL OR WAIVER OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   The City Council may defer or waive at the time of final approval, subject
to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all such improvements as, in
its judgment, are not requisite in the interests of the public health, safety
and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack
of connecting facilities.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 172.057 PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS ACCEPTANCE AND MAINTENANCE.

of the need to accept the improvement(s), whether the city has the financial
ability to maintain the improvement(s), the impact acceptance of the
improvement(s) will have upon other municipal services, the public purpose to
be served by accepting the improvement(s), the general capability of the city
to maintain the improvement(s), whether the health, safety, and welfare of the
general public will be served by acceptance of the improvement(s), and its
intent to accept the improvement(s), or to accept the improvement(s) with
conditions.
      (4)   Written request, accompanying documents. Following a determination
of the City Council of its intent to accept the public improvements(s) for

apply to all improvements proposed to be accepted by the city for maintenance
unless a written request with "as-built" drawings has been submitted to the
city prior to the effective date of this section.
   (B)   Initial consideration. The city staff shall review, inspect and test
the public improvements at the applicant's expense. The type of tests shall be
selected by the city, shall be carried out by firms selected by the city and
shall be carried out in accordance with the standards, practices and procedures
generally utilized by the industry for such tests. Review of the public
improvements by the city staff is to be based upon the applicable city, county,
state or industry construction specifications that set the standards for the
public improvement contained in the request. The construction standards that
will apply will vary as follows:
      (1)   For public improvements that were constructed, placed, or installed
prior to July 1, 1982, the construction, placement or installation shall be in
accordance with the approved construction plans and the applicable construction
standards in effect at the time of construction. If, however, review,
inspection or testing yield results not in keeping with the above, corrective
measures shall be made in accordance with the approved construction plans and
the applicable construction standards in effect at the time of construction by
the applicant.
      (2)   For public improvements to be constructed within the subdivided
plats that were recorded prior to July 1, 1982, but have not been constructed,
and for which construction plans have been prepared and approved, the
applicable construction standards will be the standard construction
specifications of the city and made a part of this chapter, by reference,
including, but not limited to, Divisions (B)(2), (3), (4) and (5) thereof as
those specifications exist today or as they may be amended from time to time by
the city engineer with the exception of those improvements where construction
has begun within two (2) years from July 1, 1982. In those instances, the
construction standards shall be in accordance with the approved construction
plans and the applicable construction standards in effect at the date of
platting and plan approval. Upon the written request of a applicant for good
cause, the City Manager may extend, for a maximum period of one (1) year, the
initial construction date for the applicable units under this section. GOOD
CAUSE, for purposes of this division (B), shall include the inability to obtain
or receive approval of necessary permits and approvals from the regulatory
agencies that regulate such construction.
      (3)   For public improvements to be constructed within subdivided plats
that were recorded prior to the effective date of this chapter but for which
construction plans have not been approved, the applicable construction
standards will be the standard construction specifications of the city adopted
and made a part of this chapter, by reference, including but not limited to
Divisions (B)(2), (3), (4) and (5) thereof as those specifications exist today
or as they may be amended from time to time by the City Engineer.
      (4)   For public improvements to be constructed under other than any of
the foregoing conditions, the applicable construction standards will be the
standard construction specifications of the city adopted and made a part of
this chapter, by reference, including but not limited to Divisions (B)(2), (3),
(4) and (5) thereof as those specifications exist today or as they may be
amended from time to time by the City Engineer.
      (5)   In all of the foregoing cases, where modification of the
requirements of the city's current standard construction specifications is
being accepted, the modification is not intended to exempt compliance with any
and all other applicable existing provisions of this code of ordinances and any
other ordinance of the city.
      (6)   It is the express intent of the City Council to permit the City
Engineer, in his sound discretion, to amend specifications from time to time in
accordance with the standards as established by good engineering practices and
industry standards that pertain to the particular improvement offered for
acceptance by the applicant.
   (C)   Unacceptable improvements. If the public improvement is determined to

City Council shall consider adoption of a final resolution accepting the
maintenance of the improvements specifically listed in the resolution and
establish the effective date as the termination of the two (2) year maintenance
period.

may deem appropriate, including the rejection or tabling of the request.
      (2)   In the event an applicant fails to either request review of the
applicable improvement or complete the required corrections under this section
within the appropriate time, such applicant will be required to post and
additional one (1) year maintenance bond or security. If the applicant fails to
post such a bond or security within thirty (30) days before expiration of the
existing bond or security, the City Council may rescind its prior resolution
accepting construction of the improvements, invoke the posted maintenance bond
or security, if appropriate, and the applicant shall be required to recommence
beginning with the requirements as established in subsection (A) above.

service for transportation, solid waste, potable water, drainage, sanitary
sewer, public schools, or park facility or service. The most current available
information and data regarding the operating levels of service of such public
facilities or services shall be utilized for concurrency evaluations. Any party
pursuing approval of a site plan, subdivision plat, or building permit shall
submit a valid concurrency evaluation, approved by the City Manager or

      (1)   Capacity for transportation facilities shall be evaluated using the
2002 Quality/Level of Service Handbook, Florida Department of Transportation.
      (2)   Projected impacts on the transportation system shall be determined
by utilizing the trip generation standards set forth in the Trip Generation
Manual, 7th Edition, Institute of Transportation Engineers, and evaluating
their impact at points of ingress and egress to roadways in the city.
      (3)   The calculation of total traffic generated by a proposed
nonresidential project will assume one hundred percent (100%) buildout and
occupancy of the project. Credit against the trip generation rates may be taken
utilizing the percentages below:
PERCENT OF CAPTURED TRIPS FROM PASSING TRAFFIC
Use Percentage (%)
PERCENT OF CAPTURED TRIPS FROM PASSING TRAFFIC
Use                        Percentage (%)
Supermarkets               25
Hardware stores            5

Service stations/carwashes 58
Offices                    0
Industrial uses            0
 
      (4)   Any capture of trips from passing traffic for uses not specified
above or in excess of those percentages must be justified by the applicant.
      (5)   Current operating level of service shall be based upon the most
recent traffic counts available plus projected traffic counts from previously
committed developments.
   (B)   Sanitary sewer and potable water.
      (1)   Capacity shall be determined by capacity reservation for the
project by the Utilities Department of the city.
      (2)   Issuance of a septic tank permit and approval of potable water well
if city utilities are not readily available and connection to city utilities is
not required by the Code of Ordinances.
   (C)   Solid waste. County Utilities Department shall certify that capacity
exists prior to development approval.
   (D)   Parks.
      (1)   Adequacy of public parks shall be based on Palm Bay's level of
service standards of four (4) acres per one thousand (1,000) population by
planning area.
      (2)   The impact of a proposed development will be determined by
utilizing the official household-size multiplier, from the University of
Florida, Bureau of Economic and Business Research for Palm Bay, times the
number of units projected for a project.
   (E)   Drainage. Certification that a project meets all applicable standards
of the stormwater management regulations set forth in
Chapter 177 of this code shall be made by the city engineering division prior
to permit approval.

§ 173.002 ZONING DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.
   The city is divided into zoning districts as described in this chapter and
as shown on the official zoning map of the city. The zoning districts implement
the future land use categories as follows. However, not all the zoning
districts listed under a future land use category are presumed to be
appropriate for a site with that particular future land use designation. The
factors listed in §
172.022 (Zoning Map Amendments) need to be met in order to approve the zoning
map amendment request. Planned unit developments (PUDs) are allowed within all
Future Land Use Map categories, provided the rezoning request meets the
requirements of
Chapter 172, Part 4 and is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.

(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 173.003 ZONING MAP.
   (A)   Identification of official map. The official zoning map shall be
identified by the signature of the Mayor attested by the City Clerk under the
following: "This is to certify that this is the official zoning map referred to
in the Palm Bay Zoning Ordinance," together with the date of adoption of this
chapter.
   (B)   Changes in district boundaries. If, in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter and other applicable law, changes are made in the district
boundaries or other matter portrayed on the official zoning map, such changes
shall be made on the official zoning map promptly after the amendment has been
approved by City Council. The official zoning map shall contain a listing by
date and ordinance or resolution number of all changes.
   (C)   Final authority as to zoning status. Regardless of the existence of
purported copies of the official zoning map which may, from time to time, be
made or published, the official zoning map shall be kept under the responsible
charge of the City Manager or designee and shall be the final graphic authority
as to the current zoning status of all lands, waters and structures in the
city. However, the legal description of all zoning or rezoning ordinances or
resolutions, if applicable, shall be the final legal authority as to the zoning
status of land.
   (D)   Replacement of official zoning map. If the official zoning map becomes
damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature or
number of changes and additions, the City Council may, by resolution, adopt a
new official zoning map which shall supersede the prior official zoning map.
The new official zoning map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions
in the prior official zoning map, but no such correction shall have the effect
of amending the original zoning code or any subsequent amendment thereof.
Unless the prior official zoning map has been lost, or has been destroyed, the
prior map or any significant parts thereof remaining, shall be preserved
together with all available records pertaining to its adoption or amendment.
   (E)   Retention of earlier zoning map. All zoning maps or remaining portions
thereof which have had official force and effect in the city prior to the
effective date of this chapter shall be retained as a public record and as a
guide to the zoning status of lands and water under the jurisdiction of the
city prior to the adoption of this chapter.
   (F)   Updating zoning base maps. From time to time the zoning base map(s)
may be updated to reflect new annexations, streets, or subdivisions formally
approved by the City Council without further official action by the Council. No
revision of zoning boundaries is permitted except by ordinance.
   (G)   Changes to map. No zoning changes shall be made on the official zoning
map or matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth
in this chapter. Any unauthorized change of whatever kind by any person or
persons shall be considered a violation of this chapter and punishable as
provided under this chapter.
   (H)   Interpretation of district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists as to
the boundaries of districts as shown on the official zoning map or the future
land use map, the following rules shall apply.
      (1)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerline of
streets, highways, alleys, or rights-of-way shall be construed as to follow
such centerlines. In the event a right-of-way is vacated, the district boundary
shall be construed as remaining in its location except when ownership of the
vacated street is divided other than at the center in which case the boundary
shall be construed as moving with the ownership.
      (2)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following such lot lines.
      (3)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall
be construed as following such city limits.
      (4)   Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed
to be midway between the main tracks.
      (5)   Boundaries indicated as following bulkhead or shorelines shall be
construed to follow such bulkhead lines or shore lines, and in the event of
change the bulkhead or shoreline shall be construed as moving with the newly
established bulkhead line or the actual shoreline; boundaries indicated as
approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or
other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
      (6)   Boundaries that are indicated as entering any body of water, but
not continuing to intersect with other zoning boundaries shall be construed as
extending in the direction in which they enter the body of water to intersect
with other zoning districts.
      (7)   Boundaries indicated as parallel to, or extensions of features
indicated in divisions (A) through (F) above shall be so construed. Distances
not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by
the scale of the map.
      (8)   Where discrepancies exist between natural or manmade features
existing on the ground and with those shown on the official zoning map or in
other circumstances not covered by the above provisions, the City Manager or
designee shall interpret the district boundaries. Appeal shall be pursuant to §
172.014.
   (I)   Lots in two (2) districts. Where a district boundary line as
established in this chapter or as shown on the zoning map divides a lot which
was of single ownership and of record at the time of this chapter. The zoning
district boundary line may be considered as running along the property line,
provided the movement of the boundary line shall not be more than fifty (50)
feet in either direction.
   (J)   Annexed territory. The zoning classification of all property which may
hereafter be annexed to the city shall be determined by the City Council after
review and recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Board at the time of
annexation.

PART 2: STANDARD ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS
§ 173.020 INTENT OF STANDARD ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (A)   General Use Holding District (GU). The provisions of this district are
intended to apply to large undeveloped or sparsely developed areas which are
capable of supporting single-family dwellings at very low densities without
extensive infrastructure improvements. This district is also intended to place
land in a hold pattern until such time as a specific request is presented which
is consistent with the future land use plan and which provides for
infrastructure improvements necessary to support a more intensive land
development classification.
   (B)   Rural Residential District (RR). The purpose of this district is to
provide for the development of single-family residential homes combined with
limited agricultural activities within a rural setting.
   (C)   Estate Residential District (RE). The purpose of this district is to
accommodate low density single-family residential development of an estate
character.
   (D)   Suburban Residential Estate District (SRE). The intent of this
district is to provide for low density single-family residential development of
a suburban character.
   (E)   Single-Family Residential Districts (RS-1, RS-2, and RS-3). The
purpose of these districts is to accommodate low density single-family
residential development of an increasingly urban character. (Note: Sites
previously zoned and developed under the SF-1 district regulations are now
subject to the RS-1 district standards).
   (F)   Residential Transition District (RT-10). The intent of this district
is to permit moderate density residential development inclusive of a range of
missing middle housing types. Lot sizes and other restrictions are intended to
promote high quality moderate density development and act as a transition area
between low- and high-density residential activities.
   (G)   Residential Mobile Home District (RMH). The purpose of this district
is to accommodate mobile home parks and subdivisions served by adequate
community facilities.
   (H)   Multiple-Family Residential Districts (RM-15 and RM-20). The intent of

of other housing types at medium and high densities. Lot sizes and other
restrictions are intended to promote and protect high quality residential
development.
   (I)   Office Professional District (OP). This district is intended to permit
professional office uses and services that are protected from intense
commercial and industrial development. Development standards and provisions are
established to reduce conflicts with adjacent residential uses and minimize
traffic conflicts along adjacent thoroughfares. This district may be considered
within residential future land use categories without requiring a future land
use map amendment on parcels that have become unsuitable for residential
development. Sites which may be unsuitable or undevelopable may include, but
are not limited to, parcels that have become isolated by previous developments
around it, or due to the acquisition of adjacent land for public purposes or
natural features (rivers, lakes, or preservation areas). Parcels must be five
usable acres or less and shall be located along a designated collector or
arterial roadway.
   (J)   Restricted Commercial District (RC). The purpose of the restricted
commercial district shall be to locate and establish areas within the city
which are uniquely suited for commercial development but which are
transitioning from residential or other noncommercial development to commercial
use. Such areas to be primarily along major transportation corridors connecting
other community commercial clusters. The uses and development standards
included in the district are intended to provide compatibility between uses,
protect nearby residential districts, provide access control along corridors,
provide quality development, enhance corridor appearance, and provide
additional commercial opportunities within the city.
   (K)   Neighborhood Commercial District (NC). The purpose of this district is
to allow limited commercial activities offering convenience goods and personal
services to residents of the surrounding neighborhood. Development standards
and provisions are established to ensure the proper development and location of
neighborhood-serving uses, reduce conflicts with adjacent residential uses, and
to minimize the interruption of traffic along adjacent thoroughfares.
   (L)   Community Commercial District (CC). The intent of this district is to
permit the development of commercial activities which offer a wide range of
goods and services to the surrounding community primarily located at or near
the intersection of arterial roadways.

permit highway oriented businesses and regional scale facilities located along
or near the intersection of major arterials and transportation nodes.
   (O)   Mixed Use Districts (CMU and UMU). The purpose of the mixed-use
districts is to foster an attractive and functional mix of residential and
nonresidential land uses within a walkable setting. See Part 5 of this chapter
for standards applicable to these districts.
      (1)   The Community Mixed-Use (CMU) district is to be applied to large
development sites where the primary use is single-family residential supported
by a variety of multi-family, commercial, recreational, and institutional uses.
      (2)   The intent of the Urban Mixed-Use (UMU) district is to cultivate a
vibrant mix of very dense and intense residential and nonresidential land uses
within a highly walkable setting primarily consisting or vertical mixed-use
buildings at the intersection of collector or arterial roadways.
   (P)   Light Industrial and Warehousing District (LI). The purpose of this
district is to accommodate light manufacturing, warehousing, distribution,
wholesaling and other light industrial uses.
   (Q)   Heavy Industrial District (HI). The intent of this district is to
permit a range of general manufacturing, storage and distribution activities in
close proximity to major transportation corridors.
   (R)   Institutional Use District (IU). The purpose of this district is to
allow for facilities that serve the educational, governmental, recreational,
health, and cultural needs of the city.
   (S)   Conservation District (C). The intent of this district is to preserve
and protect large areas of open space, vegetative habitat, natural drainage
systems, aquifer recharge areas, soils, and wildlife habitats located on public
property or on privately-held lands as desired by the property owner.
Conservation lands are intended primarily for the purpose of preserving natural
resources.

§ 173.021 SCHEDULE OF USES.
   Tables
173-1,
173-2 and
173-3 list the uses that are permitted in the various zoning districts. Uses
not expressly listed in the tables as Permitted (P) or Conditional (C) are
prohibited and shall not be established in that district. If a question arises
as to the interpretation of any permitted uses, such interpretation shall be
made by the City Manager or designee.
   A mix of uses on a single site is allowed in all districts, except the
single-family districts, provided the proposed uses are allowed in the
applicable district. If any use in a proposed mixed-use development requires
conditional use approval, the entire mixed-use site must be reviewed under the
conditional use process.

P = Permitted Use; C = Conditional Use; Blank cell = Prohibited
(1)   Required Conditional Use if the site is larger than one acre.
(2)   The site shall have direct access to a collector or arterial roadway.
(3)   All buildings on the site shall be set back a minimum of 20 feet (50 ft.
for commercial dog kennels) from all property lines or meet the district
setbacks, whichever are greater.
(4)   The acreage used in determining the number of animals that may be kept
upon the premises may only be used for one type of animal. For example, an acre
of land would allow for 2 horses, but it would not allow for an additional 5
goats. The land needed to support one type of animal cannot in turn be counted
to permit further animals. This provision is to protect the health of the
animals and to ensure the residential character of the neighborhood is
maintained.

PART 6: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS
§ 173.060 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of the planned unit development (PUD) zoning district is to
provide a zoning district that allows design flexibility and promotes planned
diversification and integration of uses and structures, while also retaining
the City Council's authority to establish such limitations and regulations as
it deems necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
The PUD district is designed to:
   (A)   Encourage flexible land development that sustainably uses land and
infrastructure, reduces transportation needs, conserves energy, and maximizes
the preservation of natural resources.
   (B)   Allow for the integration of different land uses and densities in a
single development achieving compatibility in overall site design and scale,
both internal and external, to the project site.
   (C)   Permit outstanding and innovative residential and nonresidential
developments with quality-of-life design features, such as an integration of
housing types and accommodation of changing lifestyles within neighborhoods;
design that encourages internal and external convenient and comfortable travel

PART 8: CMU AND UMU DISTRICT STANDARDS
§ 173.090 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this section is to establish standards to implement the
community mixed-use and urban mixed-use future land use categories through the
application of the Community Mixed-Use and Urban Mixed-Use zoning districts.
With preset standards for these districts, applicants can design unified
developments with a variety of uses, building types, and densities/intensities
without having to process a planned unit development. See
Chapter 172 for the required steps to process a development in the mixed-use
districts. The regulations contained in this section are intended to:
   (A)   Create walkable communities that provide within walking distance most
of the activities of daily living so that residents of all ages may gain
independence of movement, thereby reducing the number and length of vehicular
trips;
   (B)   Provide a variety of places to go and things to do within walking
distance, including an assortment of residential buildings (i.e., detaches
homes, townhouses, apartments, etc.), workplace buildings (i.e., offices,
studios, craft shops, etc.), neighborhood commercial buildings (i.e., grocery
stores, craft shops, boutiques, salons, restaurants, etc.), and public
buildings (i.e., schools, churches, libraries, assembly halls, etc.), bound
together by a well-planned public realm;
   (C)   Ensure the provision of tree-lined streets, sidewalks, playgrounds,
parks, benches, picnic shelters and gazebos which help create neighborhood
character and offer amenities to the entire community;
   (D)   Provide a variety of housing types and sizes to accommodate the needs
of a diverse population;
   (E)   Ensure a coordinated approach to site and building design;
   (F)   Achieve the integration of new developments to external pedestrian and
vehicular network;
   (G)   Support cohesive, mixed-use development with higher development
densities and intensities at nodes; and
   (H)   Encourage the development of high-quality mixed-use through
development incentives.

§ 173.091 MIX OF USES.
   
Table 173-2 lists the uses permitted within the CMU and UMU districts. The MU
Master Site Plan shall show a mix of uses in a vertical or horizontal fashion.
When laying out the uses, the most dense/intense uses shall be concentrated at
major intersection nodes with a gradual transition to a less dense urban form
at the edges of the development. To ensure a balance between housing, retail,
office, and other commercial and light industrial development within new MU
zoning districts, the following mix of uses shall be achieved (percentage of
gross acreage). For vertical mixed-use, the acreage of a site used for several
uses may be double counted (e.g., a ten (10)-acre site with ground floor
commercial and residential above may be counted as ten (10) acres of commercial
and ten (10) acres of residential - fifty percent (50%) of each use).

shall meet the standards of this section. Townhomes, multi- family, and zero-
lot-line developments shall also comply with the standards noted in §§
173.032,
173.031, and
173.034 for such uses. All other uses are also subject to the architectural
standards contained in
Part 4 of this chapter.
   (A)   Minimum site area.
      (1)   The total gross acreage of a property being rezoned to CMU shall
comprise a minimum of one hundred (100) contiguous acres, unless the site is
already adjacent to an CMU district and the new development will integrate to
the existing neighboring mixed-use. There is no minimum site area requirement
for rezoning to UMU.
      (2)   A site proposed for rezoning to CMU or UMU shall be owned by or
under the control of the applicant. Approval of the rezoning application by the
city shall be based on the understanding that, if the applicant proceeds with
the proposed development, the applicant will:
         (a)   Do so in accord with the officially approved final MU Master
Site Plan for the site, and any other conditions or modifications the City
Council may impose.
         (b)   Provide agreements, covenants, contracts, deed restrictions or
sureties acceptable to the city for completion of the undertaking in accordance
with the adopted final master plan as well as for the continuing operation and
maintenance of those areas, functions and facilities that are not to be
provided, operated, or maintained at public expense.
         (c)   Bind all development successors in title to any commitments made
under this section.
   (B)   Block standards and connectivity. Connectivity is of utmost importance
in both districts, and it is achieved by ensuring blocks and streets are laid
out to provide that connectivity for pedestrians and vehicles. While an
orthogonal grid is the most obvious method for achieving connectivity,
meandering roads are also acceptable provided they preserve the connectivity
(see
Figure 173-3). Proposed developments shall be required to provide connectivity
by meeting the following standards. The City Manager or designee may allow
adjustments based on the presence of environmentally sensitive lands, tree
protection, or other existing site-specific features.
      (1)   New blocks shall not exceed a two thousand (2,000) lineal foot
perimeter and block length shall not exceed six hundred (600) feet.
      (2)   To prevent the creation of mega-blocks due to ownership of large
tracts, vehicular and pedestrian connections shall be provided through the
development. Gated communities are not permitted within this district. Through
traffic issues may be deflected by using traffic calming techniques (e.g., lane
shifts, round abouts, non-direct routes).

IMAGES/0-0-0-5971.png]
 
   (C)   Development density and intensity. Individual components of the mixed-
use development (i.e., pods, neighborhoods) may have a range of maximum
densities based on the intended character of each area. However, the overall
maximum density for the entire development site shall be as shown in
Table 173-5.
   (D)   Lot sizes. The CMU district is intended to include a wide variety of
housing choices. The minimum size of residential sites shall vary to
accommodate those housing products as shown in
Table 173-5. A mix of single-family, townhomes, and multi-family housing is
encouraged. In no event shall a development within a CMU district have more
than seventy percent (70%) of the housing stock be the same housing type. The
master site plan shall specify where the various housing products will be
located.
   (E)   Setbacks.
      (1)   Residential uses shall meet the standards listed in
Table 173-5. However, porches and living areas may encroach up to ten (10) feet
into the front yard setback.
      (2)   Non-residential buildings should be built close to the street to
emphasize pedestrian activity. Therefore, the setbacks listed in
Table 173-5 shall be met. However, the minimum setback may be reduced to zero
(0) if an eight (8)-foot wide public furnishing zone and a six (6)-foot public
sidewalk are present or proposed adjacent to the site.
      (3)   The maximum setbacks may be waived to allow for pedestrian plazas/
forecourts.
      (4)   In no event shall parking be located between the building and the
street, unless otherwise permitted in §
173.093, Parking Location and Design.
      (5)   The front and side corner setbacks may be used for landscape,
hardscape, or outdoor dining (see
Figure 173-4).

(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 173.093 PARKING LOCATION AND DESIGN.
   The buildings must be the predominant element/view from the street.
Therefore, parking areas must be screened as follows:
   (A)   Surface parking lots shall be located in the rear of the lot, behind
the building. They may also locate between the building and the side property
line provided the building frontage requirements are met.
   (B)   Surface and structure parking areas shall be accessed from a secondary
street (secondary streets shall be identified int eh street hierarchy map),
from an adjacent property (shared use agreement necessary), or from rear alleys
if any of these are available or proposed as part of the development. Access
through single-family residential neighborhoods, however, shall not be allowed.
   (C)   Surface parking areas located along a public street shall be screened
from street view by a three (3)-foot street wall placed within the parking
setback area (see §
175.025 for street wall design requirements).
   (D)   Parking structures facing the street shall be placed behind a liner
building that houses active uses (e.g., commercial, office, residential). The
liner building, which may be attached or detached from the parking structure,
shall extend for a minimum of seventy-five percent (75%) of the length of the
parking structure, and shall have a minimum depth of thirty (30) feet. Any
portion of a parking garage that is not concealed behind a building shall be
screened to conceal all internal elements such as plumbing pipes, fans, ducts
and lighting. Ramping should be internalized wherever possible. Exposed
spandrels shall be prohibited.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 173.094 OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   Mixed-use developments shall ensure the provision of common open space. The
various components of the mixed-use development may have higher or lower
percentages than required in §
177.005 as long as the overall percentage is met. See §
177.005 for other applicable requirements.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 173.095 BUILDING STANDARDS.
   (A)   Building height. 
      (1)   Maximum height. Individual components of the mixed-use development
(i.e., pods, neighborhoods) may have different building heights based on the
intended character of each area. The maximum building height allowed shall be
as shown in
Table 173-5. Additional building height may be permitted per
Part 5 of this chapter (Development Bonuses and Incentives).
      (2)   Building transitions. To mitigate potential conflicts between
neighboring developments, the following considerations shall be made during the
review process with particular focus on proposed structures and uses located at
the perimeter of the proposed development:
         (a)   Multi-story buildings adjacent to single-family homes shall
provide a ten (10)-foot setback for each floor above two stories. The setback
may be provided as a step back for each floor, as a setback for the entire
building, or a combination of the two.
         (b)   Compatibility may be achieved through the use of open space
(parks, plazas, squares, courts, etc.), and natural features such as
topography, waterways, existing trees and vegetation.
         (c)   Siting of less-intensive uses around the perimeter of the
development, particularly when the development directly abuts a residential
area (i.e., offices instead of bars/restaurants).
         (d)   Enhanced landscaping and buffers between mixed-use developments
and existing off-site single-family residential areas.
   (B)   Building orientation. All buildings shall front a street. There shall
be no privacy fences lining up streets.

IMAGES/0-0-0-5975.png]
 
   (C)   Building frontage. Building frontage is the proportion of the front
façade compared to the lot width measured within the required setback (see
Figure 173-6). To ensure façade continuity and activity along the street, in
addition to avoiding large expanses of blocks that are not framed by buildings,
all new non-residential and multi-family buildings shall meet the following
provisions. Institutional uses are exempt from building frontage requirements.
Figure 173-6. Building Frontage

IMAGES/0-0-0-5977.png]
 
      (1)   The MU Master Site Plan shall include a street hierarchy map to
identify the "primary" streets, which refer to those streets new development
should be oriented to. All lots should have at least one frontage on a primary
street.
      (2)   All new buildings shall have a minimum building frontage of fifty
percent (50%) along primary streets. For lots with frontage on multiple primary
streets, the applicant must provide justification for choosing one over the
others to meet the requirement.
      (3)   In the case where the required building frontage cannot be met due
to the need to provide vehicular access from the street, a gateway, arch, or
similar feature shall be provided to preserve the block continuity and may be
counted toward meeting the building frontage requirement, as shown on the
figure below.

PART 9: NONCONFORMANCE PROVISIONS
§ 173.100 INTENT.
   (A)   Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that
may later be adopted, there exists lots, structures, uses of land and
structures and characteristics of use which were lawful before this chapter was
passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under
the terms of this chapter or future amendments.
   (B)   It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to
continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their continuation. Such
uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the
districts involved. It is further the intent of this chapter that
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used
as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 173.101 EXTENSION AND ENLARGEMENT.
   (A)   A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged
after passage of this chapter by attachment on a building or premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition
of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district
involved.
   (B)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
on which an active building permit has been issued. Actual building
construction shall be diligently carried on until the subject structure is
completed.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 173.102 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   (A)   In any district, permitted principal and accessory structures may be
erected on any single lot that is of record on the effective date of this
section, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this code
of ordinances and any other applicable ordinance of the city. Such lots must be
in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the
same ownership. These provisions shall apply even though such lot fails to meet
the requirements for area or width or both, that are generally applicable in
the district, provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not
involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations
for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements
shall be obtained only through the procedure established in §
172.025.
   (B)   If two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots
with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of
passage or amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots do not
meet the requirements for lot width and area as established by this chapter,
the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the
purpose of this chapter, and no portion of the parcel shall be used which does
not meet lot width and area requirements established by this chapter.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 173.103 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter,
lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of
this chapter as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (A)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter; unless such use is changed to a use
permitted in the district in which such use is located;
   (B)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this chapter;
   (C)   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than ninety (90) consecutive days. Any subsequent use of such
land shall conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the
district in which such land is located;
   (D)   No additional structure which does not conform to the requirements of
this chapter shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of
land.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 173.104 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter that could not be built under the terms of this,
chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards or other
characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may
be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
   (A)   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases
its nonconformity;
   (B)   But any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its
nonconformity;
   (C)   Should such a structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more
than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it
shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter;
   (D)   Should such a structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 173.105 NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES IN
COMBINATION.
   If a lawful use involving individual structures, or of structure and
premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this chapter, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of
this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (A)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter
in the district on which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located;
   (B)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building;
   (C)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed;
   (D)   When a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and premises in
combination is discontinued or abandoned for six (6) consecutive months, the
structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be
used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is
located;
   (E)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land. Destruction, for the purpose of this chapter,
is defined as damage to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of the
replacement cost at time of destruction.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 173.106 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use,
work may be done in any period of six (6) consecutive months on ordinary
repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or
plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the current
replacement value of the building, provided that the cubic content of the
building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter
shall not be increased.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening
or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
such official.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 173.107 NONCONFORMING OR SUB-STANDARD LOTS CREATED BY EMINENT DOMAIN
PROCEEDINGS.
   Any lot or parcel which shall be made nonconforming or substandard as a
result of eminent domain proceedings instituted by the city or other
governmental agency or through a voluntary conveyance by a lot owner in lieu of
formal eminent domain proceedings, which lot or parcel except for such eminent
domain or voluntary conveyance shall be deemed to be a conforming lot or parcel
for all purposes under this chapter. However, any new construction or building
addition shall conform to the subject yard requirements of the applicable
district. Any re-construction or maintenance of the existing structures may be
performed with no additional encroachment into the subject yard requirements.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 173.108 USES UNDER CONDITIONAL USE PROVISIONS NOT NONCONFORMING USES.
   Any use for which a conditional use is permitted as provided in this chapter
shall not be deemed a nonconforming use but shall without further action be
deemed a conforming use in such district.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 173.109 TEMPORARY USES.
   The casual, intermittent, temporary or illegal use of land or structures
shall not be sufficient to establish the existence of a nonconforming use. Such
use shall not be validated by the adoption of this chapter unless it complies
with the terms of this chapter.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
PART 10: VESTED RIGHTS
§ 173.120 PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED DEVELOPMENT.
   In the event any provision of this Land Development Code would limit or
modify the vested rights of any person or entity to complete a development that
has been previously authorized, then in that event, the city may recognize the

PART 1: ACCESSORY USES AND STRUCTURES
§ 174.001 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide standards for specific land uses
that are allowable as accessory uses or structures, temporary uses, or as
permitted subject to additional standards as noted in Tables
173-1 through
173-3. The regulations of this chapter are intended to supplement, rather than
supersede, the district regulations found in
Chapter 173.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 174.002 ACCESSORY USES AND STRUCTURES GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   Accessory structures shall meet the following provisions, unless stated
otherwise in
Table 174-1 or other sections in this Part.
   (A)   Placement. No accessory structure shall be erected within:
      (1)   Any public drainage and utility easement.
      (2)   Any required front yard setback.
      (3)   Any required side yard setback.
      (4)   Within ten (10) feet of any rear property line.
      (5)   Within five (5) feet from any building on the same lot.
      (6)   Accessory structures erected on lots fronting on two (2) streets
shall conform to the principal structure setbacks for the side corner yard
setback.
   (B)   Height. No accessory structure shall exceed twenty-five (25) feet in
height or the height of the principal structure, whichever is less.
   (C)   Timing. No accessory building may be erected upon a property without
the presence of a principal building and such accessory buildings shall not be
used until after the principal structure has been fully constructed and a
certificate of occupancy issued.
   (D)   Size. No accessory structure, or the cumulative size of all accessory
structures on a site, shall exceed the size of the principal structure, except
that:
      (1)   Sheds in residential zoning districts may not exceed 50% of the
size of the principal structure's living area.
      (2)   Properties zoned RR (Rural Residential District) of two (2) acres
or more shall be permitted to have accessory structures that exceed the square
footage of the principal structure's living area.
   (E)   Tents. Erection of tents as accessory structures is prohibited.
   (F)   Satellite dish antennae. For the purpose of this chapter, satellite
dish antennae are considered an accessory structure, and a building permit
shall be required when installing, moving or reconstructing a dish antenna.
Satellite dish antennae shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Satellite dish antennae may be roof-mounted provided that the
twenty-five (25) foot height restriction in single-family residential districts
and the maximum height limits in commercial, industrial, and multi-family
districts are not exceeded. The height of the antenna/dish shall be that
distance as measured vertically from the highest point of the dish/antenna,
when positioned at its lowest angle for operation, to ground level.
      (2)   Dish antennae located in single-family residential districts shall
not have a dish which exceeds ten (10) feet in diameter.
   (G)   Metal structures. Metal accessory structures over three hundred (300)
square feet or over twelve (12) feet in height in residential zoning districts
shall be designed to simulate non-metal construction, treated with a textured
coating on all four sides or painted to match the color scheme of the primary
residence.
   (H)   Animal enclosures or cages. Animal cages or enclosures accessory to
residential uses shall be limited in size to fifteen (15) feet in length by ten
(10) feet in width. They shall not exceed six (6) feet in height and shall
provide a ten (10) foot side setback and a fifteen (15) foot rear setback.

PART 2: TEMPORARY USES AND STRUCTURES
§ 174.020 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide standards for specific land uses
and structures that are allowable on a temporary basis. The regulations of this
chapter are intended to supplement, rather than supersede, the district
regulations found in
Chapter 173.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 174.021 MODEL HOMES/MODEL DISPLAY GROUP (EARLY START HOMES).
   Model homes are permitted in conjunction with new residential developments
provided they meet the following standards.
   (A)   Single family model homes must be located on a single lot. Model
units, however, are also permitted in any townhouse or multiple-family
building.
   (B)   Model homes must be connected to water, sewer and electricity and must
receive a certificate of occupancy as a model home only, prior to use as a
model for public use.
   (C)   Model homes may be approved only in areas where they will not
adversely affect existing residents.
   (D)   Multiple model display groups or early start homes permitted under
this code shall not be open to the public before a certificate of occupancy is
issued.
   (E)   Each model home must comply with the applicable zoning and sign
regulations.
   (F)   Model homes are not required to be constructed with garages, even in
districts where such garages would normally be required, provided the following
criteria are met:
      (1)   Prior to cessation of the use of the home as a model home, the
builder must construct an operational garage door along the front face of the
home. This garage door is required to be in place and operational prior to
either selling the home or renting the home.
      (2)   Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the builder must
file an affidavit with the Building Division certifying that the requirements
of this section will be complied with prior to selling or renting the home for
non-model home use.
   (G)   Except when located in a group, all parking facilities for model homes
shall be on private property. There shall be no paving, surfacing, or laying of
any material within any adjoining right-of-way for parking purposes.
   (H)   For model display groups, three off-street vehicular parking spaces,
including the garage, shall be provided on the site or on an adjacent vacant
property. Adjacent vacant single-family lot(s) may be used for model home
parking. A plan to provide parking on an adjacent parcel shall require
ownership by the same or an affidavit of authorization from the property owner
as well as a surety deposit payable to the city to convert the property back to
a residential or other permitted use when the structure is converted or sold.
An accessible (ADA) parking space is required and shall be counted as one of
the three required spaces.
   (I)   Model homes shall have a way for prospective purchasers, visitors and
prospective customers to get from parking facilities to the model home. Such
access shall be forty-four (44) inches wide and must be either paved in
accordance with this code of ordinances or be graded and covered with mulch.
   (J)   Model homes must be designed for public access and shall, therefore,
meet accessibility requirements throughout the home, per the current Florida
Building Code, Accessibility. This shall include handrail and grab bar
requirements.
   (K)   No model home may be used for living purposes either temporarily or
permanently while used as a model home or model display unit.
   (L)   No real estate sales except those incidentals to the sale of model
homes, model display units or lots within the development may be conducted in a
model home or model unit.
   (M)   The model home permit shall automatically expire upon the sale or
transfer of the model home, except that if ownership of the model home is
transferred to a qualified company, the model home permit may be transferred to
the new owner. In the event the model home is sold, and the permit holder
leases the model home from the purchaser, the permit holder may continue to
operate the model home for the remainder of the permitted term, provided the
permit holder is otherwise in compliance with this chapter. If the qualified
company is not the original permit holder and the qualifying agent resigns or
otherwise ceases to serve as the qualifying agent, the permit shall
automatically expire and shall not be renewed.
   (N)   A model home can be utilized as an example of a product offered for
sale by the realtor, builder, developer, or contractor for the development.
However, a model home unit shall not operate or function as a construction
office. The model home shall be used primarily for demonstrating the type of
units offered in the subdivision.
   (O)   If a garage is proposed to be used as an office for a model home, the
applicant must submit the following with the building permit application:
      (1)   Floor plan showing temporary walls, electrical and plumbing
facilities. All the accessibility requirements for a business use must be met.
      (2)   The plan should include a block note stating that a change of
occupancy application will be submitted along with a building permit
application that details the garage conversion when it is returned to the
original use along with a ten thousand dollar ($10,000.00) refundable surety to
ensure that the garage is converted back to the original use.
   (P)   Model homes on properties zoned under any non-commercial/industrial
district shall comply with the provisions set forth in this section except to
the extent such provisions are modified by the City Council when the zoning is
approved or subsequently amended.
   (Q)   Any model home not in compliance with the provisions of this section
shall be brought into compliance with these provisions within sixty (60) days
of the effective date of this section. Thereafter, violations of the provisions
of this section shall be presented to the Code Enforcement Board as provided by
law.

occupancy is issued.
   (I)   Except as otherwise provided herein, a mobile food vendor may only
operate on a lot that has a principal structure. However, operating on a vacant
lot is permitted where the vacant lot is under the same ownership as, and is
abutting, a lot that has a principal structure. Lots located across a public

§ 174.035 COMMUNICATION TOWERS AND FACILITIES.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to uniformly regulate the
size, number, type and location of communication towers, antennas and support
facilities. Advances in information technology and the Federal
Telecommunications Act of 1996 generated an increase in the number of requests
to site commercial communication support facilities in the city. The city
encourages advances in communication technology that better serve its residents
and does not prohibit communication systems. However, the purpose of the
chapter is to protect city character and public safety by controlling tower,
antenna, and facilities location, height, construction, and aesthetics ensuring
that communication systems are compatible with surrounding land uses. Moreover,
the city seeks to discourage visual clutter resulting from the potential,
simultaneous deployment and proliferation of multiple communication towers or
systems. To that end, this chapter is intended to encourage the co-location of
communication antennas on existing public or private utility facilities, and to
either camouflage antennas, towers and other communication facilities, or
minimize visual impacts of communication systems through careful design,
siting, buffering, and landscaping.
   (B)   Applicability. The terms and provisions of this chapter shall apply to
all communication facilities on land lying within the city limits, including
publicly owned land, rights-of-way, and easements except as provided in
subsection (C), below. This chapter shall supersede all conflicting ordinances
or codes regarding the locating and permitting of communication facilities.
   (C)   Exceptions. The following exceptions to complying with the
requirements of this chapter shall be permitted:
      (1)   Any communication tower or antenna that is owned and operated by a
federally licensed amateur radio operator.
      (2)   Any communication antenna which is not attached to a communication
tower or building which is accessory to any commercial, industrial,
residential, institutional, multi-family, or public utility structure provided
that:
         (a)   The communication antenna does not exceed twenty (20) feet above
the highest point of the structure. This includes ground mounted satellite dish
antennas that are regulated as accessory structures in the Zoning Code.
         (b)   Communication antennas that comply with all applicable FCC, FAA,
and State of Florida regulations.
         (c)   The communication antenna complies with applicable building
codes.
      (3)   The communication antenna or tower is located in U.S. military
facilities, regardless of size.
      (4)   Temporary telecommunications towers that comply with applicable FCC
regulations.
   (D)   General requirements.
      (1)   Communication towers and communication antennas must comply with
all applicable Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) regulations. Proof of FAA approval is required for all
communication tower applications.
      (2)   Any structurally adequate structure including interstate signs and
billboards, may be used to support one or more antennas. Appropriate structures
are buildings, water towers, utility poles, monopoles, and towers.
      (3)   An applicant seeking to construct a tower must demonstrate that
there are no reasonable opportunities to locate the antenna(s) on existing
towers or other support structures within a two (2) mile radius of the proposed
tower. An engineer's report submitted to the city must show one or more of the
following:
         (a)   No existing towers or structures have sufficient height to meet
the applicant's engineering requirements.
         (b)   No existing towers or structures have sufficient structural
strength to support the proposed antenna and related equipment.
         (c)   The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with or would be interfered with by other antennas if placed on
any existing tower or structure.
         (d)   Other information that demonstrates that the wireless carrier's
designated service cannot be provided through placement of the antennas on
existing structures.
         (e)   There are other bona fide limiting engineering factors submitted
to the city that preclude co-location.
      (4)   No signs or advertising shall be permitted on towers, antennas, or
ground mounted facilities.
      (5)   All tower plans must be designed and sealed by a professional
engineer registered in the State of Florida.
      (6)   Communication towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel or
concrete finish appearance or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA,
be painted so as to reduce the visual obtrusiveness of the structure.
      (7)   Temporary telecommunications towers associated with a special event
shall be permitted for a limited period of time by the City Manager as part of
the event, not to exceed the time of the special event. Temporary
telecommunications towers necessary to aid in post disaster relief efforts are
exempt from this permitting process.
      (8)   In addition to the general requirements for the filing of a
building permit application, the applicant shall include a statement in writing
that the proposed communications facility shall be maintained in a safe manner,
and in compliance with all conditions of the building permit, including all
conditions of any conditional use approvals.
      (9)   Construction of the communications facility, and all other work
performed at the site, shall only be conducted by persons with a Florida's
contractor's license.
   (E)   Where permitted.
      (1)   Freestanding communication towers and all other communication
facilities may be permitted by right or conditional use as stated in
Chapter 173.
      (2)   Freestanding communication towers, antennas, and other equipment

PART 1: TREE PRESERVATION CODE
§ 175.001 (RESERVED).
§ 175.002 INTENT.
   (A)   The city finds that trees provide many environmental, aesthetic, and
economic functions. It is declared to be essential to preserve trees as a means
to:
      (1)   Protect the value of lands and water quality;
      (2)   Preserve community appearance; and
      (3)   Assist climate control, soil stabilization, oxygen exchange, and
noise and air pollution abatement.
   (B)   These factors relate to the economy of the city and provide for the
health, safety and welfare of residents and visitors of the city. It is the
intent of this code to provide for the enhancement, preservation, and
protection of the city's existing tree canopy and to regulate the removal,
relocation, or destruction of trees.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 175.003 REMOVAL CRITERIA.
   The following justifications shall be considered for the proposed removal of
existing tree(s) and vegetation:
   (A)   Necessity to remove trees which present a hazard or other unsafe
condition to people, vehicular traffic, or threaten to cause disruption to
public services or public easements;
   (B)   Removal of Class I invasive species of trees and/or vegetation (as
identified annually by the Florida Invasive Species Council) which
characteristically becomes nuisance overgrowth and outcompetes native
vegetation;
   (C)   Necessity to remove diseased or fallen trees or trees weakened by age,
storm, or fire;
   (D)   The extent to which tree or vegetation removal is likely to result in
damage to the property or structures of the applicant or others, public or
private, including damage to buildings accessory structures, lakes, ponds,
streams or rivers, drainage canals or swales;
   (E)   Proposed landscaping improvements including plans whereby the
applicant has planted or will plant trees or vegetation to replace those that
are proposed to be cleared;
   (F)   Necessity to remove trees or vegetation in order to construct proposed
improvements to allow economic use of the property, including the need for
access for construction equipment (maximum of ten feet) and essential grade
changes;
   (G)   Topography of the land and the adverse impact of tree or vegetation
removal on erosion, soil retention and the diversion or increased flow of
surface water, which is necessary to use the land while conserving natural
resources;
   (H)   Must be removed so the applicant may use the property for any use
permitted, conditional, or special use for the zoning district in which the
property is located and that such a use could not be made of the property
unless the tree is removed; and
   (I)   Alternative site plans shall be considered to determine if protected
trees, specimen trees, and native vegetation may be retained.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 175.004 PROTECTION OF TREES TO BE PRESERVED.
   (A)   All trees not approved for removal shall be protected and maintained
during site preparation and construction, as specified herein:
      (1)   Identification of trees to be preserved. All trees to be preserved
shall be identified on-site with harmless bands, flagging, or other suitable
markings. These shall correspond with the approved site plan.
      (2)   For all activities requiring a site plan, the method of protection
shall appear in the graphic details within the approved site plan.
      (3)   All efforts shall be made through the grading and drainage plan to
maintain the natural drainage to those trees to be preserved. Swaling and minor
negative grade changes should always be designed outside the critical root zone
as much as possible. Piping should be used where deep swales or ditches would
require significant grade changes adjacent to trees to be saved. Trenching of
any type should be avoided in the CRZ. Where underground installations are
required adjacent to the trunks of trees to be preserved, tunneling should be
used. When trenching or tunneling near trees to remain, all possible protective
measures should be taken.
      (4)   Critical root zone (CRZ). Shall be established for each tree
retained on site. This shall be calculated by taking the DBH of the tree and
multiplying by twelve (12). This is the diameter in inches of the CRZ, centered
on the tree. Visible barricades shall be erected along the CRZ line of all
trees to be protected. These barricades shall be no closer than the calculated
CRZ or ten (10) feet from the trunk of the tree, whichever is greater. The CRZ
for all existing palms shall be three (3) feet from trunk. For clusters of four
(4) or more trees, a limit of development shall be indicated on the site plan
which provides no less than twelve (12) feet of protection from the base of the
outermost trees. The following activities shall be limited within the CRZ as
described herein:
         (a)   All felled material shall be promptly and carefully removed from
the site in order to avoid potential damage to remaining trees and vegetation;
         (b)   Underbrush and vegetation within the CRZ shall be hand cleared;
         (c)   Materials, machinery, and soil shall not be placed within the
CRZ; and
         (d)   Materials, wires, signs, or nails shall not be attached to any
tree unless such materials are used to preserve the tree.
   (B)   All trees to be preserved, except palms, shall have their natural soil
level maintained to the maximum extent practicable. Tree wells, retaining
walls, or landscape timbers may be utilized where necessary to maintain the
natural existing soil level.

subchapter shall constitute an individual violation. The property owner,
contractor and/or authorized agent shall be issued a stop work order and/or a
violation notice and shall have one (1) week to apply for a site work permit
for which the application fee shall be equal to twice the standard fee for the
permit pursuant to §
172.011. The following penalties may also apply.
      (1)   Restoration plan. Dependent on the extent of violation, a
restoration plan may be required. For proposed development sites, the
restoration plan may be incorporated into the landscape plan as part of a site
plan submittal. A stop-work order will be issued when applicable and the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any attendant structure(s) will be
withheld until the restoration requirements have been satisfied. The following
information shall be incorporated into the restoration plan, where applicable:
         (a)   Identify the locations of new tree(s) and vegetation plantings
to restore the site, providing:
            1.   One (1) restoration tree as described shall be shown for each
six (6) inches of trunk diameter at breast height (DBH) of those specimen
trees, having twelve (12) or more inches DBH which was severely damaged, cut
down, or removed from the site. Each required restoration tree shall have a
minimum five (5) inch DBH trunk and a minimum height of fifteen (15) feet and
shall be a native canopy species approved by the City Manager or designee.
            2.   One (1) replacement tree shall be shown for each protected
tree, having from six (6) inches to less than twelve (12) inches DBH, which was
severely damaged, cut down or removed from the site. Each required replacement
tree shall have a minimum two and one- half (2.5) inch DBH trunk, three (3)
feet of clear wood, a minimum height of fifteen (12) feet and shall be a native
canopy species approved by the City Manager or designee.
         (b)   Provide irrigation system or method for the maintenance for the
new trees, in compliance with §

         (d)   Indicate a schedule for the restoration to occur which shall at
the latest coincide with the final inspection for a site development, where
applicable, or within three (3) months where final inspections would not
normally occur. If the restoration does not occur within the approved time
schedule, each day of which the property is not in compliance shall constitute
a violation of this subchapter and the violation shall be presented to Special
Magistrate for action.
      (2)   Mitigation fees. Should it be determined that a restoration plan is
not feasible, then for each restoration tree not replanted as required above,
the specimen tree mitigation fee shall be paid and for each protected tree not
replanted as required above, the protected tree mitigation fee shall be paid
pursuant to §
172.011.
      (3)   Stormwater violation. Conducting site work activities without an
approved drainage plan is in violation of the Stormwater Management and
Conservation Ordinance and may be subject to the penalties provided in §

   (A)   Applicability. Sites with off-street parking areas in excess of one
thousand five hundred (1,500) square feet, or five (5) spaces, shall conform to
the minimum landscaping requirements set forth in this section. Single-family
and duplex residential uses on individually platted lots and multilevel parking
structures shall be exempt from this section. All landscaped areas shall be
protected from vehicular encroachment by curbs, wheel stops or other similar
devices.
      (1)   When existing off-street parking or other vehicular use areas are
enlarged, the enlarged areas shall meet the provisions of this section. The
newly enlarged areas shall not cause the existing parking area landscaping to
be more nonconforming.
      (2)   When existing off-street parking or other vehicular use areas are
modified, the modification shall not cause the existing parking area
landscaping to be more nonconforming. The intent of this provision is that any
existing off-street parking or vehicular use areas shall, when feasible, become
more conforming to the landscaping requirements of this section. Determination
of the feasibility of modifying the existing parking or vehicular use areas, to
become more conforming, shall be made by the City Manager or designee. This
determination shall be based on the following considerations:
         (a)   Cost of compliance with specific criteria in the parking area
landscaping code;
         (b)   Physical space available within the existing areas to comply
with specific criteria in the parking area landscaping codes, such as existing
"green" spaces;
         (c)   The extent that existing conditions represent safety hazards;
and
         (d)   The extent to which modification addresses other criteria within
the Code of Ordinances, such as, but not limited to, enhanced landscape
installation, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),
stormwater management requirements, and similar regulations.
   (B)   Minimum landscaping required in vehicular use areas. 
      (1)   Required interior parking area landscaping. All parking areas shall
be internally landscaped to provide visual and climatic relief from broad
expanses of pavement and to channelize and define logical areas for pedestrian
and vehicular circulation.
         (a)   Interior landscaping, excluding required parking setbacks, shall
account for ten percent (10%) of the total parking area. Landscape dividing
strips, with or without walkways, shall be used to subdivide the parking area
into rows with not more than an average of ten (10) spaces, per row except that
parking rows adjacent to required landscape row dividers shall only be required
such landscape strips at the end of each landscape row divider.
         (b)   Each separate landscape area shall contain a minimum of one
hundred (100) square feet and shall have a minimum dimension of at least ten
(10) feet, measured at its narrowest area, except that islands required to be
designed with turn radii are permitted to have less than ten (10) feet if
approved by the City Manager or designee, and shall include at least one (1)
tree, with the remaining area meeting the requirements of this code.
         (c)   The total number of trees shall not be less than one (1) per two
hundred (200) square feet or fraction thereof of required interior landscaped
area and shall exclude those trees required along the perimeter of the parcel.
Such landscaped areas shall be protected from vehicular encroachment by curbs,
wheel stops or landscape timbers.
         (d)   Whenever an off-street parking area is designed to provide
parking of vehicles in five (5) rows or more, at least one (1) interior
landscaped area not less than ten (10) feet in width shall be provided for the
length of the parking rows, with at least one (1) landscaped row divider
required for every five (5) parking rows.
         (e)   Landscaped areas, including landscaped islands, within or
abutting vehicular use areas shall be excavated to a depth of two (2) feet to
remove lot base course material, lime rock, asphalt, concrete, and similar
material in order to ensure that adequate planting soil exists.
         (f)   In parking areas where the strict application of this section
will seriously limit the function of such areas, such as off-street loading
areas, the required landscaping may be located near the perimeter of the paved
area. Such interior landscaping which is relocated as herein provided shall be
in addition to the perimeter landscaping requirements.
         (g)   The front of a vehicle may encroach upon any interior landscaped
area or walkway when the area is at least three and one-half (3.5) feet in
depth per abutting parking space and protected by motor vehicle stops or
curbing. An overhang may be permitted in such landscaped area or walkway. If
shrubs or hedges are planted in front of such parking areas, the shrubs must be
planted a minimum of three and one-half (3.5) feet from the back of the curb or
wheel stop to prevent damage to the hedge.
         (h)   Interior landscaped areas may be used for retention and
detention sites for groundwater recharge.
         (i)   Landscape vines, shrubs, or a combination of the two, are
required to be planted along the outside of subdivision walls or any required
masonry walls facing canal, road, or other rights-of-way.

      (3)   The fees as set forth in this section shall be increased by four
percent (4%) (rounded to the nearest dollar) each fiscal year. Should any
decrease in such fees be warranted in any given year, they shall also be
decreased annually by that percentage that accurately reflects the reduction of
permits requested and the specific and ascertainable resulting reduction in
funds needed to pay the city costs to manage all services and time needed to
issue and monitor the permits required by this section.
   (C)   Bond. A performance bond, or other financial security approved by the
City Attorney, may be required in the case where the specified work is
incomplete and certificate of occupancy has been requested, or when damages to
the right-of-way or any public property has been done and not repaired in
accordance with good engineering practices or the Driveway Permit Guidelines,
or when the work is nonconforming as determined by the Public Works Department.
In addition to paying the fees established by the Council, a performance bond
or other security approved by the City Attorney in the amount of one hundred
dollars ($100.00) nonrefundable processing fee, plus two thousand dollars
($2,000.00) retainer refundable upon completion of specified work within thirty
(30) days. If the work in question exceeds a value of two thousand dollars
($2,000.00), the bond amount shall be increased by the difference plus ten
percent (10%). If said work is incomplete after thirty (30) days, the bond will
be forfeited. All such bonds or other security arrangements shall be on forms
approved by the City Attorney. Such forms shall prescribe the manner in which
noncompliance with the provisions of a permit, or this subchapter, shall be
remedied and shall provide the necessary financial assurances to remedy any
non-compliance.

PART 4: OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS
§ 176.040 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose and intent of this section is to set forth parking requirements
in proportion to the parking demand for each use to ensure functionally
adequate, efficient, aesthetically pleasing, and secure off-street parking
facilities, and to provide for on-street parking in certain circumstances. The
regulations and design standards of this section are intended to ensure the
usefulness of parking facilities, protect the public safety, and mitigate
potential adverse land use impacts.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)

issued for remodeling or structural alterations in existing developments
without requiring compliance with this section provided such redevelopment does
not result in an increase in the number of required parking spaces.
   (B)   Change of use. The number of parking spaces required by this section
may be reduced when the use of a building is changed or reduced to a use or
floor area for which fewer parking spaces are required. When the use is changed
to a use for which more parking spaces are required, the number of spaces shall
be increased to comply with the off-street parking schedule and design
standards. Off-street parking requirements may be met with shared or satellite
parking areas as described elsewhere in this chapter.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 176.043 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.

requirements for single-family dwellings, duplexes, and mobile homes provided
that sufficient space is available exclusive of right-of-way or road easements.
   (B)   Commercial vehicle parking or storage. No required parking space shall
be used to park a commercial vehicle or other uses which may interfere with
normal off-street parking needs. See §
74.25 of the Code of Ordinances for the definition of commercial vehicle and
other restrictions.
   (C)   Emergency vehicles. Parking which blocks emergency vehicles on either
public or private roads shall not be permitted.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 176.044 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All parking spaces, and access drives shall be improved in accordance
with the design standards set forth in the current edition of the City of Palm
Bay Public Works Manual and the Land Development Code.
   (B)   Each parking space shall have a minimum width of ten (10) feet and a
minimum length of nineteen (19) feet. If a parking space contains a wheel stop
or abuts a curbed or landscaped island, an overhang may be permitted, and the
length of the space thereby shortened to a minimum of sixteen (16) feet.
      (1)   Accessible spaces shall follow the current editions of the ADA, the
FDOT Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), the Florida
Accessibility Code for Building Construction (FACBC), and F.S. Ch. 553.
      (2)   Wheel stops may be used to prevent a vehicle from encroaching on
adjacent sidewalks or property. The wheel stop shall be set back a distance
that provides an unobstructed sidewalk width of four (4) feet to meet the
Americans with Disabilities Act and the Florida Accessibility Code for
Construction.
   (C)   All off-street parking areas shall be designed to have adequate access
to a public street or alley. The function and operation of the proposed parking
type must be compatible with and appropriate for the type of parking proposed.
Back-out parking or any other type parking utilizing the public right-of-way as
an access aisle is prohibited except when applied to single-family and duplex
land uses.
   (D)   Interior aisle widths shall conform to the minimum requirements below:
 
              Aisle Width
Parking Angle One-Way Two-Way

Parallel      12 feet 22 feet
 
   (E)   All parking lots shall include pedestrian circulation along the
perimeter of the parking area adjacent to the buildings and through the parking
area from the sidewalk along the street providing access to the site and to the
entrance of the primary building. Pedestrian pathways shall be a minimum of
five (5) feet wide.
   (F)   Where off-street parking is required, such required parking areas
shall be used for vehicular parking only. No sales (unless a special event
permit has been approved), dead storage, repair work, dismantling or servicing
of any kind shall be conducted, and the required areas in the various zoning
districts shall be in addition to the loading and service spaces normally
required for the business or office served.
   (G)   Where off-street parking is required, such parking shall be provided
on the same lot or premises as the business or office which is being served. In
the event the use of the lot or premises expands or changes and would require
additional parking that cannot be accommodated on-site, the parking requirement
may be satisfied off-site by following the provisions of §
176.048 (Satellite parking).
   (H)   Where artificial lighting is provided, it shall be designed and
arranged so that no source of such lighting will be a visible nuisance to
adjoining property used or zoned for a residential purpose. In addition, such
lighting shall be designed and arranged to shield public streets and highways
and all adjacent properties from direct glare or hazardous interference of any
kind. All lighting shall meet the standards provided for in Chapter 177, Part
3.
   (I)   All required off-street parking areas shall be provided in compliance
with the landscaping provisions of
Chapter 175.
   (J)   Parking lots permitted prior to adoption of the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) may be re-painted atop the existing parking space
striping and will be considered maintenance. However, parking areas that are
modified from this original layout shall be redesigned meeting the ADA
requirements, inclusive of parking space striping, signage, markings, and
handicapped ramps (where applicable). The site must still meet the minimum
number of parking spaces as provided for in this section.
   (K)   All parking spaces, loading spaces and drives shall meet the setbacks
established for principal structures. All vehicular use areas, including
parking and drive aisles, shall have durable, all-weather surfaces with
drainage and surface water control as required by the City of Palm Bay Public
Works Manual, unless waived in conformance with subsection (L) below.
   (L)   If deemed appropriate, the City Manager or designee may waive the
paving requirements for facilities where parking is used not more than eight
hours in any seven-day period, such the overflow parking for a church or a
stadium.
   (M)   No side parking area setbacks are required for shared parking lots
provided all of the following provisions are met:
      (1)   Buildings on adjacent parcels are joined by parking areas and
aisles;
      (2)   Curb cuts and driveways on principal roadways (collector and
arterial streets) are shared in common by all parcels involved and a minimum
spacing of two hundred (200) feet in the Highway Commercial district, one
hundred (100) feet in the General Commercial district and one hundred fifty
(150) feet in all other districts is maintained; or access is provided by an
approved frontage road;
      (3)   Easements and/or written assurances of cross access and a sharing
of common facilities (stormwater system, solid waste container(s), lighting,
landscaping, etc.), as may be applicable, from all property owners involved
must be approved prior to the issuance of a building permit;
      (4)   For adjacent developments meeting the requirements of subsections
(M)(1) through (3) above, the total number of off-street parking spaces
required for uses on all parcels involved may be reduced per §
176.045 (Shared parking).
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 176.045 SHARED PARKING.
   (A)   The standards and peak parking analysis contained in the most current
edition of "Parking Generation" by the Institute of Transportation Engineers
(ITE), are hereby adopted and shall be referenced in any calculation of shared
parking.
   (B)   The City Manager or designee may permit the required parking spaces
for one use to be shared with required parking spaces for one or more uses upon
a finding that:
      (1)   The shared parking spaces are in close proximity and readily
accessible to the uses served; and
      (2)   The uses served have different peak parking demands and operating
hours; and
      (3)   The design of the parking area in terms of traffic circulation,
vehicular and pedestrian access, stormwater management, landscaping, open space
preservation, and public safety meets the requirements of this code.
   (C)   It shall be the responsibility of an applicant for shared parking
approval to provide a description of the uses, site plan(s), trip generation
report, parking study and other information necessary to permit a finding by
the City Manager or designee regarding the request for shared parking.
   (D)   In granting approval to meet the parking requirement with shared
parking, the City Manager or designee may require an agreement for shared
parking be made between or among the appropriate parties in the form of a
shared parking agreement with easement(s) in recordable form acceptable to the
City Attorney's office. Such document shall be recorded in the public records
of Brevard County, Florida.

§ 176.046 PARKING COMPUTATIONS.
   (A)   Acceptable thresholds. As part of an approval of new construction, a
change in use, substantial renovation, or expansion of an existing shopping
center, the applicant shall calculate the required number of spaces as listed
in §
176.047 (Number of off-street parking spaces required). The number of
handicapped parking spaces shall be as required by applicable Florida Statutes.
   (B)   Unlisted uses. Upon receiving a development application for a use not
listed in §
176.047, the City Manager or designee shall apply the parking and loading
requirements for the listed use most similar in parking needs to the use for
which development approval is requested.
   (C)   Multiple uses. Lots containing more than one (1) use shall provide
parking in an amount equal to the total of the requirements for all uses unless
a shared parking arrangement is approved pursuant to §
176.045 (Shared parking).
   (D)   Fractions. When calculations of the number of required spaces result
in fractions, any fraction up to one-half shall be disregarded and any fraction
of one-half or more shall be rounded upward to the next highest full number.
   (E)   Floor area. For the purpose of computing parking requirements which
are based on the amount of square footage in buildings, calculations shall be
on a gross floor area basis, unless otherwise indicated.
   (F)   Employees. For the purpose of computing parking requirements based on
the number of employees, calculations shall be for the largest number of
persons working on any single shift, including owners and managers.
   (G)   On-street parking. On-street parking spaces along the front property
line shall be counted toward the minimum number of parking spaces required for
that use on that lot, except where there are driveway curb cuts within the MUC
and MU zoning districts.
   (H)   Tree preservation. The City Manager or designee may allow a maximum
reduction of one (1) space or ten percent (10%) of the total number of parking
spaces required, whichever is greater, may be permitted to save onsite specimen
or historic trees.
   (I)   Maximum parking. The total number of parking spaces provided shall not
exceed 1.15 times the minimum required number of spaces.

(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 177.005 COMMON OPEN SPACE.
   (A)   Intent. It is the purpose of this section to promote the development
of a well-integrated open space system; to assure adequate maintenance of
common open space areas; protect and enhance the natural resources and
environment; and to implement the recreation element and other applicable
elements of the Comprehensive Plan.
   (B)   Applicability. The standards of this section shall apply to all
applications for development. This section, however, shall not apply to planned
unit developments (see
Chapter 173 for requirements specific to PUDs), individual building permits or
individual mobile homes.
   (C)   Requirement for common open space. Unless specifically stated in other
sections of this land development code, a minimum of twenty percent (20%) of a
residential development or ten percent (10%) of a non-residential development
shall be dedicated to common open space. Required common open space shall not
include landscaped areas within parking lots, land designated for city
neighborhood or community parks, foundation plantings, or stormwater retention
areas, unless the retention area is enhanced with LID, native landscaped areas,
pathways, or gathering areas. Lakes may be counted as open space if access to
water recreation is provided (e.g., boating, swimming, fishing).
   (D)   Location. Required common open space shall be located within the
development site and, to the extent feasible, shall be closely integrated with
any adjoining or nearby existing or planned public park land recreational open
space.
   (E)   Quality. Lands designated for common open space shall be suitable for
their intended purpose, taking into consideration such factors as topography,
vegetation, drainage, size, maintenance access, and relationship to surrounding
uses and other factors as determined by the City Manager or designee.
   (F)   Dedication. Common open space may be held under single ownership and
management, such as for rental apartments or the common open space held in
common by residents or property owners through a homeowner's association,
condominium association, cooperative or other legal entity. Or it may be
dedicated to the City of Palm Bay for public park and recreation purposes, if
the City Manager or designee determines that the land or water body to be
dedicated is of sufficient size and meets a public park need for the city. No
waterbody constructed and authorized to provide stormwater management for the
site shall on its own be dedicated as open space or public park or for
recreation.
   (G)   Phasing. Required common open space shall be calculated for each phase
of a multiphase project. Open space areas shall be located contiguous to each
other and in a manner that provides for a harmonious flow from one phase to the
next where feasible. Open space must be developed according to a schedule tied
to a percentage of building permits to assure completion prior to final build-
out. Open space for each phase shall be provided at the same time as or in
advance of the phase for which it is required.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 177.006 FRONTAGE ON STREET.

§ 177.007 SUBDIVISION ACCESS.
   All subdivisions shall be designed with at least two public means of ingress
and egress to/from arterial or collector streets. An adjustment in the number
of required public means of ingress and egress under this paragraph may be
authorized pursuant to §
172.026.
   Each public means of ingress and egress to a subdivision shall intersect an
arterial or collector street different from the arterial or collector street
intersected by any other required public means of ingress and egress to the
subdivision. If it is not possible for the required number of public means of
ingress and egress to a subdivision to intersect different arterial or
collector streets, the public means of ingress and egress may intersect the
same arterial or collector street; however, the points of intersection must be
located a minimum of one thousand (1,000) feet apart. If an adjustment is
authorized pursuant to §
172.026, such that only one public means of ingress and egress is required
under this paragraph, the subdivision shall be designed to provide at least one
additional means of ingress and egress for emergency vehicles OR street stubs
to adjoining undeveloped areas shall be provided when required to give access
to such areas or to provide for proper traffic circulation. Street stubs
exceeding two hundred fifty (250) feet in length shall be provided with a
temporary cul-de-sac turnaround.

subdivision as well as those off-site streets required to be improved as a part
of the subdivision, shall be designed, graded, paved, and improved to conform
to
Chapter 176, and the City of Palm Bay Public Works Manual, and shall be
approved as to design and specification by the city engineer.
   (B)   Subdivision abuts arterial or major collector street. Where a
subdivision abuts an existing or proposed arterial or major collector street,
the City Council may require frontage access streets, reverse frontage with
screening consisting of a six (6)-foot wall, fence or berm with landscaping
contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line, or such
other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential
properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
   (C)   Subdivision borders on railroad or limited access highway. When a
subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access
highway right-of-way, the City Council may require a street or alley
approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way.
   (D)   Reserve strips prohibited; exception. Reserve strips controlling
access to streets shall be prohibited except where their control is definitely
placed in the city under conditions approved by the City Council.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 177.009 SIDEWALKS/PEDESTRIAN WAYS AND BIKEWAYS.
   (A)   General requirements. Sidewalks/pedestrian ways and bikeways are to be
provided on all streets in all new subdivisions and shall meet the standards of
Chapter 176. Where there are no existing sidewalks adjacent to a proposed
subdivision, the developer may post a sidewalk bond (or cash bond) equal to one
hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the cost of constructing the sidewalk and
any necessary ramps and or crosswalk striping. A cost estimate shall be
submitted by the Project Engineer during the final subdivision process, for
city staff review. The city shall put the bond into escrow until such a time as
the city provides sidewalks in the vicinity of the subdivision.
   (B)   Waiver from sidewalk requirement. The City Council may waive the
requirement for sidewalks where it determines and finds that sidewalks may be
inappropriate for the subdivision being proposed (for example, large acre rural
subdivision that does not connect to an existing or proposed sidewalk system).
   (C)   Sidewalk connections.
      (1)   Required sidewalks within a subdivision shall connect to the nearby
existing sidewalks or sidewalk locations shown on the Sidewalk Master Plan.
Such connections must be made if the existing or planned sidewalk is within
five hundred (500) feet of the closest subdivision sidewalk. Such connection
shall be identified during the preliminary plat process and shall be identified
on the construction plans and as-built survey.
      (2)   Safe and direct pedestrian connection shall be provided to nearby
educational facilities.

(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
PART 2: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION
§ 177.020 FINDING OF FACTS.
   The City Council finds that uncontrolled stormwater management and
development of land may have a significantly adverse impact upon the quality of
the waters of the community, generally:
   (A)   Stormwater runoff carries pollutants into receiving water bodies,
degrading water quality;
   (B)   The increase in nutrients accelerates eutrophication of receiving
waters, adversely affecting fauna and flora;
   (C)   Improper channeling of water increases the velocity of runoff, thereby
increasing erosion;
   (D)   Construction requiring the alteration of natural topography and
removal of vegetation increases erosion;
   (E)   Siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases
their capacity to hold and transport water, interferes with navigation and
harms fauna and flora;
   (F)   Impervious surfaces increase the quantity and velocity of stormwater
runoff. Less water percolates into the soil and recharge of groundwaters is
thereby decreased;
   (G)   Uncontrolled stormwater runoff increases the incidence of flooding and
the level of floods which occur, possibly destroying property and causing loss
of life;
   (H)   Uncontrolled stormwater runoff interferes with the maintenance of
optimum salinity in estuarine areas.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 177.021 OBJECTIVES.
   In order to protect, maintain, and enhance both the immediate and the long-
term health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, this
subchapter has the following objectives:
   (A)   To encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and nature;
   (B)   To provide protection of land, improvements, and natural resources
through responsible stormwater management, which includes pollution abatement
and flood protection;
   (C)   To prevent individuals, business organizations, and governments from
causing harm to the community through development activities which adversely
affect water resources;
   (D)   To encourage the construction of stormwater drainage systems that
functionally approximate the natural system;
   (E)   To encourage the protection of natural conveyance systems and the use
of them in ways which do not impair their beneficial functioning;
   (F)   To encourage the use of stormwater management systems which minimize
the consumption of electrical energy or petroleum fuels to move water, remove
pollutants, or maintain the system;
   (G)   To reduce pollution in stormwater runoff that cause adverse impact to
the quality of receiving waters;
   (H)   To maintain or restore groundwater levels and groundwater quality;
   (I)   To protect, restore and maintain natural salinity levels in estuarine
areas;
   (J)   To minimize erosion and sedimentation;
   (K)   To prevent damage to and encourage protection of wetlands;
   (L)   To protect, restore, and maintain the physical and biological
integrity of groundwater and stormwater to serve their uses as designated by
the State;
   (M)   To prevent damage from flooding, while recognizing the natural
fluctuations in water levels are beneficial;
   (N)   To protect, restore, and maintain the habitat of fish and wildlife;
   (O)   To provide for stormwater infiltration, settling of suspended solids
and removal of pollutants from runoff prior to discharge into surface waters
and the groundwater table;
   (P)   To prevent damage to hydrological and biological functions of

      (4)   Time of concentration calculations. A minimum time of concentration
of fifteen (15) minutes shall be used for all developments.
      (5)   Design storm, including duration, frequency, precipitation, and
type of distribution, and shall be selected as follows:
         (a)   Ten (10) year, twenty-four (24) hour storm event for commencing
development for subdivisions, shopping centers, commercial or industrial
facilities.
         (b)   Twenty-five (25) year, twenty-four (24) hour storm event for any

commercial development of forty (40) acres or more.
      (6)   Stage-storage computations of any storage areas such as retention/
detention facilities used, including the computations showing the effect of the
design storm event.
      (7)   Stage-storage-discharge computations for any retention/detention
facilities at the control point or any other point as required, (e.g., weir),
including the computations showing the effect of the design storm event.

         (b)   Be designed so that the outfall structures shall bleed down one-
half (0.5) the volume of stormwater specified above, within forty- eight (48)
to sixty (60) hours following a storm event, but no more than one-half (0.5) of
this volume will be discharged within the first forty-eight (48) hours. This
treatment volume recovery requirement will be reduced if an integrated
management treatment train is used and surface retention basins recover their
volume within seventy-two (72) hours.

horizontal distance.
      (18)   The side slope on dry retention ponds shall be sodded and whenever
possible the bottom should be sodded also or seed and mulched as minimum.
      (19)   The bottom of dry retention ponds must never be compacted by heavy
equipment. Prior to Certificate of Completion or Occupancy a geotechnical

which is subject to flooding, until the area is filled to the base flood
elevation after settlement, as shown on the flood insurance rate map or the
flood hazard boundary map with amendments; or elevate the structures such that
the finished habitable floors are built to or above the applicable base flood
elevation as shown on the flood insurance rate map or the flood hazard boundary
map with amendments and have met the requirements of this chapter;
   (G)   To prevent saltwater intrusion by adhering to applicable best
management practices;
   (H)   To minimize injury to vegetation, fish and wildlife habitat and
otherwise help to attain the objectives of this subchapter.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 177.025 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   To ensure attainment of the objectives of this subchapter and that
performance standards will be met, the design, construction, and maintenance of
stormwater management systems shall be consistent with the following standards:
   (A)   Channeling stormwater runoff directly into water bodies shall be
prohibited. Instead, runoff should be routed over a longer distance, through
swales and other works designed to increase infiltration, allow suspended
solids to settle, and remove pollutants.
   (B)   Natural watercourses shall not be dredged, cleared of vegetation,
deepened, widened, straightened, stabilized, or otherwise altered unless a
clear water quality and quantity benefit is demonstrated. Water shall be
retained or detained before it enters any natural watercourse in order to
preserve the natural hydrodynamics of the watercourse and to prevent siltation
or other pollution.
   (C)   The area of land disturbed by development shall be as small as
practicable. Those areas which are not to be disturbed shall be protected by an
adequate barrier from construction activity. Whenever possible, natural
vegetation shall be retained and protected (see the Low Impact Development
Guidance Manual for Development Incentives associated with wetland and natural
vegetation preservation).
   (D)   No grading, cutting or filling shall be commenced until erosion and
sedimentation control structures have been installed between the disturbed area
and the city's MS4, surface waters and wetlands and a sitework permit has been
issued by the city.
   (E)   Land which has been cleared for development and upon which
construction has not commenced within two (2) calendar weeks shall be protected
from erosion by seeding or sodding or appropriate techniques designed to
revegetate the area.
   (F)   Sediment shall be retained on the site of the development.
   (G)   Discharge from a construction site must be treated by any best
management practice outlined in the current edition of the Florida Stormwater
Erosion and Sedimentation Control Inspectors Certification Manual Volume I.
   (H)   Wetlands and other water bodies shall be protected during
construction/development (unless approved to be impacted) and shall not be used
as primary sediment traps during development.
   (I)   Erosion and sedimentation facilities shall receive regular maintenance
to ensure that they continue to function properly. Contractors are required to
maintain erosion and sedimentation control best management practices throughout
construction and retain an NPDES certified monitor to inspect erosion and
sedimentation control best management practices and create/retain reports
during the construction and for discharge from the site during every one-half
(0.5) inch of rain or greater and maintain copies of discharge reports on site.
   (J)   No turbid discharge from the site is authorized to leave a
construction site. Turbid discharge will be stopped immediately, and greater
control measures installed.
   (K)   Artificial watercourses shall be designed, considering soil type, so
that the velocity of flow is low enough to prevent erosion.
   (L)   City and MTWCD maintained facilities are subject to the level of
service and standards the city and MTWCD respectively have the ability to
provide.
   (M)   Vegetated buffer strips shall be created or, where practicable,
retained in their natural state along the banks of all watercourses, water
bodies or wetlands. The width of the buffer shall be sufficient to prevent
erosion, trap the sediment in overland runoff, provide access to the water body
and allow for periodic flooding without damage to structures.
   (N)   Intermittent watercourses, such as swales, shall be vegetated.
   (O)   Retention and detention ponds shall be used to retain and detain the
increased and accelerated runoff which the development generates. Water shall
be released from detention ponds into watercourses or wetlands at a rate and in
a manner approximating the natural flow which would have occurred before
development.
   (P)   Although the use of wetlands for storing and purifying water is
encouraged, care must be taken not to overload their capacity, thereby harming
the wetlands and transitional vegetation.
   (Q)   Dry retention facilities, a volume sufficient to retain the runoff
from one-half (0.5) inch of rainfall of entire site (or one and one-half (1.5)
inches of runoff of impervious surfaces if greater) shall be provided,
including the volume required to reduce nutrient loading to the same or less
than pre-development.
   (R)   Wet detention facilities, no more than one-half (0.5) of this volume
may be discharged in the first seventy-two (72) hours following a storm event;
the total volume recovery occurring in fourteen (14) days.
   (S)   Volume in the permanent pool (below maintained water level) in wet
detention facilities must be sufficient to provide a residence time of at least
fourteen (14) days. This volume may be determined as one and one-half (1.5)
inches over the impervious portion of the drainage basin, plus one-half (0.5)
inch over the pervious portion of the basin.
   (T)   The inlet structure and outlet structure in wet detention facilities
shall be located so that contact between stormwater and littoral plantings is
maximized and short-circuiting is minimized. The inlet to the wet detention
pond should be baffled to reduce turbulence, and the outlet from the wet
detention pond shall be located as far as practicable from the inlet to provide
the longest flow path to allow for pollutant or sediment settling, and should
be constructed with skimmers to prevent the transmission of oils, grease, and
floating debris.
   (U)   Runoff from parking lots shall be treated to remove oil and sediment
before it enters receiving waters. Inlets shall be retrofitted with absorbent
material and skimmers must be installed on outfall structures.
   (V)   Detention and retention areas shall be designed when possible so that
shorelines are sinuous rather than straight and so that the length of shoreline
is increased, thus offering more space for the growth of littoral vegetation
and increased space for treatment.
   (W)   The use of vegetated buffer zones as open space, recreation and
conservation areas shall be encouraged.
   (X)   Disturbed areas shall be stabilized and protected from erosion as soon
as possible.
   (Y)   Retention areas shall be designed as dry- bottom ponds, with the
seasonal high groundwater table demonstrated to be at least two (2) feet below
the finished pond bottom. Wet bottom ponds may be used provided that the entity
responsible for maintenance shall not be the city.
   (Z)   Detention reservoirs may be designed as wet-bottom or dry-bottom
ponds. If designed as dry- bottom ponds, the seasonal high groundwater table
shall be demonstrated to be at least one (1) foot below the finished pond
bottom. If designed as a wet- bottomed pond, the depth shall be sufficient to
limit growth of emergent plants to designated peripheral littoral zones.
   (AA)   Surficial dry retention systems shall be designed to recover one-half
(0.5) of their volume in twenty-four (24) hours and the entire volume in
seventy-two (72) hours. Wet detention systems shall recover their volumes in
less than fourteen (14) days if used as the sole stormwater management
facility.
   (BB)   A developer may elect to implement voluntary low impact development
design standards for new development or redevelopment and may receive a
development bonus in accordance with
Part 5 of
Chapter 173.

§ 177.026 DEDICATION OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FACILITIES.
   The City Council may require, as a condition for obtaining approval for a
stormwater management plan, that the applicant contract to dedicate stormwater
management facilities to the city.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 177.027 PERMIT FEES.
   (A)   A variable permit fee shall be collected at the time the required
application package is submitted and will include the total cost of
administration, management, engineering, and inspection charges of the
permitting process. Permit fees are as established by resolution pursuant to §
172.011.
   (B)   Fees collected shall be used to offset the cost of the stormwater
management and conservation, site plan, and subdivision review service and
shall be allocated to provide recovery of cost to the department.
   (C)   The fees set forth in this section shall be increased by four percent
(4%) (rounded to the nearest dollar) each fiscal year. Should any decrease in
such fees be warranted in any given year, they shall also be decreased annually
by that percentage that accurately reflects the reduction of permits requested
and the specific and ascertainable resulting reduction in funds needed to pay
the city costs to manage all services and time needed to issue and monitor the
permits required by this section.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 177.028 OUTSIDE AGENCY AND GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES COORDINATION.
   While this subchapter is intended to be the minimum standards and criteria
for the design of stormwater management systems in the city, other regulatory
agencies or governmental entities by state statutes or by political boundaries
have equal jurisdiction. Most of these agencies or governmental entities have
established and refined design criteria for stormwater management. In some
cases, established design parameters of those agencies contain conflicting
standards or criteria. In the case of conflicting criteria, it is the intent of
this subchapter to have the most stringent regulations govern. The following is
a synopsis of those agencies and governmental entities which have overlapping
jurisdiction:
   (A)   United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE);
   (B)   St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD);
   (C)   Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT);
   (D)   Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP);
   (E)   Melbourne-Tillman Water Control District (MTWCD); and
   (F)   Brevard County.

§ 177.029 SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   Drainage requirements for single family residential construction. All
single-family residential development shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   The finished floor elevation of the proposed dwelling may not be
above the finished floor elevation of any existing side adjacent dwelling that
is adjacent to the side of the proposed dwelling by more than one (1) foot for
each four (4) feet of setback from the common property line.
      (2)   Side slopes on any area within the lot cannot exceed one (1) foot
vertical for each four (4) feet horizontal.
      (3)   In areas with municipal sanitary sewer service, the maximum height
of the finished floor elevation of a proposed dwelling cannot exceed one (1)
foot above the finished floor elevation of any existing dwelling that is
adjacent to the side of the proposed dwelling. If the proposed dwelling is not
adjacent to any existing dwellings, the maximum finished floor elevation may
also not be more than three (3) feet above the crown of the road that the
subject property abuts. Where no municipal sanitary sewer service exists, the
maximum height of the finished floor elevation of a proposed dwelling cannot
exceed six (6) inches above the finished floor elevation established by the
septic tank permit.
      (4)   The development of the proposed dwelling shall not adversely impact
the historical drainage or surrounding properties or structures of the block in
which the proposed dwelling is to be located. The developer of the proposed
dwelling unit must accommodate historical drainage by redirecting it to a legal
positive outfall.
      (5)   The drainage from the development of the proposed dwelling must be
directed to a legal positive outfall, without adversely impacting any adjacent
properties.
      (6)   To facilitate the above requirements, alternate measures other than
fill material may be utilized, including but not limited to, stem walls,
extended footers, pilings, pumped on-site sewage systems with elevated
drainfields, yard piping and inlets, or other approved methods.
   (B)   Adjacent drainage conveyance facilities.  Where the proposed dwelling
lot is adjacent to an existing drainage conveyance ditch or drainage

slope of three (3) feet horizontal to one (1) foot vertical from the centerline
of the facility to the lowest finished floor elevation, with a five (5) foot
wide buffer zone adjacent to the dwelling structure at the lowest finished
floor elevation.
      Any modifications to the drainage facility required to meet this section

      Should the applicant propose modifications to the drainage facility to
accommodate the proposed dwelling structure, the applicant shall be required to
maintain sufficient capacity in the drainage facility.
      The applicant shall provide to the lot drainage permit reviewer an
environmental resource permit or exemption from the FDEP prior to modification
of any open conveyance facility, ditch, or canal.
   (C)   Residential lot drainage permit.

172.011.
      (2)   The fees as set forth in this section shall be increased by four
percent (4%) (rounded to the nearest dollar) each fiscal year. Should any
decrease in such fees be warranted in any given year, they shall also be
decreased annually by that percentage that accurately reflects the reduction of
permits requested and the specific and ascertainable resulting reduction in
funds needed to pay the City of Palm Bay costs to manage all services and time
needed to issue and monitor the permits required by this section.
      (3)   Residential drainage permits expire in ninety (90) days, unless

sufficient vertical elevations to establish finished floor elevations, slopes
and drainage patterns shall be submitted and approved prior to the issuance of
the certificate of occupancy.
      (6)   The inspection and issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall not
be construed as a warranty of the drainage system. After issuance of a
certificate of occupancy, it shall be the responsibility of the property owner
to maintain the drainage system. The property owner will be liable for the
costs incurred by the city of Palm Bay to correct any deficiency in the
drainage system. Modification of the system after issuance of the certificate
of occupancy is not permitted without a new residential lot drainage permit.

restore the damaged area to its condition prior to the damage. Any such
restoration shall meet all construction and engineering standards of the city.
Additionally, any permittee who has previously failed to restore the damage(s)
as required by this subchapter shall not be issued further permits from the
city until such damage is either restored and accepted by the Public Works
Department, or the entire cost plus overhead, of restoration incurred by the
city to make such restorations has been paid in full by the permittee. In the
event discrepancies arise as to the responsibility for damage, the burden of
proof shall be on the permittee.
      (8)   A performance bond or other financial surety, acceptable to the
City Attorney, may be provided to ensure compliance with this section.
      (9)   Such surety will be in the amount one hundred ten percent (110%) of
the value of the proposed work and accompanied by a non-refundable processing
fee as established by resolution pursuant to §
172.011. Upon satisfactory completion of the improvement in accordance with the
permit requirements or repair of any damage to city facilities, as determined
by the Public Works Director, said surety shall be released.

are located on site, including Gopher Tortoises or Indigo Snakes;
      (2)   It is a federal violation to clear or disturb land upon which
endangered or threatened species, nests or eggs exist without applying for a
permit from the FWC at least ninety (90) days prior to clearing;
      (3)   In the event that threatened or endangered species dwell on site,
no clearing shall occur until the appropriate permit has been obtained from the

      (4)   Owners, builders, or contractors must provide to the city prior to
any land clearing, a stormwater pollution prevention plan; and an NPDES
construction generic permit prior to clearing any lot, or contiguous lots, or
parcels regardless of land use or zoning, that is/are one acre or greater in
size;
      (5)   Land which has been cleared for development and upon which

   (E)    Appeals.
      (1)   A property owner may appeal the application of the criteria defined
in divisions (A) and (B) above to the City Engineer, the Public Works Director,
or designee. The City Engineer, the Public Works Director, or designee may
override the application of the above criteria due extenuating circumstances
that would result in an undue hardship upon the applicant. The City Engineer,
the Public Works Director, or designee must provide in writing the relief
approved and retain the approval and all records associated thereto within the
master permit file of the dwelling. No relief may be given that would result in
an unsafe design. Adjacent property owners shall be notified in writing by the
City Engineer, the Public Works Director, or designee at least fourteen (14)
days prior to a decision which grants relief to this section. Should the
property owner or an adjacent property owner(s) object to the decision of the
City Engineer, they may appeal the decision to City Council within thirty (30)
days by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk, specifying the grounds
therefore.
      (2)   Upon receipt of an appeal of the administrative decision by the

§ 177.040 LIGHTING STANDARDS.
   It is the intent of this section to define practical and effective measures
by which outdoor light usage can be reduced, while preserving safety, security,
and the nighttime use and enjoyment of property. These measures are intended to
curtail the degradation of the nighttime visual environment, reduce light
trespass, glare, energy consumption and resource waste by encouraging lighting
practices that direct appropriate amounts of light where and when it is needed,
increasing the use of energy-efficient sources, and decreasing the use of
poorly shielded or inappropriately directed lighting fixtures.
   (A)   Conformance standards. All outdoor lighting shall be installed in
conformance with the provisions of this Code, the Florida Building Code, the
National Electrical Code, the Energy Code, and the Sign Code of Palm Bay and
under appropriate permit and inspection.
   (B)   Applicability. Proposed new land uses, developments, buildings, and
structures that require a permit shall meet the requirements of this section.

dwelling units, gross floor area, or parking spaces compared to existing on the
site, either with a single addition or with cumulative additions subsequent to
the effective date of this provision, shall meet the requirements of this Code
for the entire site, including previously installed and any new outdoor
lighting. Cumulative modification or replacement of outdoor lighting
constituting fifty (50) percent or more of the permitted lumens for the parcel,
no matter the actual amount of lighting already on a non-conforming site, shall
constitute a major addition for purposes of this section.
   (C)   General outdoor lighting standards.
      (1)   All nonexempt outdoor lighting fixtures shall have shielding so
that the total lumen output falls to zero (0.00) at the property line.
(Exception: seasonal decorative lighting (i.e., Christmas Lights) using typical
low-wattage incandescent or LED lamps shall be permitted in all zoning
districts from the Thanksgiving holiday through the 15th of January.
      (2)   The use of Metal Halide (MH), Light Emitting Diode (LED), Quartz
Light (OL), and High Intensity Discharge (HID), when properly shielded is
permitted for all exterior site lighting. Other types of lamps not listed shall
be considered as a part of the permitting process.
      (3)   High pressure sodium (HPS) lighting is prohibited for building and
security lighting.
      (4)   The use of low pressure sodium (LPS) lighting is prohibited in all
zoning districts.
      (5)   The undue lighting of the night sky by means of searchlights and
similar devices without prior approval from the City Manager or their designee
is prohibited.
      (6)   Neon lighting, LED strip and tracer lighting and other types of
lighting used to illuminate the outline of a structure or storefront window
system is prohibited.
      (7)   No lighting fixture shall produce a lumen output exceeding one
thousand (1,000) lumens in any given area.
      (8)   Poles and support structures used for outdoor lighting shall not
exceed thirty (30) feet in height. The exception shall permit for required
lighting of all communication towers or tall structures as mandated by the FAA
and FCC.

(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 178.009 SIGN PERMITS.
   (A)   Permits required.  A sign permit is required prior to construction,
erection, installation, alteration, repair, relocation, reinstallation, or
structural maintenance of any sign not subject to §
178.008 of this chapter.
   (B)   Emergency repairs.  Repairs to a legally existing sign may be
conducted prior to obtaining a permit in the event of an emergency imposing an
imminent threat to life or property, provided, however, that any necessary
permit is obtained promptly after such repairs are initiated. Emergency repairs

   (C)   Who may apply. The following persons, or the designated agent or such
persons, may apply for a sign permit:
      (1)   The owner of a sign for which a permit is required.
      (2)   The designated agent of the owner of a sign for which a permit is
required.
   (D)   Administration. The administrator or the administrator's designee
shall be responsible for the administration, processing, review and
determination of applications for sign permits.
   (E)   Timing. Unless otherwise expressly provided for in this chapter, the

of the work nor from any other applicable penalties. This provision shall not
apply to emergency repairs under subsection (B) above.
   (J)   Inspections.

§ 178.020 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (A)   Any sign which did not conform to the provisions Chapter 178
immediately prior to the effective date of this ordinance, and was not legally
permitted and constructed, shall be an illegal nonconforming sign and shall be
removed immediately.
   (B)   Unless otherwise subject to the provisions F.S. § 70.20, any sign
which was legally permitted and constructed, but which does not conform to the
provisions Chapter 178, shall be a legal nonconforming sign and shall be
governed as provided for herein.
   (C)   A legal nonconforming sign may not be altered, enlarged, or moved in a
way which increases its degree of nonconformity, but any sign or portion
thereof may be altered to decrease its degree of nonconformity, except as
provided for herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing or section (D) below, a
legal nonconforming sign may be reconstructed as a digital billboard if doing
so would otherwise conform to the requirements of Chapter 178.
   (D)   A legal nonconforming sign shall not be structurally altered to
prolong the life of the sign, except as otherwise provided herein. Reasonable
repair and maintenance of nonconforming signs, including change of copy, is
permitted, as provided for herein. Reasonable repair and maintenance means the
work necessary to keep the sign, including the sign structure, in a good state
of repair, but does not include replacement of materials in the sign structure.
Reasonable repair does not include:
      (1)   Any modification that changes the structure, or type of structure,
such as conversion of a wooden sign structure to a metal sign structure;
      (2)   Any modification that increases the sign area or the height above
ground level. Embellishments may be added provided they do not exceed ten
percent (10%) of the sign area, as established in F.A.C. § 14-10.007; or
      (3)   Any modification that adds lighting to a sign structure that
previously did not contain lighting and does not have the approvals to do so,
or changes the existing lighting from printed faces to digital faces without
prior approval.
   (E)   Should a legal nonconforming sign become damaged, destroyed or
deteriorated by any means to the extent that it requires more than reasonable
repair and maintenance, as defined in subsection (D) above, then the sign shall
not be reconstructed except in compliance with this chapter.
   (F)   Should a legal nonconforming sign be moved for any reason, it shall
thereafter conform to the requirements of this chapter after it is moved.
   (G)   A legal nonconforming sign, other than legal nonconforming billboard
signs, shall be deemed an abandoned sign and shall be removed if either the
sign or the sign structure has not been used, or if the parcel or parcels upon
which the sign is located becomes vacant or unoccupied for a period of ninety
(90) consecutive calendar days or more.
   (H)   A legal nonconforming billboard sign shall be deemed an abandoned sign
and shall be removed if either the sign or the sign structure has not been used

§ 178.021 PENALTIES.
   (A)   Litter along the streets and highways, including the State highway
system, public spaces, public rights-of-ways, and waterways of Palm Bay,
detracts from the beauty of the city. The term "litter" shall be as defined in
F.S. § 403.413(2)(f), that is located on public property, and shall include any
artificial or manmade object illegally placed within a public right-of-way or
illegally nailed, fastened or affixed to any tree, public utility pole, or
other object located on public property or within a public right-of-way. The
terms "litter" shall include "snipe sign" as defined within this chapter.
   (B)   The placement of a snipe sign on public property is transient in
nature and is therefore irreparable. The existence of snipe signs are a
nuisance upon the city and its staff. The adoption of the prohibition directed
to snipe signs on public property shall be deemed notice of the violation. The
person or business in possession or control of the snipe sign and the person or
business who owns or is advertised or identified by name, address, website or
other contact information on the sign may be cited upon observation of the
violation. The person or business who owns or is advertised or identified on
the sign shall be presumed to have permitted the placement of the snipe sign in
the absence of evidence to the contrary. The term "transient in nature" shall
mean that a condition exists on a temporary, periodic, or non-permanent basis.
The term "irreparable" shall mean the condition is incapable of being remedied,
as the harm sought to be prevented has already occurred.
   (C)   Violations of this section shall be unlawful and shall be subject to
the fines set forth in this subsection. Each piece of litter or separate sign
that a person illegally place on or affixes to public property in violation of
this Section shall be deemed a separate violation. The schedule for fines for
the violations shall be as follows:
 
Offense                 Fine
1st                     $50
2nd                     $100
3rd and each thereafter $150
 
   (D)   Any litter or snipe sign placed on or affixed to public property or
placed in the road right-of-way, including but not limited to public property
and rights-of-way along or adjoining any roadway, in violation of this section
is hereby declared to be abandoned property and is thereby subject to being
removed by an employee of the Code Compliance Division or a member of the
Volunteer Citizens on Patrol (V-COP).
   (E)   The Division Manager of the Palm Bay Code Compliance Division, or his
or her designee, shall have the duty to enforce this §
178.021 through such assigned personnel as the Manager or designee determines
to be appropriate.
   (F)   A violation of the snipe sign prohibitions of this section shall be
documented by a digital photograph taken by a Code Compliance Officer or V-COP.
   (G)   The Code Enforcement Special Magistrate shall hear charges of code
violations pursuant to the issuance of citations. The Special Magistrate shall
operate in the manner established in Chapter 52 of the Palm Bay Code of
Ordinances.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 178.022 CONFLICT WITH OTHER LAWS; UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OR INVALIDITY.
   (A)   If any portion, clause, phrase, sentence or classification of this
chapter, now or later amended, conflicts with any federal or state statute or
regulation, either now existing or later enacted, such conflicting federal or
state statute or regulation shall govern and the remaining provisions of this
chapter that can be given effect without the conflicting provision shall
continue in full force.
   (B)   If any portion, clause, phrase, sentence or classification of this
chapter, now or later amended or its application to any person or circumstance,
is held or declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be either
unconstitutional, invalid, inapplicable, inoperative or void, then such
declaration shall not be construed to affect other portions of this chapter
that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application. It is
the express intention and opinion of the City Council of the City of Palm Bay
that any such unconstitutional, invalid, inapplicable, inoperative or void
portion or portions of this ordinance did not induce its passage, and that
without the inclusion of any such portion or portions of this ordinance, the
City Council would have enacted the valid constitutional portions thereof.

PART 2: OFF-PREMISES DIRECTIONAL/GUIDANCE SIGNS
§ 178.200 SCOPE.
   (A)   The standards for off-premises directional/guidance signs as described
herein shall apply to public roads located within the boundaries of the city.
Off-premise directional/guidance sign placement is limited to only those roads
that meet the following classifications, described in the city's Comprehensive
Plan as:
      (1)   Four (4)-lane arterial, divided;
      (2)   Two (2)-lane arterial;
      (3)   Four (4)-lane collector, divided;
      (4)   Two (2)-lane collector, divided;
      (5)   Two (2)-lane major collector;
      (6)   Two (2)-lane minor collector.
   (B)   The purpose of the off-premises directional/guidance sign is to
identify a destination and guide motorists to a specific area. When used, the
off-premises directional/guidance signs should have the lowest priority of all
signs used in the public right-of-way or easement. A program of cooperation
should be established between the city and other governmental agencies when a
sign is to be placed within any state or county rights-of-way located within
city boundaries.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 178.201 CLASSIFICATIONS.
   The off-premises directional/guidance signs shall be divided into three (3)
classifications.
   (A)   Recreational and cultural (brown sign). To provide directions to
structures and sites that include but are not limited to: parks, libraries,
sanctuaries, museums, etc.; areas of public interests that are typically
attractions and traffic generators because they are open to the general public
for the purpose of cultural, recreation, play, amusement or relaxation used to
refresh the body or mind or for the training and refining of the mind,
emotions, manners, vocal skills, taste, etc.
   (B)   Non-profit (green sign). To provide directions to structures and sites
that include but are not limited to churches, public schools/colleges,
government agencies, fraternal and civic organizations, lodges, and areas of
interest that are targeted to specific groups and individuals that typically
contribute to the betterment of the community and are not operated for monetary
gain and are exempt for taxation.
   (C)   Commercial (blue sign). To provide directions to structures and sites
that provide on-premise parking spaces for one hundred (100) or more vehicles
such as golf courses, industrial parks, residential subdivisions, businesses,
private schools and areas of interests that are targeted to specific groups of
persons who derive major portions of their incomes from such facilities and, as
motorists, do not reside in the immediate areas; areas that attract large
groups of persons who visit these areas for goods and services; large groups of
persons who reside in these areas and, as motorists, derive major portions of
their incomes outside of these areas; and large groups of persons who transport
goods and services to and from these areas. The structures and sites are
operated for monetary gain and are taxable entities. Residential subdivisions
are included in this classification because of concentrated real estate sales
and new construction.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)

sign should be seven feet (7) feet above the closest edge of pavement or above
the top of the closest curb, whichever is applicable.
   (D)   Single blade sign locations shall meet the same standards for height
as the multiple stacked locations. Depending on the posted speed limit in the
area and to provide for future sign attachments, the sign post's top or aerial
height shall be initially adjusted to accommodate a total of three (3) or five
(5) sign blades stacked as described herein.
   (E)   In locations where the posted speed is less than forty-five (45) mph,
the sign blades may be stacked five (5) high, not to exceed a maximum height of
forty (40) inches.
   (F)   In locations where the posted speed is forty-five (45) mph and higher,
the sign blade stacking shall not exceed three (3) high or a maximum height of
twenty-four (24) inches.
   (G)   The background color code for each of the three (3) administrative
sign classifications shall be as follows:
      (1)   Recreational and cultural - brown;
      (2)   Non-profit - green;
      (3)   Commercial - blue.
   (H)   The directional arrow, mileage numbers, and lettering shall be white.
   (I)   The style and size of the lettering should meet the following
standards:
      (1)   The lettering should be upper case and should be of the type
provided for in the "Standard Alphabets for Highway Signs and Pavement

§ 178.203 SIGN LOCATIONS.
   (A)   The off-premises directional/guidance signs should be located at least
two hundred (200) feet from the center line of the intersection or abutting
right angle roadway except in the case of median placement, and shall not
obstruct drivers' critical viewing of other traffic control devices. The
location of other traffic control devices shall in all cases take precedence
over the location of off-premises directional/guidance signs.
   (B)   In locations where the posted speed is less than forty-five (45) mph,
the sign post closest to the travel way should be located a minimum distance of
ten (10) feet off the edge of pavement or four (4) feet behind the face of a
type "F" curb, as defined in the Florida Department of Transportation Roadway
and Traffic Design Standards (latest edition), Index 300. In all cases the
location should be as close to the right-of-way line as is practical.
   (C)   In locations where the posted speed is forty-five (45) mph and higher,

   (D)   Off-premises directional/guidance signs may not be located outside of
a five (5) mile radius from the described destination.
   (E)   Off-premises directional/guidance signs shall be limited to a maximum
of three (3) off-premises directional/guidance signs per four (4)-way
intersection for any one (1) described destination. The total number of off-
premises directional signs for any one (1) described destination should be six
(6).
   (F)   In all cases, the exact location and number of off-premises
directional/guidance signs placed within the public road right-of-way shall be
determined by the Public Works Department of the city in accordance with the
standards set forth herein.
   (G)   The number of off-premises directional/guidance sign locations will be
limited and available locations will be permitted on a first come-first serve
basis. Permit application will be accepted on file with the city in
chronological order to provide for rapid implementation in the event a permit
is canceled or expires and a specific location becomes available. The city will
make every reasonable effort to provide the number of signs and locations
specified by the applicant up to the maximum allowed. In the event the city
determines that it cannot totally comply with the applicant's request, the city
will offer to place signs that meet the requirements and adjust the permit fees
accordingly or, if possible, locate the signs at the next-closest available
location; applicant may, during the permit application review phase, choose to
continue the process or withdraw the application.
   (H)   During the term of the permit, in-place signs may be relocated or
removed at any time should site conditions change and warrant such an action by
the city. Any such modifications to the original permit application are at the
sole discretion of the Public Works Department and may be accomplished with or
without notice to the permittee, although every effort will be made to contact
the permittee should such a condition exist. No refund or adjustment to the
original permit fee shall be made in any case.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 178.204 PERMITTING.

fees are non-refundable if applications are rejected by the city, canceled by
the applicant, or for any reason an application becomes null and void.
Applicants shall have sixty (60) days from the time the initial permit
application is received by the Public Works Department to either pay for the
approved permit in full or cancel the application. If no such action is taken
by the applicant within the provided sixty (60) day period, the off-premises
directional/guidance sign right-of-way use permit application shall become null
and void. Should any application become null and void, any approved locations

the specific and ascertainable resulting reduction in funds needed to pay the
city costs to manage all services and time needed to issue and monitor the
permits required by this section.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)

PART 1: FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
§ 179.001 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Scope. The provisions of this Part shall apply to all development that
is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not
limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site
improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling,
enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of
buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building
Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and
manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of
recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other
development.
   (B)   Intent. The purposes of this Part and the flood load and flood
resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to
establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding
through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to:
      (1)   Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public
service during times of flooding;
      (2)   Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to
prevent or minimize future flood damage;
      (3)   Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation,
drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development
which may increase flood damage or erosion potential;
      (4)   Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and
shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial
functions of the floodplain;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood hazard areas;
      (7)   Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood
control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and
      (8)   Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for
community participation as set forth in the 44 C.F.R., § 59.22.
   (C)   Coordination with the Florida Building Code. This Part is intended to
be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code.
Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the currently adopted edition of the Florida
Building Code.
   (D)   Warning. The degree of flood protection required by this Part and the
Florida Building Code, as may be amended from time to time, is considered the
minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and
engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may
be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Part does not imply that land
outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within
such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood
hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the Flood Insurance Study
and shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and the requirements of 44 C.F.R., §§ 59
and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring
this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation
in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing
use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this ordinance.
   (E)   Disclaimer of liability. This Part shall not create liability on the
part of City Council of the City of Palm Bay or by any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this ordinance or
any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 179.002 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   Conflicts. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and
a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable.
   (B)   Applicability. This Part shall apply to all flood hazard areas within
the City of Palm Bay, as established in subsection (C) below.
   (C)   Basis for establishing flood hazard areas.  The Flood Insurance Study
for Brevard County, Florida, and Incorporated Areas, dated January 29, 2021,
and all subsequent amendments and revisions, and the accompanying Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), and all subsequent amendments and revisions to such
maps, are adopted by reference and shall serve as the minimum basis for
establishing flood hazard areas. Studies and maps that establish flood hazard
areas are on file at the City Hall Annex Building, 120 Malabar Road SE, Palm
Bay, Florida 32907.
   (D)   Submission of additional data to establish flood hazard areas. To
establish flood hazard areas and base flood elevations, pursuant to §
179.005, the Floodplain Administrator may require submission of additional
data. Where field surveyed topography prepared by a Florida licensed
professional surveyor or digital topography accepted by the community indicates
that ground elevations:
      (1)   Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in
areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall
be considered as flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of this Part
and, as applicable, the requirements of the Florida Building Code, as may be
amended from time to time.
      (2)   Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation, the area
shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a
letter of map change that removes the area from the special flood hazard area.
   (E)   Other laws. The provisions of this Part shall not be deemed to nullify
any provisions of local, state or federal law.
   (F)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This Part supersedes any
ordinance in effect for management of development in flood hazard areas.
However, it is not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing ordinances
including but not limited to land development regulations, zoning ordinances,
stormwater management regulations, or the Florida Building Code. In the event
of a conflict between this Part and any other ordinance, the more restrictive
shall govern. This Part shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or
easement, but any land that is subject to such interests shall also be governed
by this Part.
   (G)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this Part,
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 179.003 DUTIES AND POWERS OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   Designation. The Floodplain Administrator is designated to administer
the floodplain management program for the City of Palm Bay. The Floodplain
Administrator may delegate performance of certain duties to other employees.
   (B)   Authority. The Floodplain Administrator is authorized and directed to
administer and enforce the provisions of this Part. The Floodplain
Administrator shall have the authority to render interpretations of this Part
consistent with the intent and purpose of this ordinance and may establish
policies and procedures in order to clarify the application of its provisions.
Such interpretations, policies, and procedures shall not have the effect of
waiving requirements specifically provided in this Part without the granting of
a variance pursuant to §
179.007.
   (C)   Applications and permits. The Floodplain Administrator, in
coordination with other pertinent offices of the community, shall:
      (1)   Review applications and plans to determine whether proposed new
development will be located in flood hazard areas;
      (2)   Review applications for modification of any existing development in
flood hazard areas for compliance with the requirements of this Part;
      (3)   Interpret flood hazard area boundaries where such interpretation is
necessary to determine the exact location of boundaries; a person contesting
the determination shall have the opportunity to appeal the interpretation;
      (4)   Provide available flood elevation and flood hazard information;
      (5)   Determine whether additional flood hazard data shall be obtained
from other sources or shall be developed by an applicant;
      (6)   Review applications to determine whether proposed development will
be reasonably safe from flooding;
      (7)   Issue floodplain development permits or approvals for development
other than buildings and structures that are subject to the Florida Building
Code, including buildings, structures and facilities exempt from the Florida
Building Code, when compliance with this Part is demonstrated, or disapprove
the same in the event of noncompliance; and
      (8)   Coordinate with and provide comments to the City Manager or
designee to assure that applications, plan reviews, and inspections for
buildings and structures in flood hazard areas comply with the applicable
provisions of this Part.
   (D)   Substantial improvement and substantial determinations. For
applications for building permits to improve buildings and structures,
including alterations, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, change of
occupancy, additions, rehabilitations, renovations, substantial improvements,
repairs of substantial damage, and any other improvement of or work on such
buildings and structures, the Floodplain Administrator shall complete the
following activities. For the purpose of this chapter, "market value" shall be
defined as the value of buildings and structures, excluding the land and other
improvements on the parcel. Market value is the actual cash value (in-kind
replacement cost depreciated for age, wear and tear, neglect, and quality of
construction) determined by a qualified independent appraiser, or tax
assessment value adjusted to approximate market value by a factor provided by
the County Property Appraiser.
      (1)   Estimate the market value, or require the applicant to obtain an
appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser, of
the building or structure before the start of construction of the proposed
work. In the case of repair, the market value of the building or structure
shall be the market value before the damage occurred and before any repairs are
made;
      (2)   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to repair a
damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs of
improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building or
structure;
      (3)   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage; the determination
requires evaluation of previous permits issued for improvements and repairs as
specified in the definition of "substantial improvement"; and
      (4)   Notify the applicant if it is determined that the work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage and that compliance
with the flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code
and this ordinance is required.
   (E)   Notices and orders. The Floodplain Administrator shall coordinate with
appropriate local agencies for the issuance of all necessary notices or orders
to ensure compliance with this Part.
   (F)   Inspections. The Floodplain Administrator shall make the required
inspections as specified in §
179.006 for development that is not subject to the Florida Building Code. The
Floodplain Administrator shall inspect flood hazard areas to determine if
development is undertaken without issuance of a permit.
   (G)   Other duties of the Floodplain Administrator. The Floodplain
Administrator shall have other duties, including but not limited to:
      (1)   Establish procedures for administering and documenting
determinations of substantial improvement and substantial damage made pursuant
to §
179.003(D);
      (2)   Require that applicants proposing alteration of a watercourse
notify adjacent communities and the Florida Division of Emergency Management,
State Floodplain Management Office, and submit copies of such notifications to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA);
      (3)   Require applicants who submit hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
analyses to support permit applications to submit to FEMA the data and
information necessary to maintain the Flood Insurance Rate Maps if the analyses
propose to change base flood elevations, flood hazard area boundaries, or
floodway designations; such submissions shall be made within six (6) months of
such data becoming available;
      (4)   Review required design certifications and documentation of
elevations specified by this ordinance to determine that such certifications
and documentations are complete;
      (5)   Notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency when the corporate
boundaries of City of Palm Bay are modified; and
      (6)   Advise applicants for new buildings and structures, including
substantial improvements, that are located in any unit of the Coastal Barrier
Resources System established by the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-
348) and the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-591) that
federal flood insurance is not available on such construction; areas subject to
this limitation are identified on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as "Coastal Barrier
Resource System Areas" and "Otherwise Protected Areas."
   (H)   Floodplain management records. Regardless of any limitation on the
period required for retention of public records, the Floodplain Administrator
shall maintain and permanently keep and make available for public inspection
all records that are necessary for the administration of this ordinance and the
flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code,
including Flood Insurance Rate Maps; Letters of Change; records of issuance of
permits and denial of permits; determinations of whether proposed work
constitutes substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage; required
design certifications and documentation of elevations specified by the Florida
Building Code and this ordinance; notifications to adjacent communities, FEMA,
and the state related to alterations of watercourses; assurances that the flood
carrying capacity of altered watercourses will be maintained; documentation
related to appeals and variances, including justification for issuance or
denial; and records of enforcement actions taken pursuant to this ordinance and
the flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code.
These records shall be available for public inspection at City Hall Annex
Building, 120 Malabar Road SE, Palm Bay, Florida 32907.

be a permit for, or approval of, any violation of this Part, the Florida
Building Codes, or any other provision of the Code of Ordinances. The issuance
of permits based on submitted applications, construction documents, and
information shall not prevent the Floodplain Administrator from requiring the
correction of errors and omissions.
   (F)   Expiration. A floodplain development permit or approval shall become
invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within one
hundred eighty (180) days after its issuance, or if the work authorized is
suspended or abandoned for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days after the
work commences. Extensions for periods of not more than one hundred eighty
(180) days each shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause shall be
demonstrated.
   (G)   Suspension or revocation. The Floodplain Administrator is authorized
to suspend or revoke a floodplain development permit or approval if the permit

by the Floodplain Administrator in the administration and enforcement of this
ordinance. Any person aggrieved by the decision of City Council may appeal such
decision to the Circuit Court, as provided by Florida Statutes.
   (C)   Limitations on authority to grant variances. The City Council shall
base its decisions on variances on technical justifications submitted by
applicants, the considerations for issuance in subsection (G) below, the
conditions of issuance set forth in subsection (H), and the comments and
recommendations of the Floodplain Administrator. The City Council has the right
to attach such conditions as it deems necessary to further the purposes and
objectives of this ordinance.
   (D)   Restrictions in floodways. A variance shall not be issued for any
proposed development in a floodway if any increase in base flood elevations
would result, as evidenced by the applicable analyses and certifications
required in §
179.005(D).

repair, improvement, or rehabilitation of a historic building that is
determined eligible for the exception to the flood resistant construction
requirements of the Florida Building Code, Existing Building, Chapter 12
Historic Buildings, upon a determination that the proposed repair, improvement,
or rehabilitation will not preclude the building's continued designation as a
historic building and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the building. If the proposed work precludes
the building's continued designation as a historic building, a variance shall
not be granted and the building and any repair, improvement, and rehabilitation
shall be subject to the requirements of the Florida Building Code.
   (F)   Functionally dependent uses. A variance is authorized to be issued for
the construction or substantial improvement necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use, as defined in this ordinance, provided the variance
meets the requirements of subsection (D), is the minimum necessary considering
the flood hazard, and all due consideration has been given to use of methods
and materials that minimize flood damage during occurrence of the base flood.
   (G)   Considerations for issuance of variances. In reviewing requests for
variances, the City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all
relevant factors, all other applicable provisions of the Florida Building Code,
this Part, and the following:
      (1)   The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto other lands
resulting in further injury or damage;
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed development, including contents,
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on current and future owners;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed development
to the community;
      (5)   The availability of alternate locations for the proposed
development that are subject to lower risk of flooding or erosion;
      (6)   The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and
anticipated development;
      (7)   The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for the area;
      (8)   The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
      (9)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris
and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
      (10)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and
bridges.
   (H)   Conditions for issuance of variances. Variances shall be issued only
upon:
      (1)   Submission by the applicant of a showing of good and sufficient
cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography
of the site limit compliance with any provision of this ordinance or the
required elevation standards;
      (2)   Determination by the City Council that:
         (a)   Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot
undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do
not constitute hardship;
         (b)   The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor
create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict
with existing local laws and ordinances; and
         (c)   The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief.
      (3)   Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance,
if granted, shall be recorded in the Office of the Clerk of the Court in such a
manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land;
and
      (4)   If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the
lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below
the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the
Floodplain Administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the
difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the
lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation
(up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars
($100.00) of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base
flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

PART 2: GROUNDWATER/WELLFIELD PROTECTION
§ 179.030 PURPOSE.
   The primary purpose of this Part is to protect ground water resources and
reduce the risk to human health associated with contaminated drinking water.
The quantity and quality of water available for use as a public water supply is
directly related to land activities. Presently, most of the city's residents
obtain their potable water supply from wells that pump water from a shallow
aquifer. This aquifer is recharged by rainfall that occurs in the area around
the wellfield. Land use activity near potable water wells has direct
consequences on the quality of water percolating into the surficial aquifer. To
ensure there will be no significant adverse impact on minimum ground water
levels, and the long-term use of the present and future wells and wellfields,
it is necessary to take steps which will help to prevent the contamination of
underground fresh water.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 179.031 LAND USE AND DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS FROM ACTIVE DESIGNATED PUBLIC
UTILITY WATER WELLS.

locating within five hundred (500) feet of a designated public utility water
well.
      (1)   Stormwater discharge retention-detention facilities.
      (2)   Any industrial or commercial activities that utilize, generate, or,

      (2)   Mining or excavation operations of any kind.
   (D)   Conditional use approval shall be required to locate any domestic
wastewater facilities which include underground storage and transportation
facilities between two hundred (200) feet and one thousand (1,000) feet from a
designated public utility water well.
   (E)   Editor's note: Appendix A and Appendix B, attached to original

§ 180.001 PURPOSE, FINDINGS, INTENT, AND INCORPORATION OF RECITALS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually-
oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments in order to promote
and protect the public health, safety, good order, morals and general welfare
of the citizens of the city, to establish reasonable and uniform regulations of
adult entertainment establishments and sexually-oriented businesses within the
city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing an unreasonable limitation or unreasonable restriction on the content
of any lawful communicative materials including sexually-oriented materials.
Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to unreasonably
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually-oriented materials protected by
the First Amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually-oriented entertainment protected by the First Amendment to their
intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this subchapter to
condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene or otherwise illegal
material.
   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made
available to the Council, and on findings incorporated in Supreme Court cases
presented for consideration by the City Council in the record supporting this
chapter, including but not limited to City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters,
Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theaters, 427 U.S. 50 (1976);
Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), on materials made of record
relating to the St. Johns County Public Nudity Ordinance, and on the substance
of and findings made or incorporated in studies accomplished in other
communities and ordinances enacted in other communities, including, but not
limited to, New York, New York; City of Houston Ordinance Number 97-75; Senate
Bill Number 232, as passed by the Kansas State Legislature; Phoenix, Arizona;
Tucson, Arizona; St. Paul, Minnesota; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas;
Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles,
California; Austin, Texas; Macon-Bibb County, Georgia; Palm Beach County,
Florida; Manatee County, Florida; the findings of the Attorney General of the
State of Minnesota; the report of United States Attorney General's Commission
on Pornography (1986); Jacksonville, Florida; Detroit, Michigan; and "A Summary
of a National Survey of Real Estate Appraisers Regarding the Effect of Adult
Bookstores on Property Values," conducted by the Division of Planning,
Department of Metropolitan Development, Indianapolis, January 1984; the
publication entitled "Protecting Communities From Sexually-Oriented Businesses"
(Southwest Legal Press, Inc.); the publication entitled "Local Regulation Of
Adult Businesses" (Clark, Boardman and Callaghan); publications prepared by the
Florida Family Association, Inc. (Tampa, Florida) relating to the regulation of
sexually-oriented businesses and adverse secondary effects of sexually-oriented
businesses; the "Report to: The American Center for Law and Justice on the
Secondary Impacts of Sex Oriented Businesses", Peter R. Hecht, Ph.D. (1996);
and the findings of fact relating to the Adult Entertainment Code of Orange
County, Florida, and the findings of fact relating to the Sexually-Oriented
Business and Adult Entertainment Establishment Ordinance of Seminole County,
Florida, matters and materials submitted at the public hearings relating to
this Ordinance and other matters and documents relating to all of the above;
the City Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments
lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are
presently uncontrolled or not adequately controlled by the operators of the
establishments or businesses. Further, there are presently no mechanisms or
inadequate mechanisms to make the owners of these businesses or establishments
responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.
      (2)   Certain workers of certain sexually-oriented businesses and adult
entertainment establishments defined in this chapter engage in a higher
incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than workers of other
business establishments.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments,
especially those which provide private or semi-private areas, booths or
cubicles for viewing films, videos, live sex shows and those having physical
interaction between workers and customers.
      (4)   Offering and providing such private spaces encourages such
previously mentioned activities, which create unhealthy conditions.
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments for the
purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such businesses and
establishments.
      (6)   At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by
activities occurring in sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human
immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non
A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections.
      (7)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States: six hundred (600) in 1982;
two thousand two hundred (2,200) in 1983; four thousand six hundred (4,600) in
1984; eight thousand five hundred fifty-five (8,555) in 1985, two hundred
fifty-three thousand four hundred forty-eight (253,448) through December 31,
1992 and currently there are one million four hundred thousand (1,400,000)
people infected with the disease nationally with forty thousand (40,000) people
becoming infected annually.
      (8)   As of December 31, 1995, there have been fifty-one thousand eight
hundred thirty-eight (51,838) reported cases of AIDS in the State of Florida
with over one hundred thousand (100,000) AIDS cases being reported in the State
of Florida from 1983 - 2005. Florida ranks third in cumulative AIDS cases in
the United States and has the second highest AIDS rate in the United States.
      (9)   From 1981 to June 1996, the number of living persons testing
positive for the HIV antibody with AIDS symptoms has risen to seventy- three
thousand two hundred seventeen (73,217) in the twenty-eight (28) states having
confidential reporting requirements.
      (10)   The number of cases of early (less than one (1) year) syphilis in
the United States reported annually has risen, with thirty-three thousand six
hundred thirteen (33,613) cases reported in 1982 and forty-five thousand two
hundred (45,200) through November of 1990 and between 2004 and 2005, the
national syphilis rate increased eleven and one-tenths percent (11.1%).
      (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over five hundred thousand (500,000)
cases being reported in 1990 and currently three hundred fifty thousand
(350,000) cases of gonorrhea are reported annually with Florida reporting over
twenty thousand (20,000) cases of gonorrhea annually.
      (12)   The Surgeon General of the United States, in his report of October
22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      (13)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
      (14)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually-oriented businesses and adult
entertainment establishments are unhealthy, in part, because the activities
conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature
of the activities and the failure of owners and operators of the facilities to
self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities.
      (15)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments where persons view "adult" oriented films which gives rise to
health and aesthetic concerns.
      (16)   The findings noted in divisions (B)(1) through (15) above and as
set forth hereinafter raise substantial governmental concerns.
      (17)   Sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments have operational characteristics that should be reasonably
regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
      (18)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments.
Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent
incentive on the operators to see that the business or establishment is run in
a manner consistent with the good order, health, safety and welfare of its
patrons and workers, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to
require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the
business or establishment, fully in possession and control of the premises and
activities occurring therein.
      (19)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
      (20)   Requiring licensees of sexually-oriented businesses and adult
entertainment establishments to keep information regarding current workers and
certain past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of
criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or
suspects and by preventing minors from working at such businesses and
establishments.
      (21)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually-
oriented business and adult entertainment establishments, where such
information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest
in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually
transmitted diseases.
      (22)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain workers
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who
are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
      (23)   The fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment
establishment or sexually-oriented business license has been convicted of a
sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may
engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
      (24)   Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and
other nearby cities and counties in central Florida where adult entertainment
material is possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold for
commercial purposes in the form of books, magazines, periodicals or other
printed material, or photographs, films, motion pictures, prints, videotapes,
slides, computer digital graphic recordings or other visual representations or
recordings, or recordings or other audio matter, or instruments, novelties,
devices, or paraphernalia which depict, illustrate, describe or relate to
specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas.
      (25)   Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and
other nearby cities or counties in Florida where adult entertainment and
sexually-oriented commercial activities in the form of nude, semi-nude, or
topless dancers, entertainers, performers, or other individuals, who, for
commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing
specified anatomical areas; or engage in straddle dancing or touching with
customers.
      (26)   Commercial sexually-oriented businesses exist or operate or may
exist or operate within the city or other nearby cities or counties in Florida
where sexually-oriented services are offered for commercial or pecuniary gain
in the form of commercial physical contact, escort services and other services
providing sexual encounters. The workers of such sexually-oriented businesses
operating in Florida engage in physical contact or touching with customers
including, but not limited to, acts of prostitution, or encourage or entice the
customers to engage in lewdness.
      (27)   The activities occurring at sexually-oriented businesses and adult
entertainment establishments occur at establishments and businesses which
operate primarily for the purpose of making a profit and, as such, are subject
to regulation by the city in the interest of the good order, health, safety,
economy, property values, morals and general welfare of the people, businesses
and industries of the city. A major industry which is important to the
community's economic welfare is tourism by persons seeking to bring children to
visit Palm Bay who wish to stay in a community with a family atmosphere not
dominated by commercialized sexual themes.
      (28)   When the activities occurring at sexually-oriented businesses and
adult entertainment establishments are present in establishments and
businesses, other activities which are illegal, unsafe, or unhealthful tend to
accompany them, concentrate around them, and be aggravated by them. Such other
activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, pandering,
solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, exposing minors to
harmful materials and an unhealthy and unsanitary environment, possession,
distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of
controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and property.
      (29)   When the activities occurring at sexually-oriented businesses and
adult entertainment establishments are competitively exploited in
establishments and businesses, they tend to attract an undesirable number of
transients, blight neighborhoods, discourage wholesome tourism, adversely
affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote the
particular crimes described above and, ultimately, lead residents and
businesses to move to other locations.
      (30)   Sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments often have exterior signs or exterior appearance that are
incongruous with other business signage, lower the surrounding property values
and contribute to urban decline.
      (31)   The activities occurring at sexually-oriented businesses and adult
entertainment establishments sometimes occur in establishments and businesses
concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages which
concurrence leads to a further increase in criminal activity, unsafe activity,
and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community and
creates additional hazards to the health and safety of customers and workers
and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the
economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the
quality of life, commerce, and community environment.
      (32)   Physical contact or touching within sexually-oriented businesses
and adult entertainment establishments between workers exhibiting specified
anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and
promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases.
      (33)   In order to preserve and safeguard the good order, health, morals,
safety, and general welfare of the people of the city it is necessary and
advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators,
agents, workers, entertainers, performers, and customers at sexually-oriented
businesses and adult entertainment establishments.
      (34)   The potential dangers to the good order, morals, health, safety,
and general welfare of the people of the city posed by permitting a sexually-
oriented business or adult entertainment establishment to operate without first
meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this chapter are so
great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being
permitted to operate.
      (35)   Requiring operators of sexually- oriented businesses and adult
entertainment establishments to keep records of information concerning workers
and certain recent past workers as well as customer contracts and other matters
and materials will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal
behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects
and by making it difficult for minors to work at or be customers in such
establishments.
      (36)   Prohibiting sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments from operating within set distances of educational institutions,
religious institutions, residences, areas zoned or designated for residential
use, and parks at which minors are customarily found, will serve to protect
minors from the adverse affects of the activities that accompany such
establishments and businesses.
      (37)   Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances, and enclosed
adult booths in sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between
individuals and poses a threat to the health of the participants and promotes
the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases. Straddle dancing is
primarily conduct rather than communication or expression.
      (38)   Workers at sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments engage in a higher incidence of certain types of unhealthy or
criminal behavior than workers of other establishments and businesses
including, but not limited to, a very high incidence of illegal prostitution or
engaging in lewdness in violation of F.S. Ch. 796, operation without business
tax receipts and illegal and unlicensed massage.
      (39)   Physical contact or touching between workers of sexually-oriented
businesses and adult entertainment establishments and customers poses a threat
to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and sexually
transmittable diseases.
      (40)   The practice of not paying or underpaying workers at sexually-
oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and requiring them
to earn their entire income from tips or gratuities from their customers who
are predisposed to want sexual activity has resulted in a high incidence of
prostitution and crimes related to lewdness by workers.
      (41)   Sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments involve some activities that are pure conduct engaged in for the
purpose of making a profit, rather than speech or expressive activity and,
therefore, are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the
health, good order, morals, welfare and safety of the community.
      (42)   Requiring sexually-oriented businesses to post a listing of
services provided and restrict services to those listed as well as maintaining
a customer contract and transaction record in a daily register will discourage
incidents of criminal behavior such as lewdness and prostitution thereby
further safeguarding the health of both workers and customers and will assist
facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects if criminal
acts do occur.
      (43)   The general welfare, health, good order, morals and safety of the
citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.
   (C)   Intent. It is the intent of this chapter to protect and preserve the
good order, health, peace, morals, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the
City of Palm Bay. This chapter regulates conduct and is not an ordinance that
affects the use of land as contemplated by F.S. § 166.041.
   (D)   Authority. This chapter is enacted under the constitutionally derived
home rule power of the City of Palm Bay in the interest of the good order,
health, morals, peace, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city.
   (E)   Recitals. It is the City Council's further intention to accomplish
those intents and purposes expressed by the City Council in the recitals of the
ordinance from which this section derives, each of which are incorporated by
reference into this section.
   (F)   Speech protection. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit
constitutionally protected expression or speech. This chapter is intended to
reasonably regulate the adult entertainment industry and sexually-oriented
businesses which engage in commercial activities involving acts or services of
a sexually explicit nature or which involve acts or services involving matters
which are sexual in nature.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 180.002 CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   This chapter shall be liberally construed to accomplish its purpose of
reasonably regulating sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments in order to reduce or eliminate adverse secondary effects of
such businesses and establishments. See for example and not by way of
limitation Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, 111 S. Ct. 2456, 115
L.Ed. 2d 504 (1991), Cafe 207, Inc. v. St. Johns County, 856 F. Supp. 641 (M.D.
Fla. 1994); affirmed, Cafe 207, Inc. v. St. Johns County, 66 F. 3d 272 (11th
Cir. 1995); cert. denied, 134 L Ed. 2d.647 (U.S. April 22, 1996). This chapter
shall not be construed to authorize any illegal act under federal law, state
law or city ordinance. This chapter is intended to reasonably regulate such
matters in order to reduce or eliminate the adverse secondary effects of
commercial establishments and businesses. The regulation of alcoholic beverage
establishments is also addressed in the Code of Ordinances the City of Palm Bay
and other provisions of law.
   (B)   Unless otherwise indicated, all provisions of this chapter shall apply
equally to all persons, regardless of sex. Masculine pronouns, such as "he,"
"his," and "him," as employed in this chapter, shall also be construed to apply
to feminine pronouns and neutral pronouns, unless the context suggests
otherwise. Words used in the singular number shall include the plural number,
unless the context suggests otherwise.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 180.003 OBSCENITY; INDECENT EXPOSURE UNLAWFUL.
   As a matter of state and federal law, obscenity is unlawful in the city.
Likewise, state law prohibits indecent exposure. Nothing in this chapter shall
be construed to allow or permit the possession, distribution and transportation
of obscene materials; to authorize the exposing of persons under eighteen (18)
years of age to motion pictures, exhibitions, shows, representations and
presentations of specified sexual activities or persons displaying or
exhibiting specified anatomical areas; or the indecent exposure of a person as
prohibited by state law.
(Ord. 2024-33, passed 9-19-24)
§ 180.004 NOTICE.
   Any notice required under this chapter shall, unless otherwise provided in
this chapter, be accomplished by posting upon the subject premises and sending
a written notification by certified mail to the mailing address set forth on
the application for the license or a permit. This mailing address shall be

§ 180.023 SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION PROCEEDINGS.
   (A)   Challenge to suspension or revocation. If the City Manager or his or
her designee notifies a licensee in writing of the pending suspension or
revocation of a license as provided in §
180.021, then the suspension or revocation shall become final and effective
fifteen (15) days after mailing to the licensee's record address, posting at
the licensed establishment, or actual delivery of the notice to the licensee,
unless within fifteen (15) days of the date of the notice of suspension or
revocation the licensee first files with the City Manager or his or her
designee a written response stating the reasons why the suspension or
revocation is alleged to be in error or inappropriate and a written notice of
intent to challenge the suspension or revocation requesting a hearing to
determine whether the suspension or revocation will become effective. The
suspension or revocation shall be abated in the event that a licensee files a
timely challenge to the suspension or revocation in accordance with the
procedures of this chapter or upon an order of a court of competent
jurisdiction. A suspension or revocation already in effect, but not previously
challenged in a suspension or revocation hearing, may be challenged in the same
manner but is not abated during the proceedings.
   (B)   Hearing on suspension or revocation. When a licensee files a written
response and notice of intent to challenge a pending or existing suspension or
revocation then a public hearing to determine if the pending suspension or
revocation will become effective and final shall be held by a hearing officer
appointed by the City Council. The City Manager or his or her designee shall
notify the City Attorney and any appropriate city officers who shall schedule
and provide notice of the hearing date and time.
      (1)   Appointment, term and compensation of hearing officer:
         (a)   Three (3) hearing officers shall be appointed by the City
Council, and they shall be attorneys duly licensed to practice law in the
state, who have practiced in the state for at least five (5) years.
         (b)   Hearing officers shall be subject to removal with or without
cause, by the City Council. Hearing officers shall not be considered to be city
employees, although they may receive compensation for their services and also
may be reimbursed for such travel, mileage and per diem expenses as may be
authorized.
         (c)   Because only attorneys may hold the position of hearing officer,
the City Council shall not be required to retain an attorney to represent the
hearing officer.
         (d)   It shall be unlawful for a hearing officer to act as an agent or
an attorney for a party involved in a determination under the provisions of
this section or to be otherwise involved with any matter arising under this
section which will come before the city during the term of the hearing
officer's appointment. Further, a hearing officer shall not initiate or
consider ex parte communications or other communications with any party of
interest to a hearing officer concerning the substance of any proceeding to be
heard by a hearing officer. However, the foregoing does not prohibit
discussions between the hearing officer and city staff that pertain solely to
scheduling and other administrative matters unrelated to the merits of the
application. If a person engages in an ex parte communication with the hearing
officer, the hearing officer shall place on the record of the pending case all
ex parte written communications received, all written responses to such
communications, a memorandum stating the substance of all oral communications
received, and all oral responses made, and shall advise all parties that such
matters have been placed on the record. Any party desiring to rebut the ex
parte communication shall be entitled to do so but only if such party requests
the opportunity for rebuttal within ten (10) days after notice of such
communication. If he or she deems it necessary due to the effect of an ex parte
communication received by him or her, the hearing officer may withdraw from the
case and the City Council shall appoint another hearing officer to handle the
case.
         (e)   Selection of hearing officer. The City Manager and licensee
shall each have the right to eliminate one (1) of the three (3) hearing
officers selected by the City Council. The one (1) hearing officer not
eliminated by either party shall act as the hearing officer for the license
revocation hearing. In the event licensee objects to all three (3) hearing
officers, then the City Council shall choose the hearing officer from the list
of three (3) hearing officers absent a showing of clear prejudice by the
licensee.
      (2)   The hearing officer shall have the power to:
         (a)   Adopt rules for the conduct of the hearing;
         (b)   Subpoena licensees and witnesses to its hearings. Subpoenas may
be served by the Police Department and/or other law enforcement agencies with
jurisdiction to serve subpoenas;
         (c)   Subpoena evidence to its hearings;
         (d)   Administer oaths and take testimony under oath; and
         (e)   Issue an order having the force of law suspending or revoking
the license.
      (3)   The suspension or revocation hearing shall be held within thirty
(30) days of the City Manager's receipt of a written challenge and request for
a hearing by the aggrieved licensee.
      (4)   The participants before the hearing officer shall be the licensee,
any witnesses of the licensee, the City Manager or his or her designee and any
witnesses of the City Manager or his or her designee. All witnesses shall
provide their legal name, mailing addresses and telephone number.
      (5)   The procedures used shall be those typically used in a civil case
with the City Manager or his or her designee having the burden of proof by
clear and convincing evidence.
      (6)   Testimony and evidence may be submitted by any witness but shall be
limited to matters directly relating to the grounds for suspension or
revocation. Irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious testimony or evidence
shall be excluded.
      (7)   All testimony shall be under oath. The hearing officer shall decide
all questions of evidence, procedure and standing. All hearings shall be open
to the public. Minutes shall be kept at all hearings. Unless otherwise mutually
agreed to between the licensee and the City Manager or his or her designee, the
order of presentation of testimony and evidence shall be as follows:
         (a)   The City Manager or his or her designee and any witnesses of the
City Manager or his or her designee.
         (b)   The licensee and any witnesses of the licensee.
         (c)   Rebuttal witnesses from the City Manager or his or her designee.
         (d)   Rebuttal witnesses from the licensee.
         (e)   Summation by the City Manager or his or her designee.
         (f)   Summation by the licensee.
      (8)   The hearing officer may also call and question witnesses or request
additional evidence as the hearing officer deems necessary and appropriate.
      (9)   City shall provide a hearing room and clerical staff as may be
reasonably required by the hearing officer to conduct hearings and perform his
or her duties.
      (10)   Each party to the hearing shall have the right to call and examine
witnesses, introduce exhibits, cross-examine opposing witnesses, impeach
witnesses and rebut evidence.
      (11)   The licensee has the right, at his or her own expense, to be
represented by an attorney at any hearing.
      (12)   All testimony before the hearing officer shall be under oath and
shall be recorded. The licensee or the city may cause a verbatim record of the
proceedings to be made.
      (13)   If the hearing officer comes to believe that any facts, claims, or
allegations necessitate additional review or response by either the licensee or
the City Manager or his or her designee, then the hearing officer may order the
hearing continued until an announced date certain, not to exceed thirty (30)
days from the date of continuance. The hearing officer shall render a final
decision on the appeal within sixty (60) days of the City Manager's receipt of
licensee's written notice of challenge.
      (14)   Hearing officers may allow the parties to submit written proposed
findings of fact and conclusions of law following the hearing and shall advise
the parties of the timetable for so doing, if allowed.
      (15)   At the conclusion of the hearing within the time prescribed
herein, the hearing officer shall issue an order setting forth findings of
fact, based on evidence of record, and issue conclusions of law regarding
whether the suspension or revocation will become or remain effective, and shall
render relief in the order affording the proper relief consistent with powers
granted in this section.
   (C)   Filing of decision. The original of the written decision of the
hearing officer shall be filed with the City Clerk and copies shall be
delivered or mailed to the licensee, the City Manager or his or her designee
and the Police Department.
   (D)   Judicial review. Any person who participated in a suspension or
revocation hearing before the hearing officer and who is aggrieved by the
decision of the hearing officer may immediately challenge the decision in any
court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the Rules of Procedure of that
court. The record of the hearing shall consist of the complete record of the
proceedings before the hearing officer. The hearing officer's decision shall be
promptly reviewed by the court.
   (E)   Requirement of exhaustion procedures. Judicial review of a suspension
or revocation, or related hearing or appeal proceedings, shall be available
only after the administrative procedures and remedies set forth in this section
have been exhausted.
   (F)   Notice of final suspension or revocation. If no response or request
for a suspension or revocation hearing is filed within fifteen (15) days of the
notice of a pending suspension or revocation, or if the licensee who requested
the hearing does not appear at the suspension or revocation hearing after
notice, or if the hearing officer decides after a hearing that a pending
suspension or revocation will become final, then the City Manager or his or her
designee shall issue to the licensee notice of final suspension or revocation
of the adult entertainment license and mail or arrange delivery of the notice
to the licensee's record address.
   (G)   Effective date of suspension or revocation. The suspension or
revocation of a license shall take effect the day after delivery of a notice of
final suspension or revocation to the licensee in person, by posting on the
licensed establishment, or by mail to the licensee's record address, or on the
date the licensee surrenders the license, whichever happens first. The licensee
shall immediately return and surrender a revoked license to the City Manager or
his or her designee or surrender the revoked license, upon demand, to a member
of the Police Department.

§ 200.05 METER TESTING.
   (A)   Meter testing shall be done at the customer's request, and in
accordance with the following guidelines and schedules:
      (1)   Meter Test Request. If any customer requests a test of the meter,
the City will require a meter test or bench test fee which fee shall be set as
follows:
 
                                    FY 25-26
Meter Test                          $85.59
Bench Test - Less than 1.5" Meter   $243.08
Bench Test - 2" Meter               $286.45
Bench Test - Greater than 2" Meters Actual Cost
 
      (2)   The fee is retained by the City only if the test shows that the
meter is registering within the acceptable accuracy limits as established by
the City. If the meter is determined by the City to be registering outside of
the acceptable accuracy limits, the fee will be credited to the customer's
account.
      (3)   For tests of meters equal to or greater than 1 ½-inch (1 ½”), the
test will be based on actual costs incurred as determined by the City.
   (B)   Adjustment of Bills for Meter Error. In meter tests made by the City,
the accuracy of registration of the meter and its performance in service shall
be judged by its average error. The average error shall be considered to be the
average of the errors at the test rate flows:
      (1)   Fast meters. Whenever a meter tested is found to register fast, in
excess of the tolerance provided within the accuracy limits by the City
standards, the City shall refund to the customer the amount billed in error for
the period not to exceed six months except that if it can be shown that the
error was due to some cause, the date of which can be fixed, the overcharge
shall be computed back to but not beyond such date. The refund shall be based
upon consumption charges only and for the percentage over registering.
      (2)   Slow meters. Whenever a meter tested is found to register slow, in
excess of the tolerance provided within the accuracy limits by the City, the
City may bill the customer an amount equal to the unbilled error for the period
not to exceed six months, except that if it can be shown that the error was due
to some cause, the date of which can be fixed, the charge may be computed back
to but not beyond such date and provided further that if the utility has
required a deposit, the customer may be billed only for their portion of the
unbilled error which is in excess of the deposit retained by the City. In the
event of a non-registering meter, the customer may be billed on an estimate
based on previous bills for similar usages, such estimate to apply only to the
current billing. In the event of unauthorized use, the customer may be billed
on a reasonable estimate, in the sole discretion of the City, of the service
taken.
      (3)   Meter accuracy requirements. All meters used for measuring quantity
of water delivered to a customer shall be in good mechanical condition and
shall be adequate in size and design for the type of service which they
measure. Before being installed for the use of any customer, every meter shall
register within the accuracy limits of the City standards.

§ 200.06 CUSTOMER DEPOSITS.
   (A)   Establishment of Credit. Before rendering Utilities services, the City
shall require an applicant to satisfactorily establish credit. Establishment of
credit shall not relieve the customer from their obligation to comply with the
City's rules for prompt payment. Credit will be deemed so established if:

of bills for service requested.
      (2)   The applicant pays a deposit.
      (3)   The applicant furnishes an irrevocable letter of credit from a bank
or a surety bond.
   Any such deposit received by the City shall be held in a non-interest
bearing account. Deposits shall not be refunded until any and all outstanding
charges for Utilities services against the account for which it is deposited
have been paid in full. The deposits required under this section shall be
applied against the final bill prepared for termination of the account. If the
deposit exceeds the final bill, and no other outstanding fees or charges exist,
then the balance of the deposit shall be refunded. If a residential customer
has a record of timely payment over a continuous thirty-six (36)-month period,
then the City shall return that deposit.

payment of current bills provided. The City shall provide the customer with
reasonable written notice of not less than thirty (30) days where such request
or notice is separate and apart from any bill for service. The total amount of
the required water or wastewater deposit shall not exceed an amount equal to
the average actual charge for services for two (2) monthly billing periods for
the twelve (12)-month period immediately prior to the date of notice. In the
event the customer has had service less than twelve (12) months, the City shall
base the new or additional deposit upon the average actual monthly billing
available.

§ 200.07 DISCONNECTING, RECONNECTING, AND TRANSFERRING SERVICE.
   (A)   There shall be a charge for City service connections and for
transferring of City accounts from the name of one person to the name of
another, which shall be paid before the service connection is made or accounts
changed. There shall be no service connection charge if the original service
connection for meter installation or service installation fee has been paid.
      (1)   Transferring Service. The charge for the transfer of service to a
new customer account at a previously served location or reconnection of service
subsequent to a customer requested disconnection shall be set as follows. If
after the reconnection the customer does not have water service due to the main
valve at the house being in the off position, and the field service
representative returns to the property, an additional service initiation fee
will be applied to the account for each return trip to be set as follows:
                     FY 25-26
Transfer Fee (Re-Initiation Fee) (Per Trip)
   During normal hours         $27.39
   During after hours            $74.18
      (2)   Reconnection. When service is discontinued because of nonpayment of
amounts due or non-sufficient funds, the disconnection/ reconnection fee will
be applied to the account as set forth below. If service is ordered
discontinued because of nonpayment of the amount due, then payment is
subsequently received (thus preventing the service from being discontinued), an
administrative fee will be applied to the account. If service has been
discontinued because of non-payment and water service is restored without
authorization by the City, the City shall remove the meter and a pulled meter/
reinstall meter charge will be applied to the account. Service shall not be
restored until the customer has paid the entire amount of the delinquent bill,
together with penalties and the pulled meter/reinstall meter charge. If a meter
was pulled prior to October 1, 2015, a re-install meter charge shall be applied
to any account requesting to have such meter re-installed.

§ 200.10 WATER, WASTEWATER AND RECLAIMED WATER CAPITAL CHARGES.
   All applicable capital charges, capital charge recovery usage components,
and calculations for both, are located in the Land Development Code.
(Ord. 2008-31, passed 5-1-08)
§ 200.11 UTILITIES EXTENSION POLICY.
   (A)   Responsibility for Collection, Distribution, and Transmission Costs.
The City shall allow an applicant to connect to the nearest feasible point as
determined by the City. In addition to the water, wastewater, or reclaimed
water capital charges, the applicant shall either provide, or pay the capital
costs (including land costs) of the required capital improvements for:
      (1)   The collection of raw sewage within the boundaries of the property
owned by the applicant to which the City intends to provide wastewater service
capacity;
      (2)   The transmission of sewage from those boundaries to the City's
collection and transmission facilities prior to connection to treatment
facilities; and
      (3)   The transmission and distribution of water or reclaimed water from
the City's water treatment facilities to the applicant's property.
   (B)   Incorporation by Reference of Certain Standards and Procedures. The
Code hereby references the document generally known as the City of Palm Bay
Utilities Department Policies, Procedures, and Standards Handbook. The City
reserves the right to determine the applicability of the items referenced
therein. The City also reserves the right to modify, amend, or replace the
Policies, Procedures, and Standards Handbook at any time in the future without
the need to amend this Section. All rates shall be controlled by the prevailing
rate established by this chapter.
   (C)   Manner of Paying; Payment Prerequisite to Rendering Service. The City
requires the payment of contributions, either by cash payments or through the
installation of water distribution and wastewater collection facilities by the
applicant. The title to such facilities shall be transferred to the Utilities
Department upon their acceptance. The requirement for such contributions is
declared to be for the purpose of defraying the cost of the water distribution
and wastewater collection systems. The payment by the applicant of such
contributions to the City shall be a condition precedent to the rendering of
service.
   (D)   Computation. The aggregate value of contributions, either in cash or
by utility facilities construction donated by the applicant shall be computed
and determined as follows:
      (1)   On-site Facilities. Each applicant shall be responsible for the
design, installation, inspection and testing of complete distribution
facilities and collection facilities located in the street or streets,
facilities rights-of-way or easements adjoining or within the boundaries of the
applicant's property, or the equivalent cost of the same in the event such
facilities have been previously designed or installed. The requirement for the
installation of oversized lines or facilities, located on the applicant's
property and designed to provide service for other properties, may be the
subject of a refunding agreement.
      (2)   Off-site Facilities. The applicant is required to extend service to
the existing water distribution/transmission and wastewater collection/
transmission facilities. For the purpose of this policy, the term OFF-SITE
shall be defined as those water or reclaimed water distribution and
transmission facilities, wastewater transmission facilities, collection
facilities or pumping stations necessary to connect the applicant's property
with the System adequate in size to transmit to the applicant's property an
adequate quantity of water under adequate pressure or transmit wastewater
collected on the applicant's property to the treatment plant or disposal site.
It is the City's policy to apportion the cost of the off-site facilities pro
rata against the properties receiving service from such off-site facilities
using the refundable advance approach. Since each applicant draws from the
hydraulic capacity of such facilities, the City will require that the applicant
install such facilities and pay his property's hydraulic share as a minimum of
the cost of the off-site facilities through which service is rendered to the
applicant's property. Applicants are required to advance all or a portion of
the off-site facilities in order to provide a physical interconnection of the
applicant's property with the facilities of the Utility at their then present
terminus.
   (E)   Refundable Advance. The City requires, in many cases, in addition to
the contribution provisions set forth herein, a construction cost advance by
the applicant to further temporarily defray the cost of any off-site facilities
necessary to connect the applicant's property with the then terminus of the
facilities adequate in size to provide service as deemed appropriate by the
City. The applicant shall always be responsible for his "hydraulic share" of
the cost of off-site facilities. However, this Policy recognizes the instances
in which an applicant will be required to advance the hydraulic share
applicable to other undeveloped property in order that off-site facilities may
be constructed to serve the subject property. All amounts expended by the
applicant, over and above the hydraulic share for off-site facilities, shall be
rebated to the applicant in accordance with the terms and conditions of a
rebate agreement which the City will execute. The rebate agreement shall
provide for a plan of rebate based upon the connection of other properties, to
the extent of their hydraulic share, which properties will be served by the
off-site facilities installed by the applicant. Notwithstanding the provisions
of this section, the City will limit the life of such rebate agreement to a
term of not more than six (6) years, after which time any portion of the
rebates not made by the terms and conditions of the rebate agreement will have
lapsed and thereafter, such rebate agreement will be canceled. In no event
shall the rebate cover an amount greater than the difference between the
capitalized cost of such off-site facilities and the applicant's own hydraulic
shares of such facilities. The City shall not include any interest upon the
rebates.
   (F)   Main Line Extension Charges. In order to recover those costs
associated with the contributed capital portion of the water or reclaimed water
distribution and wastewater collection facilities, the City and Utilities
Department hereby adopt Main Line Extension Charges as set forth above.
Normally, such capital is contributed by the applicant to the City and
Utilities Department upon hook-up to the system. For those occasions where the
City and Utilities Department or their predecessor completes or has completed
the extension from the respective transmission system to the applicant's
property, a fee set as follows for the water, wastewater, and reclaimed water
system shall be levied and collected from the owner. The fee will be calculated
based on the amount of front footage each specific property occupies upon its
respective roadway.
   Main Line Extension Charges (per linear foot)
      Water      $18.80
      Wastewater   $29.63
   (G)   Time of Payment. All water or reclaimed water distribution and
wastewater collection main line extension charges shall be paid prior to
connection to a structure to be served by the City or such other time as may be
specifically provided by resolution, ordinance, agreement or permit. The City
may permit installment payments of any water or reclaimed water distribution
and wastewater collection main line fee charges upon such terms and conditions
as it deems appropriate.
   (H)   System Design; Independent Engineers. The City and Utilities
Department shall recognize the design of the facilities prepared by a
registered professional engineer regularly engaged in the field of sanitary
engineering, covering the design of applicant's on-site facilities. Such design
shall conform in all respects to the City and Utilities Department's criteria.
Such facilities shall ultimately be accepted by the City based on a
recommendation by the Utilities Department.
   (I)   Easement and Rights-of-Way. As a prerequisite to the construction of
any facilities proposed to be connected to the System, the applicant shall
agree to grant such easements or rights-of-way corresponding with the
installation of the proposed facilities. Such grant or conveyance shall be in a
form satisfactory to the City.
   (J)   Inspection. The City shall have the right to inspect the installation
of all facilities which are proposed to be transferred to Utilities Department
ownership, operation and control, or any other on-site facilities whether or
not transferred to the Utilities Department. Such inspections are intended to
assure that the collection facilities or distribution facilities are installed
in accordance with approved designs and are further consistent with the
criteria and specifications governing the kind and quality of such
installation.
   (K)   Testing. The City shall be present at tests of component parts of the
collection facilities or distribution facilities for the purpose of determining
that the facilities, as constructed, conform to the City's rules and
regulations regarding such testing. Such tests will be performed only under the
direct supervision of the engineer of record or authorized inspector. The
results of such testing shall be certified by the engineer of record or
authorized inspector. The City shall be notified at least three (3) working
days prior to any inspections or testing performed in accordance with these
regulations. Working days shall be Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.
   (L)   Transfer of Contributed Property; Bills of Sale. Each applicant who
has constructed facilities on the applicant's property prior to interconnection
with the existing facilities shall convey such component facilities as deemed
appropriate by the City to the Utilities Department by bill of sale or other
appropriate document in a form satisfactory to the City. Such transfers of
title via bill of sale to the Utilities Department shall be free of all liens
and encumbrances. The City shall not accept and the applicant shall not
transfer any facilities in the category of customer lines, plumber lines or
customer's installation located on the property owner's side of the point of
delivery of service. Such facilities shall remain the maintenance
responsibility of the applicant or subsequent user. Neither the City nor the
Utilities Department shall be required to accept title to any component part of
the facilities as constructed by the applicant until the Utilities Director has
approved the construction of said lines, verified the inspection of the
construction, and accepted the test associated with the construction of such
facilities. The applicant shall maintain accurate cost records, establishing a
construction cost of all water, wastewater, or reclaimed water facilities and
such cost information shall be furnished to the City concurrently with the bill
of sale. The City may refuse connection and deny the commencement of service to
any applicant seeking to be connected to portions of the facilities installed
by the applicant until such time as provisions of this paragraph have been
fully met by the applicant, or the applicant's successors or assigns.
   (M)   Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or
portion of this Policy is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by
any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate,
distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the
validity of the remaining portions thereof.
   (N)   Mandatory Connection to Palm Bay Utility System Required. Mandatory
connection to the System is required for all new building construction where
utility mains are within two hundred (200) feet of the property or if septic
tank failure as defined in Rule 10D-6, F.A.C. occurs. Furthermore, applicable
capital charges shall be paid by the property owner or builder as provided for
in this code. Wastewater service from the System shall be deemed available if
the System is available as that term is defined in Section 381.0065(2)(a),
Florida Statutes (Supp. 1994).

§ 200.12 DISHONORED (RETURNED) CHECK CHARGE.
   If a utility customer pays for service by a check, draft or other order that
is returned due to insufficient funds or closed bank accounts, the city will
not consider this as payment to the outstanding amount due. Any check, draft or
other order that is returned to the customer shall be subject to a service fee
for dishonored check in accordance with the provisions of § 166.251, Florida
Statutes, as may be amended from time to time. This imposition of a service fee
for dishonored check will be in addition to any late payment fee that may be
charged to the customer for the delinquent payment of the utility account.

§ 200.13 METER REREADS AND SPECIAL READS.
   (A)   Upon request of a customer, the City shall reread the customer's meter
to determine if the initial reading was accurate. The customer is entitled to
one reread or date log at no charge per calendar year. The customer shall pay a
high bill investigation fee for each subsequent reread or data log per calendar
year. If the customer-requested reread of the meter results in a corrected
bill, the fee shall be credited to the account. Upon request of a customer to
have a special meter reading performed which is not a part of the monthly
readings during the normal billing cycle, the customer shall pay a high bill
investigation fee for the special reading.

§ 200.14 GUARANTEED REVENUE/RESERVE CAPACITY CHARGE; ADOPTION; CALCULATION;
APPLICABILITY; AND TIME OF PAYMENT.
   (A)   Adoption and Calculation. The City hereby adopts, pursuant to general
law, an annual guaranteed revenue charge equal to twelve (12) times the monthly
residential base facility charge for each purchased water or wastewater
equivalent residential connection not connected to the system.
   (B)   Applicability and Time of Payment. A Guaranteed Revenue/Reserve
Capacity charge shall be paid annually by all those customers who have paid
water, wastewater, or reclaimed water capital charges or plant capacity charges
to the City and are not yet connected or using said capacity. The City may
permit installment payments of guaranteed revenue charges upon such terms and
conditions, as the City deems appropriate. The base facility charge is set at
twelve (12) times the residential base facility charge. The customer will be
billed, in arrears, on an annual basis twelve (12) months after the effective
date a water, wastewater, or reclaimed water utility agreement is executed for
the previous twelve (12) months and continuing on each annual anniversary date
thereof for so long as said reserved ERC's shall remain unconnected or unused.
The right to connect to the System under any such agreement shall remain valid
for no more than ten (10) years from the date of issuance and only for so long
as the said agreement holder pays the guaranteed revenue charge provided
herein.
   (C)   Lapse. The continued reservation of equivalent residential connections
for the water, wastewater, and reclaimed water systems shall be dependent upon
the timely payment of guaranteed revenue fees as set forth above. The customer
will pay all sums due and payable to the City for the Guaranteed Revenue/
Reserve Capacity charge within fifteen (15) days after the billing statement
has been mailed or presented by the City to the customer as set forth in such
statement. In the event of a lapse of the remaining reserve capacity or there
is a failure or refusal to pay the amounts due on statements as rendered, the
City may, in its sole discretion, discontinue service.

Council approval prior to becoming effective and implemented.
   (H)   No Free Service. No free utility services shall be provided to any
customer.

(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)
§ 201.22 NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   Users must comply with the categorical Pretreatment Standards found at
40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405–471.
      (1)   Where a categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in
terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Utilities Director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with Paragraphs (5) and (6) of this subsection.
      (2)   When the limits in a categorical Pretreatment Standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the
Utilities Director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed
either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for
purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual
Industrial Users.
      (3)   When wastewater subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Utilities
Director shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e).
      (4)   A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical
Pretreatment Standard in accordance with the following provisions of this
subsection.
         (a)   Categorical Pretreatment Standards may be adjusted to reflect
the presence of pollutants in the Industrial User’s intake water in accordance
with this subsection. Any Industrial User wishing to obtain credit for intake
pollutants must make application to the City. Upon request of the Industrial
User, the applicable Standard will be calculated on a “net” basis (i.e.,
adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the
requirements of Subparagraph (b) below are met.
         (b)   Criteria.
            1.   Either:
               A.   The applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards contained
in 40 CFR Subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net
basis; or
               B.   The Industrial User demonstrates that the control system it
proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards would,
if properly installed and operated, meet the Standards in the absence of
pollutants in the intake waters.
            2.   Credit for generic pollutants such as BOD, TSS, and oil and
grease should not be granted unless the Industrial User demonstrates that the
constituents of the generic measure in the User’s effluent are substantially
similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or
unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants
either at the outfall or elsewhere.
            3.   Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet
the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard(s), up to a maximum value
equal to the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to
determine eligibility for credits and compliance with Standard(s) adjusted
under this subsection.
            4.   Credit shall be granted only if the User demonstrates that the
intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW
discharges. The City may waive this requirement if it finds that no
environmental degradation will result.
      (5)   When a categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in terms
of pollutant concentrations, an Industrial User may request that the City
convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert
concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the Utilities
Director or said representative. The City may establish equivalent mass limits
only if the Industrial User meets all the conditions set forth in Subparagraph
(a) below:
         (a)   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the Industrial User
must:
            1.   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of
its individual wastewater discharge permit;
            2.    Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
            3.   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility’s
actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility’s long-term
average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-
term average production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions;
            4.   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and
            5.   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
Pretreatment Standards during the period prior to the Industrial User’s request
for equivalent mass limits.
         (b)   An Industrial User subject to equivalent mass limits must:
            1.   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
            2.   Continue to record the facility’s flow rates through the use
of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
            3.   Continue to record the facility’s production rates and notify
the Pretreatment Coordinator whenever production rates are expected to vary by
more than twenty percent (20%) from its baseline production rates determined in
Paragraph (5)(a)3 of this subsection. Upon notification of a revised production
rate, the Pretreatment Coordinator will reassess the equivalent mass limit and
revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility;
and
            4.   Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to Paragraph (5)(a)1 of
this subsection so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
         (c)   When developing equivalent mass limits, the Utilities Director:
            1.   Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the IU by the
concentration-based Daily Maximum and Monthly Average Standard for the
applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
            2.   Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess
the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect
changed conditions at the facility; and
            3.   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the IU’s actual average daily
flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water
conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates
used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on
the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to Section
201.26. The IU must also be in compliance with Section
201.202 regarding the prohibition of bypass.
      (6)   The Utilities Director may convert the mass limits of the
categorical Pretreatment Standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to
concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to
individual IUs. The conversion is at the discretion of the Utilities Director.
      (7)   Once included in its permit, the Industrial User must comply with
the equivalent limitations developed in this subsection in lieu of the
promulgated categorical Standards from which the equivalent limitations were
derived.
      (8)   Many categorical Pretreatment Standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum Monthly Average, or 4-day average, limitations. Where such
Standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used
in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation.
      (9)   Any IU operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or
concentration limits calculated from a production-based Standard shall notify
the Pretreatment Coordinator within two (2) business days after the User has a
reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change
within the next calendar month. Any User not notifying the Pretreatment
Coordinator of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or
concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of
the long term average production rate.

§ 201.23 STATE PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   Users must comply with FDEP 62-625 codified as Section 403.0885, Florida
Statutes.
(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)
§ 201.24 LOCAL LIMITS.
   (A)   The Utilities Director is authorized to establish Local Limits
pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c).
   (B)   No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the
Instantaneous Limits for those pollutants which have been established for the
City of Palm Bay’s WWFs using standard procedures, calculations and methods
acceptable to FDEP to protect against pass through, interference, protection of
WWF employees, and adverse effects on wastewater residuals disposal. No
Industrial User shall discharge process waste streams, unregulated waste
streams, or dilute waste streams in excess of the concentrations set forth by
the Director. Local Limits shall be included as permit conditions and attached
to each SIU wastewater permit issued. The established Local Limits are subject
to change and shall be modified as needed. The established Local Limits apply
at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the WWF. The Utilities
Director may impose mass limitations in addition to the concentration-based
limitations. A copy of the approved Local Limits is available upon request at
the following location: 250 Osmosis Drive, Palm Bay, Florida.
   (C)   The Utilities Director may develop BMPs, by ordinance or in individual
wastewater discharge permits, to implement Local Limits and the requirements of
Section
201.21.
(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)
§ 201.25 CITY OF PALM BAY RIGHT OF REVISION.
   The City reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in individual
wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on
discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this chapter.
(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)
§ 201.26 DILUTION.
   No User shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly
authorized by an applicable Pretreatment Standard or Requirement. The Utilities
Director may impose mass limitations on Users who are using dilution to meet
applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements or in other cases when the
imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams,
and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine
the User’s compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The Utilities Director may require any person discharging into the
POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a
suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An
individual wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow
equalization.
   (C)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Utilities Director, they are necessary for the proper handling
of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except
that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All
interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Utilities
Director and shall comply with this chapter and the most recent editions of the
Florida Building Code - Plumbing; the City of Palm Bay FOG Policy and

All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180)
days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need
be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However,
notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under Section
201.104 of this chapter. The notification requirement in this section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by Users subject to categorical
Pretreatment Standards under the self-monitoring requirements of Sections
201.100,
201.102, and
201.103 of this chapter.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of Subsection (A), above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15)
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any
quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33
(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the User
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the User must notify the Utilities
Director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State
hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety
(90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the User
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This section does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued there
under, or any applicable federal or state law.

§ 201.109 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, Chapter 62-
160, F.A.C., and the Department of Environmental Protection Standard Operating
Procedures for Field Activities, DEP-SOP-001/01(DEP-SOP-001/01,FS2 400,
Wastewater Sampling) and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an
applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard. If 40 CFR Part 136, Chapter 62-
160, F.A.C., and the Department of Environmental Protection Standard Operating
Procedures for Field Activities, DEP-SOP-001/01(DEP-SOP-001/01,FS2 400,
Wastewater Sampling) does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling
and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods
or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including
procedures suggested by the Pretreatment Coordinator or other parties approved
by EPA.
(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)
§ 201.110 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on
data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period.
      (1)   Except as indicated in Paragraphs (2) and (3) below, the User must
collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Pretreatment Coordinator. Where time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must be
representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures
as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City, as
appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
Instantaneous Limits.
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
      (3)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in Section
201.100 and
201.102 (40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be
used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile
organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not
exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
Utilities Director may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by
Section
201.103 (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the Industrial User is required to
collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance
with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.

§ 201.112 RECORDKEEPING.
   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the User independent of such requirements, and documentation
associated with BMP established under Section
201.24(C). Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be

ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
§ 201.140 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   When the Utilities Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement, the Utilities Director may serve upon that User a written Notice
of Violation. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of such notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by
the User to the Utilities Director. Submission of such a plan in no way
relieves the User of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the Utilities Director to take any action, including emergency
actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of
Violation.
(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)
§ 201.141 CONSENT ORDERS.
   The Utilities Director may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any User
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to
be taken by the User to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections 201.143 and 201.144 of
this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)
§ 201.142 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   The Utilities Director may order a User which has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement, to appear before the Utilities Director and show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the
User specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement
action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the User show cause why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be
served on any Authorized Representative of the User as defined in Section
200.02(B), and required by Section
201.66(A). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the User.
(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)
§ 201.143 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Utilities Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement, the Utilities Director may issue an order to the User responsible
for the discharge directing that the User come into compliance within a
specified time. If the User does not come into compliance within the time
provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the
User of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the User.
(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)
§ 201.144 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   (A)   When the Utilities Director finds that a User has violated, or

or Requirement, or that the User's past violations are likely to recur, the
Utilities Director may issue an order to the User directing it to cease and
desist all such violations and directing the User to:
      (1)    Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and
desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the User.
(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)
§ 201.145 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
   (A)   When the Utilities Director finds that a User has violated, or

discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard
or Requirement, the Utilities Director may fine such User in an amount of one
thousand dollars ($1,000) a day minimum with a maximum to be determined by
actual recovery cost per day. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation,
per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge
limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar
days, be assessed an additional penalty of twenty percent (20%) of the unpaid
balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of seven percent (7%)
per month. A lien against the User’s property shall be sought for unpaid
charges, fines, and penalties.
   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Utilities Director to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the
fine amount within ten (10) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request
has merit, the Utilities Director may convene a hearing on the matter. In the
event the User’s appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest
accruing thereto, shall be returned to the User. The Utilities Director may add
the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and
orders, to the fine.
   (D)    Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)
§ 201.146 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   The Utilities Director may immediately suspend a User’s discharge,
after informal notice to the User, whenever such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or
cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons. The Utilities Director may also immediately suspend a User’s
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
      (1)   Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a User’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Utilities Director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Utilities
Director may allow the User to recommence its discharge when the User has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Utilities Director that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Section
201.147 of this chapter are initiated against the User.
      (2)   A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Utilities Director prior to the date of
any show cause or termination hearing under Section
201.142 or
201.147 of this chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any Emergency Suspension under this section.

subject to discharge termination:
      (1)   Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the User’s premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the Pretreatment Standards in Subchapter ‘General
Sewer Use Requirements’ of this chapter.
   (B)   Such User will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section
201.142 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise
of this option by the Utilities Director shall not be a bar to, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.

in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
Pretreatment Standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
User. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards if the requirements
of Subsection (C) below, are met.
   (C)   A User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the User can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The User has submitted the following information to the Utilities
Director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five (5) days):
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the User seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical Pretreatment Standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)
§ 201.201 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
   (A)   A User shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action
brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section
201.21(A) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in Sections
201.21(B)(3) through (18) of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know,
or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause Pass Through or Interference and
that either:
      (1)   A Local Limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the User was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the Pass Through
or Interference; or
      (2)   No Local Limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the User’s prior discharge when
the City was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
Interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.

portion of a User's treatment facility.
      (2)   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause Pretreatment
Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of Subsections (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   Bypass Notifications.

unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards within
twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the User
becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description
of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates
and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it
is expected to continue; and stepstaken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Utilities Director may waive the
written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received
within twenty-four (24) hours.
   (D)   Bypass.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Utilities Director may take an
enforcement action against a User for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The User submitted notices as required under Subsection (C) of
this section.
      (2)   The Utilities Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Utilities Director determines that it
will meet the three (3) conditions listed in Paragraph (1) above.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 203.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   It is hereby ascertained, determined, and declared that:
   (A)   Pursuant to Art. VIII, Section 2(b), Florida Constitution; Fla. Stat.
§ 166.021(1); and Article I, City Charter, the City of Palm Bay ("City"),
through the City Council, has all governmental, corporate, and proprietary
powers to enable it to conduct municipal government, perform municipal
functions, and render municipal services, and may exercise any power for
municipal purposes, except when expressly prohibited by law.
   (B)   Fla. Stat. § 381.00655, requires the owners of on-site sewage
treatment and disposal systems ("OSTDS") to connect to an available publicly
owned or investor-owned sewage system within a specified period of time after
receiving written notification that the system is available for connection.
   (C)   Fla. Stat. § 381.00655, expressly states that it does not limit the
power of a municipality to enforce other laws for the protection of the public
health and safety.
   (D)   Fla. Stat. § 180.02, authorizes the City to create a zone by ordinance
and prescribe reasonable regulations requiring all persons and entities within
that zone to connect to public sewer and alternative water systems when
available and further provides that the City may extend this zone up to five
miles outside of the corporate limits.
   (E)   The growing population of the City, the increasing contamination of
groundwater and surface water and multiple devastating algae blooms that have
occurred in the Indian River Lagoon in recent years, combined with the
continued use of septic tanks constitutes a danger to the public health and
requires connection of all developed properties to central wastewater treatment
facilities whenever and wherever it is physically feasible.
   (F)   The connection of all developed properties to a central wastewater
treatment system and the elimination of OSTDS promotes the health, safety, and
welfare of all residents of the City by protecting and preserving natural
resources and the quality of the environment through the elimination of
potential sources of potable and surface water pollution and contamination.
   (G)   Properties within the City may obtain potable water from private
wells, the water from which is not subject to the comprehensive contaminant
testing and other regulations imposed pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act
(42 U.S.C. § 300f et. seq.).
   (H)   A 2009 U.S. Geological Survey study of over 2,000 private wells across
the United States found that about twenty-three percent (23%) had at least one
contaminant at a level of potential health concern.
   (I)   The contamination of private drinking wells represents a threat to the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City, which the City desires
to address and alleviate through the connection of all developed properties to
central potable water treatment and distributions systems whenever and wherever
physically feasible.
(Ord. 2023-101, passed 11-2-23)

§ 204.01 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Stormwater Management
Utility" ordinance.
(Ord. 2024-42, passed 9-19-24)
§ 204.02 AUTHORITY.
   The city is authorized by the Florida Constitution and the provisions of
F.S. Chapters 166 and 403 and F.S. § 403.0893, to construct, reconstruct,
improve, and extend stormwater systems and to issue revenue bonds and incur
other debts if needed to finance in whole or part the cost of such systems and
to establish just and equitable rates for the services and facilities provided
by the systems.
(Ord. 2024-42, passed 9-19-24)
§ 204.03 FINDINGS AND DETERMINATIONS.
   It is hereby ascertained, determined, and declared as follows:
   (A)   Through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Stormwater
(NPDES) permitting program, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as
implemented by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, has mandated
the City to implement and fund a comprehensive stormwater management program to
reduce the contamination of stormwater runoff and prohibit illicit discharges.
It is necessary to establish methods for controlling the introduction of
pollutants into the City of Palm Bay's separate storm sewer system in order to
comply with requirements of the NPDES permit process as set forth in
Chapter 95 of the City of Palm Bay Code of Ordinances, to provide for public
health, safety, environment, and general welfare of the property owners and
citizens of Palm Bay.
   (B)   The Florida Legislature has mandated that local governments in the
State of Florida, including the City, have the responsibility for developing
mutually compatible stormwater management programs consistent with the rules
and regulations of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the
water management districts and the stormwater management programs established
and maintained by other local governments.
   (C)   The City has, pursuant to F.S. Chapter 163, adopted the objectives and
policies found in the Conservation Element of the City of Palm Bay
Comprehensive Plan, which provide that the City shall design, manage, and
operate the City's Stormwater Management System so the collection, storage,
treatment, and conveyance of stormwater within the City adequately protects
surface water quality. The creation and maintenance of the City's Stormwater
Utility was designed to implement the Conservation Element of the Comprehensive
Plan and other municipal, federal, and state policies mandating stormwater
management programs by local governments.
   (D)   F.S. § 403.0893, specifically authorizes and encourages local
governments, including the City, to provide stormwater management services and
create stormwater programs and adopt stormwater charges sufficient to plan,
construct, operate, and maintain stormwater management systems.
   (E)   Improper management of stormwater increases erosion and sedimentation,
which can decrease the capacity of water bodies to hold and transport water and
interfere with navigation.
   (F)   The development and urbanization of property results in the creation
of impervious surfaces which tend to increase the volume and rate of stormwater
runoff and decrease groundwater recharge from water percolating into the soil,
thereby requiring the implementation of stormwater management practices to
offset such impacts.
   (G)   Improperly managed stormwater runoff may increase the incidence and
intensity of flooding, endangering persons and property within the City.
   (H)   Improperly managed stormwater runoff may interfere with the water
quality and quantity of the Indian River Lagoon and Turkey Creek and further
disrupt biological diversity and productivity associated with such waterbodies.
   (I)   The public health, safety, and welfare are adversely affected by poor
water quality and flooding resulting from inadequate stormwater management
practices.
   (J)   The improper management of stormwater and adverse impacts upon the
quality of water resources located within the City may result in substantial
economic harm to the City and its residents.
   (K)   Property owners within the City are eligible for flood insurance
through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which enables these
property owners to acquire federally backed flood insurance protection. To
ensure that this coverage is available, the City is required to meet the
minimum FEMA requirements for participation in the NFIP and failure to meet
these requirements could result in flood insurance being either unavailable or
prohibitively expensive to property owners within the City.
   (L)   The City maintains a system of stormwater management facilities,
including but not limited to inlets, conduits, manholes, channels, ditches,
drainage easements, retention, and detention basins, infiltration facilities,
and other components as well as natural waterways.
   (M)   Those elements of the stormwater management system that provide for
the collection, storage, treatment, and conveyance of stormwater are of benefit
and provide services to benefitted property within the City.
   (N)   The cost of operating and maintaining the stormwater management system
and the financing of existing and future repairs, replacements, improvements,
and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in
relationship to the benefits enjoyed, services received, or burden caused by
properties served thereby.
   (O)   The stormwater charges authorized herein are consistent with the
authority granted in F.S. § 403.0893. That statutory provision is additional
and supplemental authority to the constitutional and statutory power of self-
government granted to the City.
   (P)   It is necessary to establish methods for complying with regulatory
mandates and programs related to the collection, treatment, and management of
stormwater. This includes, but is not limited to, the federally-mandated NPDES
requirements; the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) permit
which the city holds to operate an MS4; city-wide water quality monitoring;
federal, state, and local mandates (stormwater and water quality); public
outreach and education efforts; management of the waters of the Turkey Creek
and Indian River Lagoon (inclusive of dredging, water quality, pollution
control, debris removal, and monitoring); the Illicit Discharge Ordinance
(Chapter 95, City Code, Ordinance No. 2008-37) which applies to all properties
within the city limits; stormwater infrastructure inventories and related
stormwater management plan; grants acquisition and management; the
implementation of city-wide stormwater best management practices (BMPs);
intergovernmental relations, and regulations; stormwater permitting, plan
review, and local regulation; right-of-way and driveway permitting; residential
drainage permitting. These programs are designed to serve the greater good of
all property owners, citizens, stakeholders, and visitors to our community
including those in subdivisions and similar developments both privately or
publicly maintained.

and earnings and obligations of the Utility and including the following
purposes:
      (1)   The acquisition by gift, purchase, or condemnation of real and
personal property and interests therein, necessary to construct, operate, and
maintain stormwater management services and stormwater management facilities;
      (2)   All costs of administration and implementation of the stormwater
management services and stormwater management facilities, including the
establishment of reasonable operating and capital reserves to meet
unanticipated or emergency stormwater management requirements;
      (3)   Engineering and design, debt service and related financing
expenses, construction costs for new facilities, and enlargement or improvement
of existing facilities;
      (4)   Operation and maintenance of the stormwater management services and
stormwater management facilities;
      (5)   Monitoring, surveillance, and inspection of stormwater management
facilities;
      (6)   Permitting, water quality monitoring, and water quality programs;
      (7)   Retrofitting developed areas for pollution control;
      (8)   Inspection and enforcement activities;
      (9)   Billing and administrative costs; and
      (10)   Other activities reasonably required to carry out the City's
stormwater management program.
   (C)   Within each stormwater management area, the City Council intends to
fund all or part of the cost of providing stormwater management services and
stormwater management facilities through stormwater charges. The City Council
has further concluded that periodic determination of revenues earned, and
expenses incurred in connection with the provision of stormwater management
services and stormwater management facilities will enhance accountability and
management control of the City's Stormwater Management Utility and will
facilitate implementation of the City Council's funding policy for stormwater
management. Accordingly, the City Manager shall establish a separate stormwater
utility fund for each stormwater management area, which shall be maintained
separate and apart from all other accounts of the City. Upon receipt, all
stormwater charges shall be deposited into the appropriate Stormwater Utility
Fund. Proceeds of the stormwater charges collected within each stormwater
management area shall be used solely for the provision of stormwater management
services and stormwater management facilities provided therein. Interest earned
on stormwater charges shall not accrue to the City general fund but shall
remain with the Stormwater Utility Fund.
   (D)   Imposition of stormwater charges. The City Council is hereby
authorized to impose stormwater charges against property within all or a
portion of the City included in a stormwater management area by subsequent
resolution(s) of the City Council as further provided herein.
      (1)   Stormwater assessments. The City Council is hereby authorized to
impose stormwater assessments against benefitted property within a stormwater
management area. All stormwater assessments imposed pursuant to this chapter
within a stormwater management area shall be imposed in accordance with the
procedures set forth in
Chapter 56 of the Code and §
6.02 of the City Charter.
         (a)   The stormwater service cost or project cost may be assessed
against benefitted property located within a stormwater management area at a
rate of assessment based upon the special benefit accruing to such property
from the stormwater management service and facilities provided by the City.
         (b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the City Council specifically
determines that any portion of a stormwater management area receives a distinct
special benefit from any component of the stormwater management services or
stormwater management facilities that is materially different in kind or degree
from the special benefit received by other portions of such stormwater
management area, the stormwater service cost or project cost related to such
component shall be assessed against the portion of the stormwater management
area receiving the distinct special benefit.
         (c)   For any fiscal year in which stormwater assessments will be
imposed within a stormwater management area, the City Council shall determine
the stormwater service cost or project cost, the rate of assessments, and the
methodology pursuant to which these costs will be apportioned amongst
benefitted property by separately adopted resolutions in accordance with the
procedures set forth in
Chapter 56 of the Code.
      (2)   Stormwater utility fees. The City Council is hereby authorized to
impose Stormwater Utility Fees on all benefitted property within a stormwater
management area to fund all or any portion of the stormwater service cost or
project cost at a just, fair, reasonable, and equitable rate based upon such
property's stormwater burden and the reasonable cost of providing stormwater
management services to such property.
         (a)   The rate of the stormwater utility fee imposed within a
stormwater management area and the methodology pursuant to which the stormwater
service cost or project cost will be apportioned amongst benefitted property
shall be established by separate resolution of the City Council, and may, at
the discretion of the City Council, be included within a resolution imposing
stormwater service assessments.
         (b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the City Council specifically
determines that any portion of a stormwater management area receives a distinct
special benefit or service from any component of the stormwater management
services or stormwater management facilities that is materially different in
kind or degree from the special benefit received by other portions of such
stormwater management area, the stormwater service cost or project cost related
to such component shall be assessed against the portion of the stormwater
management area receiving the distinct special benefit.
         (c)   Stormwater utility fees shall be adopted by a resolution
approved by the city council after a public hearing. The public hearing must be
advertised at least ten (10) days in advance in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City setting forth the date, time, and place of the public
hearing, the current rate(s), the proposed rate(s), and the effective date of
the proposed rate(s). A separate public hearing is not required to amend rates,
fees, and charges pursuant to a previously adopted price index adjustment. All
rate changes shall apply to the first billing cycle after the effective date
for the rates, unless otherwise provided by resolution.
      (3)   Collection of stormwater charges. The stormwater charges authorized
herein may be collected by the City pursuant to any legally available method or
combination of such methods, including but not limited to: (i) for stormwater
assessments, collection on the ad valorem tax bill pursuant to
Chapter 56 of the Code and the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; (ii)
collection on the utility bill; or (iii) collection by separate bill.
(Ord. 2024-42, passed 9-19-24)
§ 204.09 BILLING AND PAYMENT OF STORMWATER UTILITY FEES.
   (A)   Billing. For parcels subject to a stormwater utility fee, such fees
will be collected on the monthly utility bill or by separate bill, as
determined by the Utility.
   (B)   Delinquent bills. All charges not paid within thirty (30) days after
the bill is due shall be considered delinquent. All charges delinquent
hereunder shall be subject to (i) an interest charge at the Florida statutory
rate; and (ii) shall constitute a lien upon the real property affected, from
the date charges are incurred. Charges which remain unpaid for a period of
sixty (60) days may be reported to the City Council for assessment against the
real property. In the alternative, the City Council may direct the City
Attorney to file suit thereon, and to collect all such unpaid charges and fees,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and charges.
   (C)   Provisions of chapter cumulative. The provisions of this chapter shall
be supplemental to all ordinances of the city, and the provisions of this
chapter shall be cumulative to all other remedies provided by law or ordinance
for the collection of unpaid Stormwater Charges.
(Ord. 2024-42, passed 9-19-24)
§ 204.10 STORMWATER DRAINAGE FACILITIES.
   The owner of real property is responsible for providing and maintaining
stormwater drainage facilities to collect and dispose of stormwater on-site in
compliance with local law. It shall be unlawful for any person to alter non-
city maintained or owned stormwater drainage facilities without the prior
approval of the Public Works Director or other agencies having jurisdiction. No
changes shall be permitted by the Public Works Director which will adversely
affect the stormwater management system in the area of the property.
(Ord. 2024-42, passed 9-19-24)
§ 204.11 PROGRAM RESPONSIBILITY.
   It shall be the duty of the Director to administer the Stormwater Management
Utility. The Director shall keep an accurate record of all properties using the
services and facilities of the system and the stormwater charges established
and imposed pursuant to this chapter.
(Ord. 2024-42, passed 9-19-24)
§ 204.12 FLOODING; LIABILITY.
   (A)   Floods from stormwater runoff may occur which exceed the capacity of
the stormwater management system. Nothing in this chapter, or elsewhere in this
Code, shall be deemed to mean that property subject to the user fees
established hereby will always be free from stormwater flooding and flood
damage.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter or elsewhere in this Code shall be deemed to
create any liability on the part of, or cause of action against, the city, or
any official or employee thereof, for any flood damage that results from the
runoff of floods or storms which cannot be accepted by the stormwater
management system.
