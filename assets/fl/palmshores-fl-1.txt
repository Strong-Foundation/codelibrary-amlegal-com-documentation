filled by election for the remaining one (1) year;
   (2)   If there are more than six (6) months remaining in the unexpired term

Magistrate to the circuit court. The appeal shall not be a hearing de novo but

order to be appealed.

(Ord. 2006-11, passed 8-22-2006; Ord. 2013-07, passed 9-24-2013)
§ 31.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Generally. Any person violating any provision of this chapter, for
which no other penalty is provided, shall be subject to the penalty provisions
of §
10.99.
   (B)   Code Enforcement Special Magistrate.
      (1)   Administrative fines; cost of repairs; liens.
         (a)   Generally. The Special Magistrate, may either in the initial
order or upon notification by code enforcement officer that an order has not
been compiled with or finding that a repeat violation has been committed, order
the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this section for each day
the violation continues past the date set by the Special Magistrate for
compliance or in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat
violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to
have occurred by the Code Inspector. In addition, if the Special Magistrate
finds that the violation is a violation described in §
31.36(D), the Special Magistrate shall notify the town of the findings. The
town shall then have the right and power to make all reasonable repairs which
are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with
the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this
section. Making the repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part
of the town to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not
create any liability against the town for any damages to the property if the
repairs were completed in good faith. If a finding of a violation or repeat
violation has been made as provided by this part, a hearing shall not be
necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine. If, after due notice and
hearing, the Special Magistrate finds a violation to be irreparable or
irreversible in nature, he or she may order the violator to pay a fine as
specified in division (B)(1)(b) below.
         (b)   Fines.
            1.   A fine imposed pursuant to §§
31.30 through
31.38 shall not exceed $250 per day for a first violation and shall not exceed
$500 per day for a repeat violation, and in addition, may include all cost of
repairs pursuant to this section. However, if the Special Magistrate finds the
violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not
to exceed $5,000 per violation.
            2.   In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the Special
Magistrate shall consider the following factors:
               a.   The gravity of the violation;
               b.   Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation;
or
               c.   Any previous violations committed by the violator
         (c)   Reduction of fines. The Special Magistrate may reduce a fine
imposed pursuant to this section. If a violator desires to request
reconsideration of a fine, the following procedures must be followed:
            1.   Any order issued to the violator must be complied with;
            2.   A written request must be made to the Code Inspector for an
inspection for compliance with the order issued; and
            3.   After the Code Inspector has certified in writing that the
prior order of the Special Magistrate has been complied with, the violator
must, within 20 days of the certification by the Code Inspector, request in
writing to the Code Inspector, reconsideration of the fine by the Special
Magistrate.
         (d)   Recording of order. A certified copy of an order imposing a
fine, or a fine plus repair cost may be recorded in the public records and
thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation
exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon
petition to the circuit court, the order shall be enforceable in the same
manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including execution
and levy against the personal property of the violator, but the order shall not
be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine
imposed pursuant to this part shall continue to accrue until the violator comes
into compliance or until judgment is rendered in suit to foreclose on a lien
filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a
fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the town, and the town
may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section.
After three months from the filing of any lien which remains unpaid, the
Special Magistrate may authorize the Town Attorney to foreclose on the lien. No
lien created pursuant to the provisions of this part may be foreclosed on real
property which is a homestead.
      (2)   Remedies.
         (a)   Remedies for enforcement may include the establishment of a Code
Enforcement Board or prosecution in a court of competent jurisdiction.
         (b)   The town may levy fines, liens, injunctive relief and other
civil penalties, as provided for in the Florida Statutes. At a minimum, the
town elects to use the following standards, from F.S. Ch. 162.21 for penalties:
            1.   A violation of a code or an ordinance is a civil infraction;
            2.   A maximum civil penalty not to exceed $500;
            3.   A civil penalty of less than the maximum civil penalty if the
person who has committed the civil infraction does not contest the citation;
            4.   For the issuance of a citation by a code enforcement officer
who has reasonable cause to believe that a person has committed an act in
violation of a code or an ordinance;
            5.   For the contesting of a citation in county court;
            6.   The procedures and provisions as are necessary to provide for
the enforcement of a code or an ordinance under the provisions of this section;
and
            7.   Any person who willfully refuses to sign and accept a citation
issued by a code enforcement officer shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the
second degree, punishable as provided in F.S. § 775.082 or § 775.083

reduced by the percentage of credit determined by the above formula. If the
percentage of credit is 100% or more, no fee shall be required to be paid.
      (2)   The credit shall become effective upon Town Council acceptance of
the dedication of the land. The land shall not be accepted by the Town Council
unless it finds the land to be suitable for active recreation purposes. In
determining the suitability of the land for active recreation purposes, the
Town Council may consider all factors and variables affecting the suitability,
including, but not limited to:
         (a)   Access from paved public streets;
         (b)   Size;
         (c)   Fair market value;
         (d)   Physical characteristics and qualities;
         (e)   Proximity of the land to other recreation facilities;
         (f)   Availability of town funds to construct active recreation
facilities on the land; and
         (g)   Conformance with the town’s comprehensive plan.
      (3)   The fair market value of the land to be dedicated shall be
established by a formal MAI appraisal which is acceptable to the town. The
appraisal shall be provided by the subdivider or developer at his or her
expense.
      (4)   The land shall be dedicated to the town in fee simple, and shall be
free of any liens or encumbrances.

of monies collected adequate to determine the amount contributed to the fund
from each particular development. The funds collected from any development
shall be used only to acquire, construct or provide recreational improvements
or facilities needed or anticipated to be needed by the residents of the
particular development. The town shall maintain records of all funds expended

PUBLIC FACILITIES IMPACT FEE
§ 34.45 SHORT TITLE AND INTENT.
   (A)   This subchapter shall be known and may be cited as the Public
Facilities Impact Fee Code.
   (B)   Implementing a regulatory plan that requires new development to pay a
public facilities impact fee that does not exceed a pro rata share of the
reasonably anticipated expansion of police substation facilities, and general
administrative facilities (the “public facilities”) needed to serve new growth
and development is a responsibility of the town in order to carry out the
future land use and capital improvement elements of the town’s comprehensive
plan, as amended and adopted pursuant to F.S. Ch. 163.3161 et seq., and is in
the best interest of the health, safety, economic order, aesthetics and welfare
of the citizens of the town and the region.
   (C)   The purpose of the Public Facilities Impact Fee Code is to enable the
town to allow growth and development to proceed in the town in compliance with
the comprehensive plan, and to regulate growth and development so as to require
growth and development to share in the burden of growth by paying its pro rata
share for the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of the major police
substation and general administrative facilities. The town through this code
seeks to provide an equitable, fair share basis for new and expanded public
facilities commensurate with the impacts and need generated by new development.
   (D)   It is not the purpose of this Public Facilities Impact Fee Code to
collect fees from growth and development in excess of the cost of the
reasonably anticipated improvements to the public facilities needed to serve
the new growth and development. The Town Council hereby finds that the public
facilities impact fee has been determined in a conservative and reasonable
manner.
(Ord. 2007-12, passed 7-24-2007)
§ 34.46 FEE REQUIRED.
   (A)   All new development or an expansion or enlargement of existing
development shall pay a public facilities impact fee to the town to be used to

   Institutional              Per 1,000 square feet $250
 
   (B)   In the event that an applicant contends that the land use for which
the building permit is proposed is not within the above categories or fits
within a different category from that determined by the Building Department,
the Building Official shall render a determination as to the appropriate land
use designation.
   (C)   In the event that the fee amount is calculated based on a use category
that requires assessment of the fee based on increments of square footage, the
Building Official shall calculate the fee based on the number of whole
increments of 1,000 square feet of gross floor area plus a pro rated amount for
the fractional portion of any square footage increment.
   (D)   The Building Official is hereby delegated the authority to compute the
impact fee due and payable pursuant to this section.
   (E)   Upon rendition of any determination made pursuant to this section, an
appeal may be made to the Building Board of Adjustment and Appeals pursuant to

manner, properly trimmed and pruned so to avoid hazards to persons on public
property, to public property or to utilities serving the public.
      (2)   The Building Official or Mayor may seek entry to private property
in order to inspect trees and shrubs upon the property to determine compliance
with this division. The Building Official/Mayor shall first seek the property
owner’s/lessee’s permission to conduct an inspection. Should the property
owner/lessee object to the inspection, the Building Official/Mayor may seek,
from a court of competent jurisdiction, a warrant to inspect the premises in
accordance with this division and applicable state law. Should a condition of
extreme danger or imminent peril to public property, persons on public property
or to utilities serving the public be known to exist or readily apparent, the
warrant requirements of this section may be dispensed with, but only if there
is reasonable cause to believe that the delay involved in compliance with the
warrant requirement would pose an imminent peril or extreme danger to persons
on public property, public property or to utilities serving the public.
      (3)   Upon finding that any tree or shrub or part thereof constitutes a
nuisance, an imminent peril or extreme danger to persons upon public property,
public property or utilities serving the public, the Building Official/Mayor
direct the property owner, lessee or other person to remove, treat or trim the
tree or shrub to a degree and in a manner as the Building Official/Mayor shall
determine will correct the nuisance, imminent peril or extreme danger. Service
of an order by the Mayor to accomplish the foregoing may be in the manner
specified in F.S. § 162.12. The order shall set forth the time limit for
compliance, which shall depend upon the degree of extreme danger, imminent
peril or nuisance created by the tree or shrub. In cases of imminent peril or
extreme danger to public property, persons on public property or to utilities
serving the public, the Mayor shall have the authority to require immediate
compliance.
      (4)   If, at the end of the time period set forth in the order, the tree
or shrub has not been removed or trimmed as directed, it may be declared a
nuisance and the Mayor may have the tree or shrub removed or trimmed as
appropriate to avoid extreme danger or imminent peril. The costs of this
service, including labor, equipment and materials, may be assessed to the
private property owner. A tree or shrub may be deemed a nuisance if it, or any
part of it:
         (a)   Appears dead, decayed, diseased, insect infested, dangerous or
likely to fall on public property, persons on public property or utilities
serving the public;
         (b)   Is not pruned to a height of 14 feet above the street to
accommodate vehicles such as garbage trucks, buses and street maintenance
trucks;
         (c)   Is not pruned to a height of nine feet above the sidewalk;
         (d)   Interferes with sewers;
         (e)   Is in dangerous proximity to interfere with utilities serving
the public; or
         (f)   Interferes with a planned public improvement.
   (E)   Recorded statement constitutes a lien. Where the amount due the town
is not paid by the owner within 30 days after the cutting, trimming and/or
removal of the trees or shrubs performed by or on behalf of the town, under
this section, the Mayor may cause to be recorded in the public records of the
county a sworn statement showing the cost and expenses incurred for the work
done and the date, place and property on which the work was done. The recording
of the sworn statement shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount
due in principal for labor, administrative costs and fees incurred by the town,
plus interest and court costs, if any, for collection, including reasonable
attorney fees, until payment has been made. The costs and expenses shall be
collected in the manner fixed by law for the foreclosure of mortgages. Lien
shall accrue interest at the rate of 12% per annum. Sworn statements recorded
in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be prima facie evidence that all
legal formalities have been complied with and that the work has been done
properly and satisfactorily, and shall be full notice to every person concerned
that the amount of the statement, plus interest, constitutes a charge against
the property designated or described in the statement and that the same is due
and collectible as provided by law.

federal law, including F.S. § 337.401, as amended from time to time, Florida
Constitution of 1968, Article VIII, section 2, F.S. §§ 166.011 et seq., as the
same may be amended from time to time (municipal home-rule authority), and in
accordance with the provisions of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996,
and other federal and state law; establishing reasonable rules and regulations
necessary to manage the placement or maintenance of communications facilities
in the public rights-of-way by all communications services providers; and

applicable federal and state laws.
(Ord. 2010-01, passed 1-26-2010)
§ 93.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ABANDONMENT. The permanent cessation of all uses of a communications
facility; provided that this term shall not include cessation of all uses of a
facility within a physical structure where the physical structure continues to
be used. By way of example, and not limitation, cessation of all use of a cable
within a conduit, where the conduit continues to be used, shall not be an
ABANDONMENT of a facility in public rights-of-way.
   COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY or FACILITY or COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM or SYSTEM. Any
permanent or temporary plant, equipment and property, including but not limited
to amplifiers, cables, wires, conduits, ducts, fiber optics, head end, poles
(excluding mono poles), antennae, converters, splice boxes, cabinets, hand
holes, manholes, vaults, tower, drains, surface location markers,
appurtenances, and other equipment or pathway placed or maintained or to be
placed or maintained in the public rights-of-way of the town and used or
capable of being used to transmit, convey, route, receive, distribute, provide
or offer communications services. A COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY shall not include
any facilities of any electric utility used solely for operating its electric
utility systems, or a facility that serves only subscribers in one or more
multiple unit dwellings under common ownership or control, unless such facility
or facilities uses any public rights-of-way.
   COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.  The transmission, conveyance or routing of voice,
data, audio, video, or any other information or signals to a point, or between
or among points, by or through any electronic, radio, satellite, cable,
optical, microwave, or other medium or method now in existence or hereafter
devised, regardless of the protocol used for such transmission or conveyance.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this chapter “cable service”, as
defined in F.S. § 202.11(1), as amended from time to time, is included in the
definition of COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, and cable service providers may be
subject to other ordinances, resolutions, and regulations of the town.
   COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES PROVIDER. Any person, including a municipality or
county, providing communications services through the placement or maintenance
of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES
PROVIDER shall also include any person, including a municipality or county,
that places or maintains a communications facility in public rights-of-way but
does not provide communications services. COMMUNICATION SERVICES PROVIDER shall
not include any cable television provider that has a current cable television
franchise agreement with the town on the date this chapter is adopted, however,
upon the expiration of such franchise agreement and in the event the franchise
agreement is not renewed in accordance with federal law, the term COMMUNICATION
SERVICES PROVIDER shall also include cable television providers.
   FCC. The Federal Communications Commission and any legally appointed or
elected successor.

facilities in the public rights-of-way act(s) including but not limited to

control over communications facilities in public rights-of-way, such as the
physical control to maintain and repair, is PLACING OR MAINTAINING the
facilities. A person providing service only through resale or only through use
of a third party’s unbundled network elements is not PLACING OR MAINTAINING the
communications facilities through which such service is provided. The
transmission and receipt of radio frequency signals through the airspace of the
public rights-of-way does not constitute PLACING OR MAINTAINING facilities in
the public rights-of-way.
   PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY. A public right-of-way, public utility easement,

the airspace over the surface and the area below the surface. The term PUBLIC
RIGHTS-OF-WAY shall not include private property. The term PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY
shall not include any real or personal town property except as described above
and shall not include town buildings, fixtures, poles, conduits, facilities or
other structures or improvements, regardless of whether they are situated in
the public rights-of-way. No reference in this chapter to the PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-
WAY shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the town that its
title to any property is sufficient to permit its use for the purpose of

deemed to gain only such rights to use the public right-of-way in the town as
the town may have the undisputed right and power to give.
   REGISTRANT. A communications services provider, whether natural, corporate,
or otherwise, domestic or foreign, that has registered with the town in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, and the lawful successor,

partnership, limited partnership, trust or association, or person or group of
persons acting in concert or a change in control.
(Ord. 2010-01, passed 1-26-2010)
§ 93.04 REGISTRATION FOR PLACING OR MAINTAINING COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN
PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   (A)   Registration required. A communications services provider that desires
to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the
town shall first register with the Town Clerk in accordance with this chapter.
No registrant shall place or maintain any communications facility in a public
right-of-way without a permit to do so issued by the town.
   (B)   Registration rights in addition to other requirements. A registration
shall not convey any title, equitable or legal, to the registrant in the public
rights-of-way. Registration under this chapter governs only the placement or
maintenance of communications facilities in public rights-of-way. Registration
does not excuse a communications services provider from obtaining appropriate
access or pole attachment agreements before locating its facilities on the
town’s or another person’s facilities. Registration does not excuse a
communications services provider from complying with all applicable town
ordinances, codes or regulations, including this chapter. Other ordinances,
codes or regulations may apply to the placement or maintenance in the rights-
of-way of facilities that are not communications facilities.
   (C)   Registration information required. Each communications services
provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public
rights-of-way in the town shall file a single registration with the town which
shall include the following information:
      (1)   Name of the applicant;
      (2)   Name, address and telephone number of the applicant’s primary
contact person in connection with the registration, and the person to contact
in case of an emergency;

acknowledgment that registrant has received and reviewed a copy of this
chapter, which acknowledgment shall not be deemed an agreement;

license to provide communications services issued by the state public service
commission, the Federal Communications Commission, or other federal or state
authority, if any; and
      (5)   For an applicant that does not provide a state public service
commission certificate of authorization number, if the applicant is a
corporation, proof of authority to do business in the state, such as the number
of the certificate from or filing with the state department of state.
   (D)   Registration application fees. No registration application fees shall
be imposed.
   (E)   Registration does not give right to install and maintain facilities.
Registration does not in and of itself establish a right to place or maintain
or priority for the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in
the public rights-of-way within the town, but shall establish for the
registrant a right to apply for a permit to place or maintain a communications
facility. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or
replacement of this chapter and further subject to any additional town
ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be enacted.
   (F)   Renewal of registration. A registrant shall renew its registration
with the Town Clerk by October 1 of even numbered years in accordance with the
registration requirements in this chapter, except that a registrant that
initially registers during the even numbered year when renewal would be due or
the odd numbered year immediately preceding such even numbered year shall not
be required to renew until the next even numbered year. Within 30 days of any
change in the information required to be submitted pursuant to division (C), a
registrant shall provide updated information to the town. If no information in
the then-existing registration has changed, the renewal may state that no
information has changed. Failure to renew a registration may result in the town
restricting the issuance of additional permits until the communications
services provider has complied with the registration requirements of this
chapter.
   (G)   The town shall review the information submitted by the applicant. Such
review shall be by the Mayor or designee. If the applicant submits information
in accordance with division (C) above, the registration shall be effective and
the town shall notify the applicant of the effectiveness of registration in
writing. If the town determines that the information has not been submitted in
accordance with division (C) above, the Mayor shall notify the applicant of the
non-effectiveness of registration, and reasons for the non-effectiveness, in
writing. The town shall so reply to an applicant within 30 days after receipt
of registration information from the applicant. Non-effectiveness of
registration shall not preclude an applicant from filing subsequent
applications for registration under the provisions of this section. An
applicant has 30 days after receipt of a notice of non-effectiveness of
registration to appeal the decision as provided in §
93.14.
   (H)   A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the town
stating that it will no longer place or maintain any communications facilities
in rights-of-way within the town and will no longer need to obtain permits to
perform work in rights-of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a registration if the
registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in
rights-of-way.
   (I)   In accordance with applicable town ordinances, codes or regulations, a
permit may be required of a communications services provider that desires to
place or maintain a communications facility in rights-of-way. An effective
registration shall be a condition of obtaining a permit. Notwithstanding an
effective registration, permitting requirements shall apply. A permit may be
obtained by or on behalf of a registrant having an effective registration if
all permitting requirements are met.

credit. The bond or letter of credit shall secure both payment and performance

of credit shall be 100% of the amount of restoration cost to restore the right-
of-way to a condition equivalent to or better than prior to the commencement of
work within the public right-of-way. In the event that a letter of credit is
utilized, the registrant shall obtain and continuously maintain an unexpired,
irrevocable letter of credit, which shall at all times be in the possession of
the town during the same term as would have been required for the bond. The
form and contents of such bond or letter of credit shall be acceptable to the

expiration of the aforementioned time frame or upon the replacement of the
letter of credit by a successor registrant. The town may elect not to require a
bond where the town determines it is not necessary to secure restoration
considering by way of example and not by way of limitation the ability of the
provider to cover any claims without the need for additional security.
   (B)   Rights reserved in addition to other rights. The rights reserved to
the town under this section are in addition to all other rights of the town,
whether reserved in this chapter, or authorized by other law, or at law or in
equity, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to the
construction bond or letter of credit will affect any other right the town may
have.
   (C)   Conditions. The bond or letter of credit shall be issued upon the
following conditions:
      (1)   Twenty-four months after the completion of the restoration in
public rights-of-way in accordance with the bond or the letter of credit, the
registrant may eliminate the bond or letter of credit. However, the town may
subsequently require a new bond or letter of credit for any subsequent work in
the public rights-of-way.
      (2)   The construction bond shall be issued by a surety having a rating
reasonably acceptable to the town; shall be subject to the approval of the Town
Engineer, Town Attorney, or their respective designees; and shall provide that:
“For 24 months after issuance of this bond [or letter of credit], this bond [or
letter of credit] may not be canceled, or allowed to lapse, until 60 days after
receipt by the town, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written
notice from the issuer of the bond [or letter of credit] of intent to cancel or
not to renew.”

suffered or incurred by the town resulting from the failure of the registrant,
its or their contractors, subcontractors, materialmen, laborers, or agents to:
faithfully comply with the provisions of this code or this chapter; comply with
all orders, permits and directives of any town agency or body having
jurisdiction over its acts or defaults; pay any claims, liens, fees, or taxes

facilities within the public right-of-way and without approval of the town or
fails to complete construction of the communications facilities within the
public right-of-way or fails to properly, completely, and timely restore the
public right-of-way, or any part thereof;

registrant, the town may, at its sole option, permit the terms of the
requirements of the performance bond/letter of credit to be altered or waived

when it is determined by the town to be in the public interest to alter or
waive the terms of the bond or letter of credit. For example, but not limited
to, where such security is not necessary due to the amount of restoration that
needs to be done or the ability of the registrant to cover any claims without
the need for additional security.
   (E)   Use of bond or letter of credit. Prior to drawing upon the letter of
credit or the bond for the purposes described in this section, the town shall
notify the registrant in writing that payment is due, and the registrant shall
have not more than 30 days from the receipt of such written notice to make a
full and complete payment. If the registrant does not make the payment within
30 days or demonstrate reason acceptable to the town why such action should not
be taken, the town may withdraw the amount thereof, with interest and
penalties, from the letter of credit or the bond. Within three days of a
withdrawal from the letter of credit or bond, the town shall send to the
registrant, by certified mail, return receipt requested, written notification
of the amount, date and purpose of such withdrawal.

30 days, after mailing to the registrant by certified mail notification of a
withdrawal pursuant to division (E), the registrant shall replenish the letter
of credit and/or bond in an amount equal to the amount so withdrawn. Failure to
make timely replenishment of such amount to the letter of credit and/or bond
shall constitute a failure of the registrant to faithfully comply with the
provisions of this chapter and the registrant.
   (G)   Non-renewal, alteration, or cancellation of letter of credit or
performance bond. The bond and letter of credit required herein shall require
30 days written notice of any non-renewal, alteration or cancellation to both

section shall become the property of the town in the event that the permit is
canceled or terminated by reason of the default of the registrant.
   (J)   Right to require replacement of bonds or letter of credit. If the town
becomes aware of the financial condition of any bonding or financial
institution issuing a performance bond or letter of credit as required herein
and the financial condition is deemed by the town to jeopardize the collateral
posted with the town, the town may, at any time, require that any such bond or
letter of credit be replaced with such other bond or letter of credit
consistent with the requirements set forth in this section.
   (K)   Blanket bond. The registrant shall have the additional choice of
providing the town with a blanket bond, in which case a construction bond or
letter of credit may only be required for any work to the extent the cost of
restoration exceeds the amount of the blanket bond.

considered a permit to apply for an exemption to the removal requirement.
Removal shall be accomplished at the sole expense of the registrant.
   (B)   Upon application for an exemption from the requirement to remove an
abandoned facility, the town shall grant such request not to remove all or any
portion of such abandoned facility, if the town determines that the abandoned
facility’s presence will not in the future interfere with the public health,
safety, economic order, aesthetics, and welfare of the community and the
region, which shall include, but shall not be limited to, a determination that
such facility:
      (1)   Shall not compromise safety at any time for any public rights-of-
way user or during construction or maintenance within the public rights-of-way;
      (2)   Shall not prevent another person from locating facilities in the

requirement for the facility proposed to be abandoned, the registrant, by its
notice of abandonment to the town, shall be deemed to consent to the alteration
or removal of all or any portion of the facility by the town or another person
at such third party’s cost.
   (D)   If the registrant fails to remove all or any portion of an abandoned
facility as directed by the town within a reasonable time period as may be
required by the town under the circumstances, the town may perform such removal
and charge the cost of the removal against the registrant.

facilities from the rights-of-way and restore the rights-of-way to its original
condition before the removal.
   (D)   In any event, a terminated registrant shall take such steps as are
necessary to render safe every portion of the communications facilities
remaining in the rights-of-way of the town.
   (E)   In the event of termination of a registration, this section does not
authorize the town to cause the removal of communications facilities used to
provide another service for which the registrant or another person who owns or
exercises physical control over the facilities holds a valid certification or
license with the governing federal or state agency, if required for provision
of such service, and is registered with the town, if required.

or corporation; and
      (4)   Arising out of, or alleged to arise out of, grantee’s failure to
comply with the provisions of any statute, regulation or ordinance of any
federal, state or any local agency applicable to the grantee in its business.
   (B)   Indemnification expenses shall include, but not be limited to, all
out-of-pocket expenses, such as reasonable attorneys’ fees, and shall include
the reasonable value of any services rendered by the Town Attorney or his or
her assistants or any consultants, agents and employees of the town. Nothing

performance by the registrant of all requirements, duties and obligations
imposed upon registrant by the provisions of this chapter. The Security Fund
shall be furnished annually or as frequently as necessary to provide a
continuing guarantee of the registrant’s full and faithful performance at all
times. In the event a registrant fails to perform its duties and obligations
imposed upon the registrant by the provisions of this chapter, there shall be
recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal and surety of the
Security Fund, any damages or loss suffered by the town as a result, including
the full amount of any compensation, indemnification or cost of removal,
relocation or abandonment of any facilities of the registrant in rights-of-way,
plus a reasonable allowance for attorneys’ fees, up to the full amount of the
security fund. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the town may in its discretion
not require a Security Fund or may accept a corporate guarantee of the
registrant or its parent company.

   (D)   Nothing in this chapter shall affect the remedies the town has
available under applicable law.
   (E)   Any person who uses the communications facilities of a registrant,
other than the registrant that owns the facilities, shall not be entitled to
any rights to place or maintain such facilities in excess of the rights of the
registrant that places or maintains the facilities.
   (F)   Approved registrations and permits are expressly subject to any future
amendment to or replacement of this chapter and further subject to any
additional town ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be
enacted.
   (G)   The town shall have all powers not otherwise preempted by the
regulations of the FCC or applicable federal or state law or regulation, and
shall have all powers conferred on a permitting authority or allowed by any
provision of state or federal law which are not addressed in this chapter.
   (H)   Should any amendment be made to any federal or state law or should any
provision thereof be held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of
competent jurisdiction which materially affects the town’s authority with
respect to the regulation of this chapter, the town shall have the right to
amend this chapter to the extent it deems appropriate, and the existing permit
shall be subject to such amendment.

(Ord. 2018-06, passed 8-29-2018)
§ 93.33 SMALL WIRELESS FACILITIES AND SUPPORT STRUCTURES.
   (a)   General.
      (1)   Small wireless facilities and support structures that comply with
the requirements of this subchapter may be installed and located within town
public rights-of-way through the right-of-way/ easement permitting process. The
cost of maintaining such collocated facilities is the responsibility of the
permitee.
      (2)   A person is not authorized to collocate or attach wireless
facilities, including any antenna, micro wireless facility, or small wireless
facility, on a privately owned utility pole, a utility pole owned by an
electric cooperative or a municipal electric utility, a privately owned
wireless support structure, or other private property without the consent of
the property owner.
      (3)   Approval of the installation, placement, maintenance, or operation
of a small wireless facility pursuant to this division does not authorize the
provision of any voice, data, or video communications services or the
installation, placement, maintenance, or operation of any communications
facilities other than small wireless facilities in the right-of-way.
      (4)   Collocation of small wireless facilities or micro wireless
facilities on a utility pole, unless otherwise permitted by federal law, is
prohibited in the public right-of-way located within a location subject to
covenants, conditions, restrictions, articles of incorporation, and bylaws of a
homeowners' association. This paragraph does not apply to the installation,
placement, maintenance, or replacement of micro wireless facilities on any
existing and duly authorized aerial communications facilities.
      (5)   Collocation of small wireless facilities or micro wireless
facilities on a town utility pole or placement of a wireless support structure
is prohibited in a location subject to covenants, conditions, restrictions,
articles of incorporation, and bylaws of a homeowners' association. This
limitation does not apply to the installation, placement, maintenance, or
replacement of micro wireless facilities on any existing and duly authorized
aerial communications facilities.
      (6)   A wireless provider shall, in relation to a small wireless facility
or support structure in the public rights-of-way, comply with nondiscriminatory
undergrounding requirements that prohibit above-ground structures in public
rights-of-way. Any such requirements may be waived by the Town Mayor.
   (B)   Standards.
      (1)   Height. The height of a small wireless facility is limited to ten
feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure upon which the small
wireless facility is to be collocated. Unless waived by the town, the height
for a new utility pole or wireless support structure is limited to the tallest
existing utility pole or wireless support structure as of July 1, 2017, located
in the same right-of-way, other than a utility pole or wireless support
structure for which a waiver has previously been granted, measured from grade
in place within 500 feet of the proposed location. If there is no utility pole
or wireless support structure within 500 feet, the height is limited to 50
feet. A structure granted a permit and installed pursuant to this division
shall comply with state and federal regulations pertaining to airport airspace
protections.
      (2)   If more than 220 volts are necessary for the operation of the small
wireless facility and are utilized in the utility pole or wireless support
structure, a sign shall be attached to the utility pole or wireless support
structure stating in large, bold, high contrast letters (minimum height of each
letter four inches): "HIGH VOLTAGE - DANGER."
      (3)   All small wireless facilities and support structures shall have a
plaque placed upon it for the purpose of identification (either by the ASR
registration number or other identifying information) including the party
responsible for the operation and maintenance of the facility or structure. The
plaque shall not exceed 0.25 square feet. No other signage, other than a "high
voltage - danger sign," if applicable, or any signage required by the FCC, is
allowed on a small wireless facility, utility pole or wireless support
structure.
      (4)   All wiring and fiber shall be concealed within the support
structure and all conduit, wiring and fiber shall be buried between structures
and/or structures and ground mounted cabinets. All service lines (e.g.,
electric lines) to the support structure must also be buried unless service
lines in the area of the support structure are aerial. In that event, service
lines to the utility pole or wireless support structure may also be aerial,
except for any service drop crossing a street or right-of-way which would need
to be bored and placed under such street or right-of-way.
      (5)   New support structures and small wireless facilities shall be
designed to blend into the surrounding environment and complement existing
streetscape elements through the use of color, camouflaging and architectural
treatment. Any equipment mounted to the support structures shall also match the
support structure in color and general design. These design standards may be
waived by the Town Mayor, in consultation with the Town Engineer, upon a
showing that the design standards are not reasonably compatible for the
particular location of a small wireless facility or that the design standards
impose an excessive expense. The waiver shall be granted or denied within 45
days after the date of the request.
      (6)   Any proposed new support structure shall be designed and engineered
structurally, electrically and in all other respects, to accommodate both the
initial small cell facility and one or more additional small wireless
facilities.
      (7)   Small wireless facilities shall be flush-mounted onto support
structures, unless it is demonstrated through RF propagation analysis that
flush-mounted antennas will not meet the network objectives of the desired
coverage area.
      (8)   All small wireless facilities and support structures shall be
designed and constructed to conform to all applicable provisions of this
subchapter, the Florida Building Code, as amended, the Florida Department of
Transportation Manual, as amended.
      (9)   All wireless facilities in the public rights-of-way shall comply
with current radio frequency emissions standards of the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) and any other applicable FCC rules.
      (10)   All proposed collocations and ancillary equipment shall comply
with the ANSI/EIA/ TIA-222 (as amended) code for the town, if applicable.
      (11)   All small wireless facilities and support structures shall be
constructed to conform with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA).
      (12)   All small wireless facilities, utility poles and wireless support
structures shall be designed and constructed to conform to all applicable
standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) manual, as
amended.
      (13)   All small wireless facilities and support structures must be
located to avoid any physical or visual obstruction to pedestrian, bicycle, or
vehicular traffic or to otherwise create safety hazards to pedestrians,
bicyclists or motorists.
      (14)   The placement of small wireless facilities on existing support
structures in public rights-of-way is encouraged and preferred over the
installation of new support structures. An applicant must provide satisfactory
evidence to the town that no existing support structures can be reasonably used
or replaced for use for the proposed collocation.
      (15)   All new support structures must be constructed to permit
collocation by other wireless service providers where feasible. The term "where
feasible," as it applies to collocation, means that utilization of a support
structure by another party would, at the time of such utilization, comply with
sound engineering principles, would not materially degrade or impair the
support structure's utilization by existing users, would not unduly burden the
structural integrity of the support structure, and would not otherwise
materially and adversely impact existing users. Reasonable terms for use of a
support structure that may be imposed by the owner include a requirement for
reasonable rent or fees, taking into consideration the capitalized cost of the
support structure and land, the incremental cost of designing and constructing
the support structure so as to accommodate additional users, increases in
maintenance expenses relating to the support structure and a fair return on
investment, provided such amount is also consistent with rates paid by other
providers at comparable support structure sites.

   (H)   A permitee may not construe a permit, correspondence, or other
communication as affecting a right, privilege or duty previously conferred or
imposed by the town to or on another person. The town reserves the right to
continue or extend a right, privilege, or duty or to contract with additional
users of town-owned rights-of-way without regard to resulting economic
competition.
   (I)   A permitee is solely responsible for the risk and expense of
installation, operation, and maintenance of the permitee's attachments,
structures or improvements. The town does not warrant or represent that town-
owned utility poles, equipment or structures are suitable for placement of a

   (A)   These regulations shall be known as the Town of Palm Shores Fertilizer
Use and Application Code.
   (B)   These regulations regulate the proper use of fertilizers by any
applicator; requires proper training of commercial and institutional fertilizer
applicators; establishes training and licensing requirements; establishes a
prohibited application period; specifies allowable fertilizer application rates
and methods, fertilizer-free zones, low maintenance zones, and exemptions.
These regulations require the use of best management practices which provide
specific management guidelines to minimize negative secondary and cumulative
environmental effects associated with the misuse of fertilizers. These
secondary and cumulative effects have been observed in and on the town's
natural and constructed stormwater conveyances, rivers, creeks, canals,
springs, lakes, estuaries and other water bodies. Collectively, these water
bodies are an asset critical to the environmental, recreational, cultural and
economic well-being of the town residents and the health of the public.
Overgrowth of algae and vegetation hinder the effectiveness of flood
attenuation provided by natural and constructed stormwater conveyances.
Regulation of nutrients, including both phosphorus and nitrogen contained in
fertilizer, will help improve and maintain water and habitat quality.

in crime, debt, suicide and other negative effects on the health, safety,
morals and welfare of the residents and visitors to the areas where these
devices exist. By law, local governments have all powers of self-government

cause harm to the public. Pursuant to the Town Charter, the Town Council hereby
intends to regulate slot machines or devices to accomplish the purposes set

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 113.001 PURPOSE, FINDINGS, INTENT AND INCORPORATION OF RECITALS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually-
oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments in order to promote
and protect the public health, safety, good order, morals and general welfare
of the citizens of the town, to establish reasonable and uniform regulations of
adult entertainment establishments and sexually-oriented businesses within the
town. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing an unreasonable limitation or unreasonable restriction on the content
of any lawful communicative materials including sexually-oriented materials.
Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to unreasonably
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually-oriented materials protected by
the First Amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually-oriented entertainment protected by the First Amendment to their
intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone
or legitimize the distribution of obscene or otherwise illegal material.
   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made
available to the Council, and on findings incorporated in Supreme Court cases

Florida; Manatee County, Florida; the findings of the Attorney General of the
State of Minnesota; the report of United States Attorney General’s Commission
on Pornography (1986); Jacksonville, Florida; Detroit, Michigan; and A Summary
of a National Survey of Real Estate Appraisers Regarding the Effect of Adult
Bookstores on Property Values, conducted by the Division of Planning,
Department of Metropolitan Development, Indianapolis, January 1984; the
publication entitled Protecting Communities From Sexually-Oriented Businesses
(Southwest Legal Press, Inc.); the publication entitled Local Regulation Of
Adult Businesses (Clark, Boardman and Callaghan); publications prepared by the
Florida Family Association, Inc. (Tampa, Florida) relating to the regulation of
sexually-oriented businesses and adverse secondary effects of sexually-oriented
businesses; the Report to: The American Center for Law and Justice on the
Secondary Impacts of Sex Oriented Businesses, Peter R. Hecht, Ph.D. (1996); and
the findings of fact relating to the Adult Entertainment Code of Orange County,
Florida, and the findings of fact relating to the Sexually-Oriented Business
and Adult Entertainment Establishment Ordinance of Seminole County, Florida,
matters and materials submitted at the public hearings relating to this chapter
and other matters and documents relating to all of the above; the Town Council
finds:
      (1)   Sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments
lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are
presently uncontrolled or not adequately controlled by the operators of the
establishments or businesses. Further, there are presently no mechanisms or
inadequate mechanisms to make the owners of these businesses or establishments
responsible for the activities that occur on their premises;
      (2)   Certain workers of certain sexually-oriented businesses and adult
entertainment establishments defined in this chapter engage in a higher
incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than workers of other
business establishments;
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments, especially
those which provide private or semi-private areas, booths or cubicles for
viewing films, videos, live sex shows and those having physical interaction
between workers and customers;
      (4)   Offering and providing private spaces encourages the previously
mentioned activities, which create unhealthy conditions;
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and other
sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments for the
purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of businesses and
establishments;
      (6)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human
immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non
A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections;
      (7)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States, 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983,
4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985, 253,448 through December 31, 1992 and currently
there are 1,400,000 people infected with the disease nationally with 40,000
people becoming infected annually;
      (8)   As of December 31, 1995, there have been 51,838 reported cases of
AIDS in the state with over 100,000 AIDS cases being reported in the state from
1983 through 2005 and the state ranks third in cumulative AIDS cases in the
United States and has the second highest AIDS rate in the United States;
      (9)   From 1981 to June 1996, the number of living persons testing
positive for the HIV antibody with AIDS symptoms has risen to 73,217 in the 28
states having confidential reporting requirements;
      (10)   The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982
and 45,200 through November of 1990 and between 2004 and 2005, the national
syphilis rate increased 11.1%;
      (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being
reported in 1990 and currently 350,000 cases of gonorrhea are reported annually
with Florida reporting over 20,000 cases of gonorrhea annually;
      (12)   The Surgeon General of the United States, in his report of October
22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn;
      (13)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts;
      (14)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually-oriented businesses and adult
entertainment establishments are unhealthy, in part, because the activities
conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature
of the activities and the failure of owners and operators of the facilities to
self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities;
      (15)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments where persons view “adult” oriented films which gives rise to
health and aesthetic concerns;
      (16)   The findings noted in division (B)(1) through (B)(15) above and as
set forth hereinafter raise substantial governmental concerns;
      (17)   Sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments have operational characteristics that should be reasonably
regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns;
      (18)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments.
Further, a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on
the operators to see that the business or establishment is run in a manner
consistent with the good order, health, safety and welfare of its patrons and
workers, as well as the citizens of the town. It is appropriate to require
reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the business
or establishment, fully in possession and control of the premises and
activities occurring therein;
      (19)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters;
      (20)   Requiring licensees of sexually-oriented businesses and adult
entertainment establishments to keep information regarding current workers and
certain past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of
criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or
suspects and by preventing minors from working at businesses and
establishments;
      (21)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually-
oriented business and adult entertainment establishments, where the information
is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the
operation of the uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually
transmitted diseases;
      (22)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain workers
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who
are likely to be witnesses to the activity;
      (23)   The fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment
establishment or sexually-oriented business license has been convicted of a
sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may
engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter;
      (24)   Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the town and
other nearby cities and counties in central Florida where adult entertainment
material is possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold for
commercial purposes in the form of books, magazines, periodicals or other
printed material, or photographs, films, motion pictures, prints, videotapes,
slides, computer digital graphic recordings or other visual representations or
recordings, or recordings or other audio matter, or instruments, novelties,
devices, or paraphernalia which depict, illustrate, describe or relate to
specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas;
      (25)   Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the town and
other nearby cities or counties in the state where adult entertainment and
sexually-oriented commercial activities in the form of nude, semi-nude or
topless dancers, entertainers, performers or other individuals, who, for
commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing
specified anatomical areas; or engage in straddle dancing or touching with
customers;
      (26)   Commercial sexually-oriented businesses exist or operate or may
exist or operate within the town or other nearby cities or counties in the
state where sexually-oriented services are offered for commercial or pecuniary
gain in the form of commercial physical contact, escort services and other
services providing sexual encounters. The workers of sexually-oriented
businesses operating in the state engage in physical contact or touching with
customers including, but not limited to, acts of prostitution, or encourage or
entice the customers to engage in lewdness;
      (27)   The activities occurring at sexually-oriented businesses and adult
entertainment establishments occur at establishments and businesses which
operate primarily for the purpose of making a profit and, as such, are subject
to regulation by the town in the interest of the good order, health, safety,
economy, property values, morals and general welfare of the people, businesses
and industries of the town. A major industry which is important to the
community’s economic welfare is tourism by persons seeking to bring children to
visit the town who wish to stay in a community with a family atmosphere not
dominated by commercialized sexual themes;
      (28)   When the activities occurring at sexually-oriented businesses and
adult entertainment establishments are present in establishments and
businesses, other activities which are illegal, unsafe or unhealthful tend to
accompany them, concentrate around them and be aggravated by them. Other
activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, pandering,
solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, exposing minors to
harmful materials and an unhealthy and unsanitary environment, possession,
distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of
controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and property;
      (29)   When the activities occurring at sexually-oriented businesses and
adult entertainment establishments are competitively exploited in
establishments and businesses, they tend to attract an undesirable number of
transients, blight neighborhoods, discourage wholesome tourism, adversely
affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote the
particular crimes described above and, ultimately, lead residents and
businesses to move to other locations;
      (30)   Sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments often have exterior signs or exterior appearance that are
incongruous with other business signage, lower the surrounding property values
and contribute to urban decline;
      (31)   The activities occurring at sexually-oriented businesses and adult
entertainment establishments sometimes occur in establishments and businesses
concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages which
concurrence leads to a further increase in criminal activity, unsafe activity
and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community and
creates additional hazards to the health and safety of customers and workers
and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the
economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the
quality of life, commerce and community environment;
      (32)   Physical contact or touching within sexually-oriented businesses
and adult entertainment establishments between workers exhibiting specified
anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and
promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases;
      (33)   In order to preserve and safeguard the good order, health, morals,
safety and general welfare of the people of the town it is necessary and
advisable for the town to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators,
agents, workers, entertainers, performers and customers at sexually-oriented
businesses and adult entertainment establishments;
      (34)   The potential dangers to the good order, morals, health, safety
and general welfare of the people of the town posed by permitting a sexually-
oriented business or adult entertainment establishment to operate without first
meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this chapter are so
great as to require the licensure of the establishments prior to their being
permitted to operate;
      (35)   Requiring operators of sexually-oriented businesses and adult
entertainment establishments to keep records of information concerning workers
and certain recent past workers as well as customer contracts and other matters
and materials will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal
behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects
and by making it difficult for minors to work at or be customers in the
establishments;
      (36)   Prohibiting sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments from operating within set distances of educational institutions,
religious institutions, residences, areas zoned or designated for residential
use, and parks at which minors are customarily found, will serve to protect
minors from the adverse affects of the activities that accompany the
establishments and businesses;
      (37)   Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances and enclosed
adult booths in sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between
individuals and poses a threat to the health of the participants and promotes
the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases. Straddle dancing is
primarily conduct rather than communication or expression;
      (38)   Workers at sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments engage in a higher incidence of certain types of unhealthy or
criminal behavior than workers of other establishments and businesses
including, but not limited to, a very high incidence of illegal prostitution or
engaging in lewdness in violation of F.S. Ch. 796, operation without business
tax receipts and illegal and unlicensed massage;
      (39)   Physical contact or touching between workers of sexually-oriented
businesses and adult entertainment establishments and customers poses a threat
to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and sexually
transmittable diseases;
      (40)   The practice of not paying or underpaying workers at sexually-
oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and requiring them
to earn their entire income from tips or gratuities from their customers who
are predisposed to want sexual activity has resulted in a high incidence of
prostitution and crimes related to lewdness by workers;
      (41)   Sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments involve some activities that are pure conduct engaged in for the
purpose of making a profit, rather than speech or expressive activity and,
therefore, are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the
health, good order, morals, welfare and safety of the community;
      (42)   Requiring sexually-oriented businesses to post a listing of
services provided and restrict services to those listed as well as maintaining
a customer contract and transaction record in a daily register will discourage
incidents of criminal behavior such as lewdness and prostitution thereby
further safeguarding the health of both workers and customers and will assist
facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects if criminal
acts do occur; and
      (43)   The general welfare, health, good order, morals and safety of the
citizens of the town will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.
   (C)   Intent. It is the intent of this chapter to protect and preserve the
good order, health, peace, morals, safety and welfare of the citizens of the
town. This chapter regulates conduct and is not an ordinance that affects the
use of land as contemplated by F.S. § 166.041.
   (D)   Authority. This chapter is enacted under the constitutionally derived
home rule power of the town in the interest of the good order, health, morals,
peace, safety and general welfare of the people of the town.
   (E)   Recitals. It is the Town Council’s further intention to accomplish
those intents and purposes expressed by the Town Council in the recitals of the
ordinance from which this section derives, each of which are incorporated in by
reference into this section.
   (F)   Speech protection. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit
constitutionally protected expression or speech. This chapter is intended to
reasonably regulate the adult entertainment industry and sexually-oriented
businesses which engage in commercial activities involving acts or services of
a sexually explicit nature or which involve acts or services involving matters
which are sexual in nature.

to reduce or eliminate the adverse secondary effects of commercial
establishments and businesses. The regulation of alcoholic beverage
establishments is also addressed in the town code and other provisions of law.
   (B)   Unless otherwise indicated, all provisions of this chapter shall apply
equally to all persons, regardless of sex. Masculine pronouns, such as “he,”
“his,” and “him,” as employed in this chapter, shall also be construed to apply
to feminine pronouns and neutral pronouns, unless the context suggests
otherwise. Words used in the singular number shall include the plural number,
unless the context suggests otherwise.
(Ord. 2007-11, passed 6-26-2007)
§ 113.003 OBSCENITY, INDECENT EXPOSURE UNLAWFUL.
   As a matter of state and federal law, obscenity is unlawful in the town.
Likewise, state law prohibits indecent exposure. Nothing in this chapter shall
be construed to allow or permit the possession, distribution and transportation
of obscene materials; to authorize the exposing of persons under 18 years of
age to motion pictures, exhibitions, shows, representations and presentations
of specified sexual activities or persons displaying or exhibiting specified
anatomical areas; or the indecent exposure of a person as prohibited by state

§ 113.038 SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION PROCEEDINGS.
   (A)   Challenge to suspension or revocation. If the Mayor or his or her
designee notifies a licensee in writing of the pending suspension or revocation
of a license as provided in §
113.029 of this chapter, then the suspension or revocation shall become final
and effective 15 days after mailing to the licensee’s record address, posting
at the licensed establishment, or actual delivery of the notice to the
licensee, unless within 15 days of the date of the notice of suspension or
revocation the licensee first files with the Mayor or his or her designee a
written response stating the reasons why the suspension or revocation is
alleged to be in error or inappropriate and a written notice of intent to
challenge the suspension or revocation requesting a hearing to determine
whether the suspension or revocation will become effective. The suspension or
revocation shall be abated in the event that a licensee files a timely
challenge to the suspension or revocation in accordance with the procedures of
this chapter or upon an order of a court of competent jurisdiction. A
suspension or revocation already in effect, but not previously challenged in a
suspension or revocation hearing, may be challenged in the same manner but is
not abated during the proceedings.
   (B)   Hearing on suspension or revocation. When a licensee files a written
response and notice of intent to challenge a pending or existing suspension or
revocation then a public hearing to determine if the pending suspension or
revocation will become effective and final shall be held by a hearing officer
appointed by the Town Council. The Mayor or his or her designee shall notify
the Town Attorney and any appropriate town officers who shall schedule and
provide notice of the hearing date and time.
      (1)   Appointment, term and compensation of hearing officer.
         (a)   Three hearing officers shall be appointed by the Town Council,
and they shall be attorneys duly licensed to practice law in the state, who

cause, by the Town Council. Hearing officers shall not be considered to be town
employees, although they may receive compensation for their services and also
may be reimbursed for travel, mileage and per diem expenses as may be
authorized.
         (c)   Because only attorneys may hold the position of hearing officer,
the Town Council shall not be required to retain an attorney to represent the
hearing officer.
         (d)   It shall be unlawful for a hearing officer to act as an agent or
an attorney for a party involved in a determination under the provisions of
this section or to be otherwise involved with any matter arising under this
section which will come before the town during the term of the hearing
officer’s appointment. Further, a hearing officer shall not initiate or
consider ex parte communications or other communications with any party of
interest to a hearing officer concerning the substance of any proceeding to be
heard by a hearing officer. However, the foregoing does not prohibit
discussions between the hearing officer and town staff that pertain solely to
scheduling and other administrative matters unrelated to the merits of the
application. If a person engages in an ex parte communication with the hearing
officer, the hearing officer shall place on the record of the pending case all
ex parte written communications received, all written responses to the
communications, a memorandum stating the substance of all oral communications
received, and all oral responses made, and shall advise all parties that the
matters have been placed on the record. Any party desiring to rebut the ex
parte communication shall be entitled to do so but only if the party requests
the opportunity for rebuttal within ten days after notice of the communication.
If he or she deems it necessary due to the effect of an ex parte communication
received by him or her, the hearing officer may withdraw from the case and the
Town Council shall appoint another hearing officer to handle the case.
         (e)   Selection of hearing officer. The Mayor and licensee shall each
have the right to eliminate one of the three hearing officers selected by the
Town Council. The one hearing officer not eliminated by either party shall act
as the hearing officer for the license revocation hearing. In the event
licensee objects to all three hearing officers, then the Town Council shall
choose the hearing officer from the list of three hearing officers absent a
showing of clear prejudice by the licensee.
      (2)   Powers of hearing officer. The hearing officer shall have the power
to:
         (a)   Adopt rules for the conduct of the hearing;
         (b)   Subpoena licensees and witnesses to its hearings. Subpoenas may
be served by any law enforcement agencies or private process servers with

         (d)   Administer oaths and take testimony under oath; and
         (e)   Issue an order having the force of law suspending or revoking
the license.

hearing shall be held within 30 days of the Mayor’s receipt of a written
challenge and request for a hearing by the aggrieved licensee.

the licensee, any witnesses of the licensee, the Mayor or his or her designee
and any witnesses of the Mayor or his or her designee. All witnesses shall
provide their legal name, mailing addresses and telephone number.

in a civil case with the Mayor or his or her designee having the burden of
proof by clear and convincing evidence.
      (6)   Testimony submitted. Testimony and evidence may be submitted by any
witness but shall be limited to matters directly relating to the grounds for
suspension or revocation. Irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious
testimony or evidence shall be excluded.

hearing officer shall decide all questions of evidence, procedure and standing.

hearings. Unless otherwise mutually agreed to between the licensee and the
Mayor or his or her designee, the order of presentation of testimony and
evidence shall be as follows:

or his or her designee;

         (d)   Rebuttal witnesses from the licensee;
         (e)   Summation by the Mayor or his or her designee; and
         (f)   Summation by the licensee.
      (8)   Hearing officer. The hearing officer may also call and question
witnesses or request additional evidence as the hearing officer deems necessary
and appropriate.
      (9)   Room and staff provided. The town shall provide a hearing room and
clerical staff as may be reasonably required by the hearing officer to conduct
hearings and perform his or her duties.
      (10)   Witnesses and evidence. Each party to the hearing shall have the
right to call and examine witnesses, introduce exhibits, cross-examine opposing
witnesses, impeach witnesses and rebut evidence.

expense, to be represented by an attorney at any hearing.
      (12)   Record. All testimony before the hearing officer shall be under
oath and shall be recorded. The licensee or the town may cause a verbatim
record of the proceedings to be made.
      (13)   Hearing continued. If the hearing officer comes to believe that
any facts, claims or allegations necessitate additional review or response by
either the licensee or the Mayor or his or her designee, then the hearing
officer may order the hearing continued until an announced date certain, not to
exceed 30 days from the date of continuance. The hearing officer shall render a
final decision on the appeal within 60 days of the Mayor’s receipt of
licensee’s written notice of challenge.
      (14)   Submittal of written proposed findings. Hearing officers may allow
the parties to submit written proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law
following the hearing and shall advise the parties of the timetable for so
doing, if allowed.
      (15)   Order issued. At the conclusion of the hearing within the time
prescribed herein, the hearing officer shall issue an order setting forth

with powers granted in this section.
   (C)   Filing of decision. The original of the written decision of the
hearing officer shall be filed with the Town Clerk and copies shall be
delivered or mailed to the licensee, the Mayor or his or her designee and the
Brevard County Sheriff’s Department.
   (D)   Judicial review. Any person who participated in a suspension or
revocation hearing before the hearing officer and who is aggrieved by the
decision of the hearing officer may immediately challenge the decision in any
court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the rules of procedure of that
court. The record of the hearing shall consist of the complete record of the
proceedings before the hearing officer. The hearing officer’s decision shall be
promptly reviewed by the court.
   (E)   Requirement of exhaustion procedures. Judicial review of a suspension
or revocation, or related hearing or appeal proceedings, shall be available
only after the administrative procedures and remedies set forth in this section
have been exhausted.
   (F)   Notice of final suspension or revocation. If no response or request
for a suspension or revocation hearing is filed within 15 days of the notice of
a pending suspension or revocation, or if the licensee who requested the
hearing does not appear at the suspension or revocation hearing after notice,
or if the hearing officer decides after a hearing that a pending suspension or
revocation will become final, then the Mayor or his or her designee shall issue
to the licensee notice of final suspension or revocation of the adult
entertainment license and mail or arrange delivery of the notice to the
licensee’s record address.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 131.01 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the Town of Palm Shores Public Nudity
Chapter.
(Ord. 2007-10, passed 6-26-2007)
§ 131.02 INTENT.
   (A)   It is the intent of this chapter to protect and preserve the good
order, health, safety, welfare and morals of the citizens of the town by
prohibiting a person from intentionally or recklessly appearing or being nude,
or causing another person to appear or be nude, in a public place and in other
places which may reasonably be expected to be observed by the public within the
town in other places than those establishments defined in §
131.03.
   (B)   It is the further intention of this chapter to accomplish the intents
and purposes expressed in the following recitals:
      (1)   Local governments may prohibit the exposure of certain body parts,
see Geaneas v. Willets, 911 F. 2d 579 (11th Cir. 1990), certiorari denied, 499
U.S. 955, 111 S. Ct. 1431, 113 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1991) and see Barnes v. Glen
Theater, 501 U.S. 560 (1991);
      (2)   Efforts by the state and federal governments to apply state
criminal statutes have been rejected by the courts because, under certain of
Florida’s criminal laws, nudity alone cannot be prosecuted without proof of
lewd and lascivious conduct;
      (3)   Local governments for other counties have successfully passed and
defended regulations relating to public nudity;
      (4)   The citizens of the town wish to regulate nudity and sexual
conduct, and the citizens of the town believe that nudity and sexual conduct
begets undesirable behavior, and that adverse secondary effects such as, but
not limited to, prostitution, attempted rape, rape and assault may occur and
have the potential for occurring where nude and sexual conduct is permitted;
      (5)   The citizens of the town wish to protect against similar conditions
to the end that they not occur in the town;
      (6)   The citizens of the town desire to prohibit the public display of
nudity and sexual behavior or the simulation thereof;
      (7)   The citizens of the town believe that there are increasing
incidents of nudity in public places and in other places readily visible to the
public;
      (8)   The citizens of Palm Shores believe that persons who choose to
appear nude in public places are engaging in conduct which often serves to
impose their nudity on others who did not seek it out, who are not able to
reasonably avoid observing it, and who may be offended or distressed thereby;
      (9)   Appearing nude in public places was a criminal offense at common
law and was considered an act malum en se (a wrong in itself) and appearing
nude in a public place which is not a public place provided or set apart for
nudity has been considered improper; see Moffett v. State, 340 So. 2d 1155,
1156 n.3 (Fla. 1977);
      (10)   The citizens of the town desire to protect and preserve the
wholesome character of the town as a family oriented community with a high
quality of life offered for families, tourists and businesses;
      (11)   The citizens of the town believe that appearing nude in public
places is still contrary to the general societal disapproval that the people of
the town have of persons appearing nude among strangers in public places;
      (12)   The citizens of the town believe that the appearance of persons in
the nude in public places generally increases adverse secondary effects such
as, but not limited to, incidents of prostitution, unhealthy environment for
minors, other citizens and tourists, sexual assaults and batteries, attracts
other criminal activity to the community and encourages degradation of women
and other activities which break down societal and family structures;
      (13)   The citizens of the town believe that without regulation public
nudity constitutes harmful conduct and occurs in a manner which is incompatible
with the normal primary activity of a particular place at a particular time;
      (14)   The citizens of the town sole intent in enacting this chapter is
to prohibit the conduct of being nude in public places and to suppress the
adverse secondary effects nudity generates;
      (15)   It is the intent of the citizens of the town to protect and
preserve the good order, public health, safety, welfare and morals of the town
by restricting, to the fullest extent allowed by the United States Constitution
and State Constitution, the act of being nude to places which are readily
visible to the public;
      (16)   The Town Council’s sole intent in enacting this chapter is to
prohibit the conduct of being nude in public places and to suppress the adverse
secondary effects nudity generates, the Town Council nevertheless recognizes
that there may be instances wherein appearing nude in a public place may be
expressive conduct incidental to and a necessary part of the freedom of
expression that is protected by United States or state constitutional
provisions;
      (17)   The citizens of the town believe that Palm Shores is a town that
is, and desires very much to continue to be, a community that contains and is
known for traditional and wholesome public recreational activities, natural
features and resources and historic facilities;
      (18)   The citizens of the town believe that the average person applying
contemporary community standards would find that the public nudity prohibited
by this chapter, if allowed, when taken as a whole:
         (a)   Appeals to the prurient interests; and
         (b)   Lacks serious literary, artistic, political and scientific
value.
      (19)   The citizens of the town believe that the absence of regulation of
persons appearing nude in public places within the town encourages persons and
entities to advertise outside of the town and the state by billboard, radio,
print and other media the availability of nudity in public places within the
town and thus encourages the influx into the town of persons seeking:
         (a)   To observe and/or participate in nudity; and
         (b)   To participate in the disorderly, unhealthy, harmful and illegal
conduct that is associated therewith, thereby increasing injuries and damages
to the citizens of the town who will be victims of an increased disorderly,
harmful and unlawful conduct and thereby working directly against the town’s
economic development and tourism development activities;
      (20)   The citizens of the town believe that commercial advertising and/
or exploitation of nudity encourages escalation of nude and lewd conduct within
the competing commercial establishments exploiting the conduct and thereby
increases the adverse effects upon public order and the public health;
      (21)   The citizens of the town believe that the prohibitions contained
herein are the most reasonable and minimal restrictions required so as to
regulate conduct which is adverse to public order, health, safety, morality and
decency within the town when the conduct takes place at locations where the
public is present or is likely to be present, or where the conduct would be
readily visible to the public;
      (22)   The citizens of the town believe that the passage of this chapter
is necessary to preserve the basic character of Palm Shores;
      (23)   States may regulate the conduct of appearing nude in public
places, see Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, 111 S. Ct. 2456 115 L.
Ed. 2d 504 (1991) and Café 207, Inc. vs. St. Johns City, 856 F. supp. 641 (M.D.
Fla. 1994), aff’d, 989 F. 2d 1136 (11th Cir. 1995);
      (24)   The citizens of the town are not hereby prohibiting nudity in
private places or prohibiting nudity which is protected by the United States
Constitution or State Constitution;
      (25)   The citizens of the town believe that the express exemptions
contained in this chapter provide adequate protection to persons who, without
express exemptions, might otherwise be prevented or discouraged by this chapter
from exercising constitutionally protected rights; and
      (26)   This chapter is intended to regulate conduct, not speech; and not
an ordinance that affects the use of land as contemplated by F.S. § 125.66.
(Ord. 2007-10, passed 6-26-2007)

§ 131.04 FINDINGS.
   In addition and supplemental to the findings and determinations contained in
the recitals (§
131.02(B)) of this chapter, it is the intent of the citizens of the town to
regulate the conduct of appearing nude in public places for the purpose of
regulating nudity and other conduct, that considering what has happened in
other communities, the acts prohibited in §
131.15 herein below encourage or create the potential for the conduct of
adverse secondary effects such as, but not limited to, prostitution, attempted
rape, rape, assault and the spread of sexually communicable diseases; that
actual and simulated nudity and sexual conduct in public places, begets and has
the potential for begetting undesirable and unlawful behavior; that sexual,
lewd, lascivious and salacious conduct results in violation of law and creates
dangers to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the public and those who
engage in conduct; and, it is the intent of §
131.15 of this chapter to specifically prohibit nudity, gross sexuality and the
simulation thereof.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 132.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   It is the further intention of this chapter to accomplish those intents and
purposes expressed in the following recitals:
   (A)   The Board of County Commissioners, collectively and in conjunction
with other elected and appointed officials within Brevard County, notes that
there have been numerous occurrences within the state and the United States
where convicted sexual offenders and predators are released from custody and
thereafter commit similar crimes;
   (B)   It appears that the recidivism rate for released sexual offenders and
sexual predators is alarmingly high, especially for those who commit crimes
upon children;
   (C)   The Legislature has found and determined that sexual offenders and
sexual predators present an extreme threat to the public safety; are extremely
likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses; commit many
offenses and have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted
for only a fraction of their crimes;
   (D)   The Legislature has found and determined that protection of the public
from sexual offenders, particularly those who have committed offenses against
children, is a paramount governmental interest;
   (E)   Florida law prohibits certain sexual offenders from residing within
1,000 feet of any school, day care center, park or playground;
   (G)   The Florida Legislature passed House Bill 1877, commonly known as the
“Jessica Lunsford Act,” which was approved by Governor Jeb Bush on May 2, 2005,
and codified as Laws of Fla., Chapter 2005-28;
   (H)   The “Jessica Lunsford Act” will likely increase the number of
offenders who will be designated as sexual offenders or sexual predators and
will require electronic monitoring of certain offenders and predators and will
otherwise strengthen the state’s efforts to control the cancer of child sexual
victimization;
   (I)   The town is a family-oriented community that highly values its
children and is a place that families with young children find highly
desirable;
   (J)   Schools, day care centers, parks and playgrounds are places within the
town that children are frequently and regularly located and involved in
activities;
   (K)   The town has a substantial and compelling interest in maintaining the
quality of life and protecting the health, safety and welfare of citizens at
schools, day care centers, parks and playgrounds to engage m positive
educational, economic and social activities, and has a substantial and
compelling interest in allowing the citizens to gainfully and productively use
and enjoy the facilities in these areas and communities without victimization
at the hands of a sexual offender or sexual predator;
   (L)   Individuals have a significant interest in being able to travel and
associate freely in all areas of the town, except during times of a public
safety emergency, such as natural or man-made disasters;
   (M)   It is in the public interest to exclude certain sexual offenders and
sexual predators from the areas surrounding schools, day care centers, parks
and playgrounds;
   (N)   Persons utilizing public shelters during times of disaster must be
protected from sexual offenders and sexual predators;
   (O)   Certain exceptions must be made to the blanket prohibition against
sexual offenders and sexual predators traveling to, through and in the area of
schools, day care centers, parks and playgrounds;
   (P)   The town desires to ensure that the citizens of the county are
protected from criminal activity to the maximum extent afforded by controlling
law in order to advance the public health, safety and welfare, and benefit the
citizens of the town to the maximum extent possible;
   (Q)   The county is not prohibited from acting on the subject matter of this
chapter and the provisions of this chapter are not preempted by and are
consistent with state law; and
   (R)   This chapter is enacted under the general home rule and law
enforcement powers of the town and is not a zoning ordinance or a land
development regulation.

§ 151.003 INTENT.
   The purposes of this chapter and the flood load and flood resistant
construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum
requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to
minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of
development in flood hazard areas to:
   (A)   Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service
during times of flooding;
   (B)   Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to
prevent or minimize future flood damage;
   (C)   Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation,
drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development
which may increase flood damage or erosion potential;
   (D)   Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and
shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial
functions of the floodplain;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood hazard areas;
   (G)   Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood
control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and
   (H)   Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for
community participation as set forth in 44 C.F.R. § 59.22.

§ 151.005 WARNING.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter and the Florida
Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land
outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within
such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood
hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the Flood Insurance Study
and shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and the requirements of 44 C.F.R. §§ 59
and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring
this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation
in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing
use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this chapter.

§ 152.01 DESIGNATED; PURPOSE.
   (A)   The Planning and Zoning Board is designated the local planning agency.
   (B)   The purpose of this local planning agency will be to prepare or
supervise the preparation of a legally binding comprehensive plan for meeting
present and future development needs in the areas of:
      (1)   Land use;
      (2)   Traffic circulation;
      (3)   Water and sewage;
      (4)   Natural resource conservation;
      (5)   Recreation and open space;
      (6)   Housing;
      (7)   Coastal zone protection (if appropriate);
      (8)   Intergovernmental cooperation; and
      (9)   Utilities.
(2000 Code, § 50-31) (Ord. 81-1, passed 2-24-1981)
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
§ 152.15 ADOPTED.
   The comprehensive plan for the town entitled Comprehensive Plan of the Town
of Palm Shores is adopted by reference for the area of jurisdiction of the town
pursuant to the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development
Regulations Act of 1985, F.S. §§ 163.3161 et seq.
(2000 Code, § 50-61) (Ord. 88-05, passed 8-30-1988)
§ 152.16 MAINTENANCE OF COPY.
   A copy of the comprehensive plan, and any subsequent amendments to the plan,
shall be maintained for public inspection in the office of the Mayor at Town
Hall.
(2000 Code, § 50-62) (Ord. 88-05, passed 8-30-1988)
§ 152.17 GOVERNS DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   All development undertaken by any person or entity shall be consistent
with the comprehensive plan and all other applicable land development
ordinances and regulations of the town.
   (B)   All land development ordinances and regulations adopted by the town
shall also be consistent with the comprehensive plan.
(2000 Code, § 50-63) (Ord. 88-05, passed 8-30-1988)
CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
§ 152.30 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the intent of the town to provide land development regulations which
are consistent with and which contain specific and detailed provisions to
implement the comprehensive plan of the town. Further, it is the intent of the
town to provide specific procedures to ensure that development permits issued
by the town are conditioned on the availability of public facilities and
services, thereby meeting the concurrency requirements of the comprehensive
plan.
(Ord. 2001-09, passed 1-22-2002)
§ 152.31 CONSISTENCY WITH COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.
   All applications for development shall demonstrate compliance with the
comprehensive plan of the town and this chapter. If the application for
development is found to meet all requirements of this chapter, it shall be
presumed to be consistent with the comprehensive plan of the town. A
determination, however, will not eliminate the further requirements of a
finding of concurrency. All applications for development must therefore further
demonstrate that specified public facilities and services shall be available at
prescribed levels of service concurrent with the impact of the development on
those facilities.
(Ord. 2001-09, passed 1-22-2002)
§ 152.32 CONCURRENCY DETERMINATIONS.
   (A)   Concurrency management system established. There is hereby created a
concurrency management system which is based upon the comprehensive plan of the
town, including, but not limited to, the capital improvements element thereof
and the adopted level of service standards. The system is designed to ensure
that the issuance of a development permit will not result in a degradation of
the adopted levels of service for specified public facilities and services. The
public facilities and services for which levels of service have been
established are potable water, wastewater, drainage, solid waste, recreation
and traffic circulation.
   (B)   Adopted levels of service not to be degraded.
      (1)   All applications for development permits shall demonstrate that the
proposed development does not degrade adopted levels of service in the town.
      (2)   Concurrency shall be determined prior to or simultaneous with the
issuance of a building permit. For purposes of this subchapter, the issuance of
a building permit or approval of development on platted or unplatted land
consistent with applicable zoning regulations shall be deemed not to materially
alter the use or density or intensity of use on that piece of property.
   (C)   Determination of available capacity; required submittals. For purposes
of determining concurrency, any person seeking a building permit shall provide
the town planner evidence that sufficient public facilities and services
meeting or exceeding the standards and levels of service established in the
city’s comprehensive plan either are available when needed for the development
contemplated by the development permit, or will, as a condition of the permit,
be available to serve the proposed development. This determination shall be
made in accordance with the standards set forth in Rule 9J-5, Florida
Administrative Code. The approval of a site plan or a subdivision plat in
accordance with the procedures and provisions of this chapter shall be deemed
to be preliminary or initial approval only. No site plan or subdivision plat
shall be deemed to have received final approval of the town, and no building
permit shall be issued, until the following documents have been submitted to
the town with respect to the site plan, subdivision plat or building permit
application. The following documentation in support of concurrency shall be
provided to the town by the applicant:
      (1)   A certificate from the St. Johns River Water Management District,
the county or the State Department of Transportation, whichever agency is the
appropriate permitting authority, indicating that the stormwater system into
which the proposed project will discharge stormwater runoff has sufficient
capacity to accommodate the proposed development;
      (2)   A certificate from the county indicating sufficient sewer capacity
for the proposed development;
      (3)   A certificate from the county indicating sufficient solid waste
capacity for the proposed development in the county landfill;
      (4)   A certificate from the town indicating sufficient potable water
capacity for the proposed development in the town water system;
      (5)   For those projects proposing access to a road or highway under the
jurisdiction of the county or the State Department of Transportation, a
driveway, curb cut or other access permit from the appropriate agency. The
permit shall indicate the existing level of service from the access road
serving the project, the latest average daily traffic count on the road, the
average daily trip generation projections for the project, and the resulting
level of service on the access road after taking into account the trip
generation data; and
      (6)   A certificate from the town indicating that sufficient recreational
facilities exist in the town and in the vicinity of the proposed development to
serve the occupants of the proposed development.
   (D)   Expiration of approval of site plan or subdivision plat.
Notwithstanding the requirements set out in division (C) of this section for
submission of documentation and final approval by the town, the time limits
applicable to expiration of approvals for site plans and subdivision plats set
forth in this chapter shall be measured from the date of initial approval by
the town, and not from the date of final approval as referred to in this
section.
   (E)   Exempted construction. Nothing in this section shall apply to building
permits for construction which has no impact on public facilities or services,
including, but not limited to, permits for fences, accessory buildings,
enlargement of single-family residences, repairs to structures, driveways,
signs and similar matters

§ 153.002 PURPOSES.
   (A)   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the sign regulations
of the town. The purpose of this chapter is to establish requirements for the
design, construction, placement, installation, number, type, location and
maintenance of signs in order to preserve and protect the health, safety,
welfare and general well-being of the citizens of the town without impeding the
inherent right of business to advertise and reasonably assist potential
customers in locating and identifying any service or facility they may desire
to use or any product they may desire to purchase.
   (B)   The regulation of the design, construction, placement, installation
and maintenance of signs is further justified by their innate scheme and
primary purpose to draw mental attention to them, potentially to the detriment
of sound driving practices and the safety of the motoring public to which a
majority of signs are oriented. Therefore, it is the future purpose of this
chapter to regulate the size and location of signs so that their purpose can be
served without unduly interfering with motorists and causing unsafe conditions.
   (C)   Finally, it is also the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the aesthetic qualities of the community by regulating the design,
construction, placement, installation and maintenance of signs and by
eliminating unsightly signs and preventing clutter among sign placement. The
aesthetic impact of signs is an economic fact which may bear heavily upon the
enjoyment and value of property; therefore, the Town Council finds that the
regulation of signs is validly justified on the basis of conserving the value
of property and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the
town.

§ 153.003 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (A)   All signs or other advertising structures erected in the town after
the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives shall
conform to this chapter.
   (B)   Signs or advertising structures which are made nonconforming by this
chapter shall be regulated as follows:
      (1)   Any temporary sign shall be removed or made to conform to this
chapter within 180 days from the effective date of the ordinance from which
this chapter is derived;
      (2)   No conforming sign or advertising structure shall be permitted to
be erected on the same place of business with an existing nonconforming sign
until the nonconforming sign has been removed or made conforming;
      (3)   A nonconforming permanent sign shall not be modified in a way which
would increase the nonconformity of the sign. A nonconforming sign shall not be
replaced by another nonconforming sign except for the change of copy or
substitution of changeable panels;
      (4)   Reasonable repair and maintenance of nonconforming signs, including
change of advertising message, is permitted and is not a change, which would
terminate the nonconforming status. REASONABLE REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE means the
work necessary to keep the sign structure in a state of good repair, including
the replacement, in-kind, of materials in the sign structure. Where the
replacement of materials is involved, the replacement may not exceed 50% of the
structural materials in the sign within any 24-month period. The replacement
value and repair and maintenance cost shall be determined by the submission of
two written estimates from contractors, engineers or architects;
      (5)   A nonconforming sign may not be disassembled and re-erected at the
same location;
      (6)   A nonconforming sign may not be relocated;
      (7)   A nonconforming sign may continue to exist so long as it is not
destroyed, abandoned or discontinued as follows:
         (a)   DESTROYED means more than 50% of the upright supports of a sign
structure are physically damaged so that the normal repair practices of the
industry would call for replacement of the damaged support(s).
         (b)   A sign will not be considered destroyed within the meaning of
this section under the following conditions:
            1.   The destruction of a sign caused by vandalism or other
criminal or tortuous act; and
            2.   The sign owner must demonstrate that the replacement materials
cost would not exceed 50% of the value of the structural materials in the sign,
immediately prior to destruction. The following shall be applicable in
determining whether the replacement materials cost to re-erect the sign would
not exceed 50% of the value of the structural materials in the sign:
               a.   Structural materials are all those materials incorporated
into the sign as load-bearing parts, including vertical supports, horizontal
stringers, braces, bracing wires, brackets and catwalks. Structural materials
do not include the sign face and skirt, any electrical service or electrical
lighting, except in cases where the items have been incorporated into the sign
as load-bearing parts;
               b.   The value of the structural materials in the sign
immediately prior to destruction shall be based on the cost of all structural
materials contained in the sign as it was configured just prior to damage and
the cost of materials shall be based on or about the date of destruction,
without regard to any labor costs or special market conditions; and
               c.   The materials to be included in the replacement materials
costs to re-erect the sign shall be all materials that would be used to return
the sign to its configuration immediately prior to destruction and shall
include any material obtained from a source other than the sign itself, that is
repaired on-site. The repairs to the sign shall be those reasonably necessary
to permanently repair the sign in accordance with the normal industry standard.
The cost of the materials shall be as described in division (B)(7)(b)2.b.
above.
      (8)   A nonconforming sign is abandoned or discontinued when the sign
face which remains devoid of a bona fide advertising or when there is no bona
fide advertising contract for 180 consecutive days or longer. Signs displaying
an “available for lease” or similar message, signs displaying advertising for a
product or service no longer available, and partially obliterated signs which
do not identify a particular product, service or facility shall be considered
void of advertising matter. A nonconforming sign which is abandoned or
discontinued shall lose its nonconforming status;
      (9)   Any repair and maintenance or re-erection of a nonconforming sign
pursuant to this section, without the required building or sign permit shall

§ 153.005 PERMITS.
   (A)   Generally. Any person proposing to paint, erect, construct, enlarge,
move or make structural alterations to any sign within the town shall first
obtain a sign permit for each sign from the Building Official as required by
this chapter. These directives shall not be construed to require any permit for
a change of copy on a sign nor for the repainting, cleaning and other normal
maintenance or repair of a sign or structure for which a permit has previously
been issued, so long as the sign or sign structure is not modified in any way.
No new permit shall be required for signs which have permits and which conform
with the requirements of this chapter on the effective date of the ordinance
from which this chapter derives. A new permit shall be required for any sign
when the structural configuration or electrical components are altered or when
the sign is relocated. The Building Official shall issue sign permits in
accordance with the following procedures:
      (1)   A separate application and a separate permit shall be required for
each separate sign;
      (2)   Each application for a sign permit shall be accompanied by two
copies of a scaled drawing showing the proposed sign, including all dimensions
of the proposed sign and total sign surface area. In addition, the following
shall be provided:
         (a)   For detached signs, the elevation of the principal building or
structure and the location of the sign in relation to the property lines shall
be indicated; and
         (b)   For wall signs, the applicant shall submit the elevation of the
principal building or structure upon which the sign is to be placed with the
proposed sign and lettering of the sign superimposed thereon in correct ratio
to the scale of the drawing and with a notation thereon showing the type and
size of lettering to be used and the colors of the proposed sign.
      (3)   All plans for detached signs and projecting signs shall be prepared
and signed by a professional engineer registered and licensed in the state. All
signs shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements set for in the
Building Code;
      (4)   A drawing shall be submitted showing the location of the proposed
sign and all trees having a diameter of four inches or more at a height of four
and one-half feet above ground level in the general area of the proposed sign
location. For proposals associated with an approved site plan, the sign shall
not interfere with trees required to be planted as shown on the approved site
plan. For existing sites for which a sign application has been submitted, the
sign shall be located so that it does not interfere with existing trees on the
site. If, upon review by the Building Official, it is determined that no
alternative location can be achieved, the applicant may apply for a tree
removal permit provided, however, that trees cannot be removed in violation of
an approved site plan;
      (5)   The name and address of the owner or other person in control or
possession of the real property upon which the sign is to be located shall be
submitted. Written consent of the owner, his or her lessee or his or her agent
granting permission for the construction, operation, maintenance or display of
the sign shall be submitted;
      (6)   The name of the sign contractor shall be submitted;
      (7)   A separate electrical permit shall be required for any sign
containing electrical components to be connected to an electrical energy
source; and
      (8)   A survey prepared by a land surveyor registered and licensed in the
state shall be submitted when any determinations relative to an applicant
cannot be made without the use of the survey.
   (B)   Issuance. When an application for a sign permit complies with this
chapter and all other applicable town ordinances and regulations and when all
required fees have been remitted, the Building Official shall issue the
requested permit.
   (C)   Revocation. The Building Official is authorized and empowered to
revoke any permit issued by him or her for failure of the permittee to comply
with any of the sections of this chapter or for failure of the applicant to
construct, erect or maintain the permitted sign in strict conformance with the
plans and drawings submitted with the application. The Building Official may
also revoke a permit or approval, issued under this chapter, if there has been
any false statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the
application or plans on which the permit or approval was based. Any revocation
shall be in writing and shall show cause for the revocation notice.
   (D)   Electrical permit fee. For any sign containing electrical components
to be connected to an electrical energy source, the electrical permit fee shall
be provided for in this code.
   (E)   Unless otherwise exempted herein, any person proposing to paint,
erect, construct, or install any sign within the town shall first obtain a sign
permit for each sign from the Building Official as required by this chapter.
The permit fee for such signs shall be based on the number of signs, the
duration and the style of sign and shall be established by resolution of the
Town Council.

   (A)   Generally. If any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph,
sentence, phrase, clause, term or word of this chapter is declared
unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent
jurisdiction, the declaration of the unconstitutionally shall not affect any
other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase,
clause, term or word of this chapter.
   (B)   Severability where less speech results. Without diminishing or
limiting in any way the declaration of severability set forth above in division

part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause,
term or word of this chapter is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment
or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of
unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection,
paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term or word of this
chapter, even if severability would result in a situation where there would be
less speech, whether by subjecting previously exempt signs to permitting or
otherwise.
   (C)   Severability of provisions pertaining to prohibited signs. Without
diminishing or limiting in any way the declaration of severability set forth
above in division (A), or elsewhere in this chapter, this code, or any adopting

VARIANCES/WAIVER
§ 153.045 APPLICATIONS.
   A variance from the terms of this chapter as to height, area, location,
duration or number of signs may be granted by the Town Council when not
contrary to public interest and where owing to conditions peculiar to the
property, lot of record or structure where the sign will be located and not the
result of the actions of the applicant, prior to filing of the variance
application, a literal enforcement of the ordinance would result in unnecessary
and undue hardship. Additionally, a waiver from the terms of this chapter as to
height, area, location, duration or number of signs may be granted by the Town
Council if it is determined by legal counsel for the town that the current
applicable regulation violates the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution. Such a waiver request shall be made directly to the Town Council
and upon receipt of such a request the matter shall be placed on the next
available Town Council agenda. In the event that the matter can not be placed
on the next available agenda for any reason, the Town Mayor in consultation
with the Town Attorney may grant the requested waiver or some variation of it.

TREE PROTECTION
§ 154.001 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide protective regulations for
trees and landscaping in the town.
   (B)   It is the intent of this chapter to promote the community appearance
and assist in the natural control of solar heat, soil conservation, flooding,
air pollution and noise. In addition, trees offer a haven for community
wildlife and provide citizens with psychological relief from the increasing
complexities of a man-made urban environment. Further, it is the intent of this
section to enhance the community and its citizenry and not be punitive or to
cause a hardship to any individual, private or public company who uses
reasonable care and diligence to protect trees and indigenous plant material
within the town.
   (C)   Trees, indigenous and nonindigenous plant material, as regulated and
protected in this chapter are declared to be a natural public resource; and the
town encourages planting, replacement and protection of trees and indigenous
plant material in the interest of the health, safety and welfare of present and
future citizens of the town. Also, certain trees, designated as specimen or
historic trees by the Town Council or its designee shall be protected because
of their ecological value, indigenous and nonindigenous character, size, age or
historic association. Trees and plant material so designated shall be protected
without regard to their location within the jurisdiction of the town. To attain
that end, it shall be unlawful to cut down, damage, poison or in any other
manner destroy or cause to be destroyed any tree or plant material as covered
by the terms of this section except in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.

streets shall conform to the general community plan and shall be considered in
their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to
public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the
proposed uses of the land to be served by those streets.
   (B)   Where there is not shown in the general community plan, the
arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either:
      (1)   Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing
principal streets in surrounding areas; or
      (2)   Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the
Planning and Zoning Board to meet a particular situation where topographical or
other conditions made continuance or conformances to existing streets
impracticable.
   (C)   Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic
will be discouraged.
   (D)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial
street, the Planning and Zoning Board may require marginal-access streets,
reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation
along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or any other
treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties
and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
   (E)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or
limited-access highway right-of-way, the Planning and Zoning Board may require
a street or alley approximately parallel to and on each side of the right-of-
way and a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as
for park purposes in residential districts or for commercial or industrial
purposes in appropriate districts for the distances also shall be determined
with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade
separations.
   (F)   Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited
except where their control is definitely placed in the town under conditions
approved by the Planning and Zoning Board.
   (G)   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be

   (M)   Half streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of this chapter and
Chapter 156 and where the Planning and Zoning Board finds it will be
practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is in existence and adjacent to
a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within
the tract. A cul-de-sac will be required if determined necessary by the
Planning and Zoning Board.

maintained in place to properly support the edges of the pavement. Upon
completion of the pavement, the earth shoulders, slopes and side ditches shall
be completed and shaped to match the edge of the pavement, curb or sidewalk.
   (C)   Where streets do not have curb and gutter, shoulders shall be
stabilized and compacted to prevent erosion and rutting for a minimum width of
six feet on each side of the pavement.

§ 155.071 UNSUITABLE MATERIAL.
   (A)   Where unsuitable material occurs within the limits of the roadway, the
contractor shall remove such material and refill with suitable excavated
material or authorized borrow. Where unsuitable material is removed, the
surface of the excavated area shall be compacted by rolling with a sheepsfoot
roller exerting a compression of at least 250 pounds per square inch on the
tamper feet, for the full width of the roadbed (subgrade and shoulders). Such
rolling shall be done before any refill is begun, and shall be continued until
the roller does not penetrate the surface more than one inch.
   (B)   When the plans contain the results of a soil survey, do not assume
such data is a guarantee of the depth, extent, or character of material
present.
   (C)   Where muck, rock, clay, or other material within the limits of the
roadway is unsuitable in its original position, excavate such material to the
cross-sections shown in the plans or indicated by the Engineer, and backfill
with suitable material. Shape backfill material to the required cross-sections.
   (D)   Where the removal of plastic soils below the finished earthwork grade
is required, meet a construction tolerance, from the lines shown in the plans
as the removal limits, of ± 0.2 feet [± 60 mm] in depth and ± 6 inches [± 150
mm] (each side) in width.

§ 155.072 REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   On completion of the grading operations, a stabilized roadbed shall be
constructed. The roadbed shall be stabilized to a firm and unyielding subgrade
having the required bearing value specified in the plans.
   (B)   When the stabilizing is designated as Type B, the specialty engineer
will determine compliance with the bearing value requirements by the Limerock
Bearing Ratio (LBR) method. If approved by the specialty engineer and only for
materials requiring an LBR value of 40, the specialty engineer may omit
Sections 6.0 and 6.1 of Florida Method of Test for Limerock Bearing Ratio (FM
5-515) and perform an Unsoaked LBR Test. The engineer or the contractor may
request to use this method. If the Unsoaked LBR Test results in a failing test,
then the specialty engineer will perform a standard Soaked LBR Test.
   (C)   The required bearing value shall be obtained either by constructing
the roadbed of selected materials from the roadway or by stabilizing the
roadbed material by the addition and mixing-in of suitable stabilizing
materials. Such work shall be constructed in accordance with these
specifications and in accordance with the lines, grades and thickness shown on
the plans.
   (D)   The subgrade to be stabilized may be processed in one course, unless
the equipment and methods being used do not provide the required uniformity,
particle size limitation, compaction and other desired results, in which case,
the processing shall be done in more than one course.
   (E)   When additive stabilizing materials are required, they shall be spread
uniformly over the area to be stabilized.
   (F)   When the use of materials from an existing base is required as all, or
a portion of the stabilizing additives, the engineer will direct the location,
placement, and distribution of such materials. Perform this work prior to the
spreading of any additional commercial or local materials. Do not remove any
section of existing base until the need for it in maintaining traffic is
fulfilled.
   (G)   The mixing shall be done with rotary tillers, or other equipment
meeting the approval of the engineer. The contractor may mix the materials in a
plant of an approved type suitable for this work. The area to be stabilized
shall be thoroughly mixed throughout the entire depth and width of the
stabilizing limits. The mixing operations will be required regardless of
whether or not the existing soil has the required bearing value without the
addition of stabilizing materials.
   (H)   Regardless of the character or bearing value, all materials remaining
after the mixing operations that will not pass a 3-1/2-inch ring shall be
removed or broken down to a size not larger than 3-1/2 inches.
   (I)   Bearing value samples will be obtained and tested at completion of
satisfactory mixing of the stabilized area. For any area where the bearing
value obtained is deficient from the value specified in the contract documents,
additional stabilizing material shall be spread and mixed.
   (J)   This reprocessing shall be done for full width of the roadway being
stabilized and longitudinally for a distance of 50 feet beyond the limits of
the area in which the bearing value is deficient.
   (K)   After mixing operations have been completed and the requirements of
bearing value, uniformity and particle size have been satisfied, the stabilized
area shall be compacted to the specified density. The materials shall be
compacted at a moisture content permitting the specified compaction. If the
moisture content of the material is improper for attaining the specified
density, either water shall be added or the material shall be permitted to dry
until the proper moisture content for the specified compaction is reached.
   (L)   Within the entire limits of the width and depth of the areas to be
stabilized, the minimum density acceptable at any location will be 98% of the
maximum density as determined by Florida Methods (FM) 1-T 180 Method “D”.
Attainment of the minimum density specified is not required within the upper
six inches of areas to be grassed under the contract. These areas shall be
compacted to a reasonable firm condition as directed by the engineer.
   (M)   Use the following undertolerances from the specified bearing value, as
based on tests performed on samples obtained after completing mixing
operations:
 
Specified Bearing Value Tolerance
LBR 40                  5.0
LBR 35                  4.0
LBR 30 (and under)      2.5
 
   (N)   The following unsoaked bearing value requirement is based on tests
performed on samples obtained after completing mixing operations:
 
Specified Bearing Value Unsoaked Bearing Value Required Tolerance
LBR 40                  LBR 42                          0.0
 
   (O)   The completed stabilized subgrade shall be shaped to conform to the
finished lines, grades, and cross-section indicated on the plans.
   (P)   After the stabilizing and compacting operations have been completed,
the subgrade shall be firm and substantially unyielding to the extent that it
will support construction equipment and will have the bearing value required by
the plans. All soft and yielding materials, and any other portions of the
subgrade, which will not compact readily, shall be removed and replaced with
suitable materials and the whole subgrade brought to line and grade, with
proper allowance for subsequent compaction.
   (Q)   After the subgrade has been completed as specified above, the
contractor shall maintain it free from ruts, depressions, and any damage
resulting from the hauling or handling of materials, equipment, tools, and the
like. It shall be the contractor’s responsibility to maintain the required
density until the subsequent base or pavement is in place. Such responsibility
shall include any reports, replacement, and the like, of curb and gutter,
sidewalk and the like, which might become necessary in order to re-compact the
subgrade in the event of underwash or other damage occurring to the previously
compacted subgrade. Any such work required for re-compaction shall be at the
contractor’s expense. Ditches and drains shall be constructed and maintained
along the completed subgrade section.

RESIDENTIAL STREETS; LIMEROCK OR CEMENTED COQUINA
§ 155.085 LIMEROCK BASE CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   The work consists of the construction of a base course composed of
limerock. It shall be constructed on the prepared subgrade, in accordance with
these specifications and in conformity with the lines, grades, and cross-
section shown on the plans.
   (B)   The spreading of the rock shall be done by methods approved by the
Engineer. All shaping shall be done utilizing a motor grader.
   (C)   The limerock shall be transported to the point where it is to be used,
over rock previously placed, if practicable, and dumped on the end of the
preceding spread. No hauling over the subgrade or dumping on the subgrade shall
be permitted. If at any time the subgrade material should become mixed with the
base course material, the contractor shall without additional compensation, dig
out and remove the mixture, reshape and compact the subgrade and replace the
materials removed with clean base material, which shall be shaped and compacted
as specified above. All segregated areas of fine or coarse rock shall be
removed and replaced with properly graded rock.
   (D)   When the specified compacted thickness of the base is greater than
eight inches, the base shall be constructed in two courses. If, through field
tests, the contractor can demonstrate that the compaction equipment can achieve
density for the full depth of a thicker lift, and if approved by the engineer,
the base may be constructed in successive courses of not more than eight inches
compacted thickness. The thickness of the first course shall be approximately
one-half the total thickness of the finished base, or enough additional to bear
the weight of the construction equipment without disturbing the subgrade. At no
time shall more than three days’ work of the first course be spread ahead of
the second course.
   (E)   For single-course base, after the spreading is completed the entire
surface shall be scarified and then shaped so as to produce the required grade
and cross-section after compaction.
   (F)   For double-course base, the first course shall be bladed if necessary
to secure a uniform surface, and brought to a surface cross-section
approximately parallel to that of the finished base. Prior to the spreading of
any material for the upper course, the density tests for the lower course shall
have determined that the required compaction has been obtained. After the
spreading of the material for the second course is completed the surface of
such course shall be scarified and shaped so as to produce the required grade
and cross-section after compaction. When the material does not have the proper
moisture content to ensure the required density, wetting or drying will be
required. When water is added it shall be uniformly mixed in by discing to the
full depth of the course which is being compacted. Wetting or drying operations
shall involve manipulation, as a unit, of the entire width and depth of the
course, which is being compacted.
   (G)   As soon as proper conditions of moisture are attained, the material
shall be compacted to an average density not less than 98% of the maximum
density obtainable under FM 1-T 180, Method “D”. For double course base,
average density shall be determined separately for each course. Limerock base
for shoulder pavement shall be compacted to a density not less than 95% of
maximum density by FM 1-T 180, Method “D”. During final compacting operations,
if blading of any areas is necessary to obtain the true grade and cross-
section, the compacting operations for such areas shall be complete prior to
making the density determinations on the finished base. At least three density
determinations shall be made on each day’s final compaction operations on each
course, and the density determinations shall be made at more frequent intervals
if deemed necessary by the engineer.
   (H)   If cracks or checks appear in the base, either before or after
priming, which in the opinion of the engineer, would impair the structural
efficiency of the base course, the contractor shall remove such cracks or
checks by rescarifying, reshaping, adding base materials where necessary and
recompacting.
   (I)   The finished surface of the base course shall be checked with a
template cut to the required crown and with a 15-foot straightedge laid
parallel to the center line of the road. All irregularities greater than a
quarter-inch shall be corrected by scarifying and removing or adding rock as
required, after which the entire area shall be re-compacted as specified herein
before. In testing the surface, the measurements will not be taken in small
holes caused by individual pieces of rock having been pulled out by the grader.
   (J)   If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the surface of the base has a
glazed or cemented surface sufficient to prevent proper penetration of the
prime coat, and after he/she determines that the condition of the base meets
all requirements, he/she will direct that the surface be hard-planed with a
blade grader and broomed immediately prior to the application of the prime
coat. This hard-planning shall be done in such a manner that only the glazed or
cemented surface is removed, leaving a granular or porous condition that will
allow free penetration of the prime material. The material planed from the base
shall be removed from the base area. The hardplanning operations, when
required, shall follow the surface-testing operations specified below.
   (K)   The prime coat shall be applied only when the base meets the specified
density requirements and the moisture content does not exceed 90% of the
optimum moisture of the base material. At the time of priming, the base shall
be firm, unyielding and in such condition that no undue distortion will occur.
   (L)   The contractor will be responsible for assuring that the true crown
and template are maintained, with no rutting or other distortion, and that the
base meets all requirements, at the time the surface course is applied.
   (M)   Thickness of the base shall be measured at intervals of not more than
200 feet. Measurements shall be taken at various points on the cross-section
through holes not less than three inches in diameter.
   (N)   Where the compacted base is deficient by more than one-half inch from
the thickness called for on the plans, the contractor shall correct such areas
by scarifying and adding rock.
   (O)   The base shall be scarified and rock added for a distance of 100 feet
in each direction from the edge of the deficient area. The affected areas shall
then be brought to the required state of compaction and to the required
thickness and cross-section.

§ 155.086 CEMENTED COQUINA BASE CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   The work consists of the construction of a base course composed of
cemented coquina. It shall be constructed on the prepared subgrade, in
accordance with these specifications and in conformity with the lines, grades,
and cross-section shown on the plans.
   (B)   The spreading of the rock shall be done by methods approved by the
engineer. All shaping shall be done utilizing a motor grader.
   (C)   The cemented coquina shall be transported to the point where it is to
be used, over cemented coquina previously placed, if practicable, and dumped on
the end of the preceding spread. No hauling over the subgrade or dumping on the
subgrade shall be permitted. If at any time the subgrade material should become
mixed with the base course material, the contractor shall, without additional
compensation, dig out and remove the mixture, reshape and compact the subgrade,
and replace the materials removed with clean base material, which shall be
shaped and compacted as specified above. All segregated areas of fine or coarse
rock shall be removed and replaced with properly graded rock.
   (D)   When the specified compacted thickness of the base is greater than
eight inches, the base shall be constructed in two courses. The thickness of
the first course shall be approximately one-half the total thickness of the
finished base, or enough additional to bear the weight of the construction
equipment without disturbing the subgrade. At no time shall more than three
days’ work of the first course be spread ahead of the second course.
   (E)   For single-course base, after the spreading is completed the entire
surface shall be scarified and then shaped so as to produce the required grade
and cross-section after compaction.
   (F)   For double-course base, the first course shall be bladed if necessary
to secure a uniform surface, and brought to a surface cross-section
approximately parallel to that of the finished base, with the thickness of the
first course approximately one-half the total thickness of the base. Prior to
the spreading of any material for the upper course, the density tests for the
lower course shall have determined that the required compaction has been
obtained. After the spreading of the material for the second course is
completed, the surface of such course shall be scarified and shaped so as to
produce the required grade and cross-section after compaction.
   (G)   When the material does not have the proper moisture content to insure
the required density, wetting or drying will be required. When water is added
it shall be uniformly mixed in by discing to the full depth of the course which
is being compacted. Wetting or drying operations shall involve manipulation, as
a unit, of the entire width and depth of the course, which is being compacted.
   (H)   As soon as proper conditions of moisture are attained, the material
shall be compacted to an average density not less than 98% of the maximum
density obtainable under AASHTO T-180, Method “D”. For double course base
average density shall be determined separately for each course. Cemented
coquina base for shoulder pavement shall be compacted to a density not less
than 95% of maximum density by AASHTO T-180, Method “D”. During final
compacting operations, if blading of any areas is necessary to obtain the true
grade and cross section, the compacting operations for such areas shall be
completed prior to making the density determinations on the finished base.
   (I)   At least three density determinations shall be made on each day’s
final compaction operations on each course, and the density determinations
shall be made at more frequent intervals if deemed necessary by the engineer.
   (J)   If cracks or checks appear in the base, either before or after
priming, which, in the opinion of the engineer, would impair the structural
efficiency of the base course, the contractor shall remove such cracks or
checks by rescarifying, reshaping, adding base materials where necessary, and
recompacting.
   (K)   The finished surface of the base course shall be checked with a
template cut to the required crown and with a 15-foot straightedge laid
parallel to the center line of the road. All irregularities greater than one-
quarter inch shall be corrected scarifying and removing or adding rock as
required, after which the entire area shall be re-compacted as specified herein
before. In testing the surface, the measurements will not be taken in small
holes caused by individual pieces of rock having been pulled out by the grader.
   (L)   If, in the opinion of the engineer, the surface of the base has a
glazed or cemented surface sufficient to prevent proper penetration of the
prime coat, and after he or she determines that the condition of the base meets
all requirements, he or she will direct that the surface be hard-planed with a
blade grader and broomed immediately prior to the application of the prime
coat. This hardplanning shall be done in such a manner that only the glazed or
cemented surface is removed, leaving a granular or porous condition that will
allow free penetration of the prime material. The material planed from the base
shall be removed form the base area. The hard-planing operations, when
required, shall follow the surface-testing operations specified below.

density requirements and the moisture content does not exceed 90% of the
optimum moisture of the base material. At the time of priming, the base shall
be firm, unyielding and in such condition that no undue distortion will occur.
   (N)   The contractor will be responsible for assuring that the true crown
and template are maintained, with no rutting or other distortion, and that the
base meets all the requirements at the same time the surface course is applied.
   (O)   Thickness of the base shall be measured at intervals of not more than
200 feet. Measurements shall be taken at various points on the cross-section,
through holes not less than three inches in diameter.
   (P)   Where compacted base is deficient by more than one-half inch from the
thickness called for in the plans, the contractor shall correct such areas by
scarifying and adding rock. The base shall be scarified and rock added for a
distance of 100 feet in each direction from the edge of the deficient area. The
affected areas shall then be brought to the required state of compaction and to
the required thickness and cross-section.

§ 155.087 PRIME COAT.
   (A)   The work consists of the application of a bituminous prime coat on
previously prepared bases in accordance with these specifications.
   (B)   The surface to be primed shall be cleaned of all loose material, dust,
dirt, caked clay and other foreign material which might prevent proper bonding
and the moisture content of the base shall not exceed 90% of the optimum
moisture. The temperature of the prime material shall be between 100° and 150°
F. The actual temperature shall be that which will insure uniform distribution.
The material shall be applied by means of a pressure distributor. The amount to
be applied will be dependent on the character of the surface and shall be
sufficient to coat the surface thoroughly and uniformly, with no excess.
   (C)   For limerock, limerock stabilized, and local rock bases: For these
bases, the rate of application shall be no less than 0.10 gallon per square
yard. Sand-clay, shell, and shell stabilized bases: The rate of application for
these bases shall be no less than 0.15 gallon per square yard.
   (D)   If required, the base shall be lightly sprinkled with water and rolled
with a traffic roller, in advance of the application of the prime.
   (E)   If warranted by traffic conditions, the application may be made on
only one-half the width of the bases at one time, in which case positive means
shall be used to secure the correct amount of bituminous material at the joint.
   (F)   If emulsified asphalt is used for prime coat, the primed base shall be
uniformly covered by an application of sand-bituminous hot mix or screenings,
at an appropriate rate of ten pounds per square yard. For the sand, meet the
requirements as specified in FDOT Standard Specifications Section 902-2 or 902-
6, and for the screenings, meet the requirements as specified in Section 902-5.
The entire surface of the sand-bituminous hot mix or screenings cover material
shall be rolled with a traffic roller as required to produce a reasonable dense
mat. If material other than emulsified asphalt is used for prime coat, the
primed base shall be covered by a light uniform application of cover material.
If considered necessary for proper distribution of spread, the cover material
shall be rolled with a traffic roller, for at least ten passes over the entire
area.
   (G)   Do not apply prime and tack coats when the air temperature in the
shade and away from artificial heat is less than 40° F. at the location where
the application is to be made or when weather conditions or the surface
conditions are otherwise unfavorable.

these specifications.
   (B)   In general, a tack coat will not be required on primed bases except in
areas that have become excessively dirty and cannot be cleaned, or in areas
where the prime has cured to the extent that it has lost all bonding effect.
Generally, a tack coat will be required on hot bituminous base courses before
placing the surface course.
   (C)   The tack coat shall be applied with a pressure distributor except
that, on small jobs, if approved by the Engineer, application may be by other
mechanical devises or by hand methods. The bituminous material shall be heated
to a suitable temperature and shall be applied in a thin, uniform layer.
   (D)   The rate of application shall be between 0.02 and 0.08 gallon per
square yard. For tack coat applied on concrete pavement, which is to be
surfaced, the rate of application may exceed the upper limit, if directed by
the engineer.
   (E)   The tack coat shall be applied sufficiently in advance of the laying
of the bituminous mix to permit drying but shall not be applied so far in
advance that it might lose its adhesiveness as a result as a result of being
covered with dust or other foreign material. The tack coat surface shall be
kept free from traffic until the subsequent layer of bituminous hot mix has
been laid.

it is to be laid has been previously prepared, is intact, firm, and properly
cured and is dry. No mixture shall be spread that cannot be finished and
compacted during daylight hours.
   (B)   Wind. The mixture shall not be spread when the wind is blowing to such
an extent that proper and adequate compaction cannot be maintained or when
sand, dust, and the like are being deposited on the surface being paved, to the
extent that the bond between layers will be diminished.
   (C)   Ambient temperature. Temperature shall be 45° F. and rising. The
mixture shall be transported in tight covered vehicles previously cleaned of
all foreign material. The inside surface of the truck bodies shall be thinly
coated with soapy water or an approved emulsion containing not over 5% oil, but
no excess of either shall be used. Kerosene, gasoline or similar products shall
not be used. After the truck bodies are coated and before any mixture is placed
therein, they shall be raised so that all excess liquids will be drained out.
Prior to the laying of the mixture, the surface of the base to be covered shall
be cleaned of all loose and deleterious material by the use of power brooms or
blowers, supplemented by hand brooming where necessary.

§ 155.112 PLACING THE MIXTURE.
   (A)   All asphaltic concrete mixtures, other than adjacent to curb and
gutter or other true edges, shall be laid by the stringline method to assure
the obtaining of an accurate, uniform alignment of the pavement edge. Control
the unsupported pavement edge to ensure that it will not deviate more than ±
1.5 inches from the stringline.
   (B)   The temperature of the mixture at the time of spreading shall be
within 25° F. of the temperature set by the engineer, which temperature shall
be between 270° F. and 350° F. Any load or portion of a load of asphalt mix on
the roadway with a temperature outside of the master range shall be rejected
for use on the project. The engineer will be immediately notified of the
rejection.
   (C)   Any mixture caught in transit by a sudden rain may be laid only at the
contractor’s risk. Should such mixture prove unsatisfactory, it shall be
removed and replaced with satisfactory mixture at the contractors expense. In
no case shall the mixture be laid while rain is falling or when there is water
on the surface to be covered.
   (D)   The depth of each layer shall be checked at frequent intervals, not to
exceed 25 feet. Any deviation from the required thickness, in excess of the
allowable tolerance, shall be immediately corrected. When making an adjustment,
allow the paving machine to travel a minimum distance of 32 feet [ten m] to
stabilize before the second check is made to determine the effects of the
adjustment.
   (E)   In limited areas where the use of the spreader is impossible or
impracticable, the mixture may be spread and finished by hand. Straight-edging
and back- patching shall be done after initial compaction has been obtained and
while the material is still hot. Upon arrival, the mixture shall be dumped into
the approved mechanical spreader and immediately spread and struck-off to the
full width required and to such loose depth for each course that, when the work
is completed, the specified thickness will be secured. An excess amount of
mixture shall be carried ahead of the screed at all times. Hand raking shall be
done behind the machine as required.
   (F)   If necessary due to the traffic requirements, the mixture shall be
laid in strips in such manner as to provide for the passage of traffic. Where
the road is closed to traffic, the mixture may be laid to the full width, by
machines traveling in echelon. Before any rolling is started, the surface shall
be checked. Correct any irregularities, remove all drippings, fat sandy
accumulations from the screed, and fat spots from any source, shall be removed

§ 155.113 CONTROL TESTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The thickness shall be determined from the length of the core borings.
Minimum frequency of cores samples shall be three per day. The maximum
allowable deficiency from the specified thickness shall be as follows:
      (1)   For pavement of specified thickness of two and one-half inches or
more - one-half inch.
      (2)   For pavement of a specified thickness of less than two and one-half
inches - one-four inch.
   (B)   Where the deficiency in thickness is:
      (1)   In excess of three-eighths inch, for pavement of less than two and
one-half inches in specified thickness; or
      (2)   In excess of three-fourths inch, for pavement of specified
thickness of two and one-half inches or more.
   (C)   The contractor shall correct deficiency either by replacing the full
thickness for a length extending at least 50 feet from each end of the
deficient area or (when permitted by the engineer) by overlaying. The
contractor will receive no compensation for any pavement removed, nor for the
work of removing such pavement.
   (D)   When the deficiency in the thickness of the pavement is over one-
fourth inch but not more than three-eighths inch, for pavement of specified
thickness less than two and one-half inches: or when the deficiency in
thickness is over one-half inch but not more than three-fourths inch, for
pavement of specified thickness of two and one-half inches or greater; the
contractor will be allowed to leave such pavement in place, but without
compensation other than for the bituminous material contained therein. The
areas of pavement for which no square yard payment will be made shall be the
product of the total distance between acceptable cores, multiplied by the width
of the lane which was laid at the particular pass in which deficient thickness
was indicated. To determine the extent of the deficiencies, additional cores
will be taken as required.
   (E)   For any case of excess deficiency of the pavement the contractor will
be permitted, if approved by the Engineer for each particular location, to
correct the deficient thickness by adding new surface material and compacting
to the same density as the adjacent surface. The area to be corrected and the
thickness of new material added shall be as specified. All costs of the
overlaying and compacting shall be borne by the contractor.
   (F)   The thickness of the pavement shall be determined from the length of
cores, at least two inches in diameter, taken at random points on the cross-
section and along the roadway. Each core shall represent a section not longer
than 200 feet. The average thickness shall be determined from the measured
thickness, and in accordance with the procedure and criteria specified herein.
If the contractor believes that the number of cores taken is insufficient to
properly indicate the thickness of the pavement, he or she may request
additional borings at locations designated by him or her. The cost of these
additional borings shall be deducted from any sums due the contractor unless
such borings indicate that the pavement within the questioned area is of
specified thickness.
   (G)   Average thickness shall be calculated for the total length of project.
When the thickness as measured by the cores is more than 14 inches greater than
the specified thickness, it shall be considered in the calculation as the
specified thickness plus one-half inch.
   (H)   Areas of deficient-thickness pavement which are left in place with no
compensation shall not be taken into account in the calculations.
   (I)   Where areas of defected surface or deficient thickness are corrected
by overlaying with additional material, the thickness used in the calculations
shall be the specified thickness for the areas.

§ 156.02 INTENT.
   (A)   The public health, safety, comfort, economy, good order, appearance,
convenience, morals and general welfare require the harmonious, orderly and
progressive development of land within the town. The intent of this chapter is
to secure or to ensure:
      (1)   The establishment of standards of subdivision design that will
encourage and lead to the development of sound and economically stable
communities, and the creation of healthful living environments;
      (2)   Installation to prescribed standards by the land developer of those
necessary improvements that ought not to become a charge on the citizens and
taxpayers of already existing communities;
      (3)   The efficient, adequate and economic supply of utilities and
services to new land developments;
      (4)   The prevention of traffic hazards and the establishment of safe and
convenient means for the circulation of traffic, both vehicular and pedestrian
within new land developments and from new land developments into and from
established communities;
      (5)   That for lands within the 100-year floodplain, subdivisions shall
be designed to minimize flood damage; and
      (6)   The provisions of public open spaces in new land developments
through the dedication or reservation of land for recreational, education and
other public purposes.
   (B)   The regulation of the subdivision of land is intended to:
      (1)   Aid in the coordination of land development in the town in
accordance with orderly physical patterns;
      (2)   Discourage land subdivisions without installation by the developer
of adequate and necessary physical improvements;
      (3)   Discourage haphazard, premature, uneconomic or scattered land
development to ensure that the citizens and taxpayers of the town will not have
to bear the costs resulting from haphazard subdivision of land and the lack of
authority to require installation by the developer of adequate and necessary
physical improvements;
      (4)   Ensure to the purchaser of land in a subdivision that necessary
improvements of lasting quality have been installed; and
      (5)   Serve as one of the several instruments of land use control for the
implementation of the comprehensive plan.
(2000 Code, § 58-2) (Ord. 88-01, passed 5-24-1988)
§ 156.03 JURISDICTION.
   This chapter shall govern all subdivisions of land within the town. However,
no requirements under this chapter shall be so applied as to result in
retroactive legislation or to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair or
interfere with existing provisions of other laws or ordinances, except those
specifically repealed, or with private restrictions placed upon property by
deed covenant or other private agreement, or with restrictive covenants running
with the land to which the town is a party. Where this chapter imposes a
greater restriction upon land than is imposed or required by existing
provisions of law, ordinance, contract or deed, the provisions in this chapter
shall control.

(2000 Code, § 58-348) (Ord. 88-01, passed 5-24-1988)
§ 156.68 SEWAGE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Septic tank permits shall not be issued for lots where central sewage
is available or can reasonably be made available. Prior to submitting a new
subdivision to the County Health Department for approval, the developer shall
first determine the location of the nearest or most adequate existing central
sewage system and shall contact the utility to determine the availability and
feasibility of obtaining service. The utility’s reply to the inquiry shall be
in writing, with a copy to the Health Department. Where an existing utility is
not available to provide central sewerage service, the developer shall have an
engineer registered in the state determine the feasibility of providing a
central sewerage system to serve the proposed subdivision. A copy of the report
of the feasibility determination shall be submitted to the County Health
Department for review.
   (B)   Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the County Health Department
that central sewerage service cannot be feasibly provided either from an
existing system or by development of a subdivision system, the developer may
submit four sets of completed subdivision analysis forms, including submittals
outlined in the instructions of the forms, to the County Health Department for
review. Forms may be obtained from any of the offices of the County Health
Department. The completed forms shall constitute an application pending the
future availability of central sewerage service.
   (C)   No subdivision shall be approved for waste disposal by individual
septic tank systems except when the septic tank suitability requirements of the
rules, regulations and standards of the County Health Department are met by the
buildable area of each lot in the subdivision.
   (D)   Where the County Health Department’s septic tank suitability
requirements can be met and the central sewerage service is not considered
available and feasible, individual septic tank disposal systems may be allowed
for single-family dwellings according to the following schedules:
      (1)   With public water supply, septic tank density ratio equals one gray
water tank per half acre of lot area and one black water tank; and
      (2)   With individual wells, one gray water tank per half acre of lot
area and one black water tank.
   (E)   Multi-family and commercial installation requirements shall be
determined individually by the County Health Department.
(2000 Code, § 58-349) (Ord. 88-01, passed 5-24-1988)
§ 156.69 CENTRAL SEWERAGE SYSTEM.

exceed 15 years), the applicant shall install sanitary sewer lines, laterals
and mains from the street curb to a point in the subdivision boundary where a
future connection with the public sewer main shall be made. Sewer lines shall
be laid from the house to the street line, and a connection shall be available
in the home to connect from the individual disposal system to the sewer system
when the public sewers become available. The sewer systems shall be capped
until ready for use and shall conform to all plans for installation of the
public sewer system, where the exists, and shall be ready for connection to the
public sewer main.
   (C)   Intensive development that does occur in marginal lands should utilize
central sewage collection and treatment facilities. Low-intensity development
should utilize sewage facilities appropriate to the conditions. Any structure
built in floodplains should be designed to allow free flow of water. Floodplain
development in a manner that would significantly impede the flow of floodwaters
and cause floodwaters to back up should not be permitted unless it is clearly
shown that the increase upstream will not impede the flow of floodwaters and
cause floodwaters to back up.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 157.001 INTERPRETATION.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter
shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of
public health, safety and welfare. To protect the public, among other purposes,
the provisions are intended to provide for adequate light, pure air, safety
from fire and other danger, undue concentration of population and ample parking
facilities.
(2000 Code, § 66-1) (Ord. 75-01, passed 7-14-1975)
§ 157.002 SCOPE.
   It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way
impair or interfere with existing provisions of other laws or ordinances,
except those specifically repealed by this chapter, or with private agreement
of record, or with restrictive covenants running with the land to which the
town is a party. Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon land,
buildings or structures than is imposed or required by the existing provisions
of law, ordinance, contract or deed, the provisions of this chapter shall
control.
(2000 Code, § 66-2) (Ord. 75-01, passed 7-14-1975)
§ 157.003 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply

application, on notice to the Building Official from whom the appeal is taken
and on due cause shown.
   (B)   Variances; conditions governing applications; procedures. To authorize

hardship. A variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted by the
Board of Adjustment until:
      (1)   A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating

buildings in the same district and no permitted use of lands, structures or
buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a

exceptions;

attorney at the public hearing;
      (5)   The Board of Adjustment shall make findings whether the
requirements of division (B)(1)(a) above have been met by the applicant for a
variance;

variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of
the land, building or structure;
      (7)   The Board of Adjustment shall further determine whether the
granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of this chapter or will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare;
      (8)   In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.
Violation of the conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under
which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and
punishable as provided by this chapter; and
      (9)   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Adjustment grant a
variance to permit a use not generally or by special exception permitted in the
district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the
terms of this chapter in that district.
   (C)   To hear and decide such special exceptions as the Board of Adjustment
is specifically authorized to pass on under the terms of this Article XV; to
decide such questions as are involved in the determination of when special
exceptions should be granted; and to grant special exceptions with appropriate
conditions and safeguards or to deny special exceptions when not in harmony
with the purpose and intent of this act or any ordinance enacted under the
authority of this act.

grant will not adversely affect the public interest.

within which the action for which the special exception is required shall be
begun or completed or both.

and policies of the Comprehensive Plan.

zoning district within which the special exception is sought.

adjacent property through the creation of noise, light, vibrations, traffic,
utility requirements, or stormwater runoff that would not have been created had
the property been developed for a principal use permitted in the applicable
zoning district.
         (d)   The special exception will not create any unusual police, fire
or emergency services requirements.

NONCONFORMITIES
§ 157.090 INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this chapter, or amendments that may
later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures and
characteristics of use which were lawful before this chapter was passed or
amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms
of this chapter or future amendments. It is the intent of this subchapter to
permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to
encourage their continuation. The uses are declared by this chapter to be
incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the
intent of this subchapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon,
expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or
uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
(2000 Code, § 66-141) (Ord. 75-01, passed 7-14-1975)
§ 157.091 EXTENSION AND ENLARGEMENT.
   (A)   A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged
after July 14, 1975, by attachment on a building or premises of additional
signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other
uses of a nature that would be prohibited generally in the district involved;
nor shall the use of the premises revert to a former use that is prohibited
under this chapter.
   (B)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plan, construction or designated use of any building on
which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption of this chapter.
   (C)   Actual construction includes the placing of construction materials in
permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner.
   (D)   Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has
been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, the excavation or
demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction.

§ 157.092 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district in which dwelling units are permitted, notwithstanding
limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter, dwelling units and
customary accessory buildings may be erected on any lot of record at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter. The lot must be in
separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same
ownership. This provision shall apply even though the lot fails to meet the
requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the
district, provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving
area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the
district in which the lot is located. Variance of area, width or yard
requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Adjustment.
If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this chapter, the lands involved shall be considered to be an
undivided lot for the purposes of this chapter; and no lot or portion of the
lot shall be eligible for a development permit that does not meet lot width,
depth and area requirements established by this chapter.

§ 157.093 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter,
lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of
this chapter as enacted or amended, the use may be continued, so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
   (A)   No nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter unless the use is changed to a use
permitted in the district in which use is located.
   (B)   No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other
portion of the lot or parcel occupied by the use at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter.

characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, the structure may
be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions.
   (A)   No structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its
nonconformity.
   (B)   Any structure or portion of the structure may be altered to decrease
its nonconformity.

than 50% of its construction cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Should the structure be moved for any reason and distance whatever, it
shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is
located after it is moved.

COMBINATION.
   (A)   If a lawful use involving individual structures, or of a structure and
premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this chapter, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of
this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions.
      (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
      (2)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building that were manifestly arranged or designed for the use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no use shall be extended to occupy
any land outside the building.
      (3)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district in which the structure is located; and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
      (4)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises
in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
      (5)   All nonconforming use of structures or of structures and premises
in combination, except for residential uses, shall be discontinued; except that
for each $500 of its assessed value on the date of issuance of a certificate of
nonconforming use, the nonconformity shall be permitted to continue for a
period of one year. In no event, however, shall any nonconformity involving a
structure be required to discontinue before a period of three years; nor shall
any nonconformity be permitted to continue for a period longer than 50 years,
regardless of its assessed value.
   (B)   Nonconformities not involving the use of a principal structure, e.g.,
open storage, building supplies, vehicle, mobile home, implement and machinery
storage, junkyards, commercial animal yards and the like, shall be discontinued
within two years of the effective date of this chapter or amendment.

be considered abandoned when the:
   (A)   Intent of the owner to discontinue the use is apparent; or
   (B)   Characteristic equipment and the furnishings of the nonconforming use
have been removed from the premises and have not been replaced by similar

increased. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening
or restoring to a safe condition of any building declared to be unsafe by any
official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of the official.

   Any special exception use as provided in this chapter shall not be deemed a
nonconforming use but shall without further action be deemed a conforming use
in the district; however, the special exception shall not be extended or
expanded unless a special ordinance granting permission for the expansion or
extension has been passed and adopted by the Town Council as required by the
terms of this chapter in connection with the special exception procedure.

§ 157.115 CONDITIONAL USES.
   (A)   The Town Council may permit a conditional use as provided herein, by
ordinance granting permission for the use after a public hearing before the
Planning and Zoning Board at which persons interested shall be accorded an
opportunity to be heard. Any ordinance permitting conditional uses as provided
herein shall be construed as permitting only the specifically named or
described conditional use, and not any other conditional use. Any property or
premises designated upon the zoning map by the letter symbol “CU” alone shall
be restricted to the specific conditional use permitted and may used for no
other use whatsoever. Any property or premises designated by the letter symbol
“CU” before and in conjunction with the letter symbol for a zoning district
shall be restricted to a use for that particular conditional use specified or
the use permitted in the designated use district, i.e. the letter “C-R-1A”
shall denote a conditional use permitted in an R-1A use district and the
premises so designated may be used only for the specific conditional use
permitted in that district.
   (B)   In granting any conditional use, the Town Council shall prescribe any
conditions that it deems necessary to or desirable for, the public interest. A
conditional use shall not be permitted by the Town Council unless and until:
      (1)   A written application for the conditional use, on a form prescribed
by the town, and a site plan drawn to scale, signed and sealed by any of the
following professionals registered in the state as a land surveyor, landscape
architect, architect or engineer shall be required;
      (2)   All applications for a conditional use shall be reviewed for
sufficiency by the Town Clerk, forwarded to the town planner for review,
recommendation, report, scheduling and submittal to the Planning and Zoning
Board who shall study and make written recommendations to the Council, which
recommendations shall become a part of the official record of the town in
connection with the application;
      (3)   Upon receipt of the application, a date shall be set for a public
hearing before the Planning and Zoning Board at which parties in interest and
citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard. The Clerk shall cause a copy of
the notice to be posted on the property by the applicant for which a
conditional use is sought and at the Town Hall. Public hearing notice before
the Town Council for the adoption of a proposed ordinance approving the
conditional land shall be provided as required by F.S. Ch. 166, as amended from
time to time. In addition notice of public hearing for the adoption of a
proposed ordinance approving the conditional land use shall be posted at least
seven days in advance of such hearing before the Town Council at the Town Hall.
All notices shall state in substance the conditional use desired and a legal
description of the property;
      (4)   The applicant shall provide a map, along with the names and
addresses of all property owners within a 500 foot radius and will be
responsible for paying for notices to be sent to all adjacent owners of record.
However, failure of an adjacent owner to receive notice as mailed by the Town
Clerk shall not affect any action or proceedings taken hereunder; or
      (5)   At the time and place set forth in the notice herein above referred
to, the Planning and Zoning Board shall conduct a public hearing to consider
the request for the conditional use desired. Any party may appear in person or
be represented by counsel at the public hearing. At the time of the public
hearing and in no event later than one week from the date thereof, the Board
shall cause the submittal of the request for a conditional use together with
their written recommendations to be forwarded to the Town Council. As a
conditional use request is a quasi-judicial hearing, the Board and Town Council
may only act upon the evidence produced at the public hearing and shall
disclose for the record any ex-parte communications regarding the request.
   (C)   No conditional use shall be recommended by the Planning and Zoning
Board, nor granted by the Council, unless a determination be made that the
conditional use requested will not be injurious to the neighborhood or
otherwise detrimental to the public welfare, and will be in harmony with the
general purpose of this chapter. In making this determination, the Planning and
Zoning Board and Council shall take into account the character and uses of
adjoining buildings and lands and those in the vicinity, the number of persons
residing or working in the buildings or upon the land and traffic conditions in
the vicinity.
   (D)   Before any conditional use is recommended by the Planning and Zoning
Board or approved by the Town Council, each body shall make written findings
certifying compliance with the specific rules governing individual conditional
uses which at a minimum include consideration of the following provisions:
      (1)   Ingress and egress to the property and proposed structures thereon
with particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience,
traffic flow and control, access in case of fire or catastrophe;
      (2)   Off-street parking and loading areas where required;
      (3)   Economic, noise, glare or odor effects of the request on adjoining
properties and properties generally in the district;
      (4)   Refuse and services areas;
      (5)   Utilities, with reference to locations, availability and
compatibility;
      (6)   Screening and buffering with reference to type, dimensions and
character;
      (7)   Signs, proposed exterior lighting with reference to glare, traffic
safety, economic effect, and compatibility and harmony with properties in the
district;
      (8)   Required yards and other open space;
      (9)   Height;
      (10)   Landscaping;
      (11)   Renewal and/or termination dates; and
      (12)   The use will be reasonably compatible with surrounding uses in its
function, its hours of operation, the type and amount of traffic to be
generated, and building size and setbacks, its relationship to land values,
consistency with the town’s comprehensive plan and future land use map and
other factors that may be used to measure compatibility with the surrounding
areas.
   (E)   After the public hearing before the Planning and Zoning Board and upon
receipt of their written recommendation, the Council may by ordinance grant
permission for the conditional use and in doing so may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.
   (F)   Violations of the conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the
terms under which the conditional use is granted shall be deemed a violation of
this chapter and punishable as provided by law. The Council may provide a time
period with which action must be commenced in connection with the conditional
use, and may further provide that upon failure to implement or cessation of the
conditional use for a continuous period of six months, the use of the premises
shall revert to the previous and more restricted use classification.

contain utility sites, and other nonrecreational service buildings, the area of
which will be subtracted from the computed recreational area. Recreational
areas shall be easily accessible to all park users and management. Although the
required space for recreational usage may be met through more than one
recreational site, the minimum size of any area shall be 20,000 square feet.
Provision for all common open space and the construction of recreational

HOME-BASED BUSINESSES
§ 157.530 REGULATIONS.
   (A)   In any district where a home-based business is allowed, it shall be
clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the dwelling for dwelling
purposes and shall not change the character of the dwelling. For purposes of
this section, a business is considered a home-based business if it operates, in
whole or in part, from a residential property and has obtained and currently
possess the appropriate business tax receipt from the town.
   (B)   When permitted, home-based business shall be conducted in accordance
with the following provisions:
      (1)   The employees of the business who work at the residential dwelling
must also reside in the residential dwelling, except that up to a total of two
employees or independent contractors who do not reside at the residential
dwelling may work at the business. The business may have additional remote
employees that do not work at the residential dwelling.
      (2)   In order to preserve the character, aesthetics, architectural and
the use of the residential property so as to be consistent with the uses of the
residential areas that surround the property, there shall be no display of
goods visible from any street.
      (3)   In order to preserve the character, aesthetics, architectural and
the use of the residential property so as to be consistent with the uses of the
residential areas that surround the property, a nonilluminated nameplate, not
exceeding two square feet in area, may be displayed providing it is affixed
flat against the exterior surface at a position not more than two feet distance
from the main entrance to the residence.
      (4)   (a)   No home-based business shall occupy a residence, exclusive of
the area of any open porch or attached garage or similar space not suited or
intended for occupancy as living quarters which results in a situation where
the home business becomes the primary use of the property and the residential
use is secondary. A list of non-exclusive factors which may be considered to
determine if the residential use is secondary are as follows:
            1.   Whether homestead tax exemption is maintained on the property;
            2.   The number of occupants of the dwelling compared to the number
of bedrooms in the dwelling;
            3.   Whether the dwelling unit is owner/occupied;
            4.   Traffic generation to and from the property exceeds that which
is greater than would normally be expected at a similar residence where no
business is conducted;
            5.   Whether parking volume at the property exceeds that which is
greater than would normally be expected at a similar residence where no
business is conducted;
            6.   Whether the use of vehicles or trailers operated or parked at
the business or on a street right-of-way is greater than would normally be
expected at a similar residence where no business is conducted.
         (b)   No rooms that have been constructed as an addition to the
residence, nor any attached garage or porch that has been converted into living
quarters since the dwelling's original construction, shall be considered as
floor area until two years after its date of completion or occupancy is issued
by the town.
      (5)   No home-based business retail transaction may be conducted in any
structure or accessory building other than the residential dwelling.
      (6)   All business activities comply with any relevant local, state, and
federal regulations with respect to the use, storage, or disposal of any
corrosive, combustible, or other hazardous or flammable materials or liquids.
      (7)   No equipment or process shall be used in the home occupation that
creates noise, vibration, glare, fumes, odors or electrical interference
detectable to the normal senses off the lot. In the case of electrical
interference, no equipment or process shall be used that creates visual or
audible interference in any radio or television receivers off the premises, or
causes fluctuations in line voltage off the premises.
      (8)   Occupations that generate greater volumes of traffic than would
normally be expected in a residential neighborhood are prohibited.
      (9)   Parking related to the business activities of the home-based
business may not be greater in volume than would normally be expected at a
similar residence where no business is conducted. The parking of vehicles and
trailers shall conform to the parking requirements of the zoning district where
the home-based business is located. Vehicles and trailers, if so permitted in
the applicable zoning district, used in connection with the business must be
parked in legal parking spaces that are not located within the right-of-way, on
or over a sidewalk, or on any unimproved surfaces at the residence.
      (10)   The parking or storage of heavy equipment at the business which is
visible from the street or neighboring property is prohibited. For purposes of
this division the term HEAVY EQUIPMENT means commercial, industrial, or
agricultural vehicles, equipment, or machinery.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS AND ANTENNAS
§ 157.545 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The intent of this subchapter is to provide standards and regulations
for the location of telecommunications antennas and towers in the town. These
regulations and requirements are adopted with the intent and purpose of:
      (1)   Protecting the health, safety and welfare of the public;
      (2)   Of encouraging users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
      (3)   Of protecting residential areas, scenic roads, historical sites and
other land uses from potential adverse impact of antennas and towers;
       (4)   To minimize adverse visual impact of antennas and towers through
careful design, siting and landscaping;
      (5)   To encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a
way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas;
      (6)   To promote and strongly encourage shared use (collocation) of
existing towers and antenna support structures as a primary option rather than
construction of additional single-use towers;
      (7)   To avoid potential damage to property caused by antennas and towers
by ensuring the structures are soundly and carefully designed, constructed,
modified and maintained;
      (8)   To ensure that antennas and towers are compatible with surrounding
land uses; and
      (9)   To enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunication
services to provide the services to the community quickly, effectively and
efficiently.
   (B)   The Town Council hereby finds and declares that the concept of the
public welfare is broad and inclusive. The values it represents are spiritual
as well as physical, aesthetic as well as monetary. It is within the power of
this Town Council to determine that the community should be beautiful as well
as healthy, spacious as well as clean, well balanced as well as carefully
patrolled. All applicants for a special permit for telecommunication towers
shall have the burden of demonstrating that the proposed placement of
telecommunication towers and antennas is to the extent possible, consistent
with the preservation of the aesthetics of the community.
(2000 Code, § 66-1029) (Ord. 99-01, passed 3-23-1999)
§ 157.546 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ANTENNA. Any exterior apparatus designed to transmit or receive
communications as authorized by the FCC. The term ANTENNA shall not include
satellite earth stations used to receive direct-to-home satellite services as
defined in 47 U.S.C. § 303(v). An array of antennas, installed at one time and
designed as a single, integrated system, shall be considered as a single
antenna.
   ANTENNA SUPPORT STRUCTURE. Any building or other structure other than a
tower, which can be used for the location of an antenna. An ANTENNA SUPPORT
STRUCTURE shall be referred as to as a UTILIZED ANTENNA SUPPORT STRUCTURE if it
is or has been used for the location of an antenna.
   CAMOUFLAGED ANTENNA AND/OR TOWER. A wireless communications antenna and/or
tower designed to unobtrusively blend into the existing surroundings and be
disguised to not have the appearance of a wireless communications antenna and/
or tower. CAMOUFLAGED ANTENNAS AND/OR TOWERS on buildings must be disguised to
appear as an accessory structure that is normally associated with the principal
use occupying the property. CAMOUFLAGED ANTENNAS AND/OR TOWERS must be
disguised to blend in with other facilities on the property or existing
vegetation, such as a tower constructed in the form and shape of a tree to be
part of a forested area, or an antenna and/or tower constructed to be a
component of a bell, clock or water tower on sites with compatible buildings or
a component of a church steeple on sites with churches. Surface finish, paint
and/or markings alone are insufficient to qualify for a determination as a
CAMOUFLAGED ANTENNA AND/OR TOWER.
   COLLOCATION. The process of locating two or more antennas on an existing or
proposed tower or antenna support structure.
   ENGINEER. Any engineer licensed by the state. Radio-frequency engineers do
not have to be licensed by the state, however, for purposes of this subchapter,
if their qualifications include specific experience or employment in the
telecommunications industry in a professional technical capacity.
   MODIFY. Includes all structural changes to a tower other than routine
maintenance, including, without limitation, structural modifications,
rebuilding or relocating on the same parcel. MODIFY does not include adding
additional or different antennas or deleting or removing antennas.
      (1)   The structural changes shall be subject to the requirements
concerning MODIFIED TOWERS or MODIFICATION TO TOWERS if:
         (a)   They are made to accommodate collocation; and
         (b)   After the changes, the tower will not exceed 40 feet over the
tower’s originally approved height.
      (2)   If the structural changes do not meet the requirements of the
preceding division, they shall be subject to the requirements of this section
concerning new towers or the construction of towers.
   MONOPOLE TOWER. A tower consisting of a single pole or spine self supported
by a permanent foundation and constructed without guy wires and ground anchors.
   TOWER. A lattice, guyed or monopole structure constructed from grade which
supports antennas. The term TOWER shall not include the singular use as a
amateur radio operator’s equipment, as licensed by the FCC, or antenna support
structures and/or towers which are less than 50 feet in height and are used
only to support antennas which receive, but do not transmit television signals.
   TOWER CLUSTERING. The location of two or more towers on a parcel of
property.
(2000 Code, § 66-1030) (Ord. 99-01, passed 3-23-1999)
§ 157.547 LOCATION PRIORITY.
   (A)   It is recognized that different wireless telecommunication services
and providers have distinct geographical areas in which they must be located to
provide their service, but it is also recognized that there is usually some
flexibility in the type of antenna and type of support structure on which the
antenna is to be located. Therefore, all antennas and towers subject to this
section shall to the extent possible be located in accordance with the
following prioritization of types of facilities and sites.
   (B)   Priority of facilities or sites:
      (1)   Antennas on existing towers;
      (2)   Antennas on existing antenna support structures;
      (3)   Antennas on modified or reconstructed towers designed to
accommodate the collocation of additional carriers;
      (4)   Towers and antennas on limited replacement/modified light
standards, power poles or other the antenna support structures in a
nonresidential zoning district; and
      (5)   New construction and new towers.
(2000 Code, § 66-1031) (Ord. 99-01, passed 3-23-1999)
§ 157.548 PERMITTED USES.
   (A)   A communication tower, meeting the requirements of this chapter and
specifically §§
157.550 through
157.552 and
157.554 shall be a permitted use of land requiring administrative review and
administrative permit only, through approval by the Town Council. A
communication tower allowed as a permitted use under this section shall be
limited to a maximum of 70 feet in height and shall be a monopole tower.
   (B)   A communication tower which fails to meet the requirements of this
section as a permitted use may be permitted by a conditional use permit, if
issued by the governing body designated to hear and decide special exception or

§ 157.549 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   (A)   No person shall erect or modify an antenna or an antenna support
structure, construct a new tower or modify an existing tower without first
obtaining a special use permit pursuant to this section, or an administrative
permit as set forth herein. The Town Council, or body designated to hear and
decide special/conditional use permit requests, is under no obligation to
approve a special use permit application unless and until the applicant meets
their burden of demonstrating that the proposed use will not adversely affect
the public interest, the proposed use is consistent with the comprehensive plan
and the proposed use is compatible with the land use in the surrounding area.
The Town Council’s or designee’s determination shall be based on substantial
and competent evidence, documentation and testimony received at the public
hearing, including, but not limited to, the recommendation of the town planning
staff, the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Board, information and
recommendation of town engineering consultants, information from the applicant
and any party in support or opposition, or their respective representatives.
   (B)   In addition, the Town Council or designee shall consider the following
factors in determining whether to issue a special use permit for a new tower,
although the Town Council or designee may waive or reduce the burden on the
applicant of one or more of these criteria if the Council or designee concludes
that the goals of this section are better served thereby:
      (1)   Height of the proposed tower; surrounding topography; surrounding
tree coverage and foliage; nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
proposed ingress and egress; and availability of suitable existing towers and
other structures as set forth in this section;
      (2)   Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
subdivision boundaries, including the amount of the tower that can be viewed
from surrounding residential zones in conjunction with its proximity (distance)
to the residential zone, mitigation landscaping, existing character of
surrounding area, or other visual options proposed by the applicant;
      (3)   Proximity of the tower to public and private airports, including
but not limited to the effect on the airport traffic pattern and visual and
instrument approaches, orientation to the runway heading and type and volume of
aircraft traffic operating at the airport;
      (4)   Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness, including the extent to which the tower is designed and located
to be compatible with the nature and character of other land uses and/or with
the environment within which the tower proposes to locate, the tower may be
placed, designed or camouflaged to assist with mitigating the overall aesthetic
impact of a tower;
      (5)   Surrounding topography, tree coverage and foliage;
      (6)   Proposed ingress and egress; and
      (7)   No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Town Council that no existing tower or
antenna structure can accommodate the applicant’s proposed antenna. Evidence
submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or antenna support structure
can accommodate the applicant’s proposed antenna must be submitted with the
application and may consist of any of the following:
         (a)   No existing towers or antenna support structures are located
within the geographic area required to meet applicant’s engineering
requirements;
         (b)   Existing towers or antenna support structures are not of
sufficient height to meet applicant’s engineering requirements;
         (c)   Existing towers or antenna support structures do not have
sufficient structural strength to supports applicant’s proposed antenna and
related equipment;
         (d)   The applicant’s proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or antenna support
structure, or the antenna on the existing towers or antenna support structures
would cause interference with the applicant’s proposed antenna;
         (e)   The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner
in order to share an existing tower or antenna support structure or to adapt an
existing tower or antenna support structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs
exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable; and
         (f)   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors
that render existing towers and antenna support structures unsuitable.

§ 157.550 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   The following development standards shall govern the application,
consideration and issuance of administrative and special use permits.
   (B)   The applicant shall comply with the following conditions, unless the
applicant can obtain a variance through the Board of Adjustment, after the
variance request is reviewed and receives a recommendation by the Planning and
Zoning Board.
      (1)   Setbacks and location requirements. The following matrix, showing
separation requirements shall apply to all towers, at a minimum, whether a
permitted use or special exception. For those towers which do not abut
residentially zoned or used lands, the towers shall be setback from the
property lines a distance equal to one feet for every two feet of tower height,
but in no case less than the underlying setback, whichever is greater. In
zoning districts which require special or conditional use permit, additional
setbacks may be required to satisfy safety and aesthetic concerns. Structural
support devices such as peripheral anchors, guy wires or other supporting
devices shall be located pursuant to the district setbacks, but in no event
closer than ten feet from any property line of the parent parcel, where there
are no setbacks required. A minimum setback of ten feet from all overhead
utility lines shall be required.
      (2)   Setbacks from parent property lines. Tower setbacks shall be
measured from the base of the tower to the property lines of the parent parcel.
The tower owner shall provide a lease or deed or recorded fall zone easement
covering the certified fall radius, and all towers shall be located on a parcel
in a manner that in the event of collapse, the tower structure and its
supporting devices shall be contained within the confines of the property lines
of the parent parcel. The fall radius of the tower shall be determined and
certified by a state licensed engineer.
      (3)   Location requirements relative to off-site uses and zoning. Towers
shall meet the locational requirements set forth in the table below from
adjacent and surrounding properties of the parent tract. If the owner of the
property where the tower is to be located owns residential units thereon or on
surrounding properties (or if the properties are owned by his or her parents or
children and they have consented in writing), those units shall not be taken
into consideration when calculating the setback and locational requirements in
this section.
 
Tower Locational Requirements
Separation from                         Distance
Any adjacent or surrounding residential 100% of tower height or 50 feet which
dwelling                                ever is greater
Any adjacent or surrounding             100% of tower height or 50 feet
residentially zoned land                whichever is greater
Any government used land                100% of tower height
Public road rights-of-way               100% of tower height
Designated scenic roadways              100% of tower height
 
      (4)   Collocation. All new towers, whether monopole, lattice or guyed,
shall be designed and constructed to allow collocation of a minimum of two
antennas for monopoles and four antennas for other towers. The tower owner/
operator shall submit executed collocation agreements or binding letters of
intent for each collocation as support for granting the permit to locate the
tower, if any. Collocation agreements or binding letters of intent shall be in
a form acceptable to the Town Attorney that shall provide that each of the
additional users will be utilizing the tower upon its completion.
      (5)   Tower clustering. Application for tower clustering shall be filed
with the town and shall include a site plan showing the location and fall zone
radius of each tower. The town planner shall prepare and forward a
recommendation and supporting documents to the Town Council. The Council may
approve or deny the site for tower clustering by adoption of a resolution,
provided however, if one or more of the towers requires a special use permit,
the resolution of approval shall be subject to issuance of the necessary
special use permit. Unless otherwise approved by the Town Council, towers shall
be separated from each other a minimum distance equal to the certified fall
radius.
      (6)   Landscaping and buffers. Landscaping of tower electrical control
equipment facilities/structures and compound shall be required. A planting area
a minimum or four feet wide, around the outside perimeter of the fence around
the tower compound shall be established. The area shall be planted with a hedge
of native or ornamental evergreen shrubs at least 30 inches in height at
planting and capable of growing to at least 40 inches in height within the
first growing season. Plants shall be mulched using two inches of material. A
drip or low volume/pressure irrigation system or other alternative means of
insuring hearty growth of vegetation shall be utilized. These plant materials
shall be designed and placed to effectively screen the view of the tower
compound from adjacent property. Ornamental trees may be included in the design
to achieve this goal. Landscape buffering on the parent parcel shall be
installed along the portion of the parent parcel boundaries between the tower
and off-site residentially zoned property as necessary to buffer residential
property when vegetative buffers are non-existent or provide insufficient
screening. Plant materials shall be designed and placed to screen the view of
the tower compound. Ornamental trees may be included in the design to achieve
this goal. Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the property
shall be protected and preserved to the maximum extent possible. New trees
shall be a minimum of two inches D.B.H. and shall be container grown. Shrubs
shall be a minimum of 18 through 24 inches in height and shall be in a three
gallon container. Plants shall be mulched using two inches of material. All
plant material shall be guaranteed for two years following final inspection and
approval. Replacements shall be made annually and coordinated with the town
planner or other Town Council designee. The Town Council may require a greater
buffer where appropriate or waive or modify any or all of these requirements if
the goals of this section would be better served thereby.
      (7)   Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted except as
required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or other applicable
authority. If lighting is required, the town shall review the available
lighting alternatives and approve the design that will cause the least
disturbance to the surrounding views, including but not limited to installation
of bottom shielding on all lights.
      (8)   Color. Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish, or
concrete, or be painted a color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness, subject
to any applicable standards of the FAA, except for camouflaged towers. The
wiring conduit and coaxial cable shall be designed or painted to reduce visual
obtrusiveness.
      (9)   Buildings. At the tower site, the design of the building and
related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors,
textures, screening and landscaping that will blend with the tower facilities
to the natural setting and built environment. Outdoor storage is not permitted
at a tower site.
      (10)   Antenna. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a
tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be
of a color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the
supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
      (11)   Signage. No signage shall be allowed on any tower, except as
required for public safety purposes or by the Federal Communication Commission
(FCC).
      (12)   Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not
less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate
anti-climbing device; provided however, that the Town Council may waive the
requirements, as it deems appropriate. The use of barbed wire is prohibited.
      (13)   Inventory of existing sites. In order to encourage collocation of
facilities, the town shall maintain a current map of all existing towers and
all antenna support structures on which an antenna has been located. To prepare
and maintain a map, at the time of its first application after the effective
date of this subchapter, each applicant for an antenna and/or new tower shall
provide to the town planner an update of the inventory of the communications
company’s existing towers and antennas and approved towers that are either
within town or within one-quarter mile of the border thereof, including
municipal boundaries, including specific information about the location
(including longitude, latitude and global positioning system location), height
and design of each tower. The town may share the information with other
applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use permits under
this subchapter or other organizations seeking to locate towers or antennas
within the jurisdiction of the Town Council, provided however, that the town is
not, by sharing the information, in any way representing or warranting that the
sites are available or suitable.
      (14)   Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current
standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the
federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If, upon
inspection, the Town Council concludes that a tower fails to comply with the
codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon
notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days
to bring the tower into compliance with the standards. If the owner fails to
bring the tower into compliance within the 30 days, the Council may remove the
tower at the expense of the owner and/or landowner.
      (15)   Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural
integrity of towers, the owner of a tower constructed after the effective date
of this subchapter shall ensure that it is constructed and maintained in
compliance with EIA/TIA 222-E Standard, as published by the Electronic
Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the
Town Council concludes that a tower fails to comply with the codes and
standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice
being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring
the tower into compliance with the standards. If the owner fails to bring the
tower into compliance within the 30 days, the Town Council may remove the tower
at the expense of the owner and/or landowner.
      (16)   Public notice. For purposes of this section, any conditional/
special use permit for a tower shall require a 15 day public notice to all
abutting property owners and all owners of property that are located within 500
feet of the perimeter of the parent parcel upon which proposed communication
tower is located. Municipalities within one mile of the proposed site and
owners of private and public airports within a two mile radius of the proposed
site shall also receive notification Failure of a municipality to respond
within 30 days after notification shall be interpreted as no objection.

   (B)   The following uses may be approved in writing by the Town Council or
designee after submission of a complete application, an administrative review
and issuance of an administrative permit:
      (1)   Towers allowed as a permitted use;
      (2)   Installing an antenna on an existing structure other than a tower
(such as a building, light pole, water tower or other freestanding
nonresidential structure) that is 50 feet in height or greater, so long as the
additional antenna adds no more than 40 feet to the height of the originally
approved structure;
      (3)   Installing an antenna on any existing tower of any height,
including the placement of additional equipment buildings or other supporting
equipment used in connection with the antenna, so long as the addition of the
antenna does not add to the height of the originally approved tower;
      (4)   Replacement towers, antenna support structures or tower
modifications meeting the requirements of this section. A communication tower
may be modified or reconstructed to accommodate the collocation of an
additional communication antenna by administrative permit and shall be subject
to the following provisions:
         (a)   The modified or replacement structure shall be either of the
same tower type as the existing communication tower or a monopole tower that is
replacing an existing lattice or guyed tower, as long as the existing height is
exceeded;
         (b)   An existing communication tower may be modified or rebuilt to a
taller height, not to exceed 20 feet over the tower’s original height, to
accommodate the collocation of additional communication antennas; and

§ 157.553 ABANDONMENT OF COMMUNICATION TOWERS.
   (A)   Compelling public interest. The Town Council finds and declares that,
because of the national public policy of ensuring that the wireless industry
and its evolving new technologies are accommodated notwithstanding the
undesirable effects that communication towers may have on the aesthetics of
communities and neighborhoods, there is a compelling public interest in
ensuring that communication towers are promptly disassembled, dismantled and
removed once they are no longer being used. Further, the Town Council finds
that there is substantial risk that towers may cease being used in large
numbers if there is a concentration or consolidation of competitors within the
industry or if even newer technologies arise, obviating the need for towers.
   (B)   Abandonment.
      (1)   In the event the use of any communication tower has been
discontinued for a period of 180 consecutive days, the tower shall be deemed
abandoned. Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the town
planner, who shall have the right to request documentation and/or affidavits
from the communication tower owner/operator regarding the issue of tower usage.
Failure or refusal for any reason by the owner/operator to respond within 20
days to a request shall constitute prima facie evidence that the communication
tower has been abandoned. Upon a determination of abandonment and notice
thereof to the owner/operator, the owner/operator of the tower shall have an
additional 180 days within which to:
         (a)   Reactivate the use of the tower or transfer the tower to another
owner/operator who makes actual use of the tower within the 180 day period; or
         (b)   Dismantle and remove the tower.
      (2)   At the earliest of the 181 days from the date of abandonment
without reactivation or upon completion of dismantling and removal, any
approval for the tower will automatically expire.
   (C)   Duty to remove abandoned towers.
      (1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (B) above, upon
abandonment of a communication tower as determined under division (B) above by
the town planner and the failure or refusal by the owner/operator of the tower
to either reactivate the tower or dismantle and remove it within 180 days as
required by division (B) above, the following persons or entities (the
“responsible parties”) shall have the duty jointly and severally to remove the
abandoned tower:
         (a)   The owner of the abandoned tower (and, if different, the
operator of the abandoned tower);
         (b)   The owner of the land upon which the abandoned tower is located;
         (c)   The lessee, if any, of the land upon which the abandoned tower
is located;
         (d)   The sublessee or sublessee(s), if any, of the land upon which
the abandoned tower is located;
         (e)   Any communication service provider who or which by ceasing to
utilize the tower, or otherwise failing to operate any of its transmitters or
antennas on the tower for which it leased space or purchased the right to space
on the tower for its transmitters or antennas and the ceasing or failure to
utilize the tower in fact caused the tower to become abandoned;
         (f)   Any persons to whom or entity to which there has been
transferred or assigned any license issued by the Federal Communication
Commission and under which the tower owner/operator operated the tower;
         (g)   Any person or entity which has purchased all or a substantial
portion of the assets of the tower owner/operator;
         (h)   Any entity which has merged with, or which has arisen or
resulted from a merger with, the tower owner/operator;
         (i)   Any person or entity which has acquired the owner or the
operator of the abandoned tower;
         (j)   Any parent or subsidiary of any of the foregoing which happens
to be a corporation;
         (k)   Any managing partner of any of the foregoing which happens to be
a limited partnership; and
         (l)   Any partner of any of the foregoing which happens to be a
general partnership.
      (2)   The abandoned tower shall be removed on or before the 90 day after
receipt by the responsible party or parties of a notice from the town planner
ordering its removal. The duty imposed by this division shall supersede and
otherwise override any conflicting provision of any contract, agreement, lease,
sublease, license, franchise or other instrument entered into or issued on or
after January 1, 1999.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 158.001 VACATION RENTALS, AUTHORITY, SCOPE AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   This chapter is enacted under the home rule power of the Town of Palm
Shores in the interest of the health, peace, safety and general welfare. This
chapter may be referred to as the "Town of Palm Shores Vacation Rental Code."
   (B)   Florida Statutes § 509.013 provides a distinction between "transient
public lodging establishments" which are rented, or advertised or held out for
rental to guests more than three times in a calendar year for periods of less
than 30 days or one calendar month, whichever is less; and "nontransient public
lodging establishments" which are rented, or advertised or held out for rental
to guests for periods of at least 30 days or one calendar month, whichever is
less.
   (C)   Florida Statutes § 509.242(1)(c) further provides for a subset of
transient public lodging establishments, called "vacation rental" which is any
unit or group of units in a condominium or cooperative or any individually or
collectively owned single-family, two-family, three-family or four- family
house or dwelling unit that is also a transient public lodging establishment,
but that is not a timeshare project.
   (D)   It is the intent of this chapter to regulate vacation rentals as
defined by Florida Statutes, which are located in residential zoning districts
of the Town of Palm Shores, which collectively are referred to herein as
"vacation rentals."
   (E)   In 2011, the Florida Legislature passed House Bill 883, (Section 2011-
119, Laws of Florida), amending F.S. § 509.032(b) to provide that "[a] local
law, ordinance, or regulation may not restrict the use of vacation rentals,
prohibit vacation rentals, or regulate vacation rentals based solely on their
classification, use or occupancy. This paragraph does not apply to any local
law, ordinance, or regulation adopted on or before June 1, 2011."
   (F)   In 2014, the Florida Legislature passed Senate Bill 356 (Section 2014-
71, Laws of Florida), amending that same statute to read "[a] local law,
ordinance, or regulation may not prohibit vacation rentals, or regulate the
duration of frequency of rental of vacation rentals. This paragraph does not
apply to any local law, ordinance, or regulation adopted on or before June 1,
2011."
   (G)   (1)   The official statement of legislative intent of Senate Bill 356
as reflected in the House of Representatives' Final Bill Analysis, dated June
19, 2014, states that the "Effect of the Bill" is as follows:
         "The bill permits local governments to create regulation that
distinguishes vacation rentals from other residential property. In the past,
local government regulations have included noise, parking, registration, and
signage requirements for vacation rentals.
         The bill does not allow local governments to create regulations that
would prohibit vacation rentals or restrict the duration or frequency of
vacation rentals. These types of regulation remain preempted to the state.
         The grandfather provision in existing law exempting any local law,
ordinance, or regulation adopted on or before June 1, 2011, is maintained. Any
local law, ordinance, or regulation passed before that date that prohibits or
restricts vacation rentals based on the duration or frequency may continue to
be enforced."
      (2)   This ode does not prohibit vacation rentals, or the duration or
frequency of vacation rentals, nor is it the intention of the Town of Palm
Shores to do so, but rather this chapter is intended to address life safety and
compatibility concerns in the interests of the health, peace, safety, and
general welfare.
(Ord. 2019-07, passed 11-19-2019)
§ 158.002 FINDINGS OF FACTS.
   Based on information presented to the town by residents of the town and
owners and operators of vacation rentals, the practical first-hand experience
and observations of Town Council Members, common sense deductions of Town
Council members based on long term experiences in the town, information learned
by Town Council members from various residents, information from the U.S.
Census, as well as evidence and testimony presented at public hearings before
the Town Council, and on the Short-Term Rental Housing Restrictions White
Paper, prepared by Robinson & Cole, Attorneys at Law, in 2011, prepared for the
National Association of Realtors®, the Town Council finds:
   (A)   Residents residing within their residential dwellings are inherently
familiar with the local surroundings, local weather disturbances, local
hurricane evacuation plans, and means of egress from their residential
dwellings, thereby minimizing potential risks to themselves and their families.
   (B)   In contrast, transient occupants of vacation rentals, due to their
transient nature, are typically not familiar with local surroundings, local
weather disturbances, local hurricane evacuation plans, and means of egress
from the vacation rentals in which they are staying, thereby increasing
potential risks to themselves and their families, and putting an additional
burden on, and potentially putting at risk, emergency personnel in the event of
an emergency situation.
   (C)   Vacation rentals, left unregulated, can create negative impacts within
residential neighborhoods due to excessive noise, parking and traffic problems,
excessive use and impact on public services and public works, extreme size and/
or greater occupancy.
   (D)   Vacation rentals situated within residential neighborhoods can disturb
the quiet nature and atmosphere of the residential neighborhoods, and the quiet
enjoyment of its residents.
   (E)   Vacation rentals located within established residential neighborhoods
can create negative compatibility impacts relating to extreme noise levels,
late night activities, on-street parking issues and traffic congestion.
   (F)   A residential dwelling is typically the single largest investment a
family will make, with the residents of the residential dwelling desiring the
tranquility and peaceful enjoyment of their neighborhood without excessive
noise and increased parking issues and traffic congestion caused by transient
occupants of vacation rentals.
   (G)   According to the U.S. Census, (2010) the Town of Palm Shores has an
average household size of 2.27 persons.
   (H)   According to the U.S. Census, (2010) the Town of Palm Shores has an
average family size of 2.91 persons.
   (I)   According to the U.S. Census, (2010) the Town of Palm Shores has an
average household size of owner-occupied units of 2.35 persons.
   (J)   According to the U.S. Census, (2010) the Town of Palm Shores has an
average household size of renter-occupied units of 1.92 persons.
   (K)   Vacation rentals situated in residential zoning district can and do
create a great disparity in occupancy.
   (L)   The town finds that such rentals increase the demands upon code
enforcement, police, fire and emergency services beyond those created by non-
vacation rental residential dwelling units.
   (M)   Vacation rental use and longer term residential use and ownership are
generally incompatible, due to rapid turnover associated with short term
vacation residential use and its disruptive effect on the peaceful use and
enjoyment of residential areas.
   (N)   The primary reasonable investment-backed expectation of owners of
residential dwelling units in the town is the use that is a residence and not a
vacation rental.
   (O)   Vacation rentals is a use that is more in nature, that is best
accommodated by hotels, motels and timeshares; and,
   (P)   The regulation of vacation rentals will contribute to the stability of
existing residential neighborhood.
   (Q)   The regulation of vacation rentals will protect visitors to the town
by assuring that fire and safety inspections are periodically conducted, that
they receive necessary information about the dwelling which they have rented,
and notifying them of the owner of the dwelling's obligation to provide for
their safety and welfare.
   (R)   The regulation of vacation rentals is necessary in order to protect
the public health, safety and welfare of the city, its residents and its
visitors.

functions of a vacation rental owner may, at the option of the vacation rental
owner, be performed by an agent of the vacation rental owner, so long as the

§ 158.027 VESTED RIGHTS/WAIVER/ESTOPPEL.
   A vacation rental registration shall not be construed to establish any
vested rights or entitle the registered vacation rental to any rights under the

   (A)   Every vacation rental owner, or responsible party, as applicable,
shall be available by phone at the listed phone number 24 hours a day, seven
days a week to respond to police, fire or other emergency personnel requests.
Otherwise, response to contact by the town's regulatory personnel shall be
required only Monday through Thursday 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. and Friday 9:00
a.m. to 3:00 p.m., except holidays. Failure of the vacation rental owner, or
responsible party, as applicable, to fulfill this duty, shall be a violation of
this chapter which shall be punished by fine.
   (B)   Responsible party. All vacation rental units, if not managed by the
vacation rental owner, shall have a designated responsible party.
      (1)   The responsible party shall be available 24 hours per day, seven
days a week, for the purpose of promptly responding to complaints regarding
conduct or behavior of vacation rental occupants or alleged violations of these
regulations. This party must have authority to immediately address and take
affirmative action, within one hour of notice from the town, on violations
concerning life-safety, noise, and parking violations. A record shall be kept
by the town of the complaint and the responsible party's response, as
applicable.
      (2)   An owner may change his or her designation of a responsible party
temporarily, up to 30 cumulative days during any consecutive 12-month period,
or permanently; however, there shall only be one designated responsible party
for each vacation rental property at any given time.
      (3)   It shall be the sole responsibility of the property owner to
appoint a reliable responsible party and to inform the manager of his or her
correct mailing address. Failure to do so shall not be a defense to a violation
of this chapter. Service of notice on the responsible party shall be deemed
service of notice on the property owner, tenant and violator.
   (C)   (1)   A vacation rental owner or responsible party is responsible for
ensuring sexual offenders/predators as defined in F.S. §§ 775.21, 943.0435,
944.607 or 985.4815 register at the Brevard County Sheriff's Office 48 hours
prior to arrival at a vacation rental, regardless of the length of stay.
      (2)   A vacation rental owner and/or responsible party shall comply with
Florida law, pertaining to the distance separation of homes with a sexual
offender/predator residing within the vacation rental and any business, school,
child care facility, park, playground, or other places where children regularly
congregate.
      (3)   Failure to comply with this chapter shall result in the revocation
of the Business Tax Receipt, if applicable, and vacation rental registration
for the vacation rental and other enforcement provisions outlined in the Town
Code.
   (D)   The vacation rental owner or responsible party shall inquire at check-
in if any guest at the vacation rental is a sexual offender/predator as defined
in F.S. §§ 775.21, 943.0435, 944.607 or 985.4815. If any guest of a vacation
rental public lodging is a sexual offender/predator as defined in F.S. §§
775.21, 943.0435, 944,607 or 985.4815, the operator shall immediately notify
the town and the Brevard County Sheriff's Office.
   (E)   The owner or responsible party shall provide the town and post in a
conspicuous place in the premises, the name, address and day/evening telephone
numbers of the responsible party and be available 24 hours per day, seven days
a week for the purpose of promptly responding to complaints regarding conduct
or behavior of vacation rental occupants or alleged violations of these
regulations. Any change in the responsible party shall require written
notification to the town on forms provided by the town and in a manner
promulgated by the town upon payment of the applicable fees.
   (F)   Complaints to the responsible party concerning violations by occupants
of vacation rental units to this code shall be responded to within a reasonable
time but in no instance greater than three hours. A record shall be kept of the
complaint and the manager's response for a period of at least three months
after the incident, which shall be available for inspection by the town during
business hours.
   (G)   An owner may change his or her designation of a responsible party;
however, there shall only be one responsible party for each vacation rental
property at any given time. To change the designated agent or responsible
party, the owner shall notify the town in writing of the name, contact
information and other information required in this section for the new vacation
rental manager, along with a signed affidavit from the new agent or responsible
party acknowledging and agreeing to serve in this capacity and perform the
duties of this code. Any notice of violation or legal process which has been
delivered or served upon the previous vacation rental manager, prior to the
town's receipt of notice of change of the vacation rental manager, shall be
deemed effective service.
   (H)   It shall be the sole responsibility of the property owner to appoint a
reliable responsible party and to inform the responsible party of his or her
correct mailing address. Failure to do so shall not be a defense to a violation
of this chapter. No property owner shall designate as a responsible party any
person who does not expressly comply with the provisions of this chapter. The
property owner or the responsible party shall be deemed to be the "violator" of
this chapter as the term is used in F.S. § 162.06. Service of notice on the
responsible party shall be deemed service of notice on the property owner,
tenant and violator. Copies of all notices shall also be provided to the
property owner.

§ 158.042 MAXIMUM OCCUPANCY BASED ON SITE CAPACITY/LIMITATIONS/ GRANDFATHERING.
   (A)   The maximum occupancy of a vacation rental shall be stated in the
vacation rental registration form, and shall be limited to two occupants (as
defined herein) per bedroom (as defined herein) plus two occupants, with a
maximum capacity of 12 persons.
   (B)   The maximum occupancy restriction as set forth above shall not apply
when the property is owner occupied by the vacation rental owner.
   (C)   Notwithstanding the above, a vacation rental that was used as a
vacation rental as of the effective date of this chapter, may apply for the
status of grandfathered for a period of ten years, as to occupancy limitations,
and may cap its occupancy based upon the following criteria and procedures.
Vacation rentals that have an occupancy of 12 or less as determined according
to § 158.030(A) above will not require grandfathering to maintain that
occupancy.
      (1)   A grandfathered vacation rental shall have its maximum occupancy
based upon two persons per bedroom (each bedroom must meet the definition of
bedroom herein) at the time of application for grandfather status. A change in
the number of bedrooms at the vacation rental shall cause such vacation rental
to lose its grandfathered status.
      (2)   The vacation rental owner, or agent, as applicable,
("grandfathering applicant"), shall complete a grandfathering application as
prescribed by the town, which shall be submitted under oath and upon penalty of
perjury, and provide verifiable written proof of the number of bedrooms as
herein defined in the vacation rental.
      (3)   The grandfathering application and supporting proof shall be
submitted to the town for review by town staff, and such staff shall make a
written determination as to the maximum occupancy of such grandfathered
vacation rental.
      (4)   If the town staff fails to confirm the requested occupancy level,
the Town of Palm Shores shall notify the grandfather applicant of that fact,
and the occupancy level that can be approved, in writing. Within 20 days after
such notice, an evidentiary hearing may be requested by the grandfather
applicant before the Special Magistrate to provide the grandfather applicant an
opportunity to provide evidence and/or testimony in support of the occupancy
requested. A determination by the Special Magistrate after such evidentiary
hearing shall be final. If no hearing is requested during that time period, the
occupancy level shall be set at the level determined by the town staff upon
initial review.
      (5)   An application for grandfathering shall be submitted, if at all,
but no later than the time of registration of the vacation rental, but not
later than January 1, 2020, along with fees established by the Town Council by
resolution. If the town extends the date that registration is required, the
deadline for the application for grandfathering shall also be extended to the
same extended date. If a vacation rental has been registered, but a final
determination as to the occupancy level based upon grandfathering has not yet
been made, such vacation rental may allow occupancy up to the occupancy
requested in the grandfathering application until such time as a final
determination as to occupancy has been made.
      (6)   If it is reasonably determined by the town staff that any
information supplied to the Town of Palm Shores in support of an application
for grandfathering was intentionally false or fraudulent, the person supplying
the false or fraudulent information shall be subject to a fine. If there is
such a determination by town staff, the Town of Palm Shores shall notify the
grandfather applicant of that fact, and within 20 days after such notice, an
evidentiary hearing may be requested by the grandfather applicant before the
Special Magistrate to provide the grandfather applicant an opportunity to
provide evidence and/or testimony to show that the information supplied in
support of the application for grandfathering was not intentionally false or
fraudulent. The determination by the Special Magistrate after such evidentiary
hearing shall be final. If no hearing is requested during that time period, the
initial determination by the town staff shall be final.
      (7)   If a vacation rental registration does not exist as to a vacation
rental for a period in excess of 13 months, any grandfathering determination
shall be deemed abandoned, and shall no longer be applicable to that vacation
rental.
