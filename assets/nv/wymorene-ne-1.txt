Article 1. Elected Officials
§ 1-101   CITY MAYOR; SELECTION AND DUTIES.
The Mayor of the Municipality shall have the general, and immediate control
over all property, and officials, whether elected, or appointed, of the
Municipality. He shall preside at all meetings of the City Council, and may
vote when his vote shall be decisive and the Council is equally divided on any
pending matter, legislation, or transaction and the Mayor shall, for the
purpose of such vote, be deemed to be a member of the Council. His signature
must appear on the Municipal Clerk's minutes of all meetings, and he must sign
all resolutions which have been passed, and warrants for the payment of money
when ordered by the City Council; Provided, any ordinance vetoed by the Mayor
may be passed over his veto by a two-thirds (2/3) vote by the members of the
City Council, but if the Mayor neglects or refuses to sign any ordinance, and
returns it to the Council with his objections in writing at the next regular
Council meeting, the same shall become a law without his signature. He shall
from time to time communicate to the Council such information and
recommendations as, in his opinion, may improve the Municipality. He may
require at reasonable intervals any Municipal official to exhibit his accounts
and make reports to the Council on any subject pertaining to his office. He
shall have the power to remit fines or pardon any offense arising under the
ordinances of the Municipality. He may remove at any time an appointed police
officer of the Municipality. His territorial authority shall extend over all
places within five (5) miles of the corporate limits of the Municipality for
the enforcement of any health ordinance, and one half (1/2) mile in all matters
vested in him except taxation. He shall also have such other duties as the City
Council may by resolution confer upon him, or in any other matters which the
laws of the State of Nebraska repose in him. He shall be elected at the
Municipal Election, and shall serve a four (4) year term of office. Any
candidate for Mayor must have resided within the Municipality for forty (40)
days prior to filing for the said office and must in addition be a qualified
taxpayer. (Ref. 17-115, 17-116 RS Neb.)(Amended by Ord. Nos. 272, 4/27/77; 324,

§ 1-102   CITY COUNCIL; ACTING PRESIDENT.
The City Council shall elect one (1) of its own body each year who shall be
styled the President of the Council, and who shall preside at all meetings of
the City Council in the absence of the Mayor. In the absence of the Mayor, and
the President of the Council, the City Council shall elect one (1) of its own
body to occupy his place temporarily, who shall be styled Acting President of
the Council. Both the President of the Council and the Acting President of the
Council, when occupying the position of the Mayor, shall have the same
privileges as the other members of the City Council, and all acts of the
President of the Council, or Acting President of the Council, while so acting,
shall be as binding upon the City Council, and upon the Municipality as if done
by the elected Mayor. (Ref. 17-148 RS Neb.)
§ 1-103   CITY COUNCIL; SELECTION AND DUTIES.

the members of the City Council holding over, shall assemble in a regular
meeting at the hour and place hereinafter prescribed and perfect the
reorganization of the City Council as herein provided, and all appointive
offices in which the terms of incumbents are expired shall be filled by
appointment. After the said meeting has been called to order, the Municipal
Clerk shall report to the City Council the names of all City Councilmen-elect
who have qualified for their respective offices, and this report shall be
spread upon the minutes of the meeting preceding the roll call. Each ward of
the Municipality shall be represented by at least two (2) Councilmen. No person
shall be eligible who is not at the time of his election an actual resident of
the ward for which he is qualified and should any City Councilman move from the
ward from which he was elected, his office shall thereby become vacant. (Ref.
17-107 RS Neb.) (Amended by Ord. No. 273, 4/27/77)
§ 1-105   ELECTED OFFICIALS; VACANCY.
Whenever a vacancy occurs in an elected office of the Municipality, except

at a regular meeting and said notice shall appear as a part of the minutes of
such meeting.
   The City Council shall at once give public notice of the vacancy by causing
to be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the Municipality
or by posting in three (3) public places in the Municipality the office vacated
and the length of the unexpired term.
   The Mayor shall within two (2) weeks after the regular meeting at which such
notice has been presented, or upon the death of the incumbent, call a special
meeting of the City Council at which time the Mayor shall submit the name of a
qualified elector to fill the vacancy for the balance of the unexpired term.
   No officer who is removed at a recall election or resigns after the
initiation of the recall process shall be appointed to fill the vacancy
resulting from his or her removal or the removal of any other member of the
Governing Body during the remainder of his or her term of office.
   Upon a majority vote of approval by the City Council the vacancy shall be
filled. If a majority vote is not reached the nomination shall be rejected and
the Mayor shall at the next regular meeting submit the name of another
qualified elector. If the vote on the nominee fails to carry by majority vote,
the Mayor shall continue at such meeting to submit the names of qualified
electors and the City Council shall continue to vote upon such nominations
until the vacancy is filled.
   The Mayor shall cast his vote only in case of a tie vote of the City
Council.
   All City Council members shall cast a ballot for or against each nominee.
   The Mayor and Council may, in lieu of filling a vacancy in a City office as
provided above in this Section, call a special Municipal Election to fill such
vacancy.
   If there is a vacancy in the offices of a majority of the members of the
City Council, there shall be a special Municipal Election conducted by the
Secretary of State to fill such vacancies. (Ref. 32-4,152, 32-1406 RS Neb.)

temporary absence, until the Mayor returns.
   When the successful candidate for Mayor shall be prevented from assuming
office, the incumbent Mayor shall not be entitled to hold over the term, but
such office shall automatically become vacant and the President of the Council
shall exercise the office of Mayor until such vacancy is filled.
   If the President of the Council shall for any cause assume the office of
Mayor for the remainder of the unexpired term, there shall be a vacancy on the
Council which shall be filled as provided in Section 1-105. (Ref. 17-107, 17-

be executed by the principal named in such bonds and by at least two (2)
sufficient sureties who shall be freeholders of the county, or by the official
as principal and by a guaranty, surety, fidelity, or bonding company; Provided
no Municipal official, while still in his official term of office, shall be
accepted as surety on any other official's bond, contractor's bond, license
bond, or appeal bond under any circumstances. Only companies that are legally
authorized to transact business in the State of Nebraska shall be eligible for
suretyship on the bond of an official of the Municipality. All said bonds shall
obligate the principal, and sureties for the faithful discharge of all duties
required by law of such principal, and shall inure to the benefit of the

of such bonds. No bond shall be deemed to be given or complete until the
approval of the Governing Body, and all sureties are endorsed in writing on the
said instrument by the Mayor and Municipal Clerk pursuant to the said approval
of the Governing Body. The premium on any official bond required to be given
may be paid out of the General Fund, or other proper Municipal fund, upon a

officer may give a new bond or additional sureties as directed. In the event
that the officer should fail, refuse, or neglect to give a new bond, or
additional sureties to the satisfaction, and approval of the Governing Body
then the office shall, by such failure, refusal, or neglect, become vacant, and
it shall be the duty of the Governing Body to appoint a competent, and
qualified person to fill the said office. Any official who is re-elected to
office shall be required to file a new bond after each election. All officials
required to be bonded, must be bonded within ten (10) days following their
election or appointment, and failure to be so bonded shall create a vacancy in
the office to which such person has been elected or appointed. (Ref. 11-103

§ 1-504   MEETINGS; CLOSED SESSIONS.
(1) Any public body may hold a closed session by the affirmative vote of a
majority of its voting members if a closed session is clearly necessary for the
protection of the public interest or for the prevention of needless injury to
the reputation of an individual and if such individual has not requested a
public meeting. Closed sessions may be held for, but shall not be limited to,
such reasons as:
(a)   Strategy sessions with respect to collective bargaining, real estate
purchases, pending litigation or litigation which is imminent as evidenced by
communication of a claim or threat of litigation to or by the public body;
(b)   Discussion regarding deployment of security personnel or devices;
(c)   Investigative proceedings regarding allegations of criminal misconduct;

   (2) The vote to hold a closed session shall be taken in open session. The
vote of each member on the question of holding a closed session, the reason for
the closed session, and the time when the closed session commenced and
concluded shall be recorded in the minutes. The public body holding such a
closed session shall restrict its consideration to matters during the closed
portions to only those purposes set forth in the minutes as the reason for the
closed session. The meeting shall be reconvened in open session before any
formal action may be taken. For purposes of this section, formal action shall
mean a collective decision or a collective commitment or promise to make a
decision on any question, motion, proposal, resolution, order, or ordinance or

given by members of the public body to legal counsel or other negotiators in
closed sessions authorized under subdivision (a) of this section.
   (3) Any member of the public body shall have the right to challenge the
continuation of a closed session if the member determines that the session has
exceeded the reason stated in the original motion to hold a closed session or
if the member contends that the closed session is neither clearly necessary for
(a) the protection of the public interest or (b) the prevention of needless
injury to the reputation of an individual. Such challenge shall be overruled
only by a majority vote of the members of the public body. Such challenge and
its disposition shall be recorded in the minutes.
   (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require that any meeting
be closed to the public. No person or public body shall fail to invite a
portion of its members to a meeting and no public body shall designate itself a
subcommittee of the whole body for the purpose of circumventing the provisions
of this Article. No closed session, informal meeting, chance meeting, social
gathering, or electronic communication shall be used for the purpose of
circumventing the provisions of this Article.
   (5) The provisions of this Article shall not apply to chance meetings, or to
attendance at or travel to conventions or workshops of members of a public body
at which there is no meeting of the body then intentionally convened and there
is no vote or other action taken regarding any matter over which the public
body has supervision, control, jurisdiction, or advisory power. (Ref. 84-1410

   It shall not be a violation of this section for any public body to make and
enforce reasonable rules and regulations regarding the conduct of persons
attending, speaking at, videotaping, televising, photographing, broadcasting,
or recording its meetings. A body may not be required to allow citizens to
speak at each meeting, but it may not forbid public participation at all
meetings. No public body shall require members of the public to identify
themselves as a condition for admission to the meeting. The body may require
any member of the public desiring to address the body to identify himself or
herself. No public body shall for the purpose of circumventing the provisions
of this Article hold a meeting in a place known by the body to be too small to
accommodate the anticipated audience. No public body shall be deemed in
violation of this section if it holds its meeting in its traditional meeting
place which is located in this State. No public body shall hold a meeting
outside the State of Nebraska. The public body shall, upon request, make a
reasonable effort to accommodate the public's right to hear the discussion and
testimony presented at the meeting. Public bodies shall make available at the
meeting, for examination and copying by members of the public, at least one (1)
copy of all reproducible written material to be discussed at an open meeting.

exceeds the estimated cost of the project, the Governing Body shall have the
authority to negotiate a contract for services, material, or labor in an
attempt to complete the proposed project at a cost commensurate with the
estimated given.

cost can be estimated until the materials have been manufactured or assembled
to the specific qualifications of the purchasing Municipality, the Governing
Body or Board of Public Works, may authorize the manufacture and assemblage of
such materials and may thereafter approve the estimated cost expenditure when

amount of additional tax to be levied. The Governing Body may then issue
warrants in payment for expenditures authorized by the adopted supplemental

in any fund required to meet depreciation, repairs, or betterments remaining
unexpended, shall ever be reappropriated. In the event that no reappropriation

next general Municipal election. The resolution shall set forth the
improvement, the estimated cost, the amount of the annual levy, the number of
years required to provide the required revenue, the name of the sinking fund
proposed, and the proposition as it will appear on the ballot. Notice of the
said proposition shall be published in its entirety three (3) times on

election if a majority, or more of the legal votes were in favor of the
establishment of the fund. The Governing Body may then proceed to establish the

State law. The funds received by the Municipal Treasurer shall, as they
accumulate, be immediately invested with the written approval of the Governing
Body in the manner provided by State law. No sinking fund so established shall

prevented upon presentation of a duly licensed physician's certificate which
shall certify that the domestic subscriber or resident within such subscriber's
household has an existing illness or handicap which would cause such subscriber
or resident to suffer an immediate and serious health hazard by the
disconnection of the Municipality's service to that household. Such certificate
shall be filed with the Municipal Clerk's office within five (5) days of
receiving notice under this section and will prevent the disconnection of the
Municipality's service for a period thirty (30) days from such filing.

      (h)   The cost that will be borne by the domestic subscriber for

subscriber has been afforded his or her rights. Failure of the domestic
subscriber to attend a scheduled conference shall relieve the Municipality of
any further action prior to the discontinuance of service. If a domestic

demonstrates that failure to attend is for a legitimate reason, the
Municipality shall make a reasonable effort to reschedule the conference.
   (3)   The employee of the Municipality shall, based solely on the evidence
presented at the conference, affirm, reverse, or modify any decision by the

loss is susceptible of reasonable calculation; or
      (b)   Liquidated damages of:
         1.   Until July 1, 1985, five hundred ($500.00) dollars and

equipment, costs of the suit, and reasonable attorneys' fees in cases within
the scope of section 25-1801 RS Neb.
   (5)   There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a tenant or occupant at
any premises where bypassing, tampering or unauthorized metering is proven to
exist caused or had knowledge of such bypassing, tampering, or unauthorized
metering if the tenant or occupant:
      (a)   Had access to the part of the utility supply system on the premises
where the bypassing, tampering, or unauthorized metering is proven to exist;
and
      (b)   Was responsible or partially responsible for payment, either

was proven to exist.

supplemental and additional to powers conferred by existing laws and the

Deposit Fund", which is in the nature of a trust fund.
   (2)   If a consumer discontinues service, fails to pay his or her final
bill, and the utility service deposit is insufficient to cover the final bill,
the Municipality, after attempts to collect the past due amount, may turn the
past due amount over to a collection agency for collection. If a past consumer
who has an unpaid past due amount requests a new account for water, electric,

service deposit in the amount of $500.00 for residential consumers and
$1,000.00 for commercial consumers. The Municipal Clerk shall follow the same
procedures contained in subsection (1) of this section with respect to
receipting for the service deposit and the depositing of funds.
   (3)   When for any reason, utility services are no longer required or
needed, said utility service deposit shall, upon demand, be returned to said

should fail to give such notice, he shall be charged for all electricity used
on the said premise until the Superintendent is otherwise advised of such
circumstances. The rules, regulations, and rates for electric service named in
this Article, shall be deemed and considered a part of every contract between

property or may interfere with the work of the Fire Department. The Chief of
the Fire Department or person in charge at times of fire, as well as said
Electrical Inspector, or either of them, shall have power at once to cause the
removal of all wires, or the turning off of all electric current where the
circuits interfere with the work of the Fire Department during the progress of
fire.
§ 3-1114   MUNICIPAL ELECTRIC SYSTEM; INSPECTIONS.
Whenever, in the judgment of the Electrical Inspector, any electric wire or
appliance shall be defective by reason of improper or insufficient insulation,
or for any other cause, the Electrical Inspector shall at once notify the owner
thereof of such defect and order him to repair, rearrange, or remove the same,
and upon the owner's failure or refusal to do so, he shall be deemed guilty of
a misdemeanor. Each day which shall elapse after the expiration of a ten (10)
day period of grace shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense.
§ 3-1115   MUNICIPAL ELECTRIC SYSTEM; APPEALS.

petition, duly verified, setting forth the facts relating to such disputed
ruling or order. The Governing Body at any regular or special meeting, after
the filing of said petition, shall conduct an open hearing with reference to
said matter, at the conclusion of said hearing, shall enter an order either
reversing or annulling the order or ruling of said Inspector or affirming the
same. The decision of the Governing Body in said matter shall be final. If the
order or ruling of the Electrical Inspector is reversed, the Governing Body
shall make such order as it may deem necessary, which order shall have the same
force and effect as if made by the Electrical Inspector in the first instance,
and if the order or ruling of the Electrical Inspector be affirmed, the same
shall be enforced in the same manner and with like effect as if no such hearing
had been held.

   (4) Not later than thirty days following the adjournment of the meeting at
which the hearing was held, the City Council shall vote to uphold, reverse, or
modify the disciplinary action, suspension, demotion, removal, or discharge.
The failure of the City Council to act within thirty days or the failure of a
majority of the elected Councilmembers to vote to reverse or modify the
disciplinary action, suspension, demotion, removal, or discharge shall be
construed as a vote to uphold the disciplinary action, suspension, demotion,
removal, or discharge. The decision of the City Council shall be based upon its
determination that, under the facts and evidence presented at the hearing, the
challenged disciplinary action, suspension, demotion, removal, or discharge was
necessary for the proper management and the effective operation of the Police
Department in the performance of its duties under the state statutes.
   (5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the preemptory
suspension or immediate removal from duty of an officer, pending the hearing

§ 8-101   MUNICIPAL PROPERTY; OBSTRUCTIONS.
It shall be unlawful for any person to place in or upon any street, alley, or
sidewalk any substance or thing obstructing or encroaching upon such street,
alley, or sidewalk, or to injure, break, or destroy any sidewalk or crossing,
or to dig, excavate or remove from any street, alley, or any public grounds any
earth or sod, or to obstruct the same in any manner whatever, without first
procuring from the Governing Body express authority therefor, which authority

Section shall not be construed to prohibit or prevent a reasonable use of so
much of said sidewalks adjoining business lots by the owners or occupants
thereof, as may be necessary to display their goods, wares, or merchandise, but
not exceeding a space of three (3) feet wide on the inner side of said
sidewalk. Any person violating any of the provisions of this Section shall be
required to remove anything so deposited or to fill up any excavation made in
or upon any street, sidewalk, gutter, or alley when notified in writing by the
Superintendent of Streets to do so, and upon failure of such person to make
such removal or fill up such excavation within six (6) hours after notice has
been served upon him, the Superintendent shall have the same done. He is hereby
authorized to enter upon any premise and all expenses incurred in said removal
or filling up shall be borne by the party so violating the provisions of this
Section.
In case of the failure or refusal of such person to pay such expenses to the

for the said removal or filling up, and costs of suit, shall be recovered in an
action in the name of the Municipality.
§ 8-102   MUNICIPAL PROPERTY; MARKING.

§ 8-103   MUNICIPAL PROPERTY; UNLAWFUL CUTTING.
It shall be unlawful for any person to cut into any paving, curb, or sidewalk

the Superintendent of Streets of the place where such cutting is to be done and
it shall be the Superintendent's duty to make an inspection of the place of
construction before the same is cut. When cutting into any paving, it shall be
the duty of the party so cutting to make the same in such a way and in the
manner, and under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the
Superintendent of Streets. When the applicant is ready to close the excavation,
he shall inform the Superintendent who shall inspect the materials used and the
work done in closing said opening. It shall be discretionary with the Governing
Body to do said work and charge the cost thereof to the party who obtained the
permit or the Governing Body may consent to the same being done by the party
holding the permit. Before any permit is issued by the Governing Body, the
applicant for such permit shall deposit with the Municipal Treasurer a sum set
by resolution of the Governing Body for each square foot of paving, curb, or
sidewalk to be cut. Such deposit shall be retained by the Municipality for the
purpose of replacing said pavement, curb, or sidewalk in case said work is done
by the Municipality. In case the Municipality elects to require the applicant
to replace said paving, curb, or sidewalk, the deposit shall be retained by the
Municipality until the work is completed to the satisfaction of the
Superintendent of Streets. In addition to making the deposit above set forth,
the applicant, before any permit is issued, shall execute a bond to the
Municipality to be approved by the Governing Body in a sum set by resolution of
the Governing Body, conditioned as follows:

done by the Municipality in replacing or repairing any places cut in pavement,

to injure or deface any sidewalk space so planted or cultivated. It is hereby
made the duty of the Superintendent of Streets to view and inspect any and all
lots and parcels of land within the Municipality, at least one (1) time in each
month during the growing season, and if he shall find any violation of this

§ 8-106   MUNICIPAL PROPERTY; BILLBOARDS.
It shall be unlawful for any person to construct or maintain any billboard or
similar structure upon any of the public ways and property. It shall be
unlawful for any person to erect a billboard or similar structure on private
property if it will in any manner prevent the free use of all the streets,
sidewalks, or alleys, or would obstruct the view of or from any resident in the
Municipality. Before any person shall be allowed to erect a billboard or sign
along any street, avenue, or alley, or adjacent thereof, he shall secure a
permit from the Governing Body to erect the said billboard or sign, and the
billboard shall be built under the supervision of the Superintendent of
Streets. Whenever any billboard, for any reason, becomes a nuisance or a menace

set aside for the use of pedestrians, it shall be the duty of the Governing
Body to declare it a nuisance and cause the person owning the same to remove
it, and upon his refusal or neglect to comply with the said order within the

§ 8-107   MUNICIPAL PROPERTY; UTILITY APPURTENANCES.

Streets and permission in writing shall have been given by the Municipal Clerk
pursuant to a valid agreement with that public service company entered into by
the Governing Body. Public service companies granted right-of-way for the
erection of poles, conduits, gas mains, pipe lines, wires, and all
appurtenances thereto shall at all times, when requested by the Governing Body,
erect, locate, or relocate their pipes, poles, wires, mains, and other
appurtenances to such places and in such manner as may be designated by the
Governing Body. All such removals or relocations by the companies shall be done
at their own expense when requested to do so by the Governing Body. Whenever it
becomes necessary for the Municipality to use the ground where the poles,
wires, mains, pipe lines, and other appurtenances are located, or whenever
reasonable means of ingress or egress to private or public property, or the
public safety and convenience requires relocation, the Governing Body shall so
order by resolution and the Superintendent of Streets shall notify the said
company or companies, or their agents within the Municipality, and the said
companies shall, within twenty-four (24) hours after receiving such notice
cause said removal and relocation. The Governing Body shall designate a place
as close as possible where the poles, wires, mains, pipe lines, or other
appurtenances may be reset or replaced. All removals and relocations shall be
made to places where the said appurtenances will not interfere with any public
utility, building, or the travel across or upon the public ways and property.

be confined as much as possible to the alleys in the Municipality.
§ 8-108   MUNICIPAL PROPERTY; PERMITTED OBSTRUCTIONS.
Persons engaged in the erection, construction, reconstruction, wrecking, or

Superintendent of Streets, to do so; provided, no permit for the occupancy of
the sidewalk space, and more than one-third (1/3) of the roadway of the public
space adjacent to the real estate on which said building is to be constructed,

further, a suitable passageway for pedestrians shall be maintained within the
public space included in the permit which shall be protected and lighted in the
manner required by the Superintendent of Streets.
§ 8-109   MUNICIPAL PROPERTY; SIGNS AND CANOPIES.
No person, firm, or corporation shall erect, or maintain, any sign, signboard,
poster, or rigid canopy over any street, sidewalk, alley, or on other public
property without having first obtained a permit therefor; provided, that
nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the owner of any building from
constructing a substantial awning or marquee of noncombustible material
supported without posts over the sidewalk space if located flush with the outer
edge thereof and if a building permit shall have first been secured for the
construction of the same. Permits for signs, canopies, posters, and signboards
shall be issued by the Municipal Clerk, subject to the approval of the
Superintendent of Streets. Applicants shall file in the office of the Clerk a
written application giving full information as to size, weight, and character
of the sign or awning and the distance it will project outside the lot line,

then refer the application to the Superintendent of Streets who, upon giving
his approval, shall refer the application to the Governing Body. All awnings
shall be elevated at least six and one-half feet at their lowest part from the
top of the public sidewalk and shall not project over the sidewalk to exceed
three-fourths of the width thereof. All signs and canopies extending over any
public sidewalk, street, alley, or other public place must be securely fastened
and constructed so that there will be no danger of the same being dislodged by
ordinary winds, or falling from other causes. No sign or canopy shall be
erected or maintained which extends over any public sidewalk, street, alley, or
other public place in such a location as to obstruct the view of any traffic
light, sign, or signal. All signs and awnings shall be periodically inspected
under the direction of the Superintendent of Streets, and if it appears that
any said sign or awning is unsecure or unsafe, the Superintendent shall order,
in writing or otherwise, the property owner or person in charge of the property
to make it safe. Upon the written order of the Governing Body, any person
owning or occupying the premise where such a sign, canopy, poster, or signboard
is located, shall cause the same to be removed within the time limit specified
on such notice.
§ 8-110   MUNICIPAL PROPERTY; REMOVAL OF UNLAWFUL SIGNS AND CANOPIES.
Every sign or canopy erected or maintained in conflict with the provisions of
this Article is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and shall be removed by
the Superintendent of Streets or any Police Officer by order of said
Superintendent of Streets at the expense of the owner of the building, or his
agent or tenant, to which said sign is attached or at the expense of either of
them, after notice in writing to them or either of them to remove such sign,
shall have been given. All commercial signs where the owner or lessee have
moved or is out of business, and any such signs which has become dead or
valueless for advertising purposes are hereby declared to be public nuisances
and shall be removed as hereinbefore provided.

equal in number to thirty percent (30%) of the electors of the Municipality
voting at the last regular Municipal election held therein, be filed with the
Governing Body of such Municipality, within thirty (30) days after the third
(3rd) publication of the notice, such property shall not then, nor within one
(1) year thereafter, be sold; and provided further, that real estate now owned

the State of Nebraska or to the Nebraska Armory Board for state armory sites
or, if acquired for state armory sites, such property shall be conveyed
strictly in accordance with the conditions of sections 18-1001 to 18-1006 RS

   This section shall not apply to the sale of personal property if the
authorizing resolution directs the sale of an item or items of personal
property the total fair market value of which is less than one thousand dollars

as provided by law. In the event the property owner is a non-resident of the
County in which the property lies, the Municipality shall, before levying any
special assessment against that property, send a copy of any notice required by
law to be published by means of certified mail, return receipt requested to the
last known address of the non-resident property owner. The last known address
shall be that address listed on the current tax rolls at the time such required
notice was first published. (Amended by Ord. No. 311, 10/3/79)
§ 8-218   SIDEWALKS; CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS.
All sidewalks shall be constructed of such materials and in conformity with
such specifications as are adopted by the Governing Body. The Superintendent of
