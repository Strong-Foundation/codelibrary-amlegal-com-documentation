The purpose of this chapter is to enact the legislative intent of Nevada
Revised Statutes chapter 749 and the creation of a special category of real
property for tax purposes to be defined as "open space real property". Persons
whose property fits within the definition of open space use, and otherwise
meets the requirements of this chapter, may secure reduced property tax
assessments on such land during the period of time that such use is continued.

real property including a contract vendee of a land sales contract respecting
such property.
   POTENTIAL USE: Open space real property higher than open space use,

1975)
3.04.030: CRITERIA TO BE MET TO OBTAIN OPEN SPACE ASSESSMENT:

      3.   Recreational;
      4.   U.S. forest/recreational;

defined by the U.S. environmental protection agency be eligible for
designation;
   F.   That sites containing unusual or endangered species of plants as

properties, walkways to public recreation or historic sites, access ways for
fishermen, access ways to BLM lands, etc.);
   H.   That areas in Mineral County which, if preserved, would further the

3.08.010: DEFINITIONS; CONSTRUCTION:
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this

be, of the retail sales of retailers, valued in money, whether received in
money or otherwise, without any deduction on account of any of the following:
      1.   The cost of the property sold; however, in accordance with such
rules and regulations as the tax commission may prescribe, a deduction may be
taken if the retailer has purchased property for some other purpose than
resale, has reimbursed his vendor for tax which the vendor is required to pay
to the county or has paid the use tax with respect to the property, and has
resold the property prior to making any use of the property other than
retention, demonstration or display while holding it for sale in the regular
course of business; if such a deduction is taken by the retailer, no refund or
credit will be allowed to his vendor with respect to the sale of the property;
      2.   The cost of the materials used, labor or service cost, interest
paid, losses or any other expense;
      3.   The cost of transportation of the property prior to its sale to the

      3.   The price received for labor or services used in installing or
applying the property sold;
      4.   The amount of any tax (not including, however, any manufacturers' or
importers' excise tax) imposed by the United States upon or with respect to

   D.   For purposes of the sales tax, if the retailers establish to the
satisfaction of the tax commission that the sales tax has been added to the

person who makes the sale unless he takes from the purchaser a certificate to
the effect that the property is purchased for resale. (MC Ord. 39A, §30, 1971)
3.08.070: EFFECT OF RESALE CERTIFICATE:
The certificate relieves the seller from the burden of proof only if taken in
good faith from a person who is engaged in the business of selling tangible
personal property and who holds the permit provided for in sections
3.08.035 to
3.08.090, inclusive, of this chapter and who, at the time of purchasing the
tangible personal property, intends to sell it in the regular course of

commission may prescribe. (MC Ord. 39A §32, 1971)
3.08.080: LIABILITY OF PURCHASER GIVING RESALE CERTIFICATE:

retention, demonstration or display while holding it for sale in the regular
course of business, the use shall be taxable to the purchaser as of the time
the property is first used by him, and the sales price of the property to him
shall be deemed the measure of the tax. Only when there is an unsatisfied use
tax liability on this basis shall the seller be liable for sales tax with
respect to the sale of the property to the purchaser. If the sole use of the
property other than retention, demonstration or display in the regular course
of business is the rental of the property while holding it for sale, the

goods shall be deemed to be sales of the goods so purchased until a quantity of
commingled goods equal to the quantity of purchased goods so commingled has
been sold. (MC Ord. 39A, §35, 1971)
III. USE TAX

becomes taxable, collect the tax from the purchaser and give to the purchaser a
receipt therefor in the manner and form prescribed by the tax commission. (MC
Ord. 39A §38, 1971)
3.08.110: TAX AS DEBT TO COUNTY:
The tax required to be collected by the retailer constitutes a debt owed by the
retailer to the county. (MC Ord. 39A §39, 1971)

For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter and to prevent
evasion of the use tax and the duty to collect the use tax, it shall be
presumed that tangible personal property sold by any person for delivery in

the contrary is established. The burden of proving the contrary is upon the
person who makes the sale unless he takes from the purchaser a certificate to
the effect that the property is purchased for resale. (MC Ord. 39A §44, 1971)
3.08.140: EFFECT OF RESALE CERTIFICATE:

property is first so stored or used. If the sole use of the property, other
than retention, demonstration or display in the regular course of business, is
the rental of the property while holding it for sale, the purchaser may elect
to pay the tax on the use measured by the amount of the rental charged rather
than the sales price of the property to him. (MC Ord. 39A §47, 1971)
3.08.155: RESALE CERTIFICATE; COMMINGLED FUNGIBLE GOODS:

3.12.290: TAX REFUNDS; PERSONS ENTITLED; CLAIM SUBMITTAL:
Any person who exports any motor vehicle fuel from this county, or who sells
any such fuel to the United States government for official use of the United
States armed forces, or who buys and uses any such fuel for purposes other than
in and for the propulsion of motor vehicles, and who has paid any tax on such
fuel levied or directed to be paid as provided by this chapter, either directly
by the collection of such tax by the vendor from such consumer or indirectly by
the addition of the amount of such tax to the price of such fuel, shall be
reimbursed and repaid the amount of such tax so paid by him, except as follows:
   A.   Refund claims shall be submitted and paid once every six (6) months and
the dates for submission shall be prescribed by classes by the department's
rules and regulations.

3.12.300: REFUND CLAIM PROCEDURE; INVOICE:
   A.   A claimant for refund shall present to the department a refund claim
form accompanied by the original invoices showing the purchase. The refund
forms shall state the total amount of such fuel so purchased and used by the
consumer otherwise than for the propulsion of motor vehicles and the manner and
the equipment in which the claimant has used the same.
   B.   A claimant for refund of tax on motor vehicle fuel purchased and
exported from this county shall execute and furnish to the department a
certificate of exportation on such form as may be prescribed by the department.
   C.   An invoice to qualify for refund shall contain at least:
      1.   The number of gallons of motor vehicle fuel purchased;
      2.   The price per gallon;
      3.   The total purchase price of the motor vehicle fuel; and
      4.   Such other information as may be prescribed by the department.
   D.   The signature on the refund claim form shall subject the claimant to
the charge of perjury for false statements contained on the refund application.

(3) years for audit purposes of all motor vehicle fuel used. The record shall

      2.   The number of gallons of fuel used in each fill; and
      3.   The purpose for which the piece of equipment will be used.
The gasoline fills shall be further classified as to on highway or off highway
use. Any motor vehicle fuel used in any licensed motor vehicle does not qualify
for refund.
   F.   In accounting for motor vehicle fuel used for refund purposes, direct
measure shall be used and estimates are prohibited. Self- propelled vehicles
with mounted auxiliary equipment consuming motor vehicle fuel shall be allowed
refunds only if a separate motor vehicle fuel tank and a separate motor are
used to operate the auxiliary equipment.
   G.   No person may be granted a refund of motor vehicle fuel taxes for off
highway use when such consumption takes place on highways constructed and
maintained by public funds, on federal proprietary lands or reservations where
the claimant has no ownership or control over such land or highways, except
when such person is under a contractual relationship with the federal
government or one of its agencies and is engaged in the performance of his
duties pursuant to such relationship. Employment of an individual by the
federal government or any of its agencies does not constitute a contractual
relationship for the purpose of this subsection.
   H.   When, in the opinion of the department, it would be beneficial to the
state for a refund claimant to become a licensed dealer, such claimant may, at
the option of the department, be required to become a licensed dealer rather
than a refund claimant unless such claimant chooses to claim refunds at the tax
rate, less two percent (2%). (MC Ord. 96A §39, 1984)
3.12.310: TAX REFUND; PAYMENT:
Upon the presentation of such affidavits, invoices, written statements, tax
exemption certificates or exportation certificates, the department shall cause
to be repaid to the claimant from the taxes collected under this chapter, an
amount equal to the taxes so paid by the claimant. (MC Ord. 96A §40, 1984)
3.12.320: REFUND PAYMENT BASED ON DUPLICATE INVOICE:
In the event of the loss of an original invoice, the person claiming a refund
may submit in lieu thereof a duplicate copy of the invoice, which shall be
retained by the department until the expiration of the period specified for
filing of refund applications. No payment of refund based upon a duplicate
invoice shall be made until after the expiration of such statutory period. (MC
Ord. 96A §41, 1984)
3.12.330: EXAMINATION OF CLAIMANT'S BOOKS:
In order to establish the validity of any claim, the department may, upon
demand, examine the books and records of the claimant for such purpose. The
failure of the claimant to accede to such demand constitutes a waiver of all
rights to the refund claimed on account of the transactions questioned. (MC
Ord. 96A §42, 1984)
3.12.340: TIME LIMIT FOR TAX REFUND APPLICATION:
All applications for refund based upon exportation of motor vehicle fuel from
this state shall be filed with the department within three (3) months from the

supporting evidence, shall be filed with the department within six (6) months
from the date of purchase. All rights to refunds shall be forfeited if
applications are not filed with the department within the times herein
prescribed. (MC Ord. 96A §43, 1984)

All claims for refunds under this chapter shall be paid from county gasoline
tax funds collected under this chapter upon claims presented by the department,
approved by the state board of examiners, and allowed and paid as other claims
against the state are allowed and paid. (MC Ord. 96A §44, 1984)
3.12.360: GRANTING OF CREDIT IN LIEU OF REFUND:
In lieu of the collection and refund of the tax on motor vehicle fuel used by a
dealer in such a manner as would entitle a purchaser to claim refund under the
provisions of this chapter, or in lieu of the refund of any prior erroneous
payment of tax on motor vehicle fuel to the department made by a dealer, credit
may be given the dealer upon his tax return and assessment. (MC Ord. 96A §45,
1984)

excess of fifty (50) gallons of regular motor vehicle fuel which are not placed
directly into the tank of motor vehicles.
   B.   Any person determined by the department to be a bona fide farmer or
rancher, not engaged in other activities which would distort his highway usage,
may claim a refund only on the basis of eighty percent (80%) of his bulk
purchases, without necessity of maintaining records of use.
   C.   Any farmer or rancher desiring to claim a refund under the provisions
of this action must first secure a permit from the department, and such a
permit shall bind the permittee to file claims for refunds under the provisions
of this section until a request has been made for a change of basis for filing,
which request has been approved by the department.
   D.   The department is empowered to issue reasonable rules and regulations
to carry out the purposes of this section. (MC Ord. 96A §46, 1984)
3.12.380: INJUNCTION OR OTHER PROCESS TO PREVENT COLLECTION PROHIBITED:
No injunction or writ of mandate or other legal or equitable process shall ever
issue in any suit, action or proceeding in any court against this state or
county or any officer thereof to prevent or enjoin the collection under this
chapter of any excise tax assessed by the department. (MC Ord. 96A §47, 1984)
3.12.390: RIGHT TO BRING ACTION AGAINST STATE TREASURER:
After payment of any excise tax under protest duly verified, served on the
department, and setting forth the grounds of objection to the legality of the
excise tax, the dealer paying the excise tax may bring an action against the
state treasurer in the district court in and for Carson City for the recovery
of the excise tax so paid under protest. (MC Ord. 96A §48, 1984)
3.12.400: ACTION TO RECOVER AMOUNT PAID:
   A.   No action authorized by section 3.12.390 of this chapter may be
instituted more than ninety (90) days after the last day prescribed for the
payment of the excise tax without penalty. Failure to bring suit within the
ninety (90) days shall constitute a waiver of any and all demands against the
county on account of alleged overpayment of excise taxes.
   B.   No grounds of illegality of the excise tax shall be considered by the
court other than those set forth in the protest filed at the time of the
payment of the excise tax. (MC Ord. 96A §49, 1984)
3.12.410: JUDGMENT FOR PLAINTIFF; DISPOSITION OF AMOUNT; INTEREST:

(6%) per annum upon the amount of the excise tax found to have been collected
illegally from the date of payment thereof to the date of allowance of credit
on account of such judgment or to a date preceding the date of the refund
warrant by not more than thirty (30) days, such date to be determined by the
department. (MC Ord. 96A §50, 1984)
3.12.420: WHEN JUDGMENT NOT IN FAVOR OF PLAINTIFF:
A judgment shall not be rendered in favor of the plaintiff in any action
brought against the state treasurer to recover any excise tax paid under this

applicable to the conduct of such business and that such application is made
upon the express condition that if the license is granted, it shall be subject
to revocation in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 260A, 1-
5-2022)
7.04.040: LICENSE APPLICATION; MULTIPLE OWNERS:
In the event an applicant for licensing is not the sole owner of the business
to be conducted on the premises for which the license is sought, the
application must be accompanied by a sworn statement listing all owners of the
business and their respective interests therein. A license issued in such
circumstances shall bear the names of all owners of the business so licensed
and each person so listed upon the license shall be deemed responsible for the
proper conduct of the business. (Ord. 260A, 1-5-2022)
7.04.050: LICENSE APPLICATION PROCESSING AND INVESTIGATION; BOARD ACTION:
   A.   Every application for a liquor license shall first be filed with the
business license department of Mineral County. Each such application shall be
accompanied by a license fee payment in the amount consistent with the type of
license sought under this chapter. As a condition precedent to the issuance of
any license under this chapter, the applicant shall obtain a business license
as is or may be provided for by Title 5 of this code. Any application under
this section for an initial licensing shall also be accompanied by a
nonrefundable investigation fee, in an amount to be set by resolution of the
board of county commissioners. Every person making initial application under
this chapter shall also obtain a statement, from the business licensing
department, that the intended license application conforms with the use of the
land in the area or neighborhood where the use or event for which the license
is sought is intended to be allowed or conducted.
   B.   The sheriff, upon provision by the business license department of an
application for a liquor license under this chapter, together with all
statements of compliance with the provisions of chapters Title 5, and any
statement of compliance with the use of the land in the area or neighborhood
where the use or event for which the license is sought is to be conducted shall
thereafter investigate into the qualifications of the applicant and report the
results of his investigation to the liquor board. Upon receipt of such
information the sheriff shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, recommend
approval or disapproval of the application and transmit all information
pertaining to the license application to the liquor board for its action in
granting or refusing the application. If the application is granted the liquor
board shall cause the license to be issued.
   C.   The sheriff may, where unforeseen circumstances exist, including,
without limitation, the inability of the board to timely convene a public
meeting and consider any such application, grant a temporary liquor license to
the applicant, upon submission of a proper application, subject to final
approval by the liquor board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. Any
temporary license issued under this section becomes final upon action of the
board and no additional action need be undertaken by the applicant. No
additional approval or license need be issued. (Ord. 260A, 1-5-2022)
7.04.060: LICENSE RENEWAL:
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the procedures set forth
under this chapter for the application and issuance of liquor licenses shall
not apply to the renewal of licenses previously issued to the same applicant.
With respect to such renewal of licenses, no formal application procedure shall
be required and the sheriff shall cause the reissuance or cancellation of such
license renewals in the following manner:
   A.   The sheriff shall have authority to renew any license granted under
this chapter without presenting any request for renewal to the liquor board.
Any request for renewal granted under this section shall be accompanied by
payment of a renewal fee in an amount to be established by resolution of the
liquor board. In the absence of any cause existing against reissuance of a
license, the sheriff shall reissue a liquor license under this chapter.
   B.   The sheriff shall, where cause exists to believe that the renewal of a
license under this chapter would be contrary to the public health, welfare,
safety, or to the good order and welfare of the county, present the matter of
the renewal of any such license to the liquor board for its consideration. Upon
a finding, by the liquor board, that the renewal of a license under this
chapter would be contrary to the public health, welfare, safety, or to the good
order and welfare of the county, the liquor board shall enter an order denying
the renewal of the liquor license.
   C.   Any licensee whose license renewal has been disapproved by the liquor
board shall be notified in writing, in the manner provided for by section
7.04.120 of this chapter, upon which the licensee may avail himself of the
procedures set forth therein. (Ord. 260A, 1-5-2022)
7.04.070: LICENSE; NONTRANSFERABILITY:
   A.   No license granted or issued under any provision of this chapter shall
be in any manner assignable or transferable, or shall authorize any person
other than as therein named to do business, or authorize the conduct of any
business other than therein specified, at any place other than therein
mentioned.
   B.   If a business is owned or conducted by a partnership, corporation or
association, a sale or transfer of the stock or equity in such partnership,
corporation or association, in an amount in excess of forty nine percent (49%)
thereof, will require the application for and issuance of a new liquor license,
notwithstanding the fact that such firm or business continues its operation in
the same style or trade name and at the same location. A sale and transfer of
equity or stock in such business, in amounts not exceeding forty nine percent
(49%), shall not require new licensing for such business; provided, however,
that the names and addresses of all such new owners of the licensed business
shall be reported to the county sheriff's office for inclusion on the next
succeeding quarterly license for such business. (Ord. 260A, 1-5-2022)
7.04.080: LICENSE FEES; GENERALLY:
   A.   All fees and charges for liquor licenses shall be paid on a quarterly
basis, in advance, at the time of application therefor to the business
licensing department of Mineral County. When an applicant has not engaged in
the business until after the expiration of part of the current license year,
the license fee shall be prorated and the license fee paid for each quarter or
fraction thereof during which the business has been or will be conducted.
License fees paid pursuant to this chapter shall not be refundable, but shall
be deposited with the county treasurer for deposit in the general fund of the
county.
   B.   Except as otherwise provided for herein, all initial licensing and
renewal fees may be established upon resolution by the liquor board at any
time.
   C.   All initial and renewal fees are nonrefundable and shall be paid to the
business licensing department of Mineral County, Nevada.
   D.   Licensing fees shall be paid to the business licensing department, by
any licensee under this chapter, in accordance with the following schedule:
First quarter (January through March), on or before January 10 of the quarter;
Second quarter (April through June), on or before April 10 of the quarter;
Third quarter (July through September), on or before July 10 of the quarter;
Fourth quarter (October through December), on or before October 10 of the
quarter.
   E.   License fees not paid on or before the tenth day of each month set
forth by subsection D of this section shall be deemed delinquent. A delinquent
fee penalty consisting of an amount of ten percent (10%) of the quarterly
license fee shall be added to all payments received after becoming delinquent.
   F.   Where payment by a licensee under this section is delinquent, such
nonpayment of quarterly license fees shall be deemed a sufficient basis for the
suspension or revocation of a license granted under this chapter.
   G.   The board finds that enforcement activities under this chapter,
relating to a full liquor license, concern public health and safety; that the
establishment of a schedule of fees under this section comprehends such public
interests. (Ord. 260A, 1-5-2022)
7.04.090: LICENSE FEES; TERMS AND AMOUNTS:
   A.   It is unlawful for any person, firm, corporation or association to
engage in the business of selling, or to sell or offer for sale, any alcoholic
beverage in the county without first procuring a license therefor and without
first paying to the county a liquor license tax according to the fee schedule
set forth in this section.
   B.   The licenses provided for under this chapter and any fees payable

required by state law or ordinances of the county.
   C.   The liquor license fees shall be paid according to the following
schedule:

consumption in any amusement park, at any special event or other than at a
fixed and permanent place of business shall be licensed at a fee, as
established by resolution of the board of county commissioners.
Such a license shall entitle the holder thereof to sell liquor for consumption
on the premises where sold, subject to all reasonable terms and conditions that
the board or sheriff may impose upon the license granted, including, without
limitation, a schedule of hours during which liquor may be sold and the
location of liquor sales upon the licensed premises. The sheriff may issue a
license under this section to any active liquor license holder. The sheriff or
the board may limit the sale of liquor under this section to beer and/or wine
only.
The application shall be made in the same manner as provided under this chapter
for other licenses, except that the application shall be accompanied by the
license fee for the period for which licensing is sought.
The board or the sheriff may refund the license fee required under this
subsection on application of a duly authorized representative of any nonprofit
service club or similar organization in the county certifying that the proceeds
of the sale of all alcoholic beverages are to be applied for a charitable
purpose.
The board or sheriff may waive fees for any license granted under this
subsection C4 to any charitable organization where, in the discretion of the
board or sheriff, such waiver is or may be a benefit to the public. (Ord. 260A,
1-5-2022)
7.04.100: LICENSE; PUBLIC DISPLAY:
During all of the period of time for which a license has been issued
authorizing the sale of alcoholic beverages, the license shall be posted and at
all times displayed in a conspicuous place in the room where such business is
carried on so that all persons visiting such place may readily see and read the
same. It is unlawful for the licensee to fail to so post the license, or to
keep the same posted, or to post such license or to permit such license to be
posted in an establishment other than the licensed, or in an establishment
where traffic in alcoholic beverages is carried on or conducted by any person
other than the licensee. (Ord. 260A, 1-5-2022)
7.04.105: LICENSE SUSPENSION; GROUNDS:
Any license granted under this chapter is subject to suspension as follows:
   A.   The sheriff or undersheriff, upon consultation had with the district
attorney, shall have authority to temporarily suspend any license granted under
this chapter where he or she has reasonable cause to believe that an immediate
threat exists to the public health, welfare, or the safety of the inhabitants
of the county subject to the following conditions:
      1.   Any suspension imposed under this subsection must not exceed twenty
four (24) hours in duration.
      2.   Upon correction of the condition or conditions giving rise to a
suspension under this subsection, by the licensee, to the satisfaction of the
sheriff or undersheriff, the sheriff or undersheriff shall reinstate the
license prior to the expiration of the twenty four (24) hour period.
      3.   In the absence of correction, by a licensee, of any condition or
conditions causing a temporary suspension, an additional twenty four (24) hour
period of suspension may be imposed by the sheriff or undersheriff.
      4.   Any combination of suspensions imposed under this subsection may not
exceed a total of forty eight (48) consecutive hours.
   B.   The liquor board, on its own initiative, or upon complaint of any
person, may institute proceedings to suspend a license issued under this
chapter. Such proceedings shall be commenced upon provision of written notice
to the licensee setting forth alleged grounds for such suspension and notifying
the licensee of the procedure by which he or she may contest a proposed license
suspension. Service of such notice shall be given in person to the licensee or
by certified mail to the licensee's address as shown on the license application
filed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
   C.   Within five (5) days of the date of service of the notice, as set forth
by subsection B of this section, the licensee shall provide to the chair of the
liquor board a written answer, sworn to upon an oath, responding to the
allegations of the notice. Notice of suspension given the licensee shall state
the date upon which an answer is due.
   D.   The liquor board shall thereafter fix a day and time for a hearing at
which the matter of suspension shall be heard. Evidence received at the hearing
may be admitted if it is of the type commonly relied upon by reasonable and
prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. Reasonable cause must exist
that an immediate threat exists to public health, safety and welfare to sustain
a suspension. Every witness shall declare, by an oath or affirmation, that he
or she will testify truthfully.
   E.   The liquor board may immediately proceed to enter findings of fact
based upon the evidence and it shall, within ten (10) days from the date of
such hearing, enter its written order suspending or refusing to suspend the
license and impose such terms and conditions set forth in subsection H of this
section.
   F.   In the event that the licensee fails to respond to the notice of
suspension within the time required, by providing a written answer, or if the
licensee fails to appear at the hearing, the liquor board may proceed to
suspend the license for such time and upon such conditions as provided for by
subsection H of this section.
   G.   In all cases, where a temporary suspension was imposed by the sheriff
or undersheriff, a report of the suspension shall be made to the board. Notice
and an opportunity to be heard shall be given as provided for by subsections B
and C of this section and a hearing shall proceed as set forth by subsections D
through F of this section.
   H.   As the result of a hearing on the matter, and upon a finding by the
board that reasonable cause exists for further action associated with the
license, the board may impose any of the following conditions or combination of
conditions upon the license:
      1.   A term of suspension, not to exceed thirty (30) days in duration;
      2.   Conditions which must be corrected and establish a time certain in
which the conditions must be corrected to avoid suspension;
      3.   Direct that the report of suspension be purged from the record
associated with the license. Where such action has been taken, the matter of
the suspension shall not be considered as a basis to deny a renewal of the
license under this chapter;
      4.   Impose such other terms or conditions upon the license reasonably
calculated to ensure public health, safety and welfare.
   I.   Where the board determines that the evidence presented at the hearing
is insufficient to sustain a finding of reasonable cause for a suspension, such
findings shall be made a part of the record of proceedings. In such an
instance, the record made of the report or complaint for suspension shall not
be considered as a basis to deny the renewal of a license under this chapter.
   J.   Notwithstanding action by the sheriff, undersheriff or liquor board
relating to the imposition of a suspension, this section is not intended to
limit the liquor board, upon its own initiative, or any other person, from
instituting proceedings to revoke a license pursuant to section
7.04.120 of this chapter.
   K.   Grounds for suspension may include, without limitation, the grounds
upon which revocation may be instituted as provided for by section

licensee or individual is no longer a suitable or qualified person to conduct a
business dealing in alcoholic beverages in the county;
   B.   For making any false material statements in an application for a
license or employment certificate;
   C.   For transferring, assigning or hypothecating a license;

The ordinance codified in this chapter shall be known and may be cited in all
proceedings as the MINERAL COUNTY SAFE HAVEN ORDINANCE. (MC Ord. 87A § A, 1981)
8.08.020: PURPOSE:
   A.   The design, operation and utilization of safe havens are governed by
the United States department of transportation motor carrier safety
regulations, national fire code, hazardous materials - emergency action guide
and the provisions of this chapter. The purpose of this chapter is to safeguard
the public health and safety and to protect property by establishing a safe
haven in areas remote from population and property centers.
   B.   These terminals are a necessary part of over the road transportation of
hazardous materials since territorial restrictions on motor carrier operations
often make it necessary for a load of hazardous materials to be hauled by more
than one carrier before it reaches its destination.
   C.   Properly operated hazardous material motor vehicle terminals are in the
best interest of the public, for they enhance safety in transportation by
providing a controlled and safe location for placing vehicles for inspection,
maintenance and interlining with connecting carriers. The overall result is
improved safety on the highway. (MC Ord. 87A § B, 1981)

notice of violation or notice of declaration of chronic nuisance served upon
the owner and/or responsible party shall be sent to the County Building
Official. The county shall pay the cost and expense of such abatement from any
appropriation made available for this purpose. Prior to abatement by the

the condition(s) and an estimate of the costs of abating the conditions(s) set
forth in each notice of violation shall be filed with the County Clerk. In
addition to the costs for the work performed, the report shall contain a
statement of the charge for reinspection(s) and other incidental costs
associated with the abatement as established by law. However, if the estimated

therein who presents a written or oral protest or objection to the report and
account. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall either approve or

the Board. The amount so approved shall be assessed against and shall become a
lien upon the property affected and the Board shall adopt a resolution
assessing said amounts as liens upon the respective parcels of lands as they
are shown upon the last available assessment roll and shall also determine that
such condition(s) set forth in the notice of violation did constitute a
nuisance. The county may then cause the nuisance to be abated, except as set
forth in subsection A of this section, as approved by the Board. Abatement by
the County may be accomplished by county crews or by private contractors when
County crews are not available.

the nonpayment of general taxes. Such lien shall be prior to all liens, claims,
encumbrances and titles other than the liens of assessments and general taxes.

matters recited therein, and of the regularity of all proceedings prior to the
recording thereof. Prior assessment or assessments, for the purposes provided
in this chapter, shall not be a bar to a subsequent assessment or assessments
and any number of liens of the same parcel may be enforced in the same action.
   F.   After confirmation of the assessment, a copy shall be certified to the
Mineral County Assessor and/or Auditor who is expressly authorized to assume
and discharge the duty of collecting the special assessments by adding the
amounts of the same to the next regular bills for taxes levied against the lots
and parcel of land for county purposes and thereafter the amounts shall be
collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary county taxes are
collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure as
under foreclosure and sale, in the case of delinquency, as provided for
ordinary county taxes.
   G.   The County Clerk may accept payment of any amount due at any time prior
to the Board hearing described under subsection C of this section. In the event
that the assessment is paid, the county shall proceed to remove the lien from
the property at the owner of record or any responsible party's expense.
   H.   Within the proper exercise of discretion and upon direction from the
Board, the county attorney may bring suit against the owner of record in a
court of competent jurisdiction to collect all county liens, assessments or
costs incurred by the county in causing the nuisance to be abated at any time
after recording. (Ord. 229A, 6-6-2013; amd. Ord. 249A, 1-7-2019)

actual and serious physical harm. After a notice of violation is served upon

responsible party does not secure the structure to county specifications, the
hazard may be summarily abated by the county through temporary boarding.
   B.   The county shall pay the cost and expense of such abatement from any
appropriation made available for that purpose. Any and all charges and costs
arising from the county taking action to secure the structure shall be a
special assessment and filed against the real property containing such a
structure as a special assessment lien under the procedures set forth in
section
8.40.190  17. (Ord. 229A, 6-6-2013; amd. Ord. 249A, 1-7-2019)

abatement of the hazard without notice. Such abatement of an imminent hazard
may be limited to the minimum work necessary to remove the hazard. County
departments which may concur or request a designation of imminent hazard
include, but are not limited to Sheriff's, Fire and Public Works Departments.
   B.   The county shall pay the cost and expense of such abatement from any
appropriation made available for that purpose. Any and all charges and costs

special assessment and filed against the real property containing such a
structure as a special assessment lien under the procedures set forth in

qualified. (Ord. 228A, 1-16-2013)
11.04.060: APPROVAL OF LIST OF APPRAISERS:
   A.   The initial lists prepared by the planning department as set forth in
section
11.04.050 of this chapter, shall be presented to the board of commissioners for
approval. Each year after initial approval, the lists shall be randomly
reorganized and names thereon rotated by the planning department.
   B.   Upon request to the planning department, an appraiser may be added to
the bottom of any list at any time if the appraiser demonstrates to the
planning department that the appraiser is qualified to act as a general
appraiser in Mineral County and meets the minimum qualifications set forth in
section
11.04.040 of this chapter. If the planning department declines to add an
appraiser to a list, the appraiser may appeal that decision to the county
commissioners pursuant to subsection
11.04.070B of this chapter. (Ord. 228A, 1-16-2013)
11.04.070: REMOVAL FROM LIST OF APPRAISERS; APPEAL AND JUDICIAL REVIEW:
   A.   The ability for an appraiser to be qualified and remain on the list is
a privilege and not a right. All appraisers applying for placement on a list
must acknowledge and agree that any change in the appraiser's status or ability
to maintain the minimum qualification requirements set forth in section
11.04.040 of this chapter shall be cause for immediate removal from the list by
the planning department. The planning department shall send a notice notifying
the appraiser that he or she has been removed from the list. Once an appraiser
has been removed from a list of appraisers, he or she shall not be qualified to
be reinstated to such list until the minimum qualification requirements set
forth in section
11.04.040 of this chapter have been met and the decision of the director has
been overturned by either county commissioners pursuant to this section or by
an order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction on judicial review.
   B.   If an appraiser who is not added to a list or is removed from the list
desires to appeal the decision of the planning department to the county
commissioners, he or she shall file a notice of such intent with the county
clerk within ten (10) business days from the date of the notice of removal. If
this deadline is not complied with by the appraiser, the planning department's
decision shall be final and there shall be no further review of such decision.
The county clerk shall place such appeal on the board of county commissioners'
agenda for a public hearing.
   C.   The county commissioners shall have the power to determine if the
planning department's decision complies with the provisions of this chapter and
to affirm, reverse or modify the appealed decision. The decision of the county
commissioners is a final decision for purpose of judicial review.
   D.   Judicial review may be sought in accordance with chapter 34 of the
Nevada Revised Statutes. (Ord. 228A, 1-16-2013)
11.04.080: APPRAISER SELECTION PROCEDURE:
When an independent appraisal is required for the sale or lease of county
property, the following procedures are to be followed:
   A.   The planning department shall send a request for proposal to the
appraiser whose name is at the top of the list for the type of property being
appraised. The request shall identify the property to be appraised, the desired
terms and conditions of appraisal and the requirements for the response to the
request for proposal. The response from the appraiser must include: 1) a
statement of specific qualifications to do the type of appraisal required; 2) a
proposal of the terms and conditions for the appraisal; 3) a disclosure
statement which includes, without limitation, all sources of income of the
appraiser that may constitute a conflict of interest and any relationship of
the appraiser with the property owner or the owner of an adjoining property;
and 4) a statement that the appraiser is not related within the second degree
of consanguinity or affinity to any person who has an interest in the real
property or an adjoining property.
   B.   If the appraiser does not satisfactorily respond to the request as
determined by the planning department, his or her name shall be moved to the
bottom of the list, and the department shall move to the next name on the list.
If the appraiser responds to the request in terms that are responsive and
satisfactory to the department, his or her name shall be recommended to the
county commissioners for approval as specified in subsection
11.04.090B of this chapter.
   C.   If more than one appraisal is required, this procedure shall be
followed for each appraiser. To expedite the selection process or foster
competitive bidding, the planning department may send a request for proposal to
more than one appraiser, and those who respond and are not selected shall be
left at the top of the list.
   D.   Once the resolution of intent is adopted by the board of county
commissioners as set forth in subsection
11.04.095A5 of this chapter, the planning department shall engage the qualified
appraisers to conduct appraisals utilizing the approved form agreement for
appraisal services. (Ord. 228A, 1-16-2013)

appraiser or two (2) independent appraisers, as applicable, from the list of

standards of appraisal practice established by the Appraisal Foundation, and in
accordance with the standards and procedures required by Nevada law; and

forth in the master plan for the county. (Ord. 228A, 1-16-2013)

(60) days.
      3.   Upon acceptance of a petition for sale or lease of public property,
the board of county commissioners shall, as set forth in this chapter,
determine the method of appraising the petitioned for property, select the
appraiser, and order the appraisal of the property;

resolution shall contain the following:
         a.   A date set for public hearing not less than twenty one (21) days

session, be opened, examined and declared by the county commissioners. Of the
proposals submitted which conform to all terms and conditions specified in the
resolution of intent and which are made by responsible bidders, the bid which
is the highest must be finally accepted unless a higher oral bid is accepted or
the county commissioners reject all bids.
      2.   Before accepting any written bid, the county commissioners shall
call for oral bids. If, upon the call for oral bidding, any responsible person
offers to buy or lease the property upon the terms and conditions specified in

sale or lease.
      5.   If the property is not sold or leased at the initial offering, the
county commissioners may offer the property for sale or lease a second time
pursuant to this chapter. If there is a material change relating to the title,
zoning or an ordinance governing the use of the property, a new appraisal must
be obtained pursuant to section
11.04.090 of this chapter before offering the property for sale or lease a
second time. If the property is not sold or leased at the second offering, the
county commissioners may list the property for sale or lease at the appraised
value with a licensed real estate broker, provided the broker or a person
related to the broker with the first degree of consanguinity or affinity does
not have an interest in the property or an adjoining property. (Ord. 228A, 1-

   A.   Petition For Land Sale Or Lease For Economic Development: The board of
county commissioners may sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of real property for
the purposes of redevelopment or economic development without first offering
the real property to the public and for less than fair market value. To qualify
there has to be a need for the business or activity. Mineral County will
consider industrial, wholesale, commercial, and retail business proposals. If
there is a commercial or retail business proposal submitted for consideration
there cannot be a similar business or activity already in place in Mineral
County unless it can be shown to support or aid in the retention or expansion
of the existing similar business or activity. The petition shall contain the
following:
      1.   A site development plan prepared by a state of Nevada licensed
engineer or architect which includes, but is not limited to, proposed building
layout, floor elevations, FEMA flood zone designation, site grading and
drainage and parking lot layout. The development plan must include a statement
that outlines the proposal will be consistent with the zoning designation as
specified in the Mineral County master plan.
      2.   A comprehensive business plan specific to the proposed development
that includes:
         a.   An executive summary which includes a company description; an
organizational and management outline listing all officers, owners, and/or
partners; a plan for marketing and sales of the service or product lines; and
financial projections for the next three (3) to five (5) years.
         b.   A complete financial statement, prepared by a licensed CPA, of
the company and all officers, partners, etc.
         c.   A market analysis that demonstrates that the proposed development
will be consistent with the definitions for redevelopment and/or economic
development as set forth in this chapter.
         d.   A tax base analysis which assesses the tax base impact for
Mineral County.
         e.   The proposed purchase price for the property requested under the
appraised value will be indicated in the plan. Any proposed property sale value
under the appraised value will require a performance bond equal to the original
appraised value. The value of the property for tax purposes will remain at the
appraised value.
         f.   Nonrefundable fees including, but not be limited to, appraisal
costs, publication costs, survey costs, county staff time costs, financial
performance review, preparation of legal document costs and/or any other costs
as deemed appropriate by the board of county commissioners. Nonrefundable fees
may be credited toward the purchase price of the petitioned land if the
agreement price is over fifty percent (50%) of the appraised value.
      3.   Upon acceptance of a petition for sale or lease of public property
for economic development, the board of county commissioners shall, as set forth
in this chapter, determine the method of appraising the petitioned for
property, select the appraiser, and order the appraisal of the property.
      4.   If the board of county commissioners determines that the sale or
lease of the property for redevelopment or economic development is in the best
interest of the public, the board shall adopt a resolution declaring that it is
in the best interest of the public to sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of the
property without offering the property to the public, and for less than fair
market value of the real property. The resolution shall state that the value of
the property will remain at the appraisal value but will be sold for less than
fair market value for purposes of redevelopment or economic development. The
resolution of intent to sell or lease property for economic development shall
set forth the terms and conditions for sale and incorporate a development
agreement with Mineral County adopting the development plans proposed by the
petitioner. (Ord. 228A, 1-16-2013)

13.38.010: GENERAL:
This chapter, adopted by Mineral County, enables public water systems (PWS) to
have delineated drinking water (source water) protection areas rezoned as
wellhead protection areas.
Wellhead protection area delineations, approved by the state of Nevada wellhead
protection program, administered by the Nevada division of environmental
protection (NDEP) will be placed on the Mineral County drinking water
protection overlay map. The application for zoning change of the delineated
drinking water protection area will be accompanied by the wellhead protection
program that is specific to the PWS, when available.
The county ordinance provides protection for any portion of the delineated
drinking water protection areas, which fall under county jurisdiction, once
zoning changes have been completed. This chapter also provides protection for
unincorporated public water systems, which have no regulatory powers, to be
covered under the county umbrella provided they meet requirements for the
zoning change.
   A.   Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses
due to contamination of the public water supply, and to formalize ground water
protection procedures.
   B.   Goals:
      1.   Protect human life and health;
      2.   Ensure that the public is provided with a sustainable safe potable
water supply;
      3.   Minimize expenditure of public money for pollution remediation
projects;
      4.   Clarify regulations on land use; and
      5.   Minimize business interruptions. (MC Ord. 192A § 20, 2006)
13.38.020: ESTABLISHMENT OF WELLHEAD PROTECTION OVERLAY DISTRICT:
There is hereby established a wellhead protection overlay district identified
and described as all the area within the ten (10) year or twenty (20) year time
of travel (TOT) district around public water supplies as shown on the official
zoning map. It is further established that these areas be composed of two (2)
districts, wellhead protection overlay district I and wellhead protection
overlay district II, as they are defined in this chapter. The board may record
with the county recorder's office a metes and bounds description of the
wellhead protection overlay district. (MC Ord. 192A § 20, 2006)
13.38.030: PROHIBITED USES WITHIN ZONE I:
   A.   Uses permitted within zone I shall be limited to necessary public water
supply wellhead equipment including the following: wellhead facility buildings,
water storage tanks, disinfection and treatment equipment, disinfection and

handling, manufacture, use, storage, transfer or disposal of any hazardous
solid or liquid material or waste having a potential impact on ground water
quality that would change ground water quality to below state drinking water
quality standards, and any land use activities posing a hazard or contamination
threat to existing ground water quality.
      2.   Sewer lines, septic tanks, drain fields or the disposal of waste
oil, oil filters, tires and all other petroleum products.
   B.   Exceptions may be allowed upon issuance of a special use permit. The
planning commission may instigate a special use permit process during the
application review process. (MC Ord. 192A § 20, 2006)
13.38.040: NOTICE OF PROPOSED ACTION:
Whenever there is a request that requires a special use permit from the
planning commission for land lying within a wellhead protection district,
written notice no less than thirty (30) days before the hearing shall be given
to all entities operating a public or community water supply system within that
overlay district. The planning commission may require a granting of easements
for monitoring wells if the commission deems it appropriate for protection of
the public water supply. (MC Ord. 192A § 20, 2006)
13.38.050: PROPOSED LAND USES WITHIN ZONE II:
Upon requesting a permit for land use or development within the wellhead
protection overlay district II, applicants will be informed by the permitting
agency regarding the goals of the wellhead protection plan for the associated
PWS. The permitting agency must promptly send a copy of the application to the
PWS. The PWS will then be allowed thirty (30) days to respond to the proposed
development or land use as they pertain to the goals stated in their wellhead
protection program. The PWS may then request more detailed information or
submit a nonbinding advisory statement detailing any suggested restrictions,
modifications and/or justification for denial or approval of the permit. (MC
Ord. 192A § 20, 2006)
13.38.060: NONCONFORMING USES:
Any legal use existing at the time of the adoption hereof and listed as a
prohibited use herein, shall become a legal nonconforming use and is required
to conform to this title upon any change or transfer of ownership or upon
expansion or improvement except as otherwise provided in the zoning ordinance.
(MC Ord. 192A § 20, 2006)
13.38.070: ENFORCEMENT:
It shall be unlawful for any person, corporation, government entity or business
to occupy or use the land within the area designated in the wellhead protection
overlay district of zone I, and/or II, contrary to, or in violation of, any of
the provisions of this title and/or adopted water quality legislation and
pursuant regulations to protect ground water from potential contaminant sources
as identified in various chapters of the Nevada administrative code. (MC Ord.

sewer system must handle for the new user in relation to the usage of an
average single- family dwelling. An average single-family dwelling unit shall
be considered one equivalent dwelling unit (EDU) or twenty five (25) sewer
fixture units (SFU). The minimum SFU count for residential, enterprise
commercial and industrial shall be twenty five (25) and in no case shall there
be a discount or refund for a reduction in fixture units.
   C.   The User Charge System shall be the exclusive source of funds to meet
all operations, maintenance and replacement (OM&R) costs of the treatment
works. Each user of the sewer system shall pay its proportionate share of OM&R
costs, based upon actual or estimated contribution to the volume and loading of
the treatment facility and, in addition, each user must pay a proportion' of
the cost associated with treating water entering the system through
infiltration and inflow.
      1.   User Charge Rate Revenue: The user charge rate must generate revenue
sufficient to meet OM&R costs through customer charges which are proportionate
to usage based on the following rate classifications:
         a.   Residential User Charge Rate (UCR): Based on actual metered
consumption, rounded to he nearest thousand, of each one thousand gallons of
water, except for the months of March through November when a residential
user's assessed sewage volume shall be calculated not to exceed the user's
average consumption during the months of December through February as
determined from historical data on file with the utilities department. No
maximum assessed volume calculations shall apply during the months of December
through February. Fees for new residential services connecting to the system
during the months of March through November shall be based upon actual water
consumption of similar residences for the months of December through February
until such time as the winter average for the new residence can be determined.
         b.   Exempt Enterprise User Charge Rate: Said rate shall apply to
those customers using water outdoors during the growing season and shall be
based on actual metered consumption, rounded to the nearest thousand, of each
one thousand gallons of water, except for the months of March through November
when an exempt enterprise user's sewage volume must be calculated not to exceed
the user's average water consumption during the months of December through
February as determined from historical data on file with the utilities
department. No maximum assessed volume calculations shall apply during the
months of December through February. Fees for new exempt enterprise services
connected to the system during the months of March through November shall be
based on actual water consumption but not exceeding the average consumption of
similar exempt enterprises for the months of December through February until
such time as the winter average for the new exempt enterprise can be
determined.
         c.   Nonexempt Enterprise User Charge Rate: Based on actual metered
consumption, rounded to the nearest thousand, of each one thousand (1,000)
gallons of water. No calculated limitation on assessed sewage volume shall
apply.
         d.   Surcharge Fee: A surcharge fee shall be imposed upon all
enterprise users who discharge waste which exceeds the residential loading
benchmarks. The surcharge shall reflect the increased cost of treating the
effluent.
      2.   Equivalent Dwelling Unit And Loading Table: The predominant user
class is residential which has a value equal to twenty five (25) sewer fixture
units (based on uniform plumbing values) which is equivalent to one equivalent
dwelling unit (EDU). An equivalent dwelling unit table and loading table will
be utilized by the utilities department to standardize types of users according
to common volume calculations as follows:
User Type                               EDU Volume
All single-family dwellings             1
Each unit of a multiple-family dwelling 1
(duplexes, etc.)
Apartments (per unit)                   1
Mobile homes (each)                     1
Overnight recreational vehicle parking  1
(per every 5 RV sewer hookups)
Any public dump station                 5
(Recreational vehicles only)
Loading Levels Per EDU Of Domestic Wastewater
Parameter Strength
BOD r     200 mg/liter
SS d      200 mg/liter
 
 
All sewer users not specifically identified above will be classified as
enterprise/industrial users and their user charge will include a surcharge
based upon the equivalent dwelling unit table and loading table.
      3.   User Charge Rate: The user charge rate (UCR) shall be based on the
total operation, maintenance and replacement costs of the entire Hawthorne
sewer system attributable to each one thousand (1,000) gallons of sewage
treated at the wastewater treatment facility. There shall be a minimum monthly
user charge rate which shall equal the existing user charge rate for one
thousand (1,000) gallons as set forth in appendix A available at county clerk's
office.
      4.   Operation, Maintenance And Replacement Cost Accounting Procedures:
Operation, maintenance and replacement cost accounting procedures must
incorporate a line item budget including the following categories:
         a.   Salaries and wages;
         b.   Indirect salary and wage costs;
         c.   Contractual services;
         d.   Materials and supplies;
         e.   Utilities;
         f.   Equipment replacement;
         g.   Administrative expenses; and
         h.   The cost required to achieve and maintain compliance with
discharge permits.
      5.   Revenue From Treatment Related Byproducts: Revenue generated through
sale or use of treatment related byproducts shall be credited to OM&R expenses.
      6.   Tap Fee: The utilities department shall charge a user an amount
equal to the cost of the department's labor, equipment and materials whenever
it is necessary for the department to perform the actual tap into an existing
sewer main.
   D.   The sewer fee schedule shall be established by the utilities department
and enacted as a resolution of the board and thereafter incorporated as
appendix A, available at county clerk's office. The fee schedule shall contain
the number of sewer system users, the amount of sewer system OM&R expenses and
the sewer system capitalization requirements as well as the amount to be
exacted by the utilities department for each charge and fee. After receipt of
the prior year's audit report, the utilities department shall annually mail to
each user a copy of the sewer fee schedule.
   E.   Every year the board shall review the contribution of users and the
total cost of the operation, maintenance and replacement expenses of the sewer
system. If necessary the board shall revise the user charge rate and the
capitalization charge to accomplish the following:
      1.   Maintain the proportionate distribution of operation and maintenance
costs among the users and user classes in proportion to the demand each user
places on the sewer system and treatment works.
      2.   Generate sufficient revenue to pay the total operation and
maintenance costs necessary for the proper operation and maintenance of the
treatment works, including necessary equipment replacement.
      3.   Apply excess funds in the user charge system to the costs of
operation and maintenance for the next year and adjust the rate accordingly.
      4.   Maintain a positive balance in the capitalization system sufficient
to meet anticipated future needs and to retire existing debt. (Ord. 263B, 2023:

14.04.010: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of Mineral County may be subject to periodic
inundation which may result in the loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazards which increases flood heights and velocities,
and when inadequately anchored, damages uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.020: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
   A.   To protect human life and health;
   B.   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   C.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazards;
   F.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   G.   To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
   H.   To ensure that those who occupy areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.030: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   A.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   B.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   D.   Controlling, filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   E.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas. (Ord. 213A, 2010)

HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN: A plan that incorporates a process whereby the
potential of future loss due to flooding can be minimized by planning and
implementing alternatives to floodplain management community wide.
HIGHEST GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to
construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is:
   A.   Listed individually in the national register of historic places (a
listing maintained by the department of the interior) or preliminarily
determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the national register;
   B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district;
   C.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states
with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary
of the interior; or
   D.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either
by an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the interior or
directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved programs.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirements found at section
14.04.200 of this chapter.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain
management purposes the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers,
travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than
one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. For insurance purposes the term
"manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other
similar vehicles.
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on
or after the effective date hereof.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle built on a single chassis, four hundred (400)
square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection,
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by light duty truck, and
designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living
quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
SAND DUNES: Naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or mounds
landward of the beach.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): Darkly shaded area on a flood hazard boundary
map (FHBM) or a flood insurance rate map (FIRM) that identifies an area that
has a one percent (1%) chance of being flooded in any given year (100-year
floodplain). Over a thirty (30) year period, the life of most mortgages, there
is at least a twenty six percent (26%) chance that this area will be flooded.
The FIRM identifies these shaded areas as FIRM zones A, AO, AH, A1-A30, AE,
A99, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, AR/AO, V, V1-V30, and VE.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty
(180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or of the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers or foundation or the erection of temporary forms; nor
does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such
as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building or mobile home that is principally
aboveground.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before damage
occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any repair, reconstruction or improvement to a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure either:
   A.   Before the improvement or repair is started; or
   B.   If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement"
is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or
other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure.
This term does not, however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications, which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   B.   Any alteration of a structure listed on the national register of
historic places or a state inventory of historic places.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits
construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development in a special
flood hazard area, without an elevation certificate, other certifications or
other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided. (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.050: APPLICABILITY:
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of the county. (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.060: BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD:
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the federal insurance
administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood
Insurance Study For Mineral County", dated November 1, 1983, and all subsequent
amendments or revisions to ensure no lapse in NFIP participation in the event
of a new FIS and FIRM release, with an accompanying flood insurance rate map is
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The flood
insurance study is on file at the office of the county clerk, Mineral County
Courthouse, Hawthorne, Nevada. (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.070: PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE:
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and
other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter by
failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined
not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisoned for not more than
six (6) months, or both, for each violation and in addition shall pay all costs
and expenses involved in the case. Nothing contained in this section shall
prevent the county building inspector from taking such other lawful action as
is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.080: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 213A,
2010)
14.04.090: INTERPRETATION:
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:
   A.   Considered as minimum requirements;
   B.   Liberally constructed in favor of the governing body; and
   C.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state
statutes. (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.100: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within
such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not
create liability on the part of the county or any officer or employee thereof,
or the federal insurance administration, for any flood damages that result from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder. (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.110: DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
   A.   Required: A development permit shall be obtained before construction or
development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in
section
14.04.060 of this chapter. The permit shall be for all structures including
manufactured homes, as set forth in section
14.04.040 of this chapter, and for all development including fill and other
activities, also as set forth in section
14.04.040 of this chapter.
   B.   Application For Development Permit: Application for a development
permit shall be made on forms furnished by the Mineral County building
inspector and may include, but not be limited to: plans, in duplicate, drawn to
scale showing the nature, location, dimensions and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage
facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following
information is required:
      1.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all structures;
      2.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure has
been floodproofed;
      3.   Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the
floodproofing criteria in section
14.04.200 of this chapter; and
      4.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development. (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.120: ADMINISTRATOR DESIGNATED:
The county building inspector is appointed to administer and implement this
chapter by granting or denying development permit applications in accordance
with its provisions. (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.130: ADMINISTRATOR'S DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:
The duties and responsibilities of the county building inspector shall include,
but not be limited to:
   A.   Permit Review:
      1.   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
      2.   Review all development permits to determine that all necessary
permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental
agencies from which prior approval is required.
      3.   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that
the encroachment provisions of subsection
14.04.210A of this chapter are met.
   B.   Use Of Other Base Flood Data: When base flood elevation data has not
been provided in accordance with section
14.04.060 of this chapter, the county building inspector shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available
from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer sections
14.04.140 through
14.04.220 of this chapter.
   C.   Information To Be Obtained And Maintained:
      1.   Where base flood elevation data is provided through the flood
insurance study or required as in subsection B of this section, obtain and
record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and
whether or not the structure contains a basement;
      2.   For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures:
         a.   Verify and record the actual elevation in relation to mean sea
level, and
         b.   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in subsection
14.04.110B of this chapter.
      3.   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter.
   D.   Alteration Of Watercourses: It is the responsibility of the county
building inspector to:
      1.   Notify adjacent communities and the division of emergency management
of the state of Nevada, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse,
and submit evidence of such notification to the federal insurance
administration;
      2.   Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not
diminished.
   E.   Interpretation Of Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) Boundaries: The
county building inspector will make interpretations, where needed, as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for
example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in sections
14.04.230 and
14.04.240 of this chapter.
   F.   Maintenance Of Flood Protection Measures: The maintenance of any and
all flood protection measures (levees, dikes, dams or reservoirs) will be
required of the jurisdiction where such measures provide protection. If these
measures are privately owned, an operation or maintenance plan will be required
of the owner to be on file with the county building inspector. The county
commissioners are required to acknowledge all maintenance plans by the adoption
of such plans by ordinance.
   G.   Hazard Mitigation Plan: The Mineral County regional planning commission
and the Mineral County commissioners are responsible for reviewing all
proposals for new development and shall weigh all requests for future
floodplain development against the community's master plan. Consideration of
the following elements are required before approval:
      1.   Determination of whether or not a proposed development is in or
affects a known flood hazard area;
      2.   Inform the public of the proposed activity;
      3.   Determine if there is a practicable alternative or site for the
proposed activity;
      4.   Identify impact of the activity on the floodplain;
      5.   Approve a plan to mitigate the impact of the activity with
provisions in subsection A of this section.
   H.   Submission Of New Technical Data To FEMA: When Mineral County's base
flood elevations either increase or decrease resulting from physical changes
affecting flooding conditions, as soon as practicable, but not later than six
(6) months after the date such information becomes available, Mineral County
will submit the technical or scientific data to FEMA. Such submissions are
necessary so that upon confirmation of the physical changes affecting flooding
conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements will be
based upon current data. (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.140: GENERAL STANDARDS:
In all areas of special flood hazard, the following standards are required:
   A.   Anchoring:
      1.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movements of the structure.
      2.   All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods
and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but
are not limited to, use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors
(reference FEMA's "Manufactured Home Installation In Flood Hazard Areas"
guidebook for additional techniques).
   B.   Construction Materials And Methods:
      1.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
      2.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      3.   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise
elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
the components during conditions of flooding. (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.150: ALLUVIAL FANS:
Areas subject to alluvial fan flooding have irregular flow paths that result in
erosion of existing channels and the undermining of fill material. Those areas
are identified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) as AO zones with
velocities.
   A.   All structures must be securely anchored to minimize the impact of the
flood and sediment damage.
   B.   All new construction and substantial improvements must be elevated on
pilings, columns or armored fill so that the bottom lowest floor beam is
elevated at or above the depth number.
   C.   Use of all fill materials must be armored to protect the material from
the velocity of the flood flow.
   D.   All proposals for parcel map development and subdivision development
must provide a mitigation plan that identifies the engineering methods used to:
      1.   Protect structures from erosion and scour caused by the velocity of
the flood flow;
      2.   Capture or transport flood and sediment flow through the development
to a safe point of disposition.
   E.   All mobile homes shall be prohibited within the identified hazard area
except within existing mobile home parks. (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.160: STANDARDS FOR STORAGE OF MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT:
   A.   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding,
buoyant, flammable, explosive or could be injurious to human, animal, or plant
life, is prohibited.
   B.   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if not subject
to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or if
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
(Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.170: STANDARDS FOR UTILITIES:
   A.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
   B.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into floodwaters.
   C.   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding. (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.180: PARCEL MAP AND SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS:
   A.   All preliminary parcel map and subdivision proposals shall identify the
flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood.
   B.   All parcel map and subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the
need to minimize flood damage.
   C.   All parcel map and subdivision proposals shall have public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage.
   D.   All parcel map and subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage
provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
   E.   Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not
available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for parcel
map and subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at
least fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres (whichever is less). (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.190: REVIEW OF BUILDING PERMITS:
Where elevation data is not available either through the flood insurance study
or from another authoritative source (subsection
14.04.130B of this chapter), applications for building permits shall be
reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from
flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of
historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where
available. Failure to elevate at least two feet (2') above grade in these zones
may result in higher insurance rates. (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.200: SPECIFIC STANDARDS:
In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has been
provided as set forth in subsection
14.04.130B or section
14.04.060 of this chapter, the following provisions are required:
   A.   Residential Construction:
      1.   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
base flood elevation.
      2.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to
flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
         a.   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1')
above grade.
         c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers or other coverings
or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
   B.   Nonresidential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level
of the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall:
      1.   Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      2.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
      3.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that
the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their
development and/or review of the structural design specifications and plans.
Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in
subsection
14.04.130C2 of this chapter;
      4.   Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must
meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in
subsection A2 of this section;
      5.   Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified
that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot (1')
below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building constructed on the base flood
level will be rated as 1 foot below that level).
   C.   Manufactured Homes: All manufactured homes to be placed or
substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH and AE shall be elevated on a
permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at
or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of subsection
14.04.140A2 of this chapter.
   D.   Recreational Vehicles: All recreational vehicles placed on sites within
the floodplain on the community's flood insurance rate map will either:
      1.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
days;
      2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle
is ready for highway use if it is on wheels or a jacking system, is attached to
the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has
no permanently attached additions; or
      3.   Will meet the permit requirements of section
14.04.190 of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for
manufactured homes in subsection C of this section. (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.210: FLOODWAYS:
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section
14.04.060 of this chapter are areas designed as floodways. Since the floodway
is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions
apply:
   A.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered
professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments
shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge.
   B.   If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of sections
14.04.140 through
14.04.220 of this chapter. (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.220: ENCROACHMENTS:
The cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point. (Ord. 213A,
2010)
14.04.230: APPEAL BOARD DECIDES VARIANCE REQUESTS/APPEALS:
   A.   The appeal board, which shall be composed of three (3) members, who
shall be the fire chief of the Mineral County fire department, the chairman of
the county regional planning commission and the vice chairman of the county
local emergency planning commission, as established by the board of county
commissioners shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
   B.   The appeal board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there
is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the county
building inspector in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   C.   Those aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board, or any taxpayer,
may appeal such decision to the district court, pursuant to chapter 233B of
Nevada Revised Statutes for judicial review.
   D.   In passing upon such applications, the appeal board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards, etc., specified in
other sections of this chapter, and:
      1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effects of such damage on the individual owner;
      4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      5.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      6.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
is not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site;
      11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges.
   E.   Upon consideration of the factors of this section and section
14.04.240 of this chapter and the purpose of this chapter, the appeal board may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purpose of this chapter.
   F.   The county building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the federal insurance administration upon
request. (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.240: VARIANCE; CONDITIONS GOVERNING DECISION:
   A.   Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation
standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to
be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre in size contiguous to and surrounded
by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level,
providing items in section
14.04.230 of this chapter, have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
   B.   Variances shall not be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or
state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth
in the remainder of this section.
   C.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   D.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   E.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant;
      3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization to the
public, as identified in subsection
14.04.230D of this chapter or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   F.   Variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are
based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece
of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the
structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily
address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such,
variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare.
   G.   Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited
circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry
floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage
potential, complies with all other variance criteria except subsection A of
this section, and otherwise complies with section
14.04.140 of this chapter.
   H.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of the flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation. (Ord. 213A, 2010)
14.04.250: EXEMPTION FROM FLOOD INSURANCE REQUIREMENT:
There are two (2) methods of appeal that exempt a structure from the purchase
of flood insurance; both must be supported by the items listed below:
   A.   Appeal To Elevation Requirements:
      1.   An actual stamped copy of the recorded plat map of the property
showing official recordation and proper citation, or a photocopy of property's
legal description (e.g., lot, block and plat number, etc.);
      2.   A copy of the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) and/or flood

16.02.010: TITLE:
This title shall be known, cited, and referred to as the MINERAL COUNTY
SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE. (Ord. 209A, 2010)
16.02.020: POLICY:
   A.   It is the policy of the county to consider the subdivision of land, and
the subsequent development of the subdivided plat, as subject to the control of
the county pursuant to the master plan to assure orderly, planned, efficient,
and economical development.
   B.   Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used
safely for building purposes without imminent danger to health or from fire,
flood, earthquake, or other menace, and land shall not be subdivided until
proper provision has been made for public facilities and improvements such as
drainage, water, sewerage, schools, parks, recreation, transportation, and
utilities.
   C.   The existing and proposed public improvements shall conform to and be
properly related to the proposals shown in the master plan and the public
improvement program. It is intended that these regulations shall supplement and
facilitate the enforcement of the provisions and standards contained in the
building and housing codes and in the zoning ordinance. (Ord. 209A, 2010)
16.02.030: PURPOSE:
This title is adopted to regulate the division of land and to require the
construction of certain prescribed improvements which are needed as a
consequence of the division of land. The design, improvement, mapping and sale
of subdivision lots and parcel map lots, and the division of land into large
parcels are regulated by Nevada Revised Statutes chapters 278, 278A and 117 and
by this title. Specific purposes are as follows:
   A.   To promote public health, safety, convenience and general welfare by
ensuring development of land in a manner consistent with community objectives
as set forth in the master plan and subarea plans;
   B.   To preserve and protect the natural environment and to safeguard
against excessive stormwater runoff, erosion and flooding;
   C.   To ensure, at the time of land division, the provision of adequate
water supply, storm drainage, sewage disposal, and other utilities, services
and improvements needed as a consequence of any change or intensification of
the land use;
   D.   To encourage conservation of natural resources, e.g., streambeds,
ridgelines, scenic areas, currently assuring coordination with a system of open
space and trails;
   E.   To facilitate, through orderly design and development, law enforcement,
fire protection and other services;
   F.   To safeguard the general welfare by limiting the division of land in
proposals for major development in isolated areas where provision of public
services results in excessive costs and low efficiency of service;
   G.   To ensure that governmental maintenance costs are minimized by
requiring timely and coordinated installation of improvements adequate in size
and quality;
   H.   To provide road rights of way of adequate capacity for arterial traffic
and, at the same time, design a system minimizing through traffic on
residential streets;
   I.   To ensure that streets and roads are designed so as to minimize safety
hazards to vehicles and their occupants as well as to pedestrians;
   J.   To assure a circulation pattern within the subdivision which is well
integrated into the existing roadway pattern, and to provide the most
beneficial access to and relationship between the uses of the land and
buildings and the circulation of traffic throughout the county;
   K.   To encourage an organized continuum of urban development by
establishing conditions favoring agricultural uses in appropriate locations,
thereby reducing taxpayer costs engendered by the need to provide utilities and
public services to a scattered, inconvenient pattern of urban activities. (Ord.
209A, 2010)
16.02.040: MASTER PLAN:
The master plan shall guide the use of all land within the county. The type and
intensity of land use as shown on the master plan shall be used as a guide to
determine the character of land division including lot size and arrangement and
the type and extent of streets, roads, highways, and other utilities and public
facilities that shall be provided by the subdivider. (Ord. 209A, 2010)
16.02.050: AUTHORITY:
This title is adopted and codified pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS)
chapters 117, 278 and 278A. All terms used and defined in this title shall have
the same meaning as ascribed thereto in Nevada Revised Statutes or as they may
hereafter be amended, except that, where appropriate from the context, the term
"subdivision" shall be construed to include all divisions of land. The
provisions of this title are supplemental to the provisions of the statutes.
(Ord. 209A, 2010)
16.02.060: JURISDICTION:
   A.   These subdivision regulations shall apply to all subdivisions of land,
as defined in this title, located within the jurisdiction of the Mineral County
commissioners.
   B.   No land shall be subdivided within the county until:
      1.   The subdivider or his agent files an application, pays the required
fees, with the required documentation to the county clerk's office.
      2.   The planning commission recommends approval of the tentative map and
the final map.
      3.   The Mineral County board of commissioners approves the tentative map
and the final map.
      4.   The county recorder records the final map only after the final map
is approved by the county commissioners.
   C.   No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any
parcel or plat of land which was created by subdivision after the effective
date of, and not in conformity with, the provisions of these subdivision
regulations, and no excavation of land or construction of any public or private
improvements shall take place or be commenced except in conformity with these
subdivision regulations. (Ord. 209A, 2010)
16.02.070: RESERVED:
(Ord. 209A, 2010)
16.02.080: DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY:
The planning commission shall authorize an appropriate agent to accept parcel
maps, tentative subdivision maps, maps of division into large parcels,

appropriate action. The planning commission is further empowered to authorize a
surveyor and/or an engineer to review the technical requirements of a proposal
at the expense of the applicant. (Ord. 209A, 2010)
16.02.090: INTERPRETATION:
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these regulations
shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public
health, safety, and general welfare. (Ord. 209A, 2010)
16.02.100: CONFLICT WITH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROVISIONS:
   A.   Public Provisions: These regulations are not intended to interfere
with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or
other provisions of law. Where any provision of these regulations imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other provisions of these
regulations or any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of
law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall
control.
   B.   Private Provisions: These regulations are not intended to abrogate any
easement, covenant or any other private agreement or restriction; provided,
that where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose
higher standards, the requirements of these regulations shall govern. (Ord.
209A, 2010)
16.02.110: AMENDMENTS:
For the purpose of providing for public health, safety, and general welfare,
the planning commission may duly recommend to amend the provisions imposed by
these subdivision regulations. Public hearings on all proposed amendments shall
be held by the planning commission in the manner prescribed by law. (Ord. 209A,
2010)
16.02.120: CONDITIONS:
Attachment of reasonable conditions to land subdivision is an exercise of valid
police power delegated by the state to this county. The developer has the duty
of compliance with reasonable conditions laid down by the planning commission
and the county commissions for design, dedication, improvement, and restrictive
use of the land so as to conform to the physical and economic development of
the county and to the safety and general welfare of the future owners in the
subdivision and of the community at large. (Ord. 209A, 2010)
16.02.130: RESUBDIVISION OF LAND:
   A.   Procedure For Resubdivision: For any change in a map of an approved or
recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown, or
area reserved thereon for public use, or any lot line, or if it affects any map
or plan legal prior to the adoption of any regulations controlling subdivision,
such parcel shall be approved by the planning commission by the same procedure,
rules, and regulations as for a subdivision and pursuant to Nevada Revised
Statutes 278.473 through 278.477 inclusive.
   B.   Procedure For Subdivisions Where Future Resubdivision Is Indicated:
Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or
more lots containing more than one acre of land, and there are indications that
such lots will eventually be resubdivided into small building sites, the
planning commission may require that such parcel of land allow for the future
opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. Easements
providing for the future opening and extension of such streets may be made a
requirement of the plat. (Ord. 209A, 2010)
16.02.140: VACATION OR ABANDONMENT OF STREETS, EASEMENTS OR PLATS, AND
REVERSION TO ACREAGE:

Ord. 241A, 3-7-2018)
17.06.020: ADOPTION OF ZONING MAP:
The several Districts and boundaries thereof are established and adopted as
shown on that document entitled Zoning Map and updated from time to time as
required to compensate for individual amendments. Said Map when approved
pursuant to NRS 278.260 reflects an attempt to comply with the County’s Master
Plan with respect to uses allowed in a specific area. Strict conformity with
the Master Plan is not required, however a goal. Ref: NRS 278.250. (MC Ord. 19A

In the creation of this Title and inclusion of the Zoning Map(s) the County has
given due and careful consideration to the suitability of each zone district
for the regulations applied thereto. The location and extent of each district
and the comprehensive grouping and arrangement of the various uses and
densities of population in accordance with a well-considered plan for the
development of Mineral County and its desirable relationship to adjoining
jurisdictions. (MC Ord. 19A Art. 4 § C, 1965: amd. Ord. 241A, 3-7-2018)
17.06.040: INTERPRETATION OF ZONE DISTRICT BOUNDARIES:
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of Zoning Districts, as shown,
the following shall apply:
   A.   Boundaries are intended to parallel street lines or to follow lot or
property lines as they exist at the time of passage hereof or amendments hereto
unless specifically shown otherwise. Where a zone boundary line divides a lot
in single ownership, the regulations of the least restrictive portion of such
lot shall prevail for an extension of not more than fifty feet (50') into the
most restrictive portion.
   B.   In the event of further uncertainty, the planning commission shall
interpret intent as to the boundary location. (MC Ord. 19A Art. 4 § D, 1965:

2018)
17.06.060: ANNOTATING ZONE DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGES:
Any change to the adopted Zoning Map(s) requires the same procedure as in the
creation of the Zoning Map in the first instance. A request is made for a
Change of Land Use (zoning) and all notifications, hearings and publications,
pursuant to NRS 278.260 shall be compiled with. If the individual request for a
change of zoning is found not to reflect the land use as assigned in that area
by the adopted Master Plan, an additional application for a Master Plan
Amendment must precede the change of zoning request. (MC Ord. 19A Art. 4 § F,

may apply for a waiver of the distance requirements as part of its application.
The granting of such waiver is in the discretion of the board and may only be
granted upon affirmative findings on all the other subsections in this section.

commission of the Board of County Commissioners following a progress report
presented at an open meeting of the commission. If the applicant has not

and not limited to, a flood, damage, or destruction of the access to the site,
earthquake, or other events beyond the control of the county or permit holder,

the permit holder may be found to once again have reasonable access to the
site. In this case, the permit shall remain valid as long as the permit holder,
its heirs, assigns, or successors remain in compliance with the terms of this
permit and county, state, and federal regulations. In the event that the permit
lapses or the use is discontinued or abandoned, the permit holder/ owner, its
heirs, assigns, or successors shall remain responsible for environmental
compliance until post-closure reclamation requirements are met. If the facility
is not being abandoned, but is not in operation for greater than two tears for
as reason such as equipment failure, replacement, or maintenance, the project
contractor shall notify Mineral County in writing indicating an estimated time
line for operations to recommence. (MC Ord. 19A Art. 23 § F, 1965; Ord. 241A,

business licenses. (Ord. 176A § 4, 2002)
18.08.050: QUALITY OF USE AND MAINTENANCE:
Franchisee agrees that the electrical system it installs, maintains, operates
and uses pursuant to this franchise will be installed, maintained, operated,
and used in accordance with good engineering and utility practices and in
compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of the
United States, the state of Nevada, and Mineral County in effect or as
subsequently amended. Sierra is granted the right to trim trees along streets,
alleys, and public grounds of Mineral County and any extension thereof in order
to provide and maintain a safe installation of high voltage wires necessary,
convenient, or useful in the operation of its said system. Sierra will comply
with its tree trimming standards for trimming trees. (Ord. 176A § 5, 2002)
18.08.060: REPAIR:
If franchisee's installation, maintenance, operation and use of its electrical
system causes damage to the surface or subsurface of any public road or
adjoining public property or to any public improvement located thereon, the
franchisee, at its own expense, will repair or replace such damage reasonably
promptly after completing the installation, maintenance, operation and use of
the electrical system, to as good order and condition in which they were prior
to being disturbed or excavated by Sierra. (Ord. 176A § 6, 2002)
18.08.070: PERMITS:
Prior to major construction of new electric power lines and appurtenances equal
to or larger than one hundred twenty (120) kV in size, or major extension or
relocation of such facilities already in existence, franchisee shall obtain all
required permits from Mineral County. No such prior permission or permits shall
be required for power lines smaller than one hundred twenty (120) kV in size,
or appurtenances thereto except for street cutting permits. When Sierra has
obtained a street cutting permit for purposes of installing, maintaining, and
using said electric power lines and appurtenances or any part thereof, Sierra
shall promptly (but in no case later than 30 days) at its own cost and expense,
place said public roads or so much thereof as may have been damaged in as good
order and condition in which they were prior to being disturbed or excavated by
Sierra. For emergency repairs and for minor construction, extension, relocation
or other laying and using of electric power lines and appurtenances pursuant to
this franchise which requires a street cut, franchisee shall notify Mineral
County within a reasonable period of time subsequent to the completion of such
work and obtain any required street cutting permits at that time without any
penalty for performing work prior to obtaining the required street cutting
permit. (Ord. 176A § 7, 2002)
18.08.080: LOCATION AND RELOCATION:
The installation, maintenance, operation and use of franchisee's electrical
system within the franchise territory will be in a manner so as not to
unreasonably interfere with the placement, construction, maintenance and use of
county street lighting, water pipes, drains, sewers, streets, avenues, alleys,
roads, traffic signal systems or other county systems (hereafter referred to as
"county facilities") that have been, or may be constructed by Mineral County.
Whenever Mineral County reasonably determines that the relocation of a portion
of franchisee's electric facilities is necessary to accommodate installation or
modification of county facilities, franchisee may be required to relocate
within another location in the franchise territory said portion of its
facilities normally within one hundred fifty (150) days for low voltage (24.9
kV and below) and two hundred seventy (270) days for high voltage (60 kV and
above). Such relocation shall be at the expense of the franchisee unless one of
the following two (2) conditions occur:
   A.   The relocation is required or requested due to the actions or inaction
of any party other than Mineral County. In this circumstance the third party
would be solely responsible for the cost of any relocation and the franchisee
would not be required to relocate facilities until such time that the third
party compensates in cash in U.S. dollars or other manner acceptable to the
franchisee for any required relocation or provides a guarantee of payment for
any required relocation that is acceptable to the franchisee.
   B.   The installation or modification of county facilities encroaches upon
the preexisting easements, rights of way, or any other land rights or interests
in land, held or claimed by, the franchisee. Where franchisee has prior
existing land rights, Mineral County agrees to provide for replacement land
rights for the relocated facilities.
Where relocation is at the expense of Sierra, Mineral County agrees to provide
a suitable substitute right of way. (Ord. 176A § 8, 2002)
18.08.090: UNDERGROUNDING OF EXISTING FACILITIES:
The franchisee shall not be required to remove existing overhead facilities and
place them underground without full compensation for the costs for such
activities. Compensation shall include, but not be limited to, the remaining
depreciated value of the existing facilities to be removed, removal costs of
existing facilities, installation of the new underground facilities and the
reconnection costs for existing customers. The franchisee is not responsible
for the conversion of the customer's panels from overhead service to
underground service. Where the facilities have deteriorated and are scheduled
to be replaced by the franchisee, the franchisee shall participate in the costs
for installing the facilities underground in a dollar amount equal to that
which the franchisee would have incurred to replace them as overhead
facilities. (Ord. 176A § 9, 2002)
18.08.100: TWO PERCENT NET PROFITS FEE:
The franchisee shall pay to the county treasurer of Mineral County, state of
Nevada, annually on the first Monday of July of each year, two percent (2%) of
the net profits, if any, made by franchisee in its operation of electric heat,
light and power lines in the county of Mineral, state of Nevada for the
preceding calendar year. (Ord. 176A § 10, 2002)
18.08.110: DEFAULT:
If the franchisee fails to perform any of its obligations under this chapter,
and fails within thirty (30) days after written notice from Mineral County to
perform, Mineral County will have the right to seek immediate remedy to the
unperformed action. (Ord. 176A § 11, 2002)
18.08.120: DISPUTE RESOLUTION:
In the event franchisee and Mineral County are unable to resolve any issues
concerning the terms and/or conditions set forth in this chapter, either party
may, at any time, notify the other party in writing of the commencement of the
dispute resolution process described in this paragraph. Within five (5)
business days of the commencement of the dispute resolution process, the
parties shall meet in good faith in an effort to resolve the dispute. If the
parties are not able to resolve their dispute within thirty (30) days after
meeting in good faith, they may mutually accept arbitration.
If franchisee and Mineral County mutually accept arbitration, they become
subject to binding arbitration under the American Arbitrators Association. The
arbitration panel shall consist of three (3) arbitrators. Each party shall
appoint one arbitrator and the two (2) arbitrators appointed by the parties
shall select the third arbitrator. If the two (2) arbitrators appointed by the
parties cannot agree on a third arbitrator the binding arbitration ends and the
parties may use other means to seek resolution to the dispute. The parties will
equally incur the cost of arbitration prior to the decision being rendered by
the arbitrators. The arbitrators will apportion responsibility for the costs
associated with the arbitration, which may entail having one party reimburse
the other for some or all of the costs incurred. (Ord. 176A § 12, 2002)
18.08.130: TERMINATION OF JURISDICTION:
This franchise will cease to apply to any public road if and when Mineral
County ceases to have jurisdiction over or ceases to be obligated to maintain
said public road, but nothing in this section may be construed as obligating
the franchisee to assume jurisdiction over or to maintain said public road.
(Ord. 176A § 13, 2002)
18.08.140: HOLD HARMLESS:
The franchise will indemnify, defend, and hold Mineral County harmless from any
and all claims, including demands, actions, damages, decrees, judgments,
attorney fees, costs and expenses, that are directly caused by franchisee's
negligent installation, maintenance, or use of its electrical system.
Franchisee shall not indemnify, defend, or hold Mineral County harmless from
any independent claim against Mineral County. In the event claim against
franchisee and Mineral County is received first by Mineral County, Mineral
County will promptly furnish the franchisee all related information in its
possession or control, and will fully cooperate with franchisee in franchisee's
defense of such claim.
Neither party will settle or otherwise compromise any claim without the other
party's written consent. (Ord. 176A § 14, 2002)
18.08.150: VALIDITY:
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, word, or other portion of
this chapter is found to be illegal, said section, subsection, sentence,
clause, phrase, word, or other portion will be deemed a separate, distinct and
independent provision and the finding of illegality will not affect the
validity of the remaining provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 176A § 15, 2002)
18.08.160: COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER COUNTY ORDINANCES:
Nothing contained in this chapter excuses franchisee from obtaining a business
license from Mineral County in compliance with applicable ordinances. (Ord.
176A § 16, 2002)
18.08.170: FRANCHISE GRANTED:
Sierra Pacific Power Company its successors and assigns, are hereby granted the

receipts and expenses for the preceding year and the net profits, if any, for
the same period. (Ord. 176A § 18, 2002)
