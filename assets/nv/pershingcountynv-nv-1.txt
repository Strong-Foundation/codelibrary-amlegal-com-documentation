of Taxation shall establish the sales price as a value which is based on the
depreciated value of the vehicle as determined in accordance with the schedule
in Section

3.04.190: RESALE CERTIFICATE; PRESUMPTION OF TAXABILITY:
For the purpose of the proper administration of the Relief Tax Ordinance and to
prevent evasion of the sales tax it is to be presumed that all gross receipts
are subject to the tax until the contrary is established. The burden of proving
that a sale of tangible personal property is not a sale at retail is upon the
person who makes the sale unless he takes from the purchaser a certificate to
the effect that the property is purchased for resale. (Ord. 106 §3(F), 1989)
3.04.200: RESALE CERTIFICATE; EFFECT:
The certificate relieves the seller from the burden of proof only if taken in
good faith from a person who is engaged in the business of selling tangible
personal property and who holds the permit provided for in Sections
3.04.140 through
3.04.240 of this Article, inclusive, and who, at the time of purchasing the
tangible personal property, intends to sell it in the regular course of
business or is unable to ascertain at the time of purchase whether the property

may prescribe. (Ord. 106 §3(H), 1989)
3.04.220: RESALE CERTIFICATE; LIABILITY:
If a purchaser who gives a certificate makes any use of the property other than
retention, demonstration or display while holding it for sale in the regular
course of business, the use shall be taxable to the purchaser as of the time
the property is first used by him, and the sales price of the property to him
shall be deemed the measure of the tax. Only when there is an unsatisfied use
tax liability on this basis shall the seller be liable for sales tax with
respect to the sale of the property to the purchaser. If the sole use of the
property other than retention, demonstration or display in the regular course
of business is the rental of the property while holding it for sale, the
purchaser may elect to include in his gross receipts the amount of the rental
charged rather than the sale price of the property to him. (Ord. 106 §3(I),
1989)
3.04.230: RESALE CERTIFICATE; IMPROPER USE; PENALTY:
Any person who gives a resale certificate for property which he knows at the

applicable to the transaction is guilty of a misdemeanor. (Ord. 106 §3(J),
1989)

If a purchaser gives a certificate with respect to the purchase of fungible
goods and thereafter commingles these goods with other fungible goods not so
purchased but of such similarity that the identity of the constituent goods in
the commingled mass cannot be determined, sales from the mass of commingled
goods shall be deemed to be sales of the goods so purchased until a quantity of
commingled goods equal to the quantity of purchased goods so commingled has
been sold. (Ord. 106 §3(K), 1989)

personal property is not then taxable hereunder, at the time the storage, use
or other consumption becomes taxable, collect the tax from the purchaser and
give to the purchaser a receipt therefor in the manner and form prescribed by
the Department. (Ord. 106 §4(C), 1989)

the effect that the property is purchased for resale. (Ord. 106 §4(I), 1989)
3.04.340: RESALE CERTIFICATE; EFFECT:

demonstration or display while holding it for sale in the regular course of
business, the storage or use is taxable as of the time the property is first so
stored or used. If the sole use of the property, other than retention,
demonstration or display in the regular course of business, is the rental of
the property while holding it for sale, the purchaser may elect to pay the tax,
on the use measured by the amount of the rental charged rather than the sales
price of the property to him. (Ord. 106 §4(L), 1989)
3.04.370: RESALE CERTIFICATE; COMMINGLED FUNGIBLE GOODS:

use at a designated point or points outside this County;

Commission on such excess motor vehicle fuel the excise tax required to be paid

than one payment of any excise tax upon or in respect to the same fuel. (Ord.
148, 1996: Ord. 60 Art. IV(B), 1976)
3.08.150: EXEMPT TRANSACTIONS AND SALES:

   D.   Motor vehicle fuel distributed, or delivered on the order of the owner
to a dealer who has furnished bond and security in the amount prescribed, and
who has established to the satisfaction of the Nevada Tax Commission that the

become due to the County from him under this Chapter. Every dealer claiming
exemption shall report the distributions to the Nevada Tax Commission in such
detail as the Tax Commission may require; otherwise, the exemptions granted in
this Chapter shall be void and all fuel shall be considered distributed in the
County subject fully to the provisions of this Chapter. (Ord. 60 Art. V(A),
1976)
3.08.160: EXEMPT SALES BY DEALER IN CERTAIN QUANTITIES:
   A.   The provisions of this Chapter requiring the payment of excise taxes
shall not apply to motor vehicle fuel sold by a dealer in individual quantities
of five hundred (500) gallons or less for export to another state by the
purchaser other than in the supply tank of a motor vehicle, provided such
dealer is licensed in the state of destination to collect and remit the
applicable destination state taxes thereon.
   B.   In support of any exemption from taxes on account of sales of motor
vehicle fuel in individual quantities of five hundred (500) gallons or less for
export by the purchaser, the dealer shall retain in his files for at least
three (3) years an export certificate executed by the purchaser in such form
and containing such information as shall be prescribed by the Nevada Tax
Commission. This certificate shall be prima facie evidence of the exportation
of the motor vehicle fuel to which it applies only if accepted by the dealer in
good faith. However, should the purchaser not export any part of the motor
vehicle fuel covered by the certificate, he shall be required to remit to the
Tax Commission immediately thereafter, the applicable amount in taxes due on
such part not exported. Upon failure to do so, the purchaser shall be subject
to all penalties provided herein for delinquency in payment of taxes. (Ord. 60
Art. V(B), 1976)

Any claim for exemption from excise tax on account of motor vehicle fuel
exported by a dealer to another state, other than stock transfers or deliveries
in his own equipment, must be made by the dealer within six (6) months after
the date of the export, unless the state or territory of destination would not
be prejudiced with respect to its collection of taxes thereon, should the claim
not be made within such time. (Ord. 60 Art. V(D), 1976)
3.08.190: UNRECOGNIZED EXPORTS:
Motor vehicle fuel carried out of this County into another state or onto
Federal proprietary lands or reservations, in an amount not exceeding twenty
five (25) gallons in the fuel tank or tanks of such motor vehicle, shall not be
deemed to be exported for the purposes of Sections
3.08.150,
3.08.160,
3.08.170 and
3.08.180 of this Chapter. (Ord. 60 Art. V(E), 1976)
3.08.200: DEALERS' BONDS:
   A.   Before granting any license the Nevada Tax Commission shall require the
applicant to file with the Nevada Tax Commission a bond executed by the
applicant as principal, and by a corporation qualified under the laws of this
State as surety, payable to the State, and conditioned upon the faithful
performance of all the requirements of this Chapter and upon the punctual
payment of all excise taxes, penalties and other obligations of the applicant
as a dealer.
   B.   The total amount of the bond or bonds required of any dealer may be
fixed by the Nevada Tax Commission at three (3) times the estimated maximum
monthly tax, determined in such a manner as the Nevada Tax Commission deems
proper. If the Nevada Tax Commission determines that a person is habitually
delinquent in the payment of amounts due pursuant to this Chapter, it may
increase the amount of his security to not more than five (5) times the
estimated maximum monthly tax. When cash or a savings certificate, certificate
of deposit or investment certificate is used, the amount required must be
rounded off to the next larger integral multiple of one hundred dollars
($100.00), within the same upper limit.
   C.   The Nevada Tax Commission may increase or decrease the amount of
security required by this Section subject to the limitations provided in this
Section.
   D.   No recovery on any bond, nor the execution of any new bond, nor the
revocation, cancellation or suspension of any license affects the validity of
any bond.
   E.   In lieu of any bond or bonds, a dealer may deposit with the Nevada Tax
Commission, under such terms and conditions as the Nevada Tax Commission may
prescribe, a like amount of lawful money of the United States or any other form
of security authorized by Nevada Revised Statutes 100.065. If security is
provided in the form of a savings certificate, certificate of deposit or
investment certificate, the certificate must state that the amount is
unavailable for withdrawal except upon order of the Nevada Tax Commission.
(Ord. 148, 1996: Ord. 60 Art. V(F), 1976)
3.08.210: COLLECTION OF TAXES:
   A.   The excise tax prescribed in this Chapter shall be paid on or before
the twenty fifth day of each calendar month to the Nevada Tax Commission. The
Tax Commission shall deliver all such taxes to the State Treasurer, who shall
receipt the dealer or user therefor.
   B.   From the tax found to be due upon any statement duly and punctually
rendered, the dealer or user shall be allowed to deduct two percent (2%) to
cover the dealer's or user's costs of collection of the tax and of compliance
with the Ordinance codified in this Chapter and the dealer's or user's handling
losses occasioned by evaporation, spillage or other similar causes. (Ord. 60
Art. VI(A), 1976)
3.08.220: DELINQUENT TAXES:
   A.   If the amount of any excise tax for any month is not paid to the State
on or before the twenty fifth day of the next month, it becomes delinquent at
the close of business on that day. A dealer or user may have up to fifteen (15)
additional days to make the payment, if he makes application to the Nevada Tax
Commission and the Nevada Tax Commission finds good cause for the extension.
   B.   The proceeds from any penalty levied for the delinquent payment of an
excise tax must be allocated proportionately to the County Gas Tax Funds and
the State Highway Fund. (Ord. 148, 1996: Ord. 60 Art. VI(B), 1976)

Commission shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of the tax and penalty
and of the obligation therefor of the person named in such certificate. (Ord.
60 Art. VI(D), 1976)
3.08.250: TAX REFUNDS:
Any person who shall export any motor vehicle fuel from this State, or who
shall sell any such fuel to the United States Government for official use of
the United States Armed Forces, or who shall buy and use any such fuel for
purposes other than, in, and for the propulsion of motor vehicles, and who
shall have paid any tax on such fuel levied or directed to be paid as provided
by this Chapter, either directly by the collection of such tax by the vendor
from such consumer or indirectly by the addition of the amount of such tax to
the price of such fuel, shall be reimbursed and repaid the amount of such tax
so paid by him, except as follows:
   A.   Refund claims shall be paid by prescribed classes, in accordance with
the Nevada Tax Commission's regulations;
   B.   The minimum claim for refund shall be based on at least two hundred
(200) gallons purchased and used in a six (6) month period;
   C.   No refund of County motor vehicle fuel taxes shall be made for off-
highway use of motor vehicle fuel consumed in watercraft in this State for
recreational purposes. (Ord. 148, 1996: Ord. 60 Art. VII(A), 1976)
3.08.260: PRESENTATION OF REFUND CLAIM; AFFIDAVIT; ORIGINAL INVOICES:
   A.   A claimant for refund shall present to the Tax Commission a refund
claim form, accompanied by the original invoices showing the purchase. The
refund forms shall state the total amount of such fuel so purchased and used by
the consumer otherwise than for the propulsion of motor vehicles and the manner
and the equipment in which the claimant has used the same.
   B.   A claimant for refund of tax on motor vehicle fuel purchased and
exported from this State shall execute and furnish to the Nevada Tax Commission
a certificate of exportation on such form as may be prescribed by the Tax
Commission.
   C.   An invoice to qualify for refund shall contain at least:
      1.   The number of gallons of motor vehicle fuel purchased;
      2.   The price per gallon;
      3.   The total purchase price of the motor vehicle fuel; and
      4.   Such other information as may be prescribed by the Nevada Tax
Commission.
   D.   The signature on the refund claim form shall subject the claimant to
the charge of perjury for false statements contained on the refund application.
   E.   Daily records shall be maintained and preserved for a period of three
(3) years for audit purposes of all motor vehicle fuel used. The record shall
set forth:
      1.   The piece of equipment being supplied with the fuel;
      2.   The number of gallons of fuel used in each fill; and
      3.   The purpose for which the piece of equipment will be used.
   F.   The gasoline fills shall be further classified as to on- or off-highway
use.
   G.   When a motor vehicle with auxiliary equipment consumes motor vehicle
fuel and there is no auxiliary motor or a separate tank for such motor, a
refund of twenty percent (20%) of the tax paid on the fuel used in such vehicle
may be claimed without the necessity of furnishing proof of the amount of fuel
consumed in the operation of the auxiliary equipment. Where claims for refund
exceed twenty percent (20%), the Nevada Tax Commission shall, by rules and
regulations, establish uniform refund provisions for the respective classes of
users.
   H.   No person may be granted a refund of motor vehicle fuel taxes for off-
highway use when such consumption takes place on highways constructed and
maintained by public funds, on Federal proprietary lands or reservations where
the claimant has no ownership or control over such land or highways, except
when such person is under a contractual relationship with the Federal
Government or one of its agencies and is engaged in the performance of his
duties pursuant to such relationship. Employment of an individual by the
Federal Government or any of its agencies does not constitute a contractual
relationship for the purposes of this Chapter.
   I.   When, in the opinion of the Nevada Tax Commission, it would be
beneficial to the State for a refund claimant to become a licensed dealer, such
claimant may, at the option of the Tax Commission, be required to become a
licensed dealer, rather than a refund claimant, unless such claimant chooses to
claim refunds at the tax rate, less two percent (2%). (Ord. 60 Art. VII(B),
1976)
3.08.270: REFUND PAYMENT:
Upon the presentation of such affidavits, invoices, written statements, tax
exemption certificates or exportation certificates, the Nevada Tax Commission
shall cause to be repaid to the claimant from the taxes collected under this
Chapter, an amount equal to the taxes so paid by the claimant less the
percentage allowed the dealer or user pursuant to Section
3.08.210 of this Chapter. (Ord. 148, 1996: Ord. 60 Art. VII(C), 1976)
3.08.280: REFUND PAYMENT BASED ON DUPLICATE INVOICE:
In the event of the loss of an original invoice, the person claiming a refund
may submit, in lieu thereof, a duplicate copy of the invoice, which shall be
retained by the Nevada Tax Commission until the expiration of the period
specified for filing of refund applications. No payment of refund based upon a
duplicate invoice shall be made until after the expiration of such statutory
period. (Ord. 60 Art. VII(D), 1976)
3.08.290: EXAMINATION OF CLAIMANT'S BOOKS, RECORDS:
In order to establish the validity of any claim, the Nevada Tax Commission may,
upon demand, examine the books and records of the claimant for such purpose.
The failure of the claimant to accede to such demand constitutes a waiver of
all rights to the refund claimed on account of the transactions questioned.
(Ord. 60 Art. VII(E), 1976)
3.08.300: APPLICATION REFUND DEADLINE:
All applications for refund based upon exportations of motor vehicle fuel from

months from the date of exportation. All other applications, together with the
necessary supporting evidence, shall be filed with the Tax Commission within
six (6) months from the date of purchase. All rights to refunds shall be
forfeited if applications are not filed with the Tax Commission within the
times herein prescribed. (Ord. 60 Art. VII(F), 1976)

   A.   All claims for refunds under this Chapter shall be paid from the
combined Gas Tax Fund upon claims presented by the Nevada Tax Commission,
approved by the State Board of Examiners, and allowed and paid as other claims
against the State are allowed and paid.
   B.   Any refunds to be made of the taxes provided for in Sections
3.08.130 and
3.08.140 of this Chapter, shall be paid in the manner provided in this Chapter
and deducted from the amount of any later payment to the County. (Ord. 60 Art.
VII(G), 1976)
3.08.320: CREDIT IN LIEU OF REFUND:
In lieu of the collection and refund of the tax on motor vehicle fuel used by a
dealer in such a manner as would entitle a purchaser to claim refund under the
provisions of this Chapter, or in lieu of the refund of any prior erroneous
payment of tax on motor vehicle fuel to the Nevada Tax Commission made by a
dealer, credit may be given the dealer upon his tax return and assessment.
(Ord. 60 Art. VII(H), 1976)
3.08.330: REFUNDS TO FARMERS, RANCHERS:
   A.   For the purposes of this Chapter, "bulk purchases" means purchases in
excess of fifty (50) gallons of motor vehicle fuel which are not placed
directly into the tanks of motor vehicles.
   B.   Any person determined by the Nevada Tax Commission to be a bona fide
farmer or rancher, not engaged in other activities which would distort his
highway usage, may claim a refund only on the basis of eighty percent (80%) of
his bulk purchases, without the necessity of maintaining records of use.
   C.   Any farmer or rancher desiring to claim a refund under the provisions
of this Chapter must first secure a permit from the Nevada Tax Commission, and
such a permit shall bind the permittee to file claims for refunds under the
provisions of this Chapter until a request has been made for a change of basis
for filing, which request has been approved by the Tax Commission.
   D.   The Tax Commission is empowered to issue reasonable rules and
regulations to carry out the purposes of this Chapter. (Ord. 60 Art. VII(I),
1976)

No injunction or writ of mandate or other legal or equitable process shall ever
issue in any suit, action or proceeding in any court against this State or any
officer thereof to prevent or enjoin the collection under this Chapter of any
excise tax assessed by the Tax Commission. (Ord. 60 Art. VII(J), 1976)
3.08.350: ACTION AGAINST STATE TREASURER; VENUE:
After payment of any excise tax under protest duly verified, served on the
Nevada Tax Commission, and setting forth the grounds of objection to the
legality of the excise tax, the dealer paying the excise tax may bring an
action against the State Treasurer in the District Court in and for Carson City
for the recovery of the excise tax so paid under protest. (Ord. 148, 1996: Ord.
60 Art. VII(K), 1976)
3.08.360: ACTION FOR RECOVERY:
   A.   No action authorized by Section
3.08.350 of this Chapter may be instituted more than ninety (90) days after the
last day prescribed for the payment of the excise tax without penalty. Failure
to bring suit within the ninety (90) days shall constitute a waiver of any and
all demands against the State on account of alleged overpayment of excise
taxes.
   B.   No grounds of illegality of the excise tax shall be considered by the
court other than those set forth in the protest filed at the time of the
payment of the excise tax. (Ord. 60 Art. VII(L), 1976)
3.08.370: JUDGMENT FOR PLAINTIFF; DISPOSITION OF AMOUNT; INTEREST:

(6%) per annum upon the amount of the excise tax found to have been collected
illegally from the date of payment thereof to the date of allowance of credit
on account of such judgment or to a date preceding the date of the refund
warrant by not more than thirty (30) days, such date to be determined by the
Nevada Tax Commission. (Ord. 60 Art. VII(M), 1976)
3.08.380: ACTION IN THE NAME OF ASSIGNEE:
A judgment shall not be rendered in favor of the plaintiff in any action
brought against the State Treasurer to recover any excise tax paid under this
Chapter when such action is brought by or in the name of an assignee of the
dealer paying the excise tax, or by any person, company or corporation other
than the person, company or corporation which has paid the excise tax. (Ord. 60
Art. VII(N), 1976)
3.08.390: DEALERS' RECORDS; CONTENTS; EXAMINATIONS:
   A.   Every dealer shall cause to be kept a true record, in such form as may

of making such examination; but such time shall not exceed one day going to and
one day coming from the place where the examination is to be made, in addition
to the number of days or fractions thereof the examiner is actually engaged in

The board of county commissioners along with the Nevada department of taxation
having carefully considered that there is no other object of taxation, except

visitors to the county in proportion to their respective population and wealth
as to be suitable for the imposition of a tax for the support of Pershing
County through its current financial situation:
   A.   That it is therefore necessary to impose a separate tax upon tangible
personal property sold at retail in the county to provide revenue for capital
improvement and public safety projects of Pershing County;
   B.   That in order to avoid imposing unfair competitive hardships upon
merchants within the county, it is necessary that such additional tax be
imposed:
      1.   At the same rate throughout the county; and
      2.   Upon tangible personal property purchased outside the county for use
within the county;
   C.   That the convenience of the public and of retail merchants will best be
served by imposing the tax for operating county government upon exactly the
same transactions, requiring the same reports and making such tax parallel in
all respects to the existing sales and use taxes. (Ord. 257, 2008)
3.48.040: RATE OF TAX:
An additional sales tax in the amount of one-fourth of one percent (0.25%)
shall be imposed upon all retail sales concurrent with the sales tax now
imposed under this code. (Ord. 257, 2008)
3.48.050: EFFECTIVE DATE:

All amendments to Nevada Revised Statutes, chapter 374 which are enacted after
the date of enactment hereof, which are not inconsistent with the terms of

all functions incident to the administration of this tax before the effective
date hereof. (Ord. 257, 2008)

3.48.050 of this chapter that is attributable to the tax imposed on the gross
receipts upon the sale of, and the storage, use or other consumption, in
Pershing County of tangible personal property used for the performance of a
written contract, provided that: a) under the terms of the contract or bid, the
contract price or bid amount cannot be adjusted to reflect the imposition of

appropriate by Pershing County and adopted as such unless: 1) there are
problems which would inhibit, prohibit, or restrict the Pershing County fire,
rescue, police, and other emergency services from providing services which the
BLM/federal government does not provide; or 2) there are unfunded mandates
placed on Pershing County which are created by the BLM special use/recreation

if the assembly occurs on public lands and the assembly organizer obtains an
annual permit from a federal agency to hold the assembly.
   B.   In order to exercise this discretion to exempt an organization, the
board of Pershing County commissioners, at its discretion and upon receipt of a
request from the assembly organizer, may opt to waive the requirements of this

period of time to be determined in the agreement.

      2.   The assembly organizer shall name Pershing County, its officers and
employees as an additional insured under the commercial general liability

board of Pershing County commissioners, the assembly organizer shall file a
petition for judicial review in the district court within thirty (30) days and
shall have such rights for administrative review as set forth in Nevada Revised
Statutes chapter 233B; and
         h.   Failure of the assembly organizer to comply with any of the time
frames set forth above shall constitute jurisdictional grounds for denying the
requested relief sought by the assembly organizer.
   J.   Regardless of the duration of the agreement, the agreement shall be
conditioned upon the assembly being permitted by the BLM and continuing to
occur each year on public lands. Accordingly, the agreement shall provide that
in any year in which the assembly is held in Pershing County on land that is
not managed by BLM and the event is not permitted by the BLM, the assembly
organizer must comply with the provisions of this chapter and apply for a
license. The agreement may further provide that in the event the assembly
ceases to be held on public lands for a period of up to four (4) consecutive
years, the agreement shall terminate and the provisions therein shall become

It shall be the responsibility of the residents of the livestock control area

this area to erect and keep in good repair a fence around their property and/or
any necessary cattle guards. Such fence must be constructed in such a manner as
to keep the livestock contained on the property.

premises, the custodian shall be subject to all the penalties set forth in this
Chapter. (Ord. 173 §7, 2000)

Chapter only and then only to the extent of any penalties imposed by this

bidder, with notice of the sale given as provided for in said Section. If the
livestock is not of sufficient value, in the discretion of the Sheriff, to
justify the costs of a sale, the Sheriff may dispose of the livestock by the
cheapest means possible. (Ord. 173 §16, 2000)
6.06.170: PROCEEDS OF SALE:

telephone contact cannot be made, notice must be given to a known owner by
first class mail.
The person responsible for an impounded dog may reclaim such dog upon meeting
all regulations and paying any fees required by the animal shelter.
      2.   Any dog, which has no readily available identification (either a tag

   C.   Relinquishment Of Animal To Animal Control: A Pershing County resident
who is the owner of an animal may relinquish ownership of the animal by signing
a statement that he/she is the legal owner of the animal and authorizing animal
control to dispose of the animal. Disposal may occur through destruction or
adoption. The owner of the animal must pay the cost of disposal at the time of
relinquishment. Such cost will be the price charged Pershing County for the
medical supplies used for destruction. (Ord. 243, 2007)

   A.   Abandonment Of Injured Animals: It is unlawful for any person owning,
possessing or having custody and control of any maimed, disabled or infirm
animal to abandon the same, or leave it to die in a public street, road or
other public place, or upon the private property of himself or another, more
than one hour after he received notice that the animal is maimed, disabled or
infirm. If a maimed, disabled, or infirm animal is impounded and is
demonstrably suffering from a fresh and serious illness or injury, the animal
may be destroyed immediately to prevent undue suffering or pain, if the special
control officer determines that the animal has no visible identification
(either a tag or microchip) identifying the owner or that the officer had made
objectively reasonable efforts to contact the owner and cannot do so after a
reasonable amount of time given the suffering of the animal.
   B.   Unlawful Treatment Of Animals:
      1.   No owner shall fail to provide his animals with sufficient wholesome
and nutritious food, water in sufficient quantities, proper air, shelter space
and protection from the weather, veterinary care when needed to prevent
suffering, and humane care and treatment.
      2.   No person shall beat, cruelly ill-treat, torment, overload, overwork
or otherwise abuse an animal, or cause, instigate or permit any dogfight,
cockfight, bullfight or other combat between animals or between animals and
humans.
      3.   No owner of an animal shall abandon such animal.
      4.   No person or business shall give away or raffle any live animal,
fish, reptile or bird as a prize for, or as an inducement to enter, any
contest, game or other competition; or as an inducement to attract customers to
a business unless the person or business has obtained prior approval from the
board of county commissioners or its designee.
      5.   Any person who, as the operator of a motor vehicle, strikes a
domestic animal shall stop at once and render such assistance as may be
possible and shall immediately report such injury or death to the animal's
owner; in the event the owner cannot be ascertained and located, such operator
shall at once report the accident to the appropriate law enforcement agency or
to the local humane society.
      6.   No person shall leave an animal in a car, truck, trailer, box or
crate when the temperature and surrounding environment may cause the animal
unnecessary suffering or death. The special officer may remove an animal from a
situation that restricts the animal's ability to escape suffering and death.
However, the officer will make every reasonable effort to allow the owner of
the animal to remedy the situation before removal or, if no owner is available,
the officer will attempt to notify the owner as soon as possible that the
animal has been removed. The special officer may issue a citation to the person
responsible for confining the animal.
      7.   It is unlawful for any person to tease, coax, release or otherwise
cause an animal to escape from an enclosure provided for the animal of another.
(Ord. 243, 2007)

      2.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a permit obtained
under this section is valid for as long as the permittee owns the animal;
however, when permittee's address or the location where the animal is kept
changes the permit automatically becomes void and a new application must be

dollars ($10.00) must accompany each application for an exotic animal permit.
Each permit is valid for one animal only.
      3.   This section shall not be applicable to:
         a.   Any zoo, or any university, college, governmental research agency
or other bona fide scientific institution which, in the opinion of the special
officer, is engaged in scientific or public health research. For purposes of
this section, a "zoo" shall be considered any organization which exhibits
animals to the general public at regular specified hours, equaling at least
thirty (30) hours a week for thirty six (36) weeks a year, and whose animals,
whether maintained for exhibit purposes or not, are not for sale to private
individuals; and
         b.   Any owners of establishments which treat or board animals on the
premises or any owners of pet shops which house animals for the purpose of
sale; provided, that the owner or operator shall keep a permanent record of the
name, address and phone number of the purchaser of any animal along with the
breed, color, sex and age of each animal sold or given away and shall forward
such information to the special officer within ten (10) days after the transfer
of the animal. The special officer shall have the right to inspect such records
during normal business hours.

grant or deny the application, an aggrieved applicant or resident of the
neighborhood may appeal the special officer's decision to the Pershing County
commissioners by filing a written petition with the county clerk. The Pershing
County commissioners shall hold a public hearing to consider whether or not an
exotic animal permit should be issued. In the event the county commissioners
determine that a permit should be issued, a written permit shall be drafted
containing such conditions as the county commissioners deem necessary for the
protection of the health and safety of county residents and of the exotic
animal.
   C.   Revocation Or Suspension Of Permit; Destruction Of Animal:
      1.   Any permit issued pursuant to this section may be suspended or
revoked and/or the exotic animal destroyed if the special officer determines
that any permit condition or law relating to exotic or vicious animals has not
been adhered to.
      2.   If, after investigation, the special officer concludes that grounds
for suspension, revocation or destruction exists, he shall notify the permittee
in writing. Such notice must specify the grounds for suspension or revocation
of the permit or destruction of the animal, specify the date when such action
shall become effective, and advise the permittee of the right to appeal the
decision of the special control officer to the Pershing County commissioners.
The owner or possessor of an exotic animal may appeal to the Pershing County
commissioners by filing a written petition with the county clerk within five
(5) working days after receipt of notice from the special control officer. The
Pershing County commissioners shall then hold a public hearing to consider
whether good grounds exist to order the action sought by the special officer.
The county commissioners may, in their discretion, modify, suspend or revoke
the exotic animal permit or order the destruction of the animal. In the event
an appellant fails to appear at the hearing, he shall waive any right to
contest the action proposed by the special officer and any claim against the
county or its employees by reason of such action.
      3.   In the event it is reasonably necessary to protect against an
immediate threat or danger to the public or to an animal's health or safety,
the special officer may suspend any permit and impound the animal without a
hearing for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days unless such period is
extended by reason of a pending appeal to the county commissioners.
   D.   Inspection: Permits issued pursuant to this section shall provide that,
as a condition for issuance, the premises upon which an animal is maintained
shall be opened at any reasonable hour for inspection by the special officer or
the health officer and that the premises shall be surrendered for inspection by
the permittee upon request of such officers.
   E.   Certain Animals Not Permitted: No permit shall be issued pursuant to
this section for any of the following animals, and possession of such animals
is unlawful:

individual, organization, business or public entity to provide technical
assistance, inspections, animal seizure or impoundment facilities to assist in
the enforcement of this section.
   G.   Impoundment; Fees:

exotic animal found in the county without an exotic animal permit or found to
be in violation of a permit. The special officer must seize and impound an
exotic animal where the animal poses an immediate threat to public health and
safety.
      2.   The owner or possessor of an exotic animal shall bear the cost of
seizure, impoundment and destruction of an exotic animal determined to be in
violation of this section. (Ord. 243, 2007)

   A.   Special Officer:
      1.   The Pershing County special officer is empowered to investigate
grievances concerning animals in Pershing County. Prior to conducting an on the

6.10.010: DEFINITIONS:
As used throughout this chapter, the words and terms defined in this section
have the meaning ascribed to them unless a different meaning clearly appears in
the context where used, or unless specifically defined in an applicable
section.
BASE PROPERTY: Any land or water in this state that is owned, occupied or
controlled by a person who has obtained an appurtenant grazing preference right
for that land or water pursuant to the provisions of the Taylor grazing act.
EXOTIC LIVESTOCK: All herd animals, such as bison, which are raised for home
use or profit.
GRAZING PREFERENCE RIGHT: A right that:
   A.   Is conferred upon a person pursuant to the provisions of the Taylor
grazing act; and
   B.   Entitles the person to priority in the issuance of a permit to graze
livestock in accordance with those provisions.
LEGAL FENCE: A fence with not less than four (4) horizontal barriers,
consisting of wires, boards, poles or other fence material in common use in the
neighborhood, with posts set not more than twenty feet (20') apart. The lower
barrier must be not more than twelve inches (12") from the ground and the space
between any two (2) barriers must be not more than twelve inches (12") and the
height of top barrier must be at least forty eight inches (48") above the
ground. Every post must be so set as to withstand a horizontal strain of two
hundred fifty (250) pounds at a point four feet (4') from the ground, and each
barrier must be capable of withstanding a horizontal strain of two hundred
fifty (250) pounds at any point midway between the posts.
LIVESTOCK: All cattle, sheep, bovine, horses, or other domesticated herd
animals which are raised for home use or for profit.
PUBLIC LAND: Lands which are managed or controlled by the bureau of land
management (herein BLM) and which have a grazing preference right or which
abuts base property.
TAYLOR GRAZING ACT: The act of congress entitled "an act to stop injury to the
public grazing lands by preventing overgrazing and soil deterioration, to
provide for their orderly use, improvement and development, to stabilize the
livestock industry dependent upon the public range, and for other purposes",
approved June 28, 1934, being c. 865, 48 stat. 1269, also designated as 43 USC
sections 315 to 315r, inclusive, any amendment thereto and any replacement
therefor, including provisions of the code of federal regulations adopted and
promulgated pursuant to any such act, amendment or replacement, providing for
grazing districts or for payment of a portion of the monies derived from
grazing fees or grazing leases to the state of Nevada. (Ord. 290, 2012)
6.10.020: PURPOSE:
While the Nevada Revised Statutes 1  generally create a "fence out" requirement
for private property, under Nevada Revised Statutes 568.225, a person, who
negligently or wilfully interferes with the grazing preference right of another
person, is guilty of a misdemeanor offense. The board hereby declares and finds
that such grazing interferes with and impedes the grazing right holder's
ability to graze his cattle on the allotted land. The purpose of this chapter

graze, must take precautions to prevent the livestock from grazing on the
public property or the base property as defined by the statute. This chapter

individual, who keeps, pastures, or grazes livestock on private property with
an agriculture, mining and recreation land use, shall fence the property upon
which grazing, pasturing, or keeping the livestock will occur with a legal
fence as set forth in Nevada Revised Statutes, if the property used for

shall fence the property upon which grazing, pasturing, or keeping the exotic
livestock will occur with a fence that is specifically designed and meets
zoological fencing standards for the specific exotic livestock. If the
zoological fencing standards for the exotic animal are less than the
requirements for a legal fence, the legal fencing requirements as set forth
above shall be required. The individual who is grazing the exotic livestock is
required to maintain and keep the fence in a condition to contain the exotic
livestock. (Ord. 290, 2012)
6.10.050: LIVESTOCK AT LARGE; PENALTY:
If an individual grazes, pastures, or keeps livestock without building a fence
that meets the fencing requirements set forth in section
6.10.030 of this chapter and any of the livestock enters, grazes, or strays
onto public lands or base property, the individual is guilty of a misdemeanor
and upon conviction shall be punished for such. It shall not be a defense to a
charge herein that the charged individual had failed to maintain the fence or
that the fence was in disrepair or that the animal broke the fence. (Ord. 290,
2012)
6.10.060: EXOTIC LIVESTOCK AT LARGE; PENALTY:
If an individual grazes, pastures, or keeps exotic livestock without building a
fence that meets the fencing requirements set forth herein and any of the

the individual is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be punished
for such. It shall not be a defense to a charge herein that the charged
individual had failed to maintain the fence or that the fence was in disrepair
or that the animal broke the fence. (Ord. 290, 2012)
6.10.070: SEIZURE:
   A.   Livestock: The sheriff, grazing preference right holder, or base
property owner may seize any livestock found on public lands or base property
and hold said animals until the owner is identified and the owner has paid the

sheriff may take legal action to dispose of the livestock and collect the costs
for seizing and disposing of the animals.
   B.   Exotic Livestock: The sheriff, grazing preference right holder, base
property owner, or property owner may seize any exotic livestock found on

livestock. If the owner fails to pay the required costs or fails to claim the
exotic livestock within fourteen (14) days, the sheriff may take legal action
to dispose of the exotic livestock and collect the costs for seizing and
disposing of the exotic livestock.
   C.   Expedited Hearing And Notice: In the event that the sheriff must file
suit to dispose of any seized livestock or exotic livestock, the justice's
court shall hold expedited hearings to allow the sheriff to take such necessary
action as is warranted to minimize the costs associated with holding the
animals. Notice shall be by personal service unless the sheriff cannot locate
the owner in which case the court will order service by mail or two (2) weeks
publishing in the local newspaper or such other reasonable methods as
determined by the court. (Ord. 290, 2012)

reasonable means, the expense shall be a special assessment against the
property upon which the condition is located. The special assessment shall be
collected pursuant to the provisions set forth in subsection 4 of Nevada
Revised Statutes 244.360. (Ord. 283, 2011)
8.06.070: ASSESSMENT AND ABATEMENT:

date specified on the notice, fifty dollars ($50.00) per day for the next
twenty (20) days, and one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day thereafter. The
cumulative civil penalties shall not exceed the greater of ten thousand dollars
($10,000.00) or three (3) times the cost of abatement actually incurred by the
county to abate the condition or, if the property is not abated by the county,
the estimated cost as provided by notice to the owner.
   B.   Abatement under this chapter by the county shall be conducted after an
authorized inspector sends to the owner of the property, at the address
provided by the owner in the real property records of the county, written
notice of the estimated costs to abate the condition and the accrued civil
penalties, unless such notice is waived in writing by the owner. The notice
shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested.
   C.   After billing for that reason, but before payment in full, any owner
who has been assessed a civil penalty may request in writing a hearing before
the board to reduce the civil penalty. The request shall be accompanied by a
cash bond of one hundred dollars ($100.00) or ten percent (10%) of the civil
penalties, whichever is greater, or a judgment by confession in a form
prescribed by the county for the civil penalties as may or may not thereafter
be reduced, suspended or conditioned. After application to the civil penalties,
any balance remaining on the bond shall be returned to the owner, in accordance
with the decision of the designee of the board. The penalty shall be reduced if
it is at law grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the owner's conduct,
and may be reduced in consideration of all relevant circumstances, including
conditions on use of the property and suspension, for up to five (5) years, in
the reasoned discretion of the designee of the board. (Ord. 283, 2011)

Board of County Commissioners within ten (10) days after the denial by the

which must be certified as correct by the County and filed with the Court as
part of its answer to the petition.
   D.   Before the date set by the Court for a hearing, an application may be
made to the Court by motion, with notice to the opposing party and an
opportunity for the party to respond, for leave to present additional evidence.
If it is shown to the satisfaction of the Court that the additional evidence is
material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the
proceeding before the County, the Court may order that the additional evidence
be taken before the County upon conditions determined by the Court. The County
may modify its findings and decisions by reason of the additional evidence and
shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings or decisions with
the reviewing Court.
   E.   The review must be conducted by the Court without a jury and must be
confined to the record. The Court, at the request of a party, may hear oral
arguments and receive written briefs.
   F.   The Court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the County as
to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The Court may affirm the
decision of the County or remand the case for further proceedings. The Court
may reverse the decision and remand the case to the County for further
proceedings if it determines that substantial rights of the appellant have been
prejudiced because the County's findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions
are:

      2.   In excess of the statutory authority of the County;
      3.   Made in accordance with an unlawful procedure;
      4.   Affected by other errors of law;
      5.   Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable probative and substantial
evidence on the whole record; or

PLAN. (Ord. 262, 2009)
11.30.020: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to: a) guide county policy with respect to
natural resource issues facing Pershing County, b) provide a framework to guide
federal agencies in land use planning on federal lands as per the national
environmental policy act of 1969, the federal lands policy and management act
of 1976, the national forest management act of 1976, the threatened and
endangered species act of 1973, and other applicable laws and executive orders,
and c) safeguard property rights and other customary usage rights of the
citizens of Pershing County, the state of Nevada, and the United States against
any and all encroachments upon those rights by individuals, groups,
corporations, public agencies, nongovernmental organizations, or any other
entity which may attempt to take private property, trespass upon private
property or infringe upon other customary rights as have been established by
the constitutions, laws and customs of the United States, the state of Nevada,
and Pershing County. This title is meant to complement and supplement the
constitutions and laws of the United States, the state of Nevada, and Pershing
County with additional means of protection and enforcement. This chapter is not
intended to create new rights nor is it intended to in any way supplant the
lawful authority of individuals, groups, organizations, corporations,
governments or other entities which act pursuant to the laws and constitutions
of the United States, the state of Nevada, and Pershing County. (Ord. 262,
2009)

11.30.040: ADOPTION OF PERSHING COUNTY RESOURCES AND LAND USE PLAN:
   A.   Holding that the American people are best served when government
affairs are conducted as closely to the people as possible (i.e., at the county
level), the citizens of Pershing County, through the Pershing County board of
commissioners, adopt the Pershing County natural resources and land use plan as
provided in this chapter.
   B.   The Pershing County natural resources and land use plan shall serve as
the primary guide for the use and management of all natural resources and state
and federal lands within Pershing County. (Ord. 262, 2009)
11.30.050: CUSTOM AND CULTURE:
   A.   Since the time that aboriginal peoples inhabited what is now Pershing
County, local custom and culture has revolved around beneficial use of natural
resources. Aboriginal peoples harvested native plants, animals and geologic
material to provide nearly all the raw material for their tools, shelter and
sustenance. What was not found locally was traded with other communities in and
around the Great Basin. In similar fashion, early European miners, ranchers and
farmers lived largely within the bounds of what they could obtain from the
natural environment.
   B.   With the early gold and silver finds in the mid-1800s came Cornish and
Irish miners, Italian charcoal burners (carbonari), Germans, Swiss, French,
Russians, Chinese, and others contributing to mining and support industries,
and defining the early custom and culture of Pershing County. The signing of
the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo in 1848 concluded the Mexican- American War and
enlarged the borders of the United States to include what is now Pershing
County. Upon ratification of the treaty, the United States acquired and managed
this territory as sovereign and proprietor under the property clause of the
U.S. constitution. Legal traditions of property rights that existed under
Mexican law prior to the establishment of Nevada as a territory of the United
States remain intact today as they are consistent with the U.S. constitution
and laws of the United States. Prior existing property rights including, but
not limited to, water rights based on the doctrine of prior appropriation,
forage rights based on the ownership of water rights and land, rights of way,
and ownership of real property, are explicitly preserved by all federal land
laws. Preservation of these rights demonstrates their importance to the custom,
culture and economy of Pershing County and the west.
   C.   The burgeoning mining camps brought Basque sheepmen who ran sheep in
most of the mountains and valleys in Pershing County. On their heels came
cattlemen and other settlers who, with the help of the 1877 desert lands act,
the act of 1888, the act of 1890, the 1891 creative act, and the 1916 stock
raising homestead act, established privately owned base properties to support
permanent range livestock operations and farms. Competition among livestock
interests resulted in the passage of the 1925 Nevada livestock watering law. A
component of this law, locally known as the "three mile rule", made it a
misdemeanor for a stockman to allow his animals to graze within three (3) miles
of a watering site owned by another stockman. The federal government responded
to disputes among stockmen and overuse of the federal ranges by passing the
1934 Taylor grazing act. The Taylor grazing act superseded Nevada's livestock
watering law; however, it did not extinguish any prior existing property
rights. These property rights withstanding, the Taylor grazing act gave the
secretary of the interior broad discretion to manage public land through rules
and regulations and provided that all future grazing on public land be allowed
only via grazing permits. The system of management adopted by the secretary of
interior under the act provided for: 1) adjudication of federal ranges, 2)
issuance of revocable licenses with preference given to existing grazers owning
commensurate base property, and 3) establishment of grazing districts. Early
efforts of the state of Nevada to preserve customary grazing rights (e.g., 1925
Nevada livestock watering law) and recognition of these rights by subsequent
federal laws (e.g., TGA, FLMPA, and PRIA) demonstrate the importance of
livestock grazing to the region's custom and culture.
   D.   Commensurate with development of arable land and distributed water in
Pershing County, livestock numbers grew steadily until their peak in the 1940s
and 1950s. With these changes came increased wildlife. Populations of mule deer
increased across the state until they peaked in the 1940s and 1950s. Similar
trends are observed for sage grouse. Downward trends in these wildlife species,
beginning in the 1960s, are commensurate with declines in permitted livestock
on federal ranges and continues into the present decade.
   E.   Of Pershing County's total surface acres (3,859,840 acres), almost
seventy six percent (76%) (2,929,129 acres) are controlled and managed by the
federal government. Of these public lands under federal control, approximately
two million nine hundred nine thousand nine hundred forty nine (2,909,949)
acres are managed by the bureau of land management (USBLM) and nineteen
thousand one hundred eighty (19,180) acres are managed by the bureau of
reclamation (USBR). The USBR managed lands include those lands associated with
Rye Patch Reservoir. Access to resources on federal lands and the right to pass
uninhibited across federal lands are important historical components of
Pershing County's custom and culture. In 1859 Captain James Simpson of the U.S.
corps of topographical engineers surveyed the Simpson Wagon Road north of
present day Pershing to supplant the earlier established and longer Humboldt
Route. Beginning in the 1850s mining became an important industry in Pershing
County (then part of the larger Humboldt County). In 1919, Pershing County was
split off from the larger Humboldt County. To the north and east of Lovelock,
silver ore was discovered in Buena Vista Canyon in 1861, which led to the
founding of Unionville by southern sympathizers. In 1862, the Unionville school
was constructed and was the first public structure in the county. Unionville
was designated the seat of Humboldt County but lost that distinction in 1873 to
Winnemucca. By the late 1870s, most of the ores in Unionville were depleted,
but the town has managed to stay until today. North of Unionville, Star City
was established in 1861, when rich silver ore was discovered in the area.
During the boom years of 1864 through 1865, the town boasted one thousand two
hundred (1,200) residents, two (2) hotels, three (3) general stores, a Wells
Fargo office, a church, and a dozen or more saloons.
The 1866 mining act and the 1897 reservoir siting act, protected miners,
ranchers and others to whom access to federal lands was the basis of their
livelihood. The portion of the 1866 act codified as revised statute 2477
provided simply that the right of way for the construction of highways over
public land, not reserved for public uses, is hereby granted. Although revised
statute 2477 was repealed by the federal land management and policy act of
1976, miners, ranchers, hunters and fishermen still use these early rights of
way and rely on revised statute 2477 to protect their economic welfare and
recreational opportunities.
   F.   Water rights in Pershing County date back to the mid-1800s. Early
miners, ranchers and farmers established surface water rights through the
common law doctrine of prior appropriation. The state of Nevada codified this
doctrine for surface water in 1905 and extended the law to ground water in
1939. Efforts by Nevada's largest municipalities to import water resources from
rural communities is causing contemporary owners of agricultural and stock
watering rights in Pershing County to fear for the future of economically
viable beneficial uses of water in Pershing County. Pershing County stretches
across six (6) of Nevada's fourteen (14) major hydrographic regions/water
basins. The northwest part of the county is contained in the Black Rock Desert
Region (hydrographic region 2). The northeast and central parts of the county
are situated within the Humboldt River Basin (hydrographic region 4). The
southeast part of the county is contained within the central region
(hydrographic region 10). The terminus of the Carson River Basin (hydrographic
region 8) containing the Carson Sink and Desert protrudes into the southern
part of Pershing County. The southeast part of the county is contained within
the west central region (hydrographic region 5). The extreme southeastern
corner of the county lies within the Truckee River Basin (hydrographic region
6). In addition to these six (6) major hydrographic regions covering Pershing
County, the county also has nineteen (19) other hydrographic areas and
hydrographic subareas (whole or partial).
   G.   Farming has been an important component of Pershing County's industry
since the early days of land settlement. Agriculture and ranching has benefited
from abundant water supplies and the expansive bottomlands and lush grasses
along the Humboldt River. Early farmers constructed extensive irrigation
systems to transport water from the Humboldt River to nearby bench lands in
order to satisfy the needs of the growing population of nearby mining camps.
Rye Patch Reservoir, located approximately twenty two (22) miles up the
Humboldt River from Lovelock, was completed in 1937 and has a storage capacity
of one hundred eighty thousand (180,000) acre-feet. The USBR storage facility
greatly enhanced the reliability of water supplies to downstream agricultural
lands in the Lovelock area, making Pershing County one of the more important
agricultural centers in Nevada. Today, Pershing County's farming districts
support a robust grass, alfalfa and meadow hay industry.
   H.   While standards of living have changed dramatically since the mid-
1800s, miners, ranchers and farmers remain the core of the Pershing County
community. The shift from strictly local food hunting and fishing to sport
hunting and fishing and other natural resource recreation activities has added
a small, but viable, recreation and tourism component to the county's natural
resource based culture. Custom and culture of today's Pershing County citizens
remain steeped in their mining, farming and ranching heritage. Pershing County
is and will ever be dependent upon natural resources for its economic
existence. (Ord. 262, 2009)
11.30.060: COMMUNITY STABILITY:
   A.   Economic and social stability of Pershing County are inseparably tied
to the use of natural resources. According to a 1997 survey published by the
Nevada division of water planning, of the two thousand two hundred seventy six
(2,276) persons employed in Pershing County, over thirty seven percent (37.8%)
of the county's employment is in the natural resources and mining sector.
Mining and agriculture presently contributes the major portion of the county's
personal income and tax revenue stream; however, the boom and bust nature of
the mining activity periodically brings farming, ranching and agricultural
services back to the forefront of the economy. When mining activity lulls, the
community relies on its other traditional industries to maintain its viability.
   B.   State and federal lands make up seventy six percent (76%) of Pershing
County's land area. Given: 1) that the viability of the community remains
largely dependent on business and recreational activities conducted on or in
concert with state and federal lands and 2) that many of these activities are
inseparably tied to the economic viability of private lands in Pershing County,
the community remains particularly sensitive to state and federal planning
decisions.
   C.   Community stability in Pershing County is a symbiosis between the small
private land base and the much larger federal land base. Private property
interests in minerals, water, forage, rights of way and other natural resource
attributes of federal lands enhance social and economic values of Pershing
County's private lands. Reductions in the private land base or erosion of
private property interests in federal lands, including, but not limited to,
real property, personal property and mixed property; split estates, easements,
rights of way, mineral rights, water rights and customary usage rights; fee
interest, tenancy and possessory interest, adversely affect the social and
economic stability of the county.
   D.   Certain provisions in a number of federal laws, including the federal
land policy and management act of 1976, the public rangelands improvement act
of 1978, the federal water pollution control act amendments of 1972 (clean
water act), the threatened and endangered species act of 1973 and the wild
horse and burro protection act of 1971, have spawned sweeping changes to
federal land policy that have proven detrimental to economic and social
stability in Pershing County. Repeal of revised statute 2477 has denied access
to large tracts of federal land, thereby negatively impacting a wide range of
economic and recreational users. Department of interior regulations commonly
known as range reform 94 have substantially reduced viability of cattle and
sheep ranches. Zealous and overreaching expansion of clean water act
regulations to isolated springs and seeps and ephemeral streams threatens many
activities on federal lands. The threat of listing sage grouse, other wildlife
and plant species under the threatened and endangered species act may severely
limit economic and recreational use of private, state and federal land in
Pershing County, particularly where such listing occurs without adequate peer
reviewed scientific analysis.
   E.   As the previous observations attest, stability of the Pershing County
community, its industries, commerce, schools, healthcare, police protection,
and other services, rests squarely on: 1) protection of private property
rights, 2) sound and balanced management of natural resources, and 3) continued
multiple use and economic use of state and federal lands. (Ord. 262, 2009)
11.30.070: PRIMARY PLANNING GUIDANCE:
   A.   Private Property And Property Rights: Whereas the board of Pershing
County commissioners determines that it is in public interest of the citizens
of Pershing County, Pershing County will evaluate state or federal actions
related to private property and private property interests, including
investment backed expectations. The county will use as its primary guidance the
fifth amendment to the United States constitution, which prohibits the taking
of private property for public use without just compensation. The county will
also pursue the principles of executive order 12630 which requires federal
agencies to prepare a takings implication assessment prior to initiating any
action, issuing any rule, or making any decision which would constitute a
taking of private property or private property interest, including investment
backed expectation.
   B.   Tax Base: It is critical to the welfare of the citizens of Pershing
County that the board of Pershing County commissioners pursues a stable source
of tax revenue based on economic use of natural resources. In order to build a
broad tax base, the county supports privatizing certain state and federal lands
for commercial, residential, industrial and agricultural and mining uses. In
the face of considerable reductions in ad valorem tax revenues caused by
transfer of private land to public ownership, Pershing County maintains a
policy of no net reduction in ad valorem taxes related to land tenure changes
unless the reductions are adequately mitigated by agreement with the board of
Pershing County commissioners after public hearing. In addition, Pershing
County promotes the concept of split estate taxation wherein the various
components of an estate in real property are taxed as a function of their
relative value rather than being accrued only in the surface estate.
   C.   Water Resources:
      1.   Pershing County affirms support for the doctrine of prior
appropriation as established by state law; that the right to appropriate water
is a compensable property right available to individuals and municipalities.
Ownership of the right to use water has, as key principles, those provisions
set forth in Nevada Revised Statutes 533.010 through 533.085, including, but
not limited to, first right, first use, beneficial use, and point of diversion.
      2.   Pershing County promotes private development of water resources on
state and federal land for beneficial use in Pershing County, including, but
not limited to, geothermal reservoirs, power generation, municipal water
supplies, irrigation and stock water.
      3.   Pershing County mandates the use of peer reviewed science in the
assessment of impacts related to water resource development.
      4.   The county discourages out of basin water transfers and will
adamantly oppose such transfers that do not: a) pass the highest test of
scientific rigor in demonstrating minimal impacts to existing water rights and
b) show a long term benefit to the economic viability and community stability
of the county. Out of basin and out of county transfers of water shall be
accorded full attention of Nevada Revised Statutes 533.370, 533.438 and other
applicable state laws.
      5.   Pershing County will work to maintain its water resources in a
condition that will render it usable by future generations for the full range
of beneficial uses that further a viable and stable economic and social base
for its citizens. The county supports retaining authority of states to protect
water quality under the clean water act. The county does not support abrogation
of that authority to any other governmental or nongovernmental entity. The
county promotes water quality standards that are: a) consistent with actual
uses for which a particular water source or body is lawfully appropriated, and
b) based on accurate information regarding its natural state and range of
variability. The county will demand coordination among all responsible and
affected interests when considering water quality actions.
   D.   Air Resources: Pershing County will work to maintain its air resources
in a condition that will render them usable by future generations for the full
range of beneficial uses that further a viable and stable economic and social
base for its citizens.
      1.   The county supports retaining authority of states to protect air
quality under the clean air act. The county does not support abrogation of that
authority to any other governmental or nongovernmental entity. The county
promotes air quality standards that are: a) consistent with actual uses for
which a particular airshed is lawfully appropriated, and b) based on accurate
information regarding its natural state and range of variability.
      2.   The Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center at Naval Air Station Fallon
affects airspace over Pershing County by operating the Fallon Range Training
Complex (FRTC). As a cooperating agency in the January 2000 environmental
impact statement analyzing changes to operations of the FRTC, Pershing County
demonstrated its intention to protect its interests in the public airspace.
That interest persists today. The county will demand coordination among all
responsible and affected interests when considering actions that may impact air
quality and airspace.
   E.   Mining: It is critical to the welfare of the citizens of Pershing
County and the nation that mining on state and federal lands remains an open
and free enterprise. Pershing County upholds the tenet that mining claims are
compensable property belonging to individuals or groups of individuals.
Pershing County supports:
      1.   Retention of and compliance with the 1872 mining law as amended;
      2.   Mine reclamation activities as per Nevada Revised Statutes chapter
519A;
      3.   Streamlining of the permitting process;
      4.   Reasonable bonding requirements that promote small business
investment in mine exploration, development, and reclamation;
      5.   Use of the best available science and technology to ensure adequate
protection of land, air, and water resources;
      6.   Mitigation of mining activities that may impair the economic future
of Pershing County citizens through bilateral or multilateral consultations
with the board of Pershing County commissioners;
      7.   Disposal of mine dewatering water in a manner that returns water to
the ground in the same basin it is withdrawn with minimal evaporation and
transpiration loss;
      8.   Immediate curtailment of temporary dewatering rights at the
cessation of permitted mining and reversion of all temporary change
applications supporting dewatering to the permitted use of the originating
water right.
   F.   Agriculture: Pershing County recognizes: 1) the importance of
agriculture to the stability of the local economy and 2) the historic and
contemporary influence of agriculture on the community's custom and culture.
Farms and ranches have played and continue to play a fundamental role in the
social and economic well being of the county. Pershing County recognizes that
increasing regulatory pressures are reducing the viability of farms and
ranches. In order to reverse such trends, Pershing County supports, encourages
and promotes policies that will lead to the long term economic strength of
family farming and ranching.
      1.   With respect to farm production, Pershing County supports:
         a.   Private investment in and ownership of agriculturally productive
land;
         b.   Economically and scientifically sound agricultural practices;
         c.   Coordination and consultation of state and federal conservation,
wildlife and planning activities with local farm organizations and Pershing
County.
      2.   With respect to livestock production and federal lands, Pershing
County supports:
         a.   Private investment in and private ownership of range improvements
and water developments;
         b.   Economically and scientifically sound grazing practices;
         c.   Increasing grazing capacity and other economic incentives to
promote private investment in range improvements including, but not limited to,
fencing, seeding, water development, improved grazing systems, brush control,
pinyon/juniper eradication, proper fire management and noxious weed control;
         d.   Restoring voluntary nonuse AUMs and suspended AUMs to active
preference;
         e.   A grazing fee formula that accounts for all nonfee costs of
producing livestock on state and federal land;
         f.   Subleasing of grazing rights;
         g.   Multiple use concepts;
         h.   Active management of range resources by permittees rather than by
public agencies;
         i.   Limiting the role of public agencies to monitoring range
condition as per the 1984 "Nevada Rangeland Monitoring Handbook" and
determining compliance with applicable laws;
         j.   Coordination and consultation of state and federal conservation,
wildlife, land management and planning activities with permittees, local
livestock organizations and Pershing County.
   G.   Wildlife: Management of wildlife, including fish, game animals, nongame
animals, predatory animals, sensitive species, threatened and endangered
species, under all jurisdictions whatsoever, must be grounded in peer reviewed
science and local input. Wildlife management plans must identify and plan for
mitigation of negative impacts to local economies, private property interests
and customary usage rights.
      1.   Pershing County supports wildlife management that:
         a.   Is responsive to the county wildlife advisory board, the natural
resources advisory committee, and the board of county commissioners;
         b.   Enhances populations of game and nongame species native to
Pershing County;
         c.   Recognizes that enhancing nonnative game and nongame species may
negatively impact native species and rangeland and forest ecosystems;
         d.   Increases wildlife numbers where practicable and not in conflict
with existing economic uses or ecosystem health;
         e.   Avoids managing wildlife at population levels that exceed those
reported in historical records and established by peer reviewed scientific
investigation;
         f.   Recognizes that large game animals compete for forage and water
with other economic uses;
         g.   Recognizes that federal agencies are mandated to maintain or
improve conditions on federal forests and ranges;
         h.   Recognizes that wildlife damage mitigation may encumber existing
interests and properties to future damages.
      2.   Pershing County will actively participate in wildlife management
decisions that affect the welfare of its citizens via state wildlife planning
efforts and county, state and federal land use planning. Pershing County will
work to ensure proper implementation of wildlife plans.
      3.   Pershing County is adamantly opposed to listing any species of
wildlife under the threatened and endangered species act unless the highest
level of scientific rigor (i.e., peer reviewed research based on publicly
accessible data sets and methodology) demonstrates that the species warrants
listing. The county shall consider all reasonable actions to avoid listings
under the threatened and endangered species act, including, but not limited to,
state and local conservation planning and legal recourse.
      4.   To maintain agriculture as a productive part of the local economy
and to enhance the environment for ecologically and economically important
wildlife, Pershing County supports sound predator control programs.
      5.   Pershing County generally opposes the introduction, gradual
encroachment and institutionalization of wildlife not native to Pershing
County.
      6.   Pershing County recognizes that the bureau of land management is
mandated by congress to manage all multiple uses of federal lands, including
wildlife, in a manner that maintains or improves the conditions of federal
ranges. The county will pursue federal intervention in wildlife management
situations in which range conditions are inadequately protected.
   H.   Recreation: Recreation is important to the citizens of Pershing County.
The unique outdoor recreational opportunities found in Pershing County are many
of its greatest assets. Pershing County values the opportunity and freedom
these lands provide and encourages balanced management goals that include
hiking, camping, wildlife viewing, and other outdoor recreation activities.
Pershing County strongly advocates the rights of recreationists to continued
lawful access to public lands.
   I.   Utility Rights And Public Consumption: As per 43 USC section 315(e),
Pershing County supports individual citizens acquisition of rights of way for
roads, ditches, pipelines, canals, power lines, telephone lines and stock
driveways. Pershing County adamantly supports the protection of vested rights
that may limit other uses of state and federal lands. As per 43 USC section 315
(d), Pershing County recognizes rights of local citizens to utilize natural
resources for personal consumption (e.g., firewood, posts, sand, gravel, etc.).
   J.   Land Disposition And Land Tenure Adjustments:
      1.   Pershing County will respect and uphold private property interests
in land, including, but not limited to, land patents, mining claims, easements,
rights of way, and forage rights.
      2.   Pershing County maintains a no net loss policy with respect to
private land and private property rights, and is opposed to public acquisition
of private property, except where the acquisition is: a) clearly in the public
interest of the citizens of Pershing County and b) appropriately mitigated in
value and in land area by transfer of property from the public domain to
private ownership as per this chapter. Determination that such a transaction is
in the public interest of the citizens of Pershing County and that proposed
mitigation is appropriate shall be determined by the board of Pershing County
commissioners after proper public hearing.
      3.   Pershing County recognizes that the imbalance of the private/public
land ownership inhibits new economic activity in Pershing County and is
detrimental to Pershing County's long term viability. The county encourages
state and federal agencies to aggressively pursue land disposal to the maximum
extent allowed by law. State and federal land transfers to local governments
will be given priority consideration in any disposal of state or federal land.
      4.   If any public entity intends to acquire an estate in land, water,
minerals, forage or any other private property in Pershing County, the proposed
acquisition shall first be presented to the board of Pershing County
commissioners. The board shall determine likely impacts to the county's human
and natural environment and render an opinion about the suitability of the
acquisition.
   K.   Riparian Habitat And Wetlands:
      1.   Riparian areas and wetlands are critically important to well
balanced and productive rangeland ecosystems. Pershing County encourages
consultation, cooperation and coordination as provided under section 8 of the
public rangelands improvement act of 1978 for riparian areas and wetlands under
the jurisdiction of a federal agency.
      2.   The bulk of riparian areas and wetlands in Pershing County exist on
private ranches and farms. Pershing County supports retaining riparian areas
and wetlands in private ownership by improving the economic environment for the
ranching and farming community.
   L.   Wilderness, Wilderness Study Areas, Parks And Refuges: To the extent
that multiple use of federal lands is vital to the economy of Pershing County,
the county is opposed to the designation of any wilderness areas or wilderness
study areas within its geographic boundaries. The county calls for removal of
wilderness study area designations and reintroduction of active stewardship of
these lands that do not meet the suitability criteria of the 1964 wilderness
act. Pershing County demands local input and decision making in the designation
and management of parks, refuges, areas of environmental concern, roadless
areas or any other legislative action, regulatory decision or policy that
limits access to or use of federal land or resources within the geographic
boundaries of the county.
   M.   Wild Horses: Pershing County recognizes that horses protected under the
wild free roaming horse and burro act of 1971 are properly classified as feral
animals. The county recognizes that in passing the wild free roaming horse and
burro act, congress failed to account for prior adjudication of the nation's
public ranges, thereby disenfranchising livestock grazers and wildlife of
existing forage allocations without compensation. The county recognizes that
congress mandated that the department of the interior manage wild and free
roaming horses in a manner that is consistent with legislative intent and will
hold the agencies accountable under all applicable laws. Poor management of
feral horse herds has resulted in sustained overpopulation of horses in
Pershing County. Overpopulation has caused long term damage to range vegetation
and water sources, and has resulted in starvation of horses during periods of
drought and severe winters. Pershing County encourages federal legislation and
policies that promote scientifically sound and responsible management of feral
horse herds. Pershing County advocates economically beneficial uses for feral
horses and advocates public sale of excess horses. The county opposes the cost
ineffective policy of long term pasturing for excess horses where the policy
conflicts with the stated intent of the 1971 wild free roaming horse and burro
act to manage horses in a manner that is designed to achieve and maintain a
thriving natural ecological balance on the public lands.
   N.   Access: Pershing County supports the right of public access through
state and federal lands inasmuch as access does not conflict with private
property rights.
   O.   Pinyon And Juniper Control: Pershing County encourages active
management of pinyon/juniper woodlands and removal of woodlands where they
exist at unhealthy densities and beyond their historic range. Pershing County
supports economic use of these resources.
   P.   Wildfire: Pershing County supports the right for local citizens to
protect their property from fires originating on state and federal lands. The
county advocates active fire management on federal lands, including, where
appropriate and in consultation with grazing permit holders, adjacent
landowners, local volunteer firefighters and Pershing County, a let burn
policy. The county is opposed to arbitrary and inequitable restriction of
postfire land use for recreation and livestock grazing. The county insists that
all postfire land use restrictions be adequately justified and based on peer
reviewed science.
   Q.   Other Federal Land Use Regulations: Many land use regulations have the
potential to adversely impact Pershing County's economy. Pershing County
mandates involvement in all federal actions that may impact the local economy
according to this title. (Ord. 262, 2009)

11.40.010: TITLE:
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as COOPERATIVE LANDS MANAGEMENT.
(Ord. 262, 2009)
11.40.020: PURPOSE:
This chapter is created to assist the natural resources advisory committee with
its duties and in harmony with the natural resources and public land use plan.
(Ord. 262, 2009)
11.40.030: FINDINGS OF FACT:
The board of commissioners of Pershing County, a political subdivision of the
state of Nevada, finds as follows:
   A.   The government of the United States of America exercises control over
two million one hundred thousand (2,100,000) acres (81 percent) of the land and
the majority of natural resources within the geographic boundaries of Pershing
County;
   B.   Decisions governing federal lands in Pershing County have a history of
negative impact on the interrelated heritage of cultural, environmental and
economic well being and stability of county residents;
   C.   The congress of the United States has expressed intent, codified in 42
USC 4331, to act in cooperation with county governments while using all
practicable means to create and maintain conditions on federal lands allowing
for productive harmony between man and nature while fulfilling the social,
economic, environmental and cultural requirements of present and future
generations;
   D.   The efforts of congress seeking to coordinate federal plans with county
government, maintaining a balance between population and resources, and
encouraging high standards of living and a wide sharing of life's amenities, as
contemplated by 42 USC 4331(b)(5), can be enhanced by:
      1.   Increasing cooperation between Pershing County, state of Nevada, and
those federal officials involved with the administration of federal lands
situated within the county; and
      2.   Full consideration by the federal government of the needs of
Pershing County citizens who will be directly or indirectly impacted by federal
agency decisions regarding the use of federal lands and the management of
water, fish and wildlife in Nevada;
   E.   There now exists a substantial and urgent need to increase the
involvement of Pershing County in the management of federal lands and in the
development of criteria that are meaningful in any decision making process, as
contemplated by 43 CFR sections 1610.3-1(a), 1610.3-1(b), 1620.3-2(a); 36 CFR
chapter II, sections 219.7(a), 219.7(c), 219.7(d). (Ord. 262, 2009)
11.40.040: PROCEDURES ADOPTED:
Procedures adopted based upon consideration of the findings set forth in
section
 11.40.030 of this chapter, Pershing County adopts the following procedures to
ensure that there is full and complete disclosure and cooperation by federal
entities to the county regarding decisions affecting federal lands located
within the county and, reciprocally, that federal entities be made aware of the
impact of their actions and decision making on the interrelated heritage of
cultural, environmental and economic well being and stability of the county.
The adopted procedures apply to all decisions undertaken by any agency,
department or other federal entity including, but not limited to, the
department of interior, department of agriculture, environmental protection
agency, department of defense, or department of energy (hereinafter known as
"federal entities") that do or will have a direct or indirect impact on federal
and private lands within the geographic confines of the county. (Ord. 262,
2009)
11.40.050: SPECIFIC PROCEDURES:
Within thirty (30) days after adoption of this chapter, and at the beginning of
each calendar year thereafter, the chairman of the board of Pershing County
commissioners, on behalf of the board, or his designee, shall give to federal
entities written notice as follows:
   A.   That the county government of Pershing County demands, pursuant to
adopted federal statutes and regulations, full and complete notice and
opportunity for involvement in the decision making processes of the federal
entity that:
      1.   Are being taken or are being proposed to be taken regarding federal
lands located within the state of Nevada,
      2.   Involve listing, delisting, classification or reclassification of a
threatened or endangered species or any designated habitat within the county,
or
      3.   Involve any major federal action significantly affecting the quality
of the human and natural environment within the county;
   B.   That failure of federal entities to afford Pershing County complete
notice and opportunity for involvement beyond that afforded individuals, or to
limit state and county government involvement, input to or comment at public
hearings, is presumed to be prejudicial to the government of Pershing County
and its residents, and that the board of Pershing County commissioners is
authorized and empowered by this chapter to authorize and instruct the Pershing
County district attorney to seek redress for such prejudice in the federal
courts and through administrative hearings;
   C.   That, within the county's budgetary constraints, the county will notify
federal entities of any other evidence of the county's interrelated historic,
cultural and environmental heritage, as well as the anticipated impact on the
same of any use of federal or private lands situated within the county. (Ord.
262, 2009)
11.40.060: PRESUMPTION OF NEGATIVE IMPACT:
If implementation of a habitat designation or other federal policy or practice
over federal lands located within the geographic boundaries of this county:
   A.   Causes alteration of present county land use regulations without such
changes having been initiated voluntarily by the county; and
   B.   Makes it unfeasible for existing, lawful businesses to continue their
current operations; then the proposed federal action will be presumed by the
county to create a negative impact on the interrelated environmental, cultural
and economic well being of this county and its residents, and not to be a
preferred alternative acceptable to the county as it relates to resolving the
environmental and other concerns of the federal entities. (Ord. 262, 2009)
11.40.070: QUARTERLY REPORTS REQUIRED:
On a quarterly basis, the chairman of the board of Pershing County
commissioners, or his designee, shall report to the county commission and the
public on the activity of the county taken under this chapter, and actions
taken or proposed to be taken by the federal or state government regarding
federal lands in the county. (Ord. 262, 2009)

(Ord. 262, 2009)
11.60.030: FINDINGS OF FACT:
The board of Pershing County commissioners, a political subdivision of the
state of Nevada, finds as follows:
   A.   The government of the United States of America exercises control over
two million one hundred thousand (2,100,000) acres (81 percent) of the land and
the majority of natural resources within the geographic boundaries of Pershing
County;
   B.   Decisions governing federal lands in Pershing County have a direct

improvement of those natural resources and for the general purposes of the
county;
      3.   To determine when and if certain public lands should be devoted to
special purposes rather than multiple use in order to better utilize the
particular natural resources found on those lands, and to provide for orderly
transfer of special purpose public lands to private ownership if that will
effect more desirable utilization of the resources. (Ord. 262, 2009)

The legislature of the state of Nevada in Nevada Revised Statutes 278.020,
244A.057, and 543.020 confers upon local government units authority to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the Pershing County board of commissioners, in and
for the political subdivision of Pershing County, Nevada, does hereby adopt the
floodplain management regulations herein. This chapter shall be referred to as
the FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE. (Ord. 266, 2009)
15.08.020: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are caused by structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effects
of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards, which increase flood heights
and velocities, also contribute to flood losses. (Ord. 266, 2009)
15.08.030: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Protect human life and health;
   B.   Minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects;
   C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and

15.08.040: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions which:
   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damages at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, alluvial fans, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters;
   D.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage;
   E.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas.

FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS): The official report provided by the federal
insurance administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate
map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR: The community official designated by the Pershing
County commissioners to administer and enforce the floodplain management
regulations. The floodplain administrator for Pershing County is defined in
section
15.08.130 of this chapter.
FLOODPLAIN AND FLOOD PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by waters from any source. (See definition of Flood, Flooding Or Floodwaters.)
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited
to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management
plans, regulations and ordinances.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: This chapter, and any federal, state or
local regulations plus community zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations,
building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a
grading and erosion control) and other applications of police power which
control development in flood prone areas to prevent and reduce flood loss and
damage.
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and
their contents. Refer to FEMA technical bulletins TB-1 ("Openings In Foundation
Walls And Walls Of Enclosures", 2008), TB-3 ("Non-Residential Floodproofing -
Requirements And Certification", 1993), and TB-7 ("Wet Floodproofing
Requirements", 1993) for guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing.
FLOODWAY (Also Referred To As REGULATORY FLOODWAY): The channel of a river or
other watercourse and the adjacent land area that must be reserved in order to
discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation.
FOOTING: The enlarged base of a foundation wall, pier, or column, designed to
spread the load of the structure so that it does not exceed the soil bearing
capacity.
FOUNDATION: The underlying structure of a building usually constructed of
concrete that supports the foundation walls, piers, or columns.
FOUNDATION WALLS: A support structure that connects the foundation to the main
portion of the building or superstructure.
FRAUD/VICTIMIZATION: Related to variances of this chapter, the variance granted
must not cause fraud on or victimization to the public. In examining this
requirement, the Pershing County board of commissioners will consider the fact
that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities, and
remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years.
Buildings permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are
subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while
future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all
the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood
damages bring. Additionally future owners may be unaware of the risk potential
to the property due to flood damage and the extremely high rates for flood
insurance.
FREEBOARD: A margin of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for
purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many
unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated for selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the
watershed.
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only marina facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and boat building and boat repair
facilities, but does not include long term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
GOVERNING BODY: The local governing unit, county or municipality that is
empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for public health,
safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
HARDSHIP: Related to variances of this chapter, the exceptional hardship would
result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Pershing County
board of commissioners requires the variance be exceptional, unusual, and
pertain only to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship
alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical
handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise
cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems
can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of ground surface prior
to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is:
   A.   Listed individually in the national register of historic places (a
listing maintained by the department of the interior) or preliminarily
determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the national register; or
   B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district; or
   C.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states
with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary
of the interior; or
   D.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either
by an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the interior or
directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved programs.
HYDRAULICS: The science that deals with practical applications of water in
motion.
HYDRODYNAMIC LOADS: Forces imposed on structures by floodwaters due to the
impact of moving water on the upstream side of the structure, drag along its
sides, and eddies or negative pressures on its downstream side.

earth's surface and underground.
HYDROSTATIC LOADS: Forces imposed on a flooded structure due to the weight of
the water.
LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA): The procedure by which any owner or lessee of
property who believes his property has been inadvertently included in a special
flood hazard area can submit scientific and technical information to the
federal insurance administrator for review to remove the property from said
area. The administrator will not consider a LOMA if the information submitted
is based on alteration of topography or new hydrologic or hydraulic conditions
since the effective date of the FIRM.
LETTER OF MAP REVISION (BASED ON FILL) (LOMR-F): A letter from FEMA stating
that an existing structure or parcel of land that has been elevated by fill
would not be inundated by the base flood.
LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR): An official revision to a currently effective
FIRM. A LOMR officially changes flood zone, floodplain and floodway
designations, flood elevations and planimetric features.

and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement.
An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is
not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that the enclosure does not
violate applicable nonelevation design requirements.
MANUFACTURED HOME (MOBILE HOME): A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include "recreational vehicles".
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel or contiguous parcels of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MARKET VALUE:
   A.   For the purposes of determining substantial improvement, market value
pertains only to the structure in question. It does not pertain to the land,
landscaping or detached accessory structures on the property. For determining
improvement, the value of the land must always be subtracted.
   B.   Market value shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the
structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of
depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed.
      1.   The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square
foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide
recognized by the building construction industry.
      2.   The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into
account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional
obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include
economic or other forms of external obsolescence.
   C.   Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from
those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered
only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent
professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the
differences.

levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge,
conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel refuse, fill, structure,
vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any
watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
100-YEAR FLOOD: Having the same meaning as "base flood".
PHYSICAL MAP REVISIONS (PMR): A reprinted NFIP map incorporating changes to
floodplains, floodways, or flood elevations. Because of the time and cost
involved to change, reprint, and redistribute an NFIP map, a PMR is usually
processed when a revision reflects large scope changes.
PONDING HAZARD: A flood hazard that occurs in flat areas when there are
depressions in the ground that collect "ponds" of water. The ponding hazard is
represented by the zone designation AH on the FIRM.
POST-FIRM CONSTRUCTION: Construction or substantial improvement that started on
or after the effective date of the initial flood insurance rate map (FIRM) of
the community or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later.
PRE-FIRM CONSTRUCTION: Construction or substantial improvement which started on
or before December 31, 1974, or before the effective date of the initial flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) of the community, whichever is later.

one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding must
be provided.
PUBLIC SAFETY/NUISANCE: This definition relates to variances. The granting of a
variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of
the entire community or neighborhood, or any number of persons, or unlawfully
obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable
lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle built on a single chassis, four hundred (400)
square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection,

stream, brook, etc.
SHEET FLOW AREA: Having the same meaning as Area Of Shallow Flooding.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): Darkly shaded area on a flood hazard boundary
map (FHBM) or a flood insurance rate map (FIRM) that identifies an area that
has a one percent (1%) chance of being flooded in any given year (100-year
floodplain). Over a thirty (30) year period, the life of most mortgages, there
is at least a twenty six percent (26%) chance that this area will be flooded.
The FIRM identifies these shaded areas as FIRM zones A, AO, AH, A1-A30, AE,

definition of Flood Insurance Risk Zone Designations.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and other proposed new
development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days from
the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building that is principally aboveground and
includes gas or liquid storage tanks and manufactured homes.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds
fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits
construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development in a special
flood hazard area, without an elevation certificate, other certifications or
other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the North American vertical

The areas of special flood hazard identified by the federal insurance
administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood
Insurance Study Of The County Of Pershing", with accompanying flood insurance
maps is adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The
flood insurance study (FIS) dated September 25, 2009, and accompanying flood
insurance rate maps (FIRM) and flood boundary and floodway maps (FBFM), dated
June 17, 1991, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The FIS and
attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may
be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this
chapter and which are recommended to the Pershing County board of commissioners
by the floodplain administrator. The FIS, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at the
Pershing County administration building. (Ord. 266, 2009)
15.08.070: COMPLIANCE:
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. Violations (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute a misdemeanor. Each day that the violation continues to occur
constitutes a separate and distinct violation. Each violation shall constitute
a separate misdemeanor count. Each violation is subject to a minimum fine of
one hundred dollars ($100.00) and a maximum fine of one thousand dollars
($1,000.00). Nothing herein shall prevent the Pershing County board of
commissioners from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation. (Ord. 266, 2009)
15.08.075: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing

delegate this authority to any officer in the county. (Ord. 266, 2009)
15.08.140: LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR; DUTIES GENERALLY:
Duties of the local administrator shall include, but not be limited to, those
in sections
15.08.150 through
15.08.190 of this chapter. (Ord. 266, 2009)
15.08.150: PERMIT APPLICATION REVIEW:
The local administrator shall not issue a floodplain development permit unless
the following has been accomplished by the floodplain administrator or his
designee:
   A.   Review all development permit applications to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including, but not limited
to, the requirements of section
15.08.120 of this chapter.
   B.   Review all subdivision and other proposed new development, including
manufactured home and recreational vehicle parks to determine whether the
proposed development site will be reasonably safe from flooding. When the
proposed building site is located in the special flood hazard area, all new
construction and substantial improvements will meet the applicable standards of
sections
15.08.220 through
15.08.290 (inclusive) and 15.08.320 of this chapter.
   C.   Determine whether any proposed development in the special flood hazard
area may result in physical damage to any other property to include stream bank
erosion and any increase in velocities or that it does not adversely affect the
carrying capacity of the areas where base flood elevations have been determined
but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter,
"adversely affects" means the cumulative effect of the proposed development
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any
point. To assist the local floodplain administrator in making this
determination, the permit applicant may be required to submit additional
technical analyses.
   D.   Review all development permit applications to determine that all
necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state, or local
governmental agencies from which prior approval is required.
   E.   For construction on an existing structure, determine if proposed
construction constitutes substantial improvement or repair of a substantially
damaged structure.
   F.   Review all development permit applications to determine if the proposed
development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that
the encroachment provisions of section
15.08.320 of this chapter are met. (Ord. 266, 2009)

15.08.280 through
15.08.320 of this chapter. The following applies to use of other flood data in
conjunction with the management of the floodplain:
   A.   When the federal emergency management agency has designated special
flood hazard areas on the community's flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) but has
neither produced water surface elevation data nor identified a floodway, the
local floodplain administrator shall attempt to obtain, review and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
state or other source, including data developed pursuant to subsection
15.08.120H of this chapter, as criteria for requiring new construction,
substantial improvements or other proposed development meets the requirements
of this chapter.
   B.   When base flood elevations are not available, the local floodplain
administrator may use flood information from any other authoritative source,
such as historical data, to establish flood elevations within the special flood
hazard areas. This information shall be submitted to the Pershing County board
of commissioners for adoption.
   C.   When base flood elevations are not available from any other source,
base flood elevations shall be obtained using one of two (2) methods from the

have openings below the base flood elevation shall be provided with automatic
backflow valves or other automatic backflow devices that are installed in each
discharge line passing through a building's exterior wall; and
   C.   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding. (Ord. 266, 2009)
15.08.270: STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISIONS:
The following shall apply to subdivisions:
   A.   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard
area and the elevation of the base flood.
   B.   All subdivision plans will provide the elevation of proposed structures
and pads. If the site is filled above the base flood, the final lowest floor
and pad elevation shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or
surveyor and provided to the floodplain administrator.
   C.   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage.
   D.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
   E.   All subdivisions shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to
flood hazards.
   F.   Additionally all subdivision proposals will demonstrate, by providing a
detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any
point within the community. (Ord. 266, 2009)
15.08.275: STANDARDS FOR CRITICAL STRUCTURES:
Critical structures are not authorized in a special flood hazard area, unless:
   A.   All alternative locations in flood zone X have been considered and
rejected.
   B.   All alternative locations in flood zone shaded X have been considered
and rejected.
If the floodplain manager determines the only practical alternative location
for the development of a new or substantially improved critical structure is in
a special flood hazard area he must give public notice of the decision and
reasons for the elimination of all alternative locations. (Ord. 266, 2009)
15.08.280: STANDARDS FOR MANUFACTURED HOMES:
   A.   All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved,
within zones A, AH, AE, and on the community's flood insurance rate map, on
sites located:
      1.   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision;
      2.   In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
      3.   In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision; or
      4.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site upon
which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a
flood;
shall be elevated on a permanent foundation so that the lowest floor will be
elevated at least two feet (2') above the base flood elevation and be securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to
be limited to, use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements
for resisting wind forces.
   B.   All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites
in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A, AH, and AE
on the community's flood insurance rate map that are not subject to the
provisions of section
15.08.275, "Standards For Critical Structures", of this chapter will be
elevated so that either:
      1.   The bottom of structural frame or the lowest point of the
manufactured home is at least two feet (2') above the base flood elevation; or
      2.   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than
thirty six inches (36") in height above grade and securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement.
   C.   Within zone A, when no base flood elevation data is available, new and
substantially improved manufactured homes shall have the floor elevated at
least three feet (3') above the highest adjacent grade.
   D.   Within zone AO, the floor of all new and substantially improved
manufactured homes will be elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least
two feet (2') above the depth number specified on the FIRM, or at least three
feet (3') above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
(Ord. 266, 2009)
15.08.285: STANDARDS FOR RECREATIONAL VEHICLES:
All recreational vehicles placed on sites within the floodplain on the
community's flood insurance rate map will either:
   A.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
days;
   B.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle is
ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to
the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has
no permanently attached additions; or
   C.   Will meet the permit requirements of section
15.08.120 of this chapter (permit application), and the elevation and anchoring
requirements for manufactured homes in section
15.08.280, "Standards For Manufactured Homes", of this chapter. (Ord. 266,
2009)
15.08.290: FLOODWAYS:
Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential,
the following provisions apply:
   A.   If a floodway has not been designated within the special flood hazard
areas established in section
15.08.065, "Basis For Establishing Areas Of Special Flood Hazard", of this
chapter, no new construction, substantial improvement, or other development
(including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE, unless it has
been demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any
point within the community.
   B.   In designated floodways located within the special flood hazard areas
established in section
15.08.065, "Basis For Establishing Areas Of Special Flood Hazard", of this
chapter encroachment shall be prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, storage of equipment or supplies, and any other
development within the adopted regulatory floodway; unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, performed in accordance
with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge, and the federal emergency management
agency has issued a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR).
   C.   If the provisions of this section have been satisfied, all proposed new
development and substantial improvements will comply with all other applicable
flood hazard reduction provisions of section
15.08.215, "Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction", of this chapter. (Ord. 266,
2009)
15.08.300: VARIANCE PROCEDURES:
The following provisions apply to variances:
   A.   Nature Of Variances: The variance criteria set forth in this section
are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a
piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for
a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying
with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to
the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
It is the duty of the Pershing County board of commissioners to help protect
its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of
the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that
variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood
ordinance are quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood
loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore,
the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain
multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted.
The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
If, upon review, the administrator of FEMA determines that community practices
indicate a pattern of issuing variances that is inconsistent with the
objectives of sound floodplain management, the community may be suspended from
the national flood insurance program.
   B.   Appeal Board:
      1.   In passing upon requests for variances, the appeals board shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter, and:
         a.   The danger of materials being swept onto other lands and injuring
others;
         b.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         c.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
         d.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         e.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         f.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         g.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         h.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         i.   The safety of access to the property in time of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         j.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and
         k.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and
bridges.
      2.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
         a.   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars
($100.00) of insurance coverage;
         b.   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be
recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the Pershing County
recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears as an exception
on the title of the affected parcel of land.
      3.   The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance
administration, federal emergency management agency.
   C.   Conditions For Variances: The following conditions apply to a variance
granted in accordance with this section:
      1.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvements, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-
half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the
procedures of sections
15.08.110, "Administration", and 15.08.215, "Provisions For Flood Hazard
Reduction", of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
      2.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
"historic structures", as defined in section
15.08.045, "Definitions", of this chapter upon a determination that the
proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
      3.   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      4.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the Pershing County board of commissioners
need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to
whatever elevation the applicant proposed, but only to that elevation which the
Pershing County board of commissioners believes will both provide relief and
preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
      5.   Variances shall only be issued upon a:
         a.   Showing of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional "hardship", as defined in section
15.08.045, "Definitions", of this chapter to the applicant.
            (1)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance, defined in section
15.08.045, "Definitions", of this chapter as "public safety/nuisance", cause
fraud or victimization, as defined in section
15.08.045, "Definitions", of this chapter of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
      6.   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of this subsection C
are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by
methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result
in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.
      7.   Upon consideration of all the factors of this code and the purposes
of this chapter, the appeals board may attach such conditions to the granting
of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
(Ord. 266, 2009)
15.08.310: MAP REVISION AND AMENDMENT PROCEDURES:
The following provisions apply to map revision and amendments:
National flood insurance program regulations provide procedures to remove
property from the 100-year floodplain or from a special flood hazard area.
Amendments and revisions to community flood insurance rate maps cannot
adversely impact the floodplain or floodway delineations of the level of the
100-year flood.
There are several procedures provided whereby the federal insurance
administrator will review information from the community, an owner, or a lessee
of property where it is believed the property should not be included in a
special flood hazard area.
   A.   Submissions to FEMA for revisions to effective flood insurance studies
(FISs) by individual and community requesters will require the signing of
application/certification forms. These forms will provide FEMA with assurance
that all pertinent data relating to the revision are included in the submittal.
They will also assure that: 1) the data and methodology are based on current
conditions; 2) qualified professionals have assembled data and performed all
necessary computations; and 3) all individuals and organizations impacted by
proposed changes are aware of the changes and will have an opportunity to
comment on them. FEMA procedures permit the following types of requests:
      1.   A request for a revision to the effective FIS information (FIRM,
FBFM, and/or FIS report) is usually a request that FEMA replace the effective
floodplain boundaries, flood profiles, floodway boundaries, etc., with those
determined by the requester. Before FEMA will replace the effective FIS
information with the revised, the requester must: a) provide all of the data
used in determining the revised floodplain boundaries, flood profiles, floodway
boundaries, etc.; b) provide all data necessary to demonstrate that the
physical modifications to the floodplain have been adequately designed to
withstand the impacts of the one percent (1%) annual chance flood event and
will be adequately maintained; c) demonstrate that the revised information
(e.g., hydrologic and hydraulic analyses and the resulting floodplain and
floodway boundaries) are consistent with the effective FIS information.
      2.   Requests for amendments or revisions to FEMA maps must be reviewed
and submitted to FEMA by the Pershing County board of commissioners with the
applicant for a map amendment or revision required to prepare all the
supporting information and appropriate FEMA forms.
   B.   The scientific or technical information to be submitted with these
requests may include, but is not limited to, the following:
      1.   An actual copy of the recorded plat map bearing the seal of the
appropriate recordation official county clerk or recorder of deeds indicating
the official recordation and proper citation, deed or plat book volume and page
number, or an equivalent identification where annotation of the deed or plat
book is not the practice.
      2.   A topographical map showing:
         a.   Ground elevation contours in relation to the NGVD (national
geodetic vertical datum).
         b.   The total area of the property in question.
         c.   The location of the structure or structures located on the
property in question.
         d.   The elevation of the lowest adjacent grade to a structure or
structures.
         e.   An indication of the curvilinear line which represents the area
subject to inundation by a base flood. The curvilinear line should be based
upon information provided by an appropriate authoritative source, such as a
federal agency, department of water resources, a county water control district,
a county or city engineer, a federal emergency management agency flood
insurance study, or a determination by a registered professional engineer.
      3.   A copy of the FHBM or FIRM indicating the location of the property
in question.
      4.   A certification by a registered professional engineer or licensed
land surveyor that the lowest grade adjacent to the structure is above the base
flood elevation.
      5.   The completion of the appropriate forms in the federal emergency
management agency's packets, amendments and revisions to national flood
insurance program maps (MT-1 FEMA form 81-87 series and MT-2 FEMA form 81-89
series). (Ord. 266, 2009)
15.08.320: ENCROACHMENTS:
The cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point. (Ord. 266,
2009)
15.08.330: VIOLATION; PENALTIES:
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter
by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned for not more than ninety
(90) days, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and
expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the
county from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation. (Ord. 266, 2009)

15.18.010: ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE:
Pershing County hereby establishes a special use permit process. The purpose of
this chapter is to provide a method of reviewing proposed uses, which possess
characteristics that require special appraisal in order to determine if the
uses have the potential to adversely affect other land uses, air or water
quality, transportation systems, or public facilities or services. (Ord. 308,
2014)
15.18.020: HEARING PROCESS AND NOTICING:
The board of Pershing County commissioners shall take action to approve,
approve with conditions, modify, modify with conditions, or deny the special
use permit request based upon recommendations from the Pershing County regional
planning commission. Except as otherwise provided by law, the process shall
follow the general provisions of the Pershing County development code for
special use permits as part of the approval of a special use permit application
in relation to noticing and holding hearings. Failure of the commission to hold
a public hearing or take action within the time frames provided in this chapter
shall constitute approval of the application.
A hearing to consider an application for a special use permit shall be held
within sixty five (65) days after the filing of the application. The hearing
must be noticed and conducted according to the provisions set forth in Nevada
Revised Statutes 278.315. (Ord. 308, 2014)
15.18.030: PREAPPLICATION PROCESS:
Prior to submitting the application for a special use permit, the applicant
must have a presubmission meeting with Pershing County planning and building
department staff to discuss the project and the application. No special use
permit application shall be accepted and processed until the information
necessary to review and decide upon the proposed special use permit is deemed
complete. (Ord. 308, 2014)
15.18.040: APPLICATION PROCESS:
As part of the application process, the planning department, fire department,
emergency medical services, sheriff's department, public works department,
other county staff, or other public entities that supply infrastructure or
other necessary services may provide review of the application. Based upon the
recommendations of these departments, staff, or other entities, reasonable
conditions that are related and roughly proportional to the proposed use of the
property may be suggested as a requirement of the special use permit and
subject to the approval of the board of Pershing County commissioners. (Ord.
308, 2014)
15.18.050: APPLICATION FEE:
An application processing fee of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), as
established by the board of Pershing County commissioners, shall be collected
for any application for a special use permit made in compliance with this
chapter. (Ord. 308, 2014)
15.18.060: CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL:
No special use permit application shall be approved unless the applicant
establishes that the use is appropriate at the proposed location and meets the
following criteria:
   A.   All of the applicable application elements, as outlined in this code,
are complete and the applicant has agreed to meet all conditions imposed as a
part of the special use permit approval process;
   B.   The proposed use shall be consistent with the purpose, goals,
objectives and standards of this chapter, the county master plan and of the
Pershing County development code;
   C.   The proposed use shall not result in a substantial or undue adverse
effect on adjacent properties, character of the neighborhood, roads or traffic
conditions, parking, public improvements or infrastructure, public sites or
rights of way, the potential impairment of natural resources, or other matters
affecting the public health, safety, and general welfare;
   D.   The proposed use will be adequately served by public improvements,
facilities, and services, and will not impose an undue burden on other users;
and
   E.   The applicant for a special use permit shall have the burden of proof
by a preponderance of the evidence to provide facts supporting the proposed
special use permit. For the purposes of legal clarity, this shall include the
burden of going forward with the evidence and the burden of persuasion on all
questions of fact, which are to be determined by the Pershing County regional
planning commission and board of Pershing County commissioners. Additionally,
the applicant shall provide adequate information in the application and on the
site plan to substantiate the findings required in this section. (Ord. 308,
2014)
15.18.070: APPEAL PROCESS:
Any aggrieved person may appeal a decision denying or approving the application
decision of the Pershing County regional planning commission to the board of
Pershing County commissioners within ten (10) days after the date of the final
decision. If the end of the appeal period falls on a nonbusiness day, the
appeal period shall be extended to include the next business day. (Ord. 308,
2014)
15.18.080: WHO CAN APPEAL:
Appeals may be filed by any person aggrieved by the decision of the Pershing
County regional planning commission if the person is:
   A.   The applicant or the applicant's authorized agent;
   B.   An owner of real property who has received notice of the public hearing
pursuant to section
15.18.020 of this chapter;
   C.   A person who may be adversely affected by the decision; and has
participated in the review process by submitting written testimony on the
application prior to the public hearing before the planning commission; or
   D.   Has participated in the review process by providing oral or written
testimony at the public hearing before the planning commission on the
application. (Ord. 308, 2014)
15.18.090: CONTENTS OF APPEAL:
The appeal shall be in writing and state the basis of the appeal by citing the
inadequacy of the findings made by the planning commission. Such reasons shall
be based upon the evidence presented to the planning commission at the original
hearing. Failure of the appellant to present such reasons shall be deemed cause
for denial of the appeal. A fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00) shall be paid
to the Pershing County clerk at the time of filing the appeal. (Ord. 308, 2014)
15.18.100: TIME PERIOD FOR HEARING OF APPEAL:
The clerk of the board of Pershing County commissioners (the Pershing County
clerk) shall schedule a public hearing on the appeal of the planning
commission's final decision before the board of Pershing County commissioners
within sixty (60) days of the date of the filing of the appeal. (Ord. 308,
2014)
15.18.110: ACTION BY THE BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS:
The board of Pershing County commissioners shall consider only those items
cited in the appeal. In its deliberation, it may use the record and any
additional evidence relevant to the application and may confirm, reverse, or
modify the appealed actions based upon its interpretation of the criteria
required for approval per section
15.18.060 of this chapter and the evidence submitted. The board of county
commissioners shall render a final decision within sixty (60) days of the
appeal hearing. In the case of a tie due to the absence of a member, the appeal
shall be continued to a future meeting unless requested otherwise by the
appellant. Said future meeting may be beyond the sixty (60) days required for a
final decision. The final decision of the board of county commissioners shall
be final for the purposes of judicial review, with exception of a renewable
energy generation project special use permit, which can be appealed, under
certain conditions, to the public utilities commission of Nevada pursuant to
Nevada Revised Statutes 278.26506. (Ord. 308, 2014)
15.18.120: EFFECTIVE DATE:
The decision of the board of county commissioners shall be effective
immediately. (Ord. 308, 2014)
15.18.130: SPECIAL USE PERMIT MAINTENANCE:
Construction on the project shall commence within two (2) years of approval. If
the applicant is not able to initiate construction within that period, a two
(2) year time extension from the date of the original approval of the special
use permit may be granted by the board of county commissioners following a
progress report presented at an open public meeting of the commission. If the
applicant has not commenced construction solely due to length or contingency on
federal or state permitting process, the board shall grant approval of a two
(2) year time extension following presentation of the progress report. In the
event that the use authorized by the special use permit is abandoned for a
period of more than two (2) years from the date of last producing operations,
the permit shall become null and void and a new special use permit shall be
required. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this code, the
term "abandonment", as applied to renewable generation project facilities shall
not be construed as applying to a facility with regular on site employees,
maintenance, and security, regardless of whether commercial production at the
facility has temporarily lapsed. In the event of a force majeure event, such
as, and not limited to, a flood, damage, or destruction of the access to the
site, earthquake, or other events beyond the control of the county or permit
holder, the period of abandonment shall not be deemed to commence until such
time as the permit holder may be found to once again have reasonable access to
the site. In this case, the permit holder shall reasonably attempt to establish
access to the site. The special use permit shall remain valid as long as the
permit holder, its heirs, assigns, or successors remain in compliance with the
terms of this permit and county, state and federal regulations. In the event
that the permit lapses or the use is discontinued or abandoned, the permit
holder/owner, its heirs, assigns or successors shall remain responsible for
environmental compliance until postclosure reclamation requirements are met. If
the facility is not being abandoned, but is not in operation for greater than
two (2) years for a reason such as equipment failure, replacement, or
maintenance, the project contractor shall notify Pershing County in writing
indicating an estimated time line for operations to recommence. (Ord. 308,

15.18.200: EXPEDITED PERMIT PROCESS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION PROJECTS ON
PUBLIC LANDS:
The following is adopted in reference to public lands which are managed by the
federal government:
   A.   Purpose And Definition: Any renewable energy generation project that is
required to apply for a renewable energy generation project special use permit,
may apply instead for an expedited renewable energy generation project permit
if Pershing County determines that each of following conditions apply:
      1.   The project is proposed to be fully or partially built on public
land that is in an isolated or rural area in Pershing County. "Isolated or
rural" is defined as being more than twenty (20) miles from Interstate 80;
      2.   The project is proposed to be built in a location where there will
be minimal risk of disturbance to residents;
      3.   All project impacts on Pershing County services, including, but not
limited to: roads, law enforcement, fire, and emergency response; are addressed
to the county's satisfaction;
      4.   The applicant has been required by a federal land management agency
to complete an environmental review process that includes an environmental
impact statement (EIS) or environmental assessment (EA);
      5.   The county is engaged in the federal environmental review process as
a cooperating agency, is made aware of the project at the beginning of the
federal review and permit application process, and through this process can
ensure that the health, safety and welfare of Pershing County residents are
adequately protected.
   B.   Application Process: Prior to submitting the application for the
permit, and at the beginning of the federal review and permit application
process, the applicant must have a presubmission meeting with Pershing County
staff to discuss the project and the application. If all of the above
conditions are met the applicant shall submit as the application the
appropriate documents related to the environmental review by state and federal
land management agencies. Following the submission of the application, staff
will grant an administrative approval or denial of the permit within sixty five
(65) days. If granted an approval, final issuance of the permit will be
contingent on approval of any pending federal land use permits, as well as the
review of any documents associated with the EIS or EA.
   C.   Application Fee: An application processing fee, as established by the
board of Pershing County commissioners, shall be collected for any application
for an expedited renewable energy generation project permit. In addition, the
applicant may be required to pay the cost for a contractor to represent the
county as a cooperating agency in the federal environmental review process if
the county does not otherwise have the capacity or staff to review and
participate.
   D.   Conflict With Federal Law Or Regulation: Unless the matter is a matter
regulated under state sovereignty, the county will defer to federal
requirements to ensure there is no conflict with existing federal law. (Ord.
308, 2014)
