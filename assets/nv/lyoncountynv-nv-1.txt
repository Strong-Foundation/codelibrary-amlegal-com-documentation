348, section 4 is hereby amended as follows:
 
15.348.04: DESIGN STANDARDS:
All of the following design standards shall be met by all multi- family
residential developments:
   A.   Building Orientation: Multi-family residential developments, when
abutting a private street, local, collector, or arterial street that has
existing or planned on-street parking, shall have the building oriented to the
street along a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the site's frontage (see
figure 15.348-2 of this subsection).

The "orientation" standard is met when all of the following criteria are met:
      1.   Primary building entrances shall face the street;
      2.   The front of the buildings shall be within twenty five feet (25') of
the front lot/parcel line,
Exception: Open, courtyard space in excess of twenty five feet (25') may be
placed in front of building entrances. Open courtyard space is defined as
usable, hard-surfaced space with pedestrian amenities including benches,
seating walls or similar furnishings.
      3.   Off-street parking or vehicular circulation shall not be placed
between buildings and streets used to comply with this standard;
   B.   Building Form: New multi-family construction shall comply with the
following building form standards (see figure 15.348-3 of this subsection).

      1.   Structures shall not have continuous horizontal distance exceeding
one hundred feet (100') (measured from end wall to end wall).
      2.   A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the front facade (area
measurement) shall contain windows or doors. All windows and doors shall be
trimmed or be recessed (i.e., into the front facade) to provide shadowing.
      3.   Garages attached to living units and accessed from the street (front
setback) shall be recessed at least four feet (4') behind the front facade of a
dwelling structure; and
      4.   Exterior building elevations shall incorporate design features
including offsets, balconies, projections, window reveals, or similar elements
to preclude large expansions of uninterrupted building surfaces. Along the
vertical face of a structure, the features shall occur at a minimum of every
thirty feet (30'), and on each floor shall contain a minimum of two (2) of the
following features:
         a.   Recesses (e.g., deck, patio, courtyard, entrance, window reveals)
that have a minimum depth of three feet (3');
         b.   Extensions (e.g., floor area, deck, patio, entrance) that have a
minimum depth of two feet (2') and minimum length of four feet (4'); and/or
         c.   Offsets or breaks in roof elevation of two feet (2') or greater
in height. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
C. Roof Form: New multi-family residential structure(s) shall comply with the
following building form standards
1. Roof Architecture
a. General Design Principles
1. No specific architectural style is required; however, within a development,
buildings shall incorporate complementary forms, materials, colors, and
rooflines that result in a cohesive and integrated design.
2. Roof massing shall avoid box-like or monotonous appearances. Articulation
shall be achieved through variations in roof planes, changes in materials, and
the integration of architectural elements.
3. Architectural detailing and materials shall be consistently applied on all
building elevations to retain a cohesive design.
2. Roof Form and Massing
a. Roof Design and Variation
1. Roof forms shall be used to break up long horizontal massing, reflect
internal building organization, and emphasize entries, corners, or unit
modules.
2. Roofs shall have variations in plane accomplished by changes in plane or by
the use of traditional roof forms such as dormers (pitched, shed-roof or
eyebrow), gables, hipped roofs and variations in pitch.
3. Flat roofs may be permitted if fully concealed behind architectural facade
roof elements that simulate sloped rooflines through construction of false or
partial roof forms integrated into the building’s exterior. These elements
shall be constructed along all exterior elevations of the building and shall
maintain a minimum height consistent with a 3:12 roof pitch measured from the
top of the primary roof surface to the peak of the facade roof. The facade roof
shall be continuous around the entire perimeter of the building to ensure a
consistent and integrated architectural appearance, which shall be compatible
with and complimentary to the architectural character of the surrounding
development.
b. Roof Function and Expression
1. Roof forms shall be aligned with and reinforce the layout of the building,
highlighting entrances, corners, and unit configurations.
2. Applied or purely decorative roof features that are not structurally or
visually integrated into the building are discouraged.
 
 
3. Rooftop Mechanical Equipment Screening
a. All rooftop mechanical equipment shall be fully screened from view from
public streets, adjacent residential uses, and publicly accessible locations
(e.g. sidewalks, parks, or other ground level areas open to the public).
Required screening shall be designed to ensure that rooftop mechanical
equipment is not visible when viewed from any adjacent public street, adjacent
residential use, or publicly accessible location located at or below the
elevation of the top of the highest occupied floor of the building.
b. Screening shall be accomplished through one or more of the following:
1. Locating equipment within recessed roof wells below the height of facade
roof elements;
2. Enclosing equipment within a rooftop structure designed and finished in a
manner architecturally consistent with the primary building; or
3. Using facade roof forms that are of sufficient height and design to fully
conceal equipment from all public views.
c.    Mechanical equipment shall not extend above the visible roofline or roof
screen.
4. Alternative Compliance
The Community Development Director may approve deviations from the standards
set forth in this section through the minor variance process if the applicant
demonstrates that the proposed design:
a. Meets or exceeds the overall intent of these design standards;
b. Provides an equal or greater level of architectural quality and visual
interest; and
c. Maintains compatibility with surrounding development patterns.
    
Section 2. If any section of this ordinance or portion thereof is for any
reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction,
such holding shall not invalidate the remaining parts of this ordinance
 
Section 3. All ordinances, parts of ordinances, chapters, sections,
subsections, clauses, phrases or sentences contained in the Lyon County Code in
conflict herewith are hereby repealed.
 
 Section 4. This ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and after its
passage, approval and publication as required by law.
 
 
Proposed on the 15th day of  May , 2025.

33   the issuance of construction permits, the cost estimate for the complete removal of
non-
34   operational above and below ground improvements must be submitted and financial
assurance
35   must be posted.
36   a. Decommissioning Plan:
 The Decommissioning Plan will address the following items:
37   i.  All physical improvements, materials, and equipment related to solar
energy
38   generation, transmission, and storage must be removed from the surface and
39   the subsurface to a minimum depth of forty-eight (48”) inches. The pre-
existing
40   soil grade shall also be restored following disturbance caused in the
removal
41   process. These shall include, but are not limited to, structures,
buildings,
42   equipment, cabling and wiring, solar electric systems, electrical
components,
43   security barriers, foundations, pilings, berms, storm water improvements,
and
44   any other associated facilities.
45   ii.  All fencing shall be removed and recycled or reused unless the
Community
46   Development Director grants approval for any existing perimeter fencing to
47   remain in place, in which case, the Nevada Department of Wildlife will be
48   consulted to ensure that the remaining fence will not negatively impact
wildlife.
 
1   iii.  All access roads located within the Project Area shall be removed unless
the
2   road was in existence prior to the development or the Community Development
3   Director approves a written request from the current or purchasing
landowner
4   to allow a portion of the access roads and associated culverts or related
5   materials to remain.
6   iv.  For any part of the facility on leased property, the Decommissioning Plan
may
7   propose to incorporate agreements with landowners regarding the retainment
8   of driveways, roads, landscaping, berms, fences, gates or repurposed
buildings
9   or other structures with approval by the Board of County Commissioners.
10   However, any proposed use of remaining buildings or other structures must
be
11   in conformance with the regulations for the zoning district in effect at the
time
12   of Board of County Commissioners approval.
13   v.  Ground cover and screening established as part of the Facility Development
Plan
14   and other existing vegetation may remain as part of the Decommissioning
Plan.
15   Land disturbed as part of the decommissioning process must be reseeded and
16   re-vegetated with certified weed free native seed mixes or other plant
species
17   suitable to the area. A list of such appropriate plant materials shall be
provided
18   by the Community Development Director. Such planting and associated
grading
19   or other land disturbance must be completed within one (1) year of removal
of
20   Facility structures and equipment, in accordance with the Decommissioning
21   Plan approved and adopted by the Board of County Commissioners.
22   vi.  Disposal and recycling of all facility materials and equipment, including but
not
23   limited to, PV panels, inverters, and batteries must fully comply with all
24   applicable County, state and federal laws, regulations, and code
requirements,
25   which includes a County-approved demolition permit for work to be
performed
26   by a licensed contractor and an approved location for disposal of such
materials
27   and equipment.
28   vii.  Guaranteed Funds: Financial assurance for the estimated cost of
29   decommissioning and reclamation, which may include the possibility of
salvage
30   value if allowed by the Board of County Commissioners must be guaranteed
by
31   the owner or operator of the Facility prior to issuance of construction permits
to
32   ensure that decommissioning and reclamation can successfully occur. Should
33   another authority having jurisdiction (e.g., NDEP, Bureau of Land
Management,
34   etc.) also require financial assurance for decommissioning and reclamation,
the
35   Board of County Commissioners may consider accepting the same or portions
of
36   the same financial assurance to satisfy both requirements, so long as the
37   assurance meets the specifications of both Lyon County and the separate
38   authority. Upon issuance of the financial assurance, the applicant shall name
the
39   County as a party to the financial assurance. The applicant may choose one
of
40   the following options (either the full cost option or the tiered
securitization
41   option) to provide financial assurance.
42   viii.  Full Decommissioning Cost: The full cost of decommissioning and
reclamation
43   will be guaranteed by one or any combination of the following as
determined
44   acceptable by the Board of County Commissioners.
45   1.  Trust Fund: The owner or operator of the Facility shall establish a
trust
46   fund into which money specifically earmarked for decommissioning and
47   reclamation is deposited. The Facility Conditional Use Permits and the
48   terms of the trust fund shall prohibit the release of these funds without
 
1   the written consent of the County. The County shall consent to the
2   release of the funds upon compliance with the Decommissioning Plan
3   approved by the Board of County Commissioners.
4   2.  Payment Surety Bond: The owner or operator of the Facility shall obtain
5   a surety bond satisfactory to and approved by the County in an amount
6   equal to the estimated cost of decommissioning and reclamation. A
7   standby trust fund must be established into which the surety company
8   will make payments if the owner or operator fails to comply with their
9   financial responsibilities. This money deposited into the standby trust
10   fund shall be used to pay a third party to perform the work described in
11   the Decommissioning Plan approved by the Board of County
12   Commissioners.
13   3.  Letter of Credit: A letter of credit issued by a financial institution
that
14   has a credit rating of at least A- or higher by Standard and Poor's or A3
15   or higher by Moody's; and financial ratios and capitalization
16   requirements that are acceptable to the County, in the full amount of
17   the decommissioning and reclamation estimate.
18   4.  Tiered Securitization: An amount equal to, or more than, ten (10%)
19   percent of the approved decommissioning and reclamation cost
20   estimate shall be either: deposited into a cash escrow account at a
21   financial institution acceptable to the County; or an amount equal to, or
22   more than, ten (10%) percent of the decommissioning and reclamation
23   cost estimate in the form of a payment surety bond or a letter of credit
24   issued by a financial institution that has a credit rating of at least A-
25   from Standard & Poor's or A3 from Moody's and assets (50%) and
26   capital surplus (50%) totaling at least $10,000,000,000, or an A.M. Best
27   financial strength rating of at least A- (Excellent) or other credit
rating
28   and capitalization reasonably acceptable to the County shall be
29   obtained. The amount deposited in the cash escrow account, or the
30   amount of the surety bond or letter of credit, shall increase by an
31   additional ten (10%) percent each year on the anniversary of the
32   commencement of operation of the Facility for nine (9) additional years
33   until 100% of the full cost estimate of decommissioning and reclamation
34   is achieved.
35   ix.  Cost Estimate Update: The estimated decommissioning and reclamation
costs
36   must be recalculated at an interval no sooner than every year but not later
than
37   every five years by an independent third-party Nevada licensed engineer,
38   following the requirements for the original decommissioning cost estimate,
and
39   using the most current industry standards. The cost of preparing this
update
40   must be paid by the owner or operator.
41   x.  If the recalculated estimated cost of decommissioning and reclamation
exceeds
42   the original estimated cost by two percent (2%) or greater, then the
Facility
43   owner or operator shall deposit additional funds into the trust fund or
cash
44   escrow account or make an update to the payment surety bond or letter of
45   credit to meet the new cost estimate.
46   xi.  If the recalculated estimated cost of decommissioning and reclamation is
less
47   than ninety-eight percent (98%) of the original estimated cost, then the
County
48   may consider approval of a written request by the owner or operator to
reduce
 
1   the required deposits or, payment surety bond, or letter of credit to the
2   recalculated estimate of decommissioning and reclamation cost.
3   xii.  Any increase or decrease in the decommissioning and reclamation
securitization
4   shall be funded by the applicant or refunded to the applicant 
(if permissible by
5   the form of security) within ninety (90) calendar days and shall be
similarly
6   readjusted for every subsequent five (5)-year decommissioning cost estimate
7   update.
8   B. Amendment to Decommissioning Plan:
 Any amendment must be approved by the Board of
9   County Commissioners prior to beginning decommissioning and reclamation.
Applications
10   for an amendment shall require a public hearing under the same procedures as
required
11   for the Facility Conditional Use Permit. Required timeframes for completion
of
12   decommissioning and reclamation shall not be extended due to the amendment
13   application process.
14   C. Partial Decommissioning:
 If decommissioning is triggered for a portion, but not the entire
15   Facility, then the owner or operator shall complete decommissioning and reclamation
in
16   accordance with the Decommissioning Plan for the applicable
portion of the Solar Facility.
17   The remaining portion of the Solar Facility shall continue to be subject to
the
18   Decommissioning Plan.
19   D. Date of Decommissioning:
 If the Solar Facility is to be decommissioned and reclaimed, the
20   Facility owner or operator must notify the Community Development Director in writing
of
21   the proposed date of discontinued operations and plans for removal.
22   E. Abandonment of Facility: Unless otherwise approved by the Community
Development
23   Director (e.g., to allow time to repair damage from severe weather or to
update
24   equipment), Facilities that have not been in active and continuous service for a period
of
25   twelve 
(12) months, as determined by the Community Development Director based upon
26   receipt of a valid Land Use complaint, an unsatisfactory report from a state of
federal
27   agency, unsatisfactory annual life and fire safety inspections and/
or unsatisfactory self-
28   inspection of battery units, or a failure to provide any of these reports, shall
be
29   decommissioned and reclaimed at the Facility owner or operator’s expense.
However,
30   following the first six 
(6) months of failure to maintain the site, the County will have the
31   option to hire appropriate professionals to perform needed maintenance using the
surety
32   funds required by the Conditional Use Permit.
33   F. The owner or operator or their successors, within six 
(6) months after the complete cessation
34   of use of the Facility and at their sole expense, shall initiate and provide
continuous
35   decommissioning of the Facility in accordance with the approved Decommissioning
Plan.
36   a. Following the completion of decommissioning of the entire
Facility and payment for any
37   such costs arising out of a default by the owner or operator or their successors,
any
38   remaining securitized funds held by the County shall be distributed to the
project
39   owner(s) in the same percentage of the securitized funds matched with the
percentage
40   of the project owner's acreage ownership of the Facility.
41   G. Default Decommissioning and Reclamation by the County:
 If the owner or operator, or their
42   successors, fail to decommission the Facility pursuant to the approved
Decommissioning
43   Plan, and the County has not approved a repowering of the Facility, the County shall
have
44   the right, but not the obligation, to commence decommissioning and reclamation
activities
45   and shall have access to the property, and shall have the right to draw on securitized
funds
46   up to the amount of the actual decommissioning costs, and the rights to the
generation
47   equipment and ESS equipment and materials remaining on the property. If applicable,
any
48   excess decommissioning and reclamation securitized funds shall be returned to the
current
 
1   owner(s) of the property after the County has completed the decommissioning
and
2   reclamation activities and paid all outstanding invoices, divided according to
the
3   percentage of the property owner's acreage ownership of the Solar Facility. Nothing
herein
4   shall limit other rights or remedies that may be available to the County to enforce
the
5   obligations of the owner or operator or their successors, including under the
County's
6   zoning powers.

paid as are other claims against the County.
When it is necessary for an inquest jury to travel a greater distance than one
mile to view the remains of a dead person or to the place where the inquest is
to be held, the necessary and actual expenses entailed for the transportation
of the jury shall also be allowed, audited and paid as are other claims against
the County, upon proper certification therefor by the County Coroner.
      3.   Witnesses:
         a.   The County Coroner is authorized to issue subpoenas for
witnesses, returnable as may be directed, such subpoenas to be served by the
Coroner or such person as may be directed. Witnesses at a Coroner's inquest
shall be compensated as provided by law for witnesses required to attend in the
courts of this State, and such charge shall be a charge against the County.
The County Coroner must summon and examine, as witnesses, every person who, in
the Coroner's opinion or in the opinion of any of the jurors, as or may have
any knowledge of the facts. The Coroner may also summon a qualified surgeon or
physician to inspect and examine the body or hold a postmortem examination
thereon, or a chemist to make an analysis of the stomach or the tissues of the
deceased to give their professional opinions as to the cause of the death.

inquest jury shall render its verdict and certify the same in writing, signed
by each of them and setting forth the name of the deceased and when, where and
by what means death occurred and, if death was by criminal means, factually
known or reasonably established, the name of the person causing the death, if
known.
      5.   Filing Testimony: Testimony at such inquest shall be reduced to
writing, without delay, and filed in the office of the clerk of the District
Court.
      6.   Arrest Warrant: If the inquest jury finds that the person was killed
by another under circumstances not excusable or justifiable in law and the
party committing the act is not already in custody, the County Coroner or
District Attorney shall immediately take appropriate action for the issuance of
a warrant for the arrest of the accused.
The warrant may be served in any county of the State and returned by the
officer serving the same before a judge of the county in which issued. The
officer receiving such warrant shall have the same power under such warrant as
is afforded under a warrant from any court or judge in the State of Nevada.
      7.   Single Inquest for Multiple Deaths: A single inquest may be held
with respect to more than one death where all such deaths were occasioned by a
common cause. (1973 Code §2.06.130)
   C.   Powers and Duties in Examination of Bodies: If the preliminary
investigation of the County Coroner or of others assisting the Coroner has
failed to satisfy the Coroner or medical examiner as to the cause of the
particular death or where reasonable grounds exist to suspect that a crime has
been committed, the County Coroner or medical examiner is authorized to:
      1.   Take possession of and inspect or examine the body of the deceased
person, including a postmortem examination, which shall include the power to
exhume such body, in connection with any inspection or examination authorized
herein, and no search warrant shall be necessary for access thereto.
      2.   At the Coroner's discretion, make or cause to be made an analysis of
the stomach, blood or contents of organs or tissues of the body and secure
professional opinions as to the result of such postmortem examination. The
information so secured shall be reduced to writing and filed by the Coroner in
the records of the death of the deceased person. At the Coroner's discretion,
the Coroner may, if the circumstances warrant, hold an inquest as hereinabove
provided. The County Coroner or medical examiner shall have the right to retain
only such tissue of the body removed at the time of the autopsy as may, in his
opinion, be necessary or advisable to make proper investigation of the case or
for verification of the findings relating to the cause of death.
      3.   The County Coroner, or any person assisting the Coroner who may be
duly licensed by the State to do so, may perform an autopsy of any remains as
to which the Coroner has jurisdiction and authority as herein provided if the
deceased, prior to death, has authorized such an autopsy in a will or other
written instrument or upon receipt of a written authorization from a person
representing to be any of the following:
         a.   The surviving spouse;
         b.   A surviving child or parent;
         c.   A surviving brother or sister;
         d.   Any other kin or person who has or has acquired the right to
control the disposition of the remains;

         f.   Any other duly authorized public officer. (1973 Code §2.06.190)
   D.   Death Certificate: The cause of death appearing on a certificate of
death signed by the Coroner shall be in conformity with facts ascertained from
inquiry, autopsy and other scientific findings. In case of death without
medical attendance and without violence, casualty, criminal or undue means, the
Coroner may, without holding an inquest or autopsy, make the certificate of
death from statements of relatives, persons last in attendance or persons
present at the time of death, after due medical consultation and opinion has
been given by one qualified and licensed to practice medicine and so recorded
in the records of death, providing such information affords clear grounds to
establish the correct medical cause of death within accepted medical practice
and within the requirements for accuracy prescribed by the Division of Vital
Statistics of the State Division of Health. (1973 Code §2.06.140)
   E.   Designation of Morgue or Mortuaries; Designee Not Liable: In the
absence of a County morgue only, the County Coroner is authorized, equitably,
to designate one or more commercial mortuaries in the County, if furnished with
sufficient accommodations and facilities, to receive bodies. No person
operating a morgue or mortuary and no person employed in the same shall be
liable for the acts of the County Coroner or for the acts of any of his
deputies, assistants or staff personnel or other persons assisting the County
Coroner in performing the removal of any body to a morgue or mortuary or for
the performance of an autopsy upon such body. (1973 Code §2.06.200)
   F.   Relatives Notified; Release of Remains: The County Coroner shall use
due diligence to locate and notify the relatives of the deceased of the death
and of the location of the remains. The County Coroner, after his investigation
has been completed and upon proper identification of the body by the next of
kin, legal representative or close friend who has responsibility for burial,
shall release the body to such claim. The body of any unknown or unclaimed
person shall be buried by order of the County Coroner after a period not to
exceed ten (10) days from completion of the Coroner's investigation. (1973 Code

and/or windows, to prohibit entrance to the premises pending the arrival of a
legally authorized representative of the deceased; provided, that this shall
not be done in such a manner as to interfere with the investigation being
conducted by other law enforcement agencies. Any costs arising from the
premises being locked and sealed while occupied by property of the deceased may
be a proper and legal charge against the estate of the deceased, and shall be
disposed of through the office of the Lyon County Treasurer. Any weapons,
property or evidence related to the investigation or prosecution of any known
or suspected criminal death may, with knowledge of the Coroner, be delivered to
a law enforcement agency or District Attorney, receipt for which shall be

or other person shall remove a body from the place of its discovery for
pronouncement of death without prior knowledge of an express approval from the
Coroner or the appointed deputy.
      3.   Wilful disregard of the provisions of this subsection shall be a

found with the deceased, unless taken from the Coroner's possession by legal
authority. If the County Coroner or the deputy or assistant fails to so pay or

in subsection B1 above, the County Treasurer may, after giving notice by

appointed for an initial one year term and the remaining members shall be
appointed for an initial two (2) year term. A member may be reappointed by the
Board of County Commissioners at the end of his term in accordance with Board
of County Commissioner rules.
   E.   Vacancies: A vacancy occurring on a citizens' advisory board shall be
filled by the Board of County Commissioners for the remainder of the unexpired
term. Except as provided in subsection F of this section, if a member of an
advisory board misses three (3) consecutive meetings of the advisory board
without just cause as determined by the Chairman of the advisory board, a
vacancy in that member's position automatically occurs and the Board of County
Commissioners shall fill the vacancy as set forth in this subsection.

      1.   Presumption of Taxability: For the purpose of the proper
administration of this Chapter and to prevent evasion of the sales tax, it
shall be presumed that all gross receipts are subject to the tax until the
contrary is established. The burden of proving that a sale of tangible personal
property is not a sale at retail is upon the person who makes the sale, unless
he takes from the purchaser a certificate to the effect that the property is
purchased for resale. (1973 Code §4.16.010)
      2.   Effect of Certificate: The certificate relieves the seller from the
burden of proof only if taken in good faith from a person who is engaged in the
business of selling tangible personal property and who holds the permit
provided for in this subsection and subsection D of this Section and who, at
the time of purchasing the tangible personal property, intends to sell it in
the regular course of business or is unable to ascertain at the time of
purchase whether the property will be sold or will be used for some other
purpose. (1973 Code §4.16.020)
      3.   Contents and Form of Certificate: The certificate shall:
         a.   Be signed by and bear the name and address of the purchaser.

The certificate shall be substantially in such form as the Tax Commission may
prescribe. (1973 Code §4.16.030)
      4.   Liability of Purchaser Giving Certificate: If a purchaser who gives
a certificate makes any use of the property other than retention, demonstration
or display while holding it for sale in the regular course of business, the use
shall be taxable to the purchaser as of the time the property is first used by
him, and the sales price of the property to him shall be deemed the measure of
the tax. Only when there is an unsatisfied use tax liability on this basis
shall the seller be liable for sales tax with respect to the sale of the
property to the purchaser. If the sole use of the property other than
retention, demonstration or display in the regular course of business is the
rental of the property while holding it for sale, the purchaser may elect to
include in his gross receipts the amount of the rental charged rather than the
sale price of the property to him. (1973 Code §4.16.040)
      5.   Commingled Fungible Goods: If a purchaser gives a certificate with
respect to the purchase of fungible goods and thereafter commingles these goods
with other fungible goods not so purchased but of such similarity that the

sales from the mass of commingled goods shall be deemed to be sales of the
goods so purchased until a quantity of commingled goods equal to the quantity
of purchased goods so commingled has been sold. (1973 Code §4.16.060)
      6.   Improper Use of Certificate: Any person who gives a resale
certificate for property which he knows at the time of purchase is not to be
resold by him in the regular course of business for the purpose of evading
payment to the seller of the amount of the tax applicable to the transaction is
guilty of a misdemeanor. (1973 Code §4.16.050)
4.01.04: USE TAX:
   A.   Registration Required: Every retailer selling tangible personal
property for storage, use or other consumption in the County shall register
with the Tax Commission and give:

      2.   The location of all distribution or sales houses or offices or other
places of business in the County.
      3.   Such other information as the Tax Commission may require. (1973 Code
§4.20.080)
   B.   Tax Imposed: An excise tax is imposed on the storage, use or other
consumption in the County of tangible personal property purchased from any
retailer on or after May 1, 1981, for storage, use or other consumption in the
County at the rate of two and twenty five one-hundredths percent (2.25%) of the
sales price of the property. (1973 Code §4.20.010)
   C.   Liability for Tax: Every person storing, using or otherwise consuming
in the County tangible personal property purchased from a retailer is liable
for the tax. His liability is not extinguished until the tax has been paid to
the County; except, that a receipt from a retailer maintaining a place of
business in the County or from a retailer who is authorized by the Tax
Commission, under such rules and regulations as it may prescribe, to collect
the tax and who is, for the purposes of this Section relating to the use tax,
regarded as a retailer maintaining a place of business in the County, given to
the purchaser pursuant to subsection D of this Section is sufficient to relieve
the purchaser from further liability for the tax to which the receipt refers.
(1973 Code §4.20.020)
   D.   Collection of Tax from Consumer; Receipt: Every retailer maintaining a
place of business in the County and making sales of tangible personal property
for storage, use or other consumption in the County, not exempted under Section
4.01.02 of this Chapter, definition of "exempted from laws imposed by this
Chapter", and Section
4.01.05 of this Chapter, shall, at the time of making the sales or, if the
storage, use or other consumption of the tangible personal property is not then
taxable hereunder, at the time the storage, use or other consumption becomes
taxable, collect the tax from the purchaser and give to the purchaser a receipt
therefor in the manner and form prescribed by the Tax Commission. (1973 Code
§4.20.030)
The tax required to be collected by the retailer constitutes a debt owned by
the retailer to the County. (1973 Code §4.20.040)
   E.   Advertising Restrictions and Regulations:
      1.   It is unlawful for any retailer to advertise or hold out or state to
the public or to any customer, directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part
thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the retailer, or that it will not be
added to the selling price of the property sold, or that if added, it or any
part thereof will be refunded. (1973 Code §4.20.050)
      2.   The tax required to be collected by the retailer from the purchaser
shall be displayed separately from the list price, the price advertised in the
premises, the marked price or other price on the sales check or other proof of
sales. (1973 Code §4.20.060)
   F.   Certificate of Resale:
      1.   Presumption of Taxability: For the purpose of the proper
administration of this Chapter and to prevent evasion of the use tax and the
duty to collect the use tax, it shall be presumed that tangible personal
property sold by any person for delivery in the County is sold for storage, use
or other consumption in the County until the contrary is established. The
burden of proving the contrary is upon the person who makes the sale, unless he
takes from the purchaser a certificate to the effect that the property is
purchased for resale. (1973 Code §4.24.010)
      2.   Effect of Certificate: The certificate relieves the person selling
the property from the burden of proof only if taken in good faith from a person
who is engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property and who
holds the permit provided for by subsections 4.01.03D and E of this Chapter and
who, at the time of purchasing the tangible personal property, intends to sell
it in the regular course of business or is unable to ascertain at the time of
purchase whether the property will be sold or will be used for some other
purpose. (1973 Code §4.24.020)
      3.   Contents and Forms of Certificate: The certificate shall:
         a.   Be signed and bear the name and address of the purchaser.
         b.   Indicate the number of the permit issued to the purchaser.
         c.   Indicate the general character of the tangible personal property
sold by the purchaser in the regular course of business.
The certificate shall be substantially in such form as the Tax Commission may
prescribe. (1973 Code §4.24.030)
      4.   Liability of Purchaser Giving Certificate: If a purchaser who gives
a certificate makes any storage or use of the property other than retention,
demonstration or display while holding it for sale in the regular course of
business, the storage or use is taxable as of the time the property is first so
stored or used. If the sole use of the property, other than retention,
demonstration or display in the regular course of business, is the rental of
the property while holding it for sale, the purchaser may elect to pay the tax
on the use measured by the amount of the rental charge rather than the sales
price of the property to him. (1973 Code §4.24.040)
      5.   Commingled Fungible Goods: If a purchaser gives a certificate with
respect to the purchase of fungible goods and thereafter commingles these goods

identity of the constituent goods in the commingled mass cannot be determined,
sales from the mass of commingled goods shall be deemed to be sales of the
goods so purchased until a quantity of commingled goods equal to the quantity
of purchased goods so commingled has been sold. (1973 Code §4.24.050)
      6.   Presumptions:
         a.   Presumptions of Purchase from Retailer: It shall be further
presumed that tangible personal property shipped or brought to the County by
the purchaser after January 1, 1971, was purchased from a retailer on or after
January 1, 1971, for storage, use or other consumption in the County. (1973
Code §4.24.060)
         b.   Presumption of Use; Out-of-County Delivery: On and after January

outside this County to a purchaser known by the retailer to be a resident of
the County was purchased from a retailer for storage, use or other consumption
in the County and stored, used or otherwise consumed in the County. This
presumption may be controverted by:

authorized representative and retained by the vendor, that the property was
purchased for use at a designated point or points outside the County.

judgment so entered by the County Clerk unless sooner released or otherwise
discharged.
The lien may, within five (5) years from the date of the judgment or within
five (5) years from the date of the last extension of the lien in the manner
herein provided, be extended by filing for record in the office of the County
Recorder of any county an abstract or copy of the judgment, and from the time

Commission of the person liable for the same and the fact that the Tax
Commission has complied with all provisions of this Chapter in the
determination of the amount required to be paid.
         b.   From the time of the filing for record, the amount required to be
paid, together with interest and penalty, constitutes a lien upon all real
property in the county where filed, owned by the person or, afterwards and

priority of a judgment lien and shall continue for five (5) years from the time
of the filing of the certificate unless sooner released or otherwise
discharged.
         c.   The lien may, within five (5) years from the date of the filing

of the lien in the manner herein provided, be extended by filing for record a
new certificate in the office of the county recorder of any such county, and
from the time of such filing, the lien shall be extended to the real property
in such county for five (5) years, unless sooner released or otherwise
discharged. (1973 Code §4.56.110)
      5.   Release or Subordinate Lien: The Tax Commission may, at any time,
release all or any portion of the property subject to any lien provided for in
this Chapter from the lien or subordinate the lien to other liens and

subordination of the lien will not jeopardize the collection of the amount,
interest and penalties. (1973 Code §4.56.120)

released from the lien or that the lien has been subordinated to other liens
and encumbrances shall be conclusive evidence that the property has been

Commission or its authorized representative may issue a warrant for the
enforcement of any liens and for the collection of any amount required to be
paid to the County under this Chapter.

a writ of execution.
The warrant shall be levied and sale made pursuant to it in the same manner and

The notice shall also be published for at least ten (10) days before the date
set for the sale in a newspaper of general circulation, published in the county

the county ten (10) days prior to the date set for the sale.
The notice shall contain a description of the property to be sold, a statement
of the amount due, including interest, penalties and costs, the name of the

jurisdiction.
         c.   If, for any reason, the receipt of the person liable for the
amount is not available, the Tax Commission shall deposit the excess moneys
with the County Treasurer, as trustee for the owner, subject to the order of
the person liable for the amount, his heirs, successors or assigns. (1973 Code

  4.01.08B of this Chapter.
4.01.10: LIABILITY OF SUCCESSORS:
If any retailer liable for any amount under this Chapter sells out his business
or stock of goods or quits the business, his successors or assigns shall
withhold sufficient of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former
owner produces a receipt from the Tax Commission showing that it has been paid
or a certificate stating that no amount is due. (1973 Code §4.64.010)
If the purchaser of a business or stock of goods fails to withhold the purchase
price as required, he becomes personally liable for the payment of the amount
required to be withheld by him to the extent of the purchasing price, valued in
money. Within sixty (60) days after receiving a written request from the
purchaser for a certificate or within sixty (60) days from the date the former
owner's records are made available for audit, whichever period expires later,
but in any event not later than ninety (90) days after receiving the request,
the Tax Commission shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the
purchaser at his address as it appears on the records of the Tax Commission of
the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate.
Failure of the Tax Commission to mail the notice will release the purchaser
from any further obligation to withhold the purchase price as above provided.
The time within which the obligation of a successor may be enforced shall start
to run at the time the retailer sells out his business or stock of goods or at
the time that the determination against the retailer becomes final, whichever
event occurs later. (1973 Code §4.64.020)
4.01.11: INJUNCTION PROHIBITED; ACTION FOR REFUND:

prevent or enjoin the collection under this Chapter of any tax or any amount of
tax required to be collected. (1973 Code §4.68.010)
   B.   Action for Refund:
      1.   Claim Required: No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any
court for the recovery of any amount alleged to have been erroneously or
illegally determined or collected unless a claim for refund or credit has been
duly filed. (1973 Code §4.68.020)

of the Tax Commission's action upon a claim filed pursuant to this Chapter, the
claimant may bring an action against the Tax Commission on the grounds set
forth in the claim in a court of competent jurisdiction in any county for the
recovery of the whole or any part of the amount with respect to which the claim
has been disallowed.
Failure to bring action within the time specified constitutes a waiver of any
demand against the County on account of alleged overpayments. (1973 Code
§4.68.030)
      3.   Failure of Tax Commission to Mail Notice; Right of Action: If the
Tax Commission fails to mail notice of action on a claim within six (6) months
after the claim is filed, the claimant may, prior to the mailing of notice by
the Tax Commission of its action on the claim, consider the claim disallowed
and bring an action against the Tax Commission on the grounds set forth in the
claim for the recovery of the whole or any part of the amount claimed as an
overpayment. (1973 Code §4.68.040)

credited on any use tax or amount of use tax due from the plaintiff under
Section
4.01.04 of this Chapter.
The balance of the judgment shall be refunded to the plaintiff. (1973 Code
§4.68.050)
      2.   In any judgment, interest shall be allowed at the rate of six
percent (6%) per year upon the amount found to have been illegally collected

by not more than thirty (30) days, the date to be determined by the Tax
Commission. (1973 Code §4.68.060)
      3.   A judgment shall not be rendered in favor of the plaintiff in any
action brought against the Tax Commission to recover any amount paid when the
action is brought by or in the name of an assignee of the person paying the
amount or by any person other than the person who paid the amount. (1973 Code

improvement, or expansion of neighborhood parks or the installation of
facilities in existing or neighborhood parks for the benefit of the
neighborhood from which it was collected. (Ord. 476, 7-1-2004, eff. 7-19-2004)

money in the form of credits against future construction tax payments which
become due for the subdivision or development.
   B.   At the option of the county, construction of facilities may be
performed by the county, the developer or independent contractors. If the
developer performs the work under contract with the county, land and
construction payments may be made in the form of credits in an amount not to

independent appraiser agreed to by the county and paid for by the subdivider or

that subdivision or development first became occupied, all money paid by the
subdivider or developer, together with the interest at the rate at which the
county has invested the money in the fund, must be refunded to the owners of
the lots in the subdivision or development at the time of the reversion on a
pro rata basis. The county manager is responsible to oversee that parks are
developed and facilities are installed in a timely manner. (Ord. 476, 7-1-2004,

5.08.02: FINDINGS; PURPOSE:
   A.   In adopting this chapter, the board recognizes and finds, based on the
experiences of other cities and counties, that the regulation of adult
characterized businesses is necessary because such establishments:
      1.   Have serious, objectionable operational characteristics,
particularly when several of the establishments are concentrated in an area.
      2.   Tend to be places where certain criminal activities, such as
solicitation of prostitution and violation of liquor laws, can more easily
occur.
      3.   Require regulation to protect the patrons and employees of the
establishments.
      4.   Are not compatible with residential and civic uses that are
frequented by juveniles.
      5.   Tend to be locations where the potential for the transmission of
sexually transmitted diseases is high.
   B.   It is the purpose of this chapter to:
      1.   Adopt specific licensing requirements for adult characterized
businesses;
      2.   Place location restrictions on these establishments;
      3.   Provide for a safe, healthy and aesthetically pleasing atmosphere
for residents and visitors to the area;
      4.   Ensure that the effects of adult characterized businesses will not
be experienced by juveniles;
      5.   Mitigate the effect of adult characterized businesses on surrounding
neighborhoods which can result in blight and reduced property values;
      6.   Prevent the clustering of adult characterized businesses in any one
area;
      7.   Limit the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and the commission
of public offenses such as prostitution, and trafficking in illegal narcotics;
      8.   Address the serious secondary effects of adult characterized
businesses such as low level maintenance of commercial businesses and parking
lots; and the interference with the enjoyment of residential lots due to noise,
vandalism, crime and litter;
      9.   Provide by regulation, sufficient alternative sites for the
establishment and operation of adult characterized businesses within the
county.
   C.   This chapter is not adopted for the purpose of regulating the content
of the material sold to or observed by the patrons of such establishments or
entertainment.
   D.   This chapter is not adopted for the purpose of regulating licensed
prostitution within Lyon County. Licensed prostitution is regulated in chapter
3 of this title. (Ord. 477, 8-19-2004, eff. 9-25-2004)

6.02.01: SHORT TITLE:
This chapter may be referenced as the LYON COUNTY HAZARDOUS WASTES ORDINANCE.
(Ord. 328, 4-6-1989)
6.02.02: FINDINGS OF FACT:
The Board of Lyon County Commissioners finds and declares:
   A.   Hazardous wastes present in the community may pose acute and chronic
health hazards to individuals who live and work in Lyon County. Many hazardous
wastes present a serious health risk over long periods of time.
   B.   Mishandling of these substances can result in widespread and serious
contamination of soil, air and surface and ground water.
   C.   Environmental cleanup of soil and water contaminated with hazardous
wastes can cost many times more than the cost of properly containing and
handling the hazardous wastes which can cause pollution. Such cleanup very
probably would exceed the County's financial capabilities, necessitating
control of hazardous waste to minimize potential financial disaster.
   D.   It is the responsibility of all businesses and persons to fully protect
their workers and the public from hazardous wastes they handle.
   E.   It is technically and economically feasible to design manufacturing and
commercial facilities in such a way that the release of hazardous wastes is
eliminated or minimized.
   F.   Many State and Federal programs have solved one type of pollution by
redirecting the contamination to another part of the environment rather than
eliminating the hazard. The County, however, has the responsibility and the
authority to plan to protect human health and the environment from all
significant adverse effects resulting from the use and handling of hazardous
wastes. (Ord. 328, 4-6-1989)
6.02.03: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to protect human health and life, the
environment and property by placing on the handlers of hazardous wastes the
obligation to prevent releases, emissions or discharges of all hazardous
wastes. (Ord. 328, 4-6-1989)
It is the intent of the Board of Lyon County Commissioners that this chapter
shall recognize the County's responsibilities and its right to act to protect
public health, life and the environment from contamination by hazardous wastes.
This chapter shall condition all handling of hazardous wastes by placing an
obligation on the handler to prevent and/or control its emissions, discharges
and releases.
Further, it is the intent of the board of Lyon County commissioners to require
that hazardous wastes handlers monitor emissions into the environment and keep
records on the effectiveness of hazardous wastes management practices as a
means of enforcing their obligation. (Ord. 328, 4-6-1989)
6.02.04: INTERPRETATION AND SCOPE:
   A.   Conflicts With Other Laws: Whenever any provision of this chapter
conflicts with the county building code, fire code, this code or any other law,
statute, rule or regulation, the stricter shall prevail. (Ord. 328, 4-6-1989;
amd. Ord. 486, 5-5-2005)
   B.   Existing Operations: A hazardous waste handler already operating a
facility on the effective date hereof shall be required to comply with the
terms of this chapter within sixty (60) days. (Ord. 328, 4-6-1989)

state or federal law or regulation is not a "handler" for the purposes of this
chapter.

Waste";

      2.   Harms or poses a significant risk of harm to the public health or
adverse impact to the environment.
   B.   Specific Obligations: Any person handling or intending to handle a
hazardous waste shall obtain and keep current a hazardous waste permit. A
separate permit is required for each place or location where hazardous wastes
will be handled. Ordinarily, such permit will be issued pursuant to this Code
controlling planning and zoning 1 . In the event that the handler does not have
a fixed place or location where hazardous wastes will be handled, he is
required to obtain a permit for nonspecific location prior to handling any
hazardous waste pursuant to the County's health and safety police powers rather
than land use control authority. The permit for nonspecific location will be
applied for, issued and controlled the same as a permit for a specific site.
(Ord. 328, 4-6-89)

by an applicant or permit holder, the County may, in its discretion, at such
applicant's or permit holder's sole cost or expense, retain a suitably
qualified independent engineer, chemist, toxicologist or industrial hygienist,
or other appropriate consultant, acceptable to the County, for the purpose of
evaluating and rendering a professional opinion regarding the adequacy of such
submittal to achieve the purposes of this Chapter.
   B.   Prior to the County retaining any said independent expert, the County
shall consult with the applicant/permit holder regarding the expert to be
retained by County, the scope of the work to be done by said expert and a
reasonable estimate of the cost to be borne by the applicant/permittee. In the
event that a disagreement exists between the County staff and the applicant/
permittee regarding the expert to be utilized, the scope of the work to be done
by said expert or the cost to be assessed against applicant/permittee, the
issue shall be heard and decided by the County Commissioners. The County and
the applicant/permittee shall use their best efforts to cooperate and act
reasonably. The County shall be entitled to rely on such evaluation and/or
opinion of such consultant in making the relevant determinations provided for
in this Chapter.
   C.   When County, in its discretion, reasonably determines that a
professional consultant shall be retained, an applicant or permit holder shall
forthwith deposit with the County such sum as may be necessary to pay for the
services of the expert. No new application shall be processed further until
such deposit is made. In the event that a consultant's services are required to
evaluate an existing hazardous waste permit, such permit shall be suspended ten
(10) days after request for deposit, unless and until the necessary deposit is
made. (Ord. 328, 4-6-89)
6.02.08: HAZARDOUS WASTE PERMIT:
   A.   Permit Required: As of the effective date hereof, a permit is required
for all new facilities where hazardous wastes will be handled prior to the
construction of the facility.
   B.   Application for Permit; Procedures for Approval and Revocation:
      1.   An applicant for a hazardous waste permit shall first pay to the
County a filing fee set by resolution of the Board of Lyon County Commissioners
and in a sum sufficient to reimburse the County for all expenses which the
County shall incur in processing the application.
      2.   The application shall:
         a.   Be in a form prepared by the Lyon County Zoning Administrator and
the Lyon County Emergency Management Director and approved by the Board of Lyon
County Commissioners.
         b.   Not be accepted for filing until it is complete, and all
investigations which may be required are complete.
      3.   After the application is accepted for filing by the Lyon County
Planning Department, the County shall proceed as follows:
         a.   If the hazardous waste permit is to be considered in conjunction
with an application for a special use permit or variance of land use or a
zoning change, the hazardous waste permit process must be completed before the
special use permit/variance/ zoning change application is accepted for filing;
provided, however, if the applicant wishes to proceed simultaneously with the
hazardous waste permit application and the land use application, the County
will accept both applications for filing if the applicant formally waives, in
writing, the provisions of NRS 278.315(2) or any other applicable statute, rule
or regulation limiting the period of time within which the County may consider
and process the land use application.
         b.   The application shall be placed on the agenda of the next
available meeting of the Lyon County Planning Commission for consideration and
adoption of a recommendation to the Board of Lyon County Commissioners.
If, in the discretion of the Planning Commission or at the request of the Board
of Lyon County Commissioners, it shall appear that the Lyon County Planning
Commission should hold a hearing in the area of the County which would be most
affected by the hazardous waste permit, the Planning Commission is authorized
hereby to hold such a hearing.
         c.   The application, together with the recommendation of the Lyon
County Planning Commission, shall be forwarded to the Board of Lyon County
Commissioners for public hearing and decision.
         d.   The Board of Lyon County Commissioners may approve the hazardous
waste permit application as requested, with modifications or conditions, or may
deny the application. Since it is the intention of Lyon County that hazardous
wastes be regulated as a "pervasively regulated industry", denial of a permit
application may be based upon any reasonable finding of the County that
issuance of the permit would not be in the best interests of the County or any
of the residents thereof for reasons of health, safety, general welfare or any
other similar good and sufficient reason.
         e.   Any hazardous waste permit issued pursuant to this Chapter shall
be subject to continuing review and may be terminated at any time if the permit
holder fails to comply with the terms of this Chapter and/or any special
conditions or modifications. In addition to continuing review, every hazardous
waste permit shall be subject to automatic annual review to determine if the
permit should be continued, modified or revoked. No person or entity issued a
permit hereunder shall acquire any property right or other right to renewal or
continuation of the permit. Nonuse of a permit for six (6) months shall result
in automatic revocation.
If, in the opinion of the Lyon County Zoning Administrator, the office of the
District Attorney, the Board of Lyon County Commissioners or the Lyon County
Emergency Management Director, any hazardous waste permit should be revoked
pursuant to this Chapter, Lyon County shall so notify the permit holder by
legal notice setting forth the basis for the requested revocation together with
notification of the date for a revocation hearing before the Board of Lyon
County Commissioners.
At the conclusion of the public hearing on revocation, the Board of County
Commissioners may revoke the hazardous waste permit, reinstate the hazardous
waste permit, with additional conditions or modifications, or reinstate the
permit without additional conditions or modifications.
   C.   Investigation Costs: All applicants for hazardous wastes permits shall
deposit, in advance, in addition to the application fee, all estimated costs of
processing the application including any travel costs or other expenses
necessary in the County's sole discretion to reasonably investigate the
applicant or the proposed operation.
   D.   Nontransferability of Permit; Expiration: If a handler changes its
operations and begins the use of a new hazardous waste or if a new handler of
hazardous wastes occupies a facility where another handler formerly operated,
then that handler is required to apply for a permit.
Every permit granted hereunder expires automatically with any majority change
of ownership or significant change in management of the hazardous wastes
handler entity. (Ord. 328, 4-6-89)
6.02.09: INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   General Requirements: All applicants/permittees for hazardous wastes
permits issued or renewed after the effective date hereof shall be required to
provide liability insurance adequate to insure the public against the risks
reasonably to be anticipated as a result of the handling of hazardous wastes.
Lyon County shall be named expressly as an additional insured on all such
policies. The amount and type of insurance to be required shall be determined
by the County after evaluation of the risks to be insured against.
All liability policies shall be for a minimum of one year "tail" to cover later
claims. The one-year policy and the "tail" shall be renewed annually.
   B.   Costs for Analysts or Consultants: In the event that the County finds
it necessary to retain an independent analyst to assist the County to determine
the level of insurance to be required, the applicant shall deposit, in advance,
the estimated cost of obtaining such analyst or consultant.
   C.   Qualifications of Insurance Companies: All insurance shall be written
by companies authorized by the Nevada Insurance Commissioner to write policies
of that type in the State of Nevada.
   D.   Types of Insurance Required: The insurance to be required may include,
but is not limited to:
      1.   General liability.
      2.   Sudden and accidental.
      3.   Nonsudden and accidental.
      4.   Environmental pollution.
      5.   Off-premises damages.
      6.   SIIS.
      7.   Additional industrial health insurance.
      8.   Closure expense insurance.
   E.   Termination or Cancellation of Insurance: Any hazardous wastes permit
issued or renewed pursuant to this Chapter shall become void upon the lapse,
termination or cancellation of the insurance required hereunder.
   F.   Other Assurance Methods: With approval of the County Commissioners, the
applicant/permittee may provide the coverage required through comparable means
of financial assurance such as bonds or letters of credit, etc. (Ord. 328, 4-6-
89)
6.02.10: HAZARDOUS WASTES MANAGEMENT PLAN:
Each applicant for a permit pursuant to this Chapter shall file a hazardous
wastes management plan (HWMP) which shall set forth the applicant's methods for
safe handling and control of hazardous wastes. Said plan must be filed at the
time of application for permit. The HWMP may be amended at any time with the
consent of the Board of Lyon County Commissioners. Those hazardous wastes
handlers that frequently initiate significant changes in handling of hazardous
wastes should indicate that information in the plan or file an amended plan.
The HWMP shall be a public record, and shall consist of:
   A.   The Environmental Audit: Hazardous wastes handlers shall provide the
County with an environmental audit of each hazardous waste they handle.
Included in an environmental audit are:
      1.   A list of all hazardous wastes that will be handled at the facility.
The list shall include applicable reportable quantities;
      2.   General descriptions of all processes that produce wastewaters, air
emissions or other hazardous wastes;
      3.   Diagrams showing the flow of all hazardous wastes through each step
of this process;
      4.   General descriptions of all treatment processes for hazardous
wastes, including information on their efficiency in removing or destroying
hazardous contaminants, unless Federal law prohibits such disclosure; and
      5.   Estimates of the type and volume of hazardous wastes that will be
incorporated into final products, discharged into the sewer, released into the
air and/or transformed into hazardous wastes.
   B.   Control of Emissions, Discharges and Releases: The HWMP shall indicate
the measures employed to control emissions, discharges and releases of each
hazardous waste by:
      1.   Showing that the handler has, or within reasonable time will obtain
an applicable State/Federal permit or license (so long as that permit or
license specifically covers each hazardous waste and its harm or potential for
harm).
      2.   Explaining how the handler complies with existing laws, statutes,
standards or regulations that do not require a permit or license but do
specifically cover the handling of each hazardous waste and specifically
require its control.
      3.   Documenting measures that will be employed to control the hazardous
waste in such a manner as to present the least acute or chronic hazard or risk
to public health and/or least damage to the environment including, but not
limited to:
         a.   The best available control technologies (BACT), or
         b.   Changes in process and manufacturing strategies to reduce
handling of the hazardous waste if there are no laws, statutes, standards and
regulations relating to its handling and control.
      4.   Demonstrating the adequacy of:
         a.   Contingency plans for spills and unauthorized emissions,
discharges and releases of the hazardous waste.
         b.   Employee training and equipment for proper handling of hazardous
materials and in response to all emergencies involving the hazardous waste.
         c.   Adequate standards for construction of storage areas for the
hazardous wastes.
      5.   If applicable, demonstrating that the environmental fate of the
hazardous waste is such that it presents no harm or potential of harm to human
health or to the environment.
No effort outlined above shall be approved by the County if it results in
increased risk or hazard of harm to the health or safety of persons involved in
handling the hazardous waste or otherwise employed at the facility or the
public or the environment.
   C.   Monitoring Plan: For each hazardous waste used, the handler shall
document the efforts used to verify that the hazardous wastes are controlled in
accord with all other elements of the HWMP:
      1.   These efforts shall include, but are not limited to:
         a.   Sampling of emissions discharges and releases.
         b.   Self-inspections of storage, manufacturing and transportation
operations.
         c.   Testing of emergency procedures.
      2.   These efforts shall take place in such manner as to:
         a.   Include sampling, self-inspections and monitoring at those times
during the production process when the highest volume discharges and the
highest probable concentrations of contamination are likely to occur.
         b.   Monitor, inspect or sample for all hazardous wastes used in the
manufacturing process which have any potential for appearing in wastewater
discharge.
         c.   Include periodic random sampling, monitoring or inspection. (Ord.
328, 4-6-89)
6.02.11: RESPONSIBILITIES OF PERMITTEE:
   A.   Compliance with HWMP: All permit holders shall handle and control
hazardous wastes in accordance with the provisions of the hazardous wastes
management plan (HWMP) approved by the County.
   B.   Records Kept: Records of monitoring, inspections and sampling results
produced pursuant to a monitoring plan that is a part of an HWMP approved by
the County shall be kept and made available for inspection at all times.
   C.   Unauthorized Release of Hazardous Wastes:
      1.   As soon as any hazardous waste handler has knowledge of any
unauthorized release, that handler shall report the incident to the County
immediately and, in all cases, within one hour after the release is discovered.
Any emergency variation from the HWMP on file shall be immediately reported to
the County. The notification, as required hereunder, shall be reported to the
Lyon County Sheriff's office which will notify the appropriate County
personnel.
      2.   In the event of an unauthorized release, the County may require:
         a.   That the hazardous wastes handler conduct monitoring to establish
whether there is environmental contamination as a result of the release;
         b.   Removal of the hazardous wastes and contaminated media; and/or
         c.   That the hazardous waste handler pay the costs of a consultant of
the County's choosing to evaluate testing and removal activities.
   D.   Closure Plan: As part of the application for a hazardous waste permit,
the applicant shall file a plan satisfactory to the County for ultimate closure
of the facility. The closure plan shall include:
      1.   A detailed plan for decontamination and restoration of the facility
site, including description of methods to be used, estimates of costs, verified
by independent consultants, and any other data which would assist the County in
determining the efficacy of the closure plan; and
      2.   An irrevocable letter of credit, irrevocable bond or other
irrevocable surety acceptable to County in a sum sufficient to effect the
decontamination and restoration proposed in the detailed plan.
The permittee shall implement its closure plan when it permanently ceases
operations under the hazardous waste permit or when operations have ceased for
a period of six (6) months, which time shall be deemed to be a permanent
cessation of operations unless it be shown to the satisfaction of the County
that the cessation is temporary and that the operations will resume at some
reasonable time satisfactory to the County.
A permittee may not escape responsibility for implementing the closure plan by
sale or other disposition of the facility. Any subsequent permittee holding a
hazardous waste permit for the same site also is responsible for implementing
the closure plan at the time of ultimate closure. (Ord. 355, 5-2-91)
6.02.12: HAZARDOUS WASTE SITING:
   A.   Stationary Facilities: A stationary facility for the handling of
hazardous waste, other than in tanks or portable containers, shall not be
constructed within the areas designated by Nevada Administrative Code 444.3456
in effect on July 22, 1987.
A stationary facility for the handling of hazardous waste in tanks or portable
containers is exempt from the specific siting requirements of this subsection
A. Said permit application will be reviewed applying the general requirements
and standards set forth in NRS 278.020.
   B.   Portable Facilities: A portable facility for the handling of hazardous
wastes will be reviewed applying the general requirements and standards set
forth in NRS 278.020. (Ord. 328, 4-6-89)
6.02.13: INSPECTIONS:
   A.   Authority: The County may conduct inspections at its discretion to
ascertain compliance with this Chapter and may cause to be corrected any
conditions which constitute any violations of this Chapter or of any other
statute, code, rule or regulation affecting the use and handling of hazardous
waste.
   B.   Entry Powers: For the purpose of investigating or enforcing the
provisions of this Chapter, the County may enter the facilities or premises of
a hazardous waste handler at all reasonable times to inspect the same;
provided, that if the facilities or premises are occupied, the County's
representative(s) shall first present proper credentials and request entry, and
further provided, that if such facility or premises is unoccupied, the County
shall first make a reasonable effort to contact the user and request entry,
except in emergency circumstances. If such entry is refused, the County shall
have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry.
   C.   Inspections Are Discretionary; Nonliability for Damage: All inspections
specified herein to be performed by the County are discretionary with the
County, and nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as requiring the County
to conduct any such inspection nor shall any actual inspection made imply a
duty to conduct any other inspection. Furthermore, nothing in this Chapter
shall be construed to hold the County or any officer, employee or
representative of the County responsible for any damage to persons or property
by reason of any failure to make an inspection or reinspection.
   D.   Special Inspections:
      1.   In addition to the inspections specified above, the County may
require the employment by the handler of special inspectors or consultants to
conduct an environmental audit monitoring or to otherwise determine compliance
with the provisions of this Chapter.
      2.   The special inspector or consultant shall be a qualified person who
shall demonstrate expertise and independence to the satisfaction of the County.
      3.   The report of the special inspection shall include an evaluation of
the facility and recommendations consistent with the provisions of this
Chapter, if appropriate. A copy of the report shall be filed with the County at
the same time that it is submitted to the permit holder.
      4.   The permit holder shall, within thirty (30) days of the report, file
with the County a plan to implement all recommendations, or demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the County why such recommendations shall not be implemented.
   E.   Substituted Inspections: An inspection by an employee of any other
public agency may be deemed by the County as an acceptable substitute for any
inspection required by this Chapter. (Ord. 328, 4-6-89)
6.02.14: RECORDS KEPT:
All records required by this Chapter shall be maintained by the permit holder
for a period of not less than five (5) years. These records shall be made
available to the County during normal working hours and upon reasonable notice.
Nothing in this Section alters or lessens responsibility to maintain records
required under other laws. (Ord. 328, 4-6-89)
6.02.15: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this Chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes. The standards set forth herein are minimum standards, and
this Chapter does not imply that compliance will ensure that there will be no
unauthorized discharge of a hazardous waste. This Chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the County or any officer or employee thereof for any
damages that result from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made hereunder. All hazardous wastes handlers are advised to
determine to their own satisfaction the level of protection in addition to that
required by this Chapter necessary or desirable to ensure that there is no risk
or damage to public health or the environment. Mere compliance with this
Chapter does not release the handler from civil liability to others for damages
resulting from his use of hazardous waste. (Ord. 328, 4-6-89)
6.02.16: ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES:
   A.   Any hazardous waste handler who intentionally or negligently violates

      1.   Be denied a hazardous waste permit by the County; or
      2.   Have a hazardous waste permit revoked.
      3.   Have the hazardous waste permit suspended pending a formal hearing
before the Board of County Commissioners or a designated hearing officer. The
suspension may be ordered by an enforcement officer if the alleged violation
threatens the health or safety of any person.
      4.   Be subject to the following penalties:
         a.   Administrative Penalties: Upon a finding by the County
Commissioners that a hazardous waste handler has violated any provision of this
Chapter, the County Commissioners may levy an administrative fine of up to five
hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for each violation.
         b.   Civil Penalties: Any hazardous waste handler who intentionally or
negligently violates any provision of this Chapter or fails to comply with any
order issued hereunder shall be liable for a civil penalty up to five hundred
dollars ($500.00) per day for each violation which shall be assessed and
recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the County by the District
Attorney. In any civil action brought pursuant hereto, in which the County
prevails, the court shall determine and impose reasonable costs, including all
attorney fees permissible under Nevada law, incurred by the County in the
investigation and prosecution of the action.
         c.   Criminal Penalties: Any person or business which intentionally
violates any provision of the Chapter shall be subject to the criminal
penalties prescribed by Nevada statute for misdemeanor offenses.
   B.   Remedies under this Chapter are in addition to and do not supersede or
limit any and all other remedies, civil or criminal.

This Chapter may be referenced as the LYON COUNTY INFECTIOUS WASTES ORDINANCE.
(Ord. 329, 4-6-89)
6.03.02: FINDINGS OF FACT:
The Board of Lyon County Commissioners finds and declares:
   A.   Infectious wastes present in the community pose acute and chronic
health hazards to individuals who live and work in Lyon County.
   B.   Mishandling of these substances can result in widespread and serious
contamination of soil, air and surface and ground water.
   C.   Environmental cleanup of soil and water contaminated with infectious
wastes can cost many times more than the cost of properly containing and
handling the infectious wastes which can cause pollution. Such cleanup very
probably would exceed the County's financial capabilities, necessitating
control of infectious waste to minimize potential financial disaster.
   D.   It is the responsibility of all businesses and persons to fully protect
their workers and the public from infectious wastes they handle.
   E.   The County has the responsibility and the authority to plan to protect
human health and the environment from all significant adverse effects resulting
from the use and handling of infectious wastes. (Ord. 329, 4-6-1989)
6.03.03: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to protect human health and life, the
environment and property by placing on the handlers of infectious wastes the
obligation to prevent releases, emissions or discharges of all infectious
wastes.
It is the intent of the Board of Lyon County Commissioners that this chapter
shall recognize the County's responsibilities and its right to act to protect
public health, life and the environment from contamination by infectious
wastes. This chapter shall condition all handling of infectious wastes by
placing an obligation on the handler to prevent and/or control its emissions,
discharges and releases.
Further, it is the intent of the Board of Lyon County Commissioners to require
that infectious wastes handlers monitor emissions into the environment and keep
records on the effectiveness of infectious wastes management practices as a
means of enforcing their obligation. (Ord. 329, 4-6-1989)
6.03.04: INTERPRETATION AND SCOPE:
   A.   Conflicts With Other Laws: Whenever any provision of this chapter
conflicts with title 15, chapter 239 of this Code, or any other law, statute,
rule or regulation, the stricter shall prevail. (Ord. 329, 4-6-1989; amd. 1991
Code)
   B.   Existing Operations:
      1.   An infectious waste handler already operating a facility on the
effective date hereof shall be required to file an infectious waste management
plan within thirty (30) days.
      2.   All existing infectious wastes handlers shall be required to comply
with the terms of this chapter whenever any existing special use permit,
variance or other similar permit is renewed.
      3.   Existing infectious wastes handlers who presently are not required
to hold a special use permit or other such permit shall be required to comply
with the terms of this chapter within eight (8) years after its effective date.

adverse impact to the environment.
   B.   Specific Obligations: Any person handling or intending to handle an
infectious waste shall obtain and keep current an infectious waste use permit.
A separate permit is required for each place or location where infectious
wastes will be handled. Ordinarily, such use permit will be issued pursuant to
this Code controlling planning and zoning 1 . In the event that the handler
does not have a fixed place or location where infectious wastes will be
handled, he is required to obtain a use permit for nonspecific location prior
to handling any waste pursuant to the County's health and safety police powers
rather than land use control authority. The use permit for nonspecific location
will be applied for, issued and controlled the same as a use permit for a
specific site. (Ord. 329, 4-6-1989)

6.03.07: PROFESSIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR COUNTY DETERMINATIONS:
   A.   Whenever the approval or satisfaction of the County may be required by
this chapter for the design, monitoring, testing or other technical submittal
by an applicant or permit holder, the County may, in its discretion, at such
applicant's or permit holder's sole cost or expense, retain a suitably
qualified independent engineer, chemist, toxicologist or industrial hygienist
or other appropriate consultant, acceptable to the County, for the purpose of
evaluating and rendering a professional opinion regarding the adequacy of such
submittal to achieve the purposes of this chapter.
   B.   Prior to the County retaining any said independent expert, the County
shall consult with the applicant/permit holder regarding the expert to be
retained by County, the scope of the work to be done by said expert and a
reasonable estimate of the cost to be borne by the applicant/permittee. In the
event that a disagreement exists between the County staff and the applicant/
permittee regarding the expert to be utilized, the scope of the work to be done
by said expert or the cost to be assessed against applicant/permittee, the
issue shall be heard and decided by the County Commissioners. The County and
the applicant/permittee shall use their best efforts to cooperate and act
reasonably. The County shall be entitled to rely on such evaluation and/or
opinion of such consultant in making the relevant determinations provided for
in this chapter.
   C.   When County, in its discretion, reasonably determines that a
professional consultant shall be retained, an applicant or permit holder shall
forthwith deposit with the County such sum as may be necessary to pay for the
services of the expert. No new application shall be processed further until
such deposit is made. In the event that a consultant's services are required to
evaluate renewal of an existing infectious waste use permit, such permit shall
be suspended until the necessary deposit is made. (Ord. 329, 4-6-1989)
6.03.08: INFECTIOUS WASTE PERMIT:
   A.   Permit Required: As of the effective date hereof, a permit is required
for all new facilities where infectious wastes will be handled prior to the
construction of the facility.
   B.   Application for Permit; Procedures for Approval and Revocation:
      1.   An applicant for an infectious waste permit shall first pay to the
County a filing fee set by resolution of the Board of Lyon County
Commissioners. The filing fee shall be in a sum sufficient to reimburse the
County for all expenses which the County shall incur in processing the
application.
      2.   The application shall:
         a.   Be in a form prepared by the Lyon County Zoning Administrator and
the Lyon County Emergency Management Director and approved by the Board of Lyon
County Commissioners.
         b.   Not be accepted for filing until it is complete and all
investigations which may be required are complete.
      3.   After the application is accepted for filing by the Lyon County
Planning Department, County shall proceed as follows:
         a.   If the infectious waste permit is to be considered in conjunction
with an application for a special use permit or variance of land use or a
zoning change, the infectious waste permit pro- cess must be completed before
the special use permit/variance/ zoning change application is accepted for
filing; provided, however, if the applicant wishes to proceed simultaneously
with the infectious waste permit application and the land use application, the
County will accept both applications for filing if the applicant formally
waives, in writing, the provisions of NRS 278.315(2) or any other applicable
statute, rule or regulation limiting the period of time within which the County
may consider and process the land use application.
         b.   The application shall be placed on the agenda of the next
available meeting of the Lyon County Planning Commission for consideration and
adoption of a recommendation to the Board of Lyon County Commissioners.
If, in the discretion of the Planning Commission or at the request of the Board
of Lyon County Commissioners, it shall appear that the Lyon County Planning
Commission should hold a hearing in the area of the County which would be most
affected by the infectious waste permit, the Planning Commission is authorized
hereby to hold such a hearing.
         c.   The application, together with the recommendation of the Lyon
County Planning Commission, shall be forwarded to the Board of Lyon County
Commissioners for public hearing and decision.
         d.   The Board of Lyon County Commissioners may approve the infectious
waste permit application as requested, with modifications or conditions, or may
deny the application. Since it is the intention of Lyon County that infectious
wastes be regulated as "a pervasively regulated industry", denial of a permit
application may be based upon any reasonable finding of the County that
issuance of the permit would not be in the best interests of the County or any
of the residents thereof for reasons of health, safety, general welfare or any
other similar good and sufficient reason.
         e.   Any infectious waste permit issued pursuant to this Chapter shall
be subject to continuing review and may be terminated at any time if the permit
holder fails to comply with the terms of this Chapter and/or any special
conditions or modifications. In addition to continuing review, every infectious
waste permit shall be subject to automatic annual review to determine if the
permit should be continued, modified or revoked. No person or entity issued a
permit hereunder shall acquire any property right or other right to renewal or
continuation of the permit. Nonuse of a permit for six (6) months shall result
in automatic revocation.
If, in the opinion of the Lyon County Zoning Administrator, the office of the
District Attorney, the Board of Lyon County Commissioners or the Lyon County
Emergency Management Director, any infectious waste permit should be revoked,
those officers shall so notify the permit holder by legal notice, together with
notification of the date for a revocation hearing before the Board of Lyon
County Commissioners. The infectious waste permit shall be in a state of
suspension from the date of notification to the date of the revocation hearing,
and the permit holder shall not conduct any infectious waste operations during
such suspension. The revocation hearing shall be set for the first available
time and date and shall take precedence over other Board of Lyon County
Commissioners' agenda times, except for other public hearing previously
noticed.
At the conclusion of the public hearing on revocation, the Board of County
Commissioners may revoke the infectious waste permit, reinstate the infectious
waste permit with additional conditions or modifications or reinstate the
permit without additional conditions or modifications.
   C.   Investigative Costs: All applicants for infectious waste use permits
shall deposit, in advance, all costs of processing the application including
any travel costs or other expenses necessary in the County's sole discretion to
reasonably investigate the applicant or the proposed operation.
   D.   Nontransferability of Permit; Expiration: If a handler changes its
operations and begins handling a new infectious waste or if a new handler of
infectious wastes occupies a facility where another handler formerly operated,
then that handler is required to apply for a permit.
Every permit granted hereunder expires automatically with any significant
majority change of ownership or significant change in management of the
hazardous wastes handler entity. (Ord. 329, 4-6-89)
6.03.09: INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   General Requirements: All applicants for infectious waste use permits
issued or renewed after the effective date hereof shall be required to provide
liability insurance or other financial surety adequate to insure the public
against the risks reasonably to be anticipated as a result of the handling of
infectious wastes. Lyon County shall be named expressly as an additional
insured on all such policies.
The amount and type of insurance to be required shall be determined by the
County after evaluation of the risks to be insured against. All liability
policies shall be for a minimum of one year with a one year "tail" to cover
later claim. The one-year policy and the "tail" shall be renewed annually.
   B.   Costs for Analysts or Consultants: In the event that the County finds
it necessary to retain an independent analyst to assist the County to determine
the level of insurance to be required, the applicant shall deposit, in advance,
the estimated cost of obtaining such analyst or consultant.
   C.   Qualifications of Insurance Companies: All insurance shall be written
by companies authorized by the Nevada Insurance Commissioner to write policies
of that type in the State of Nevada.
   D.   Types of Insurance Required: The insurance to be required may include,
but is not limited to:
      1.   General liability.
      2.   Sudden and accidental.
      3.   Nonsudden and accidental.
      4.   Environmental pollution.
      5.   Off-premises damages.
      6.   SIIS.
      7.   Additional industrial health insurance.
      8.   Closure expense insurance.
   E.   Termination or Cancellation of Insurance: Any infectious wastes use
permit issued or renewed pursuant to this Chapter shall become void upon the
lapse, termination or cancellation of any insurance policy required hereunder.
(Ord. 329, 4-6-89)
6.03.10: INFECTIOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN:
   A.   General Requirements: Lyon County requires that each handler establish
an infectious waste management plan (IWMP), which plan must be filed at the
time of application for permit. A responsible person at the facility shall
prepare a comprehensive document that outlines policies and procedures for the
management of infectious waste (including infectious wastes with multiple
hazards). This requirement shall be consistent with the standard of the Joint
Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (JCAH) which specifies a system "to
safely manage hazardous materials and wastes". This plan shall include the
following elements:
      1.   Waste management options.
      2.   Designation.
      3.   Segregation.
      4.   Packaging.
      5.   Storage.
      6.   Handling and transport.
      7.   Treatment.
      8.   Disposal.
      9.   Staff training.
      10.   Contingency planning.
Various options are available for the development of an infectious waste
management system. Management options for an individual facility shall be
selected on the basis of what is most appropriate for that particular facility.
Factors such as location, size and budget shall be taken into consideration.
The selected options shall be incorporated into a documented infectious waste
management plan. Therefore, a specific person at the generating facility shall
be responsible for implementation of the plan. This person shall have the
responsibility as well as the authority to make sure that the provisions of the
management plan are being followed.
In addition to the overall infectious waste management plan, handlers shall
specify detailed instructions for research and clinical laboratories within the
facility where infectious waste is generated.
   B.   Selection of Waste Management Options:
      1.   In an infectious waste management system, there are a number of
areas in which alternative options are available (e.g., treatment techniques
for the various types of infectious waste, types of treatment equipment,
treatment sites, various waste handling practices, etc.). Selection of
available options at a facility shall be determined by factors such as the
nature of the infectious waste, the quantity of infectious waste generated, the
availability of equipment for treatment on-site and off-site, regulatory
constraints and cost considerations.
Since treatment methods vary with waste type, the waste shall be evaluated and
categorized with regard to its potential to cause disease. Such characteristics
as chemical content, density, water content, bulk, etc., influence waste
treatment decisions. Facilities may use a combination of treatment techniques
for the different components of the infectious waste stream, e.g., steam
sterilization for laboratory cultures and incineration for pathological waste.
      2.   The quantity of each category of infectious waste handled at the
facility may also influence the method of treatment. If a selected option is
not suitable for treatment of all wastes, then other options shall be included
in the infectious waste management plan.
      3.   Handlers shall comply with all Federal, State and local regulations
pertaining to the transport of infectious waste and ensure that the waste is
being handled and treated properly at any off-site treatment facility.
   C.   Designation of Infectious Waste: The first element of an infectious
waste management plan is to specify which wastes are to be managed as
infectious waste. Lyon County has designated seven (7) categories of wastes as
infectious; however, other potentially contaminated wastes shall be evaluated
on an individual basis by an authorized responsible person or committee. The
following categories of waste are designated as infectious waste:
Waste Category Examples*

Pathological waste                body fluids removed during surgery,
                                  autopsy and biopsy
                                  Contaminated hypodermic needles,
Contaminated sharps               syringes, scalpel blades, Pasteur

                                  intentionally exposed to pathogens
 
* These materials are examples of wastes covered by each category. The
categories are not limited to these materials. An additional infectious waste
category consists of miscellaneous contaminated wastes. Wastes from patients
known to be infected with blood-borne diseases should be managed as infectious
waste (for example, dialysis waste from known hepatitis B patients).
 
Miscellaneous                       
Contaminated Wastes                Examples
                                   Soiled dressings, sponges, drapes, lavage
Wastes from surgery and autopsy    tubes, drainage sets, underpads and surgical
                                   gloves
Miscellaneous laboratory wastes    Specimen containers, slides and cover slips;
                                   disposable gloves, lab coats and aprons
Dialysis unit wastes and lab coats Tubing, filters, disposable sheets, towels,
                                   gloves, aprons
                                   Equipment used in patient care, medical
Contaminated equipment             laboratories, research and in the production
                                   and testing of certain pharmaceuticals
 
   D.   Infectious Waste Segregation: Infectious waste shall be separated from
the general waste stream to assure that these wastes receive appropriate
handling and treatment. Infectious waste shall be segregated from the general
waste stream at the point of generation (i.e., the point at which the material
becomes a waste).
Provision shall be made for infectious waste with multiple hazards. These
wastes shall be segregated from the general infectious waste stream when
additional or alternative treatment is required, or in cases where the wastes
are regulated under Federal or State rules.
Infectious waste shall be discarded directly into containers or plastic bags
which are clearly identifiable and distinguishable from the general waste
stream. Containers shall be marked with the universal biological hazard symbol.
Red or orange plastic bags shall be used to identify infectious waste.

The symbol is fluorescent orange or orange-red. The background may be any color
that provides sufficient contrast for the symbol to be clearly defined.
   E.   Packaging:
      1.   Lyon County requires:
         a.   Selection of packaging materials that are appropriate for the
type of waste:
            (1)   Plastic bags for many types of solid or semi-solid infectious
waste.
            (2)   Puncture-resistant containers for sharps.
            (3)   Bottles, flasks or tanks for liquids.
         b.   Use of packaging that maintains its integrity during storage and
transport.
         c.   Use of plastic bags that are impervious, tear resistant and
distinctive in color or markings.
         d.   Closing the top of each bag by folding or tying as appropriate
for the treatment or transport.
         e.   Placement of liquid wastes in capped or tightly stoppered bottles
or flasks.
         f.   No compaction of infectious waste or packaged infectious waste
before treatment.
      2.   Infectious waste shall be packaged in order to protect waste
handlers and the public from possible injury and disease that may result from
exposure to the waste. Infectious waste shall be contained from the point of
origin up to the point at which it is no longer infectious. Therefore, the
integrity of the packaging shall be preserved through handling, storage,
transportation and treatment.
      3.   The following factors shall be considered in selecting appropriate
packaging:
         a.   Waste type.
         b.   Handling and transport of the packaged waste (before treatment).
         c.   Treatment technique.
         d.   Special considerations for plastic bags.
         e.   Package identification.
   To provide adequate waste containment, packaging shall be appropriate for
the type of waste. For example, liquid infectious waste shall be placed in
capped or tightly stoppered bottles or flasks. Containment tanks shall be used
for large quantities of liquid waste. Solid or semi-solid wastes such as
pathological wastes, animal carcasses and laboratory wastes may be placed in
plastic bags.
      4.   Sharps shall be placed directly into impervious, rigid and puncture-
resistant containers to eliminate the hazard of physical injury. Clipping of
needles is not approved, unless the clipping device effectively contains needle
parts which might otherwise become airborne and pose a hazard.
      Authorized containers for sharps are glass, metal, rigid plastic, wood
and heavy cardboard; containers shall be compatible with selected treatment
processes. Sharps containers shall be marked with the universal biohazard
symbol and sealed before handling.
   F.   Storage:
      1.   Lyon County requires:
         a.   Minimizing storage time.
         b.   Proper packaging that ensure containment of infectious waste and
the exclusion of rodents and vermin.
         c.   Limited access to storage area.
         d.   Posting of universal biological hazard symbol on storage area
door, waste containers, freezers or refrigerators.
      2.   Infectious waste shall be treated as soon as possible after
generation. If treatment is not available because of insufficient capacity,
malfunction or unavailability of personnel, waste may be stored under
refrigeration for not more than three (3) days.
      3.   The packaging shall provide containment of the waste throughout the
waste management process. In addition, the packaging shall deter rodents and
vermin and other such vectors in disease transmission.
      4.   Storage temperature and duration must be controlled to prevent
microbial growth and odors typically associated with wastes containing decaying
organic matter.
      5.   The storage area shall be a specially designated area located at or
near the treatment site. The storage area shall have limited access that
restricts the entry of unauthorized personnel. It shall be kept free of rodents
and vermin. In addition,the universal biohazard lablel shall be posted where
appropriate (e.g., doors, waste containers, refrigerators and freezers).
   G.   Handling and Transport:
      1.   General Requirements:
         a.   Lyon County requires:
            (1) Avoidance of mechanical loading devices which may rupture
packaged wastes.
            (2) Frequent disinfection of carts used to transfer wastes within
the facility.
            (3) Placement of all infectious waste into rigid or semi-rigid
containers before transport off-site.
            (4) Transport of infectious waste in closed, leakproof trucks or
dumpsters.
         b.   If the waste is to be moved within the facility for treatment or
storage, packaging shall effectively contain the waste. If necessary, multiple
packaging shall be used to preserve the integrity of the bags and to ensure
containment of the waste. Placing single-bagged waste within a rigid or semi-
rigid container such as a bucket, box or carton is authorized. Plastic bags may
be used as liners for such containers. Another authorized practice is double-
bagging, that is, placing the sealed plastic bag within another bag which is
subsequently sealed. Containers of sharps and liquids may be placed within
other containers (e.g., boxes) for ease of handling. The containers shall be
covered with secure lids during transport and storage. Lids may be opened
during the treatment process.
      2.   Plastic Bags:
         a.   Whenever plastic bags of infectious waste are handled and
especially when they are transferred, care shall be exercised to prevent
tearing of the bags. Plastic bags containing infectious waste shall not be
transported through a chute or dumbwaiter. Mechanical devices shall not be used
for transport or loading of plastic bags containing these wastes. Authorized
practices for handling plastic bags include loading by hand, transporting the
loaded dumpster to minimize handling and placing the plastic bags within rigid
or semi-rigid containers before handling and transport.
         b.   Two (2) different criteria shall be used to judge the suitability
of a plastic bag: its thickness and its durability, as evaluated by the ASTM
dart test. Therefore, procurement shall be based on one or both of these
standards. The important consideration is the selection of tear-resistant
plastic bags that maintain their integrity (at least until the waste is
treated) and, thus, prevent dispersal of infectious agents into the
environment.
      3.   Transporting Off-Site: When infectious waste is transported off-site
for treatment, plastic bags, single or double, shall be placed within rigid or
semi-rigid containers to maintain the integrity of the packaging and prevent
spillage. Depending on the management system, these containers may be recycled
or disposed of. Recycled containers (such as heavy plastic barrels) which are
used repeatedly for transport and treatment of bagged waste shall be
disinfected after each use.
      4.   Compaction of Waste: Infectious waste shall not be compacted prior
to treatment because compacting may actually disperse the infectious waste by
destroying the integrity of the packaging. In addition, compaction may
interfere with the effectiveness of the treatment process.
      5.   Containers Appropriate for Type of Process: Containers to be
incinerated shall be combustible. Containers used in steam sterilization shall
allow steam penetration and evacuation of air. Packaging technique shall be
suitable for the application processes.
      6.   Package Identification: Packaged infectious waste shall be easily
identifiable. This shall be accomplished by the use of containers with the
distinctive red or orange color that indicates biohazardous material and the
use of the universal biohazard symbol on all infectious waste packages and
containers. The identification system shall include clear labelling to indicate
all hazards that are present in the waste.
      The use of appropriate hazard symbols shall be in accordance with
municipal, State and Federal regulations.
      7.   Requirements for Safe Transport: There are two (2) factors which
shall be satisfied to ensure safe transport of infectious waste both within the
facility and to the treatment facility:
         a.   Proper packaging is required to ensure containment of the waste.
         b.   Mechanical devices shall not be used to transfer or load
infectious waste to avoid rupturing of the packaging and dissemination of the
waste.
Carts are acceptable for moving packaged infectious waste within the facility.
Carts shall be disinfected frequently, and carts used to transport infectious
waste shall not be used for other materials prior to decontamination.
   H.   Treatment of Infectious Waste: For the purposes of this Chapter, Lyon
County defines "treatment" as any method, technique or process designed to
change the biological character or composition of waste.
   Lyon County requires:
      1.   Establishing standard operating procedures for each process used for
treating infectious waste.
      2.   Monitoring of all treatment processes to assure efficient and
effective treatment.
      3.   Use of biological indicators to monitor treatment (other indicators
may be used; provided, that their effectiveness has been successfully
demonstrated).
The purpose of treating infectious waste is to reduce the hazard associated
with the presence of infectious agents. Treatment shall reduce or eliminate
pathogens (present in the waste) so that waste no longer poses a hazard to
persons who may be exposed to it.
   I.   Disposal of Treated Waste: Infectious waste which has been effectively
treated is no longer biologically hazardous and may be mixed with and disposed
of as ordinary waste; provided, the waste does not pose other hazards that are
subject to Federal, State or local regulations.
   Needles and syringes shall be rendered nonusable before disposal; treated
sharps may be ground up, incinerated or compacted; for aesthetic reasons, body
parts shall not be recognizable when disposed of.
   J.   Staff Training: Training is required to maintain personnel awareness of
the potential hazards posed by infectious wastes and to reinforce waste
management policies and procedures that are detailed in the infectious waste
management plan.
   K.   Contingency Planning: As part of the infectious waste management plan,
all handlers shall prepare contingency plans to deal with spills and
unauthorized emission discharges and releases of infectious waste.
(Ord. 329, 4-6-89)
6.03.11: INFECTIOUS WASTE FACILITIES SITING:
   A.   Any generator of infectious waste may build and operate an infectious
waste treatment facility, including an appropriate infectious waste
incinerator, in conjunction with any hospital, laboratory, clinic or similar
facility; provided, any such infectious waste treatment facility shall have a
capacity not greater than that required to treat or incinerate the infectious
waste generated at that hospital, laboratory, clinic, etc.
   B.   Other than set forth above, any stationary facility for the treatment,
incineration or disposal of infectious waste, including treatment, incinerator
or disposal in tanks, is subject to the siting criteria set forth in NAC
444.8456.
   C.   A portable facility for the treatment, incineration or transfer of
infectious waste is subject to the siting requirements and considerations set
forth in NRS 278.020. (Ord. 329, 4-6-89)
6.03.12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this Chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes. The standards set forth herein are minimum standards, and
this Chapter does not imply that compliance will ensure that there will be no
unauthorized discharge of an infectious waste. This Chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the County or any officer or employee thereof for any
damages that result from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made hereunder. All infectious wastes handlers are advised to
determine to their own satisfaction the level of protection in addition to that
required by this Chapter necessary or desirable to ensure that there is no risk
or damage to public health or the environment. Mere compliance with this
Chapter does not release the handler from civil liability to others for damages
resulting from his use of infectious waste. (Ord. 329, 4-6-89)
6.03.13: ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES:
   A.   Any infectious waste handler who intentionally or negligently violates
any of the provisions of this Chapter may:
      1.   Be denied an infectious waste use permit by the County; or
      2.   Have an infectious waste use permit revoked.
      3.   Be ordered by an enforcement officer to cease operations forthwith
or have the infectious waste use permit suspended pending a formal hearing
before the Board of County Commissioners or a designated hearing officer.
      4.   Be subject to the following penalties:
         a.   Administrative Penalties: Upon a finding by the County that an
infectious waste handler has violated any provision of this Chapter, the County
may levy an administrative fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for
each violation.
         b.   Civil Penalties: Any infectious waste handler who intentionally
or negligently violates any provision of this Chapter or fails to comply with
any order issued hereunder shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed
five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for each violation which shall be
assessed and recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the County by
the District Attorney. In any civil action brought pursuant hereto, in which
the County prevails, the court shall determine and impose reasonable costs,
including all attorney fees permissible under Nevada law, incurred by the
County in the investigation and prosecution of the action.
         c.   Criminal Penalties: Any person or business which intentionally
violates any provision of the Chapter shall be subject to the criminal
penalties prescribed by Nevada statute for misdemeanor offenses.
   B.   Remedies under this Chapter are in addition to and do not supersede or
limit any and all other remedies, civil or criminal.
   C.   Acceptance by a permittee of a use permit granted pursuant to this
Chapter shall signify acceptance by the permittee of the penalty provisions of
this Chapter as if by contract or otherwise with the County. (Ord. 329, 4-6-89)

6.04.01: FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSE:
The U.S. government has adopted comprehensive requirements through the adoption
of laws and regulations requiring businesses to report to local officials and
fire officials certain information regarding extremely hazardous substances,

7.08.01: DEFINITIONS:
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have
the meanings ascribed to them:
ALARM ADMINISTRATOR: A person or persons designated by the county to
administer, control and review false alarm reduction efforts and administers
the provisions of this chapter.
ALARM COMPANY: A person subject to the licensing requirements, and/or a company
engaged in selling, leasing, installing, servicing or monitoring alarm systems.
ALARM SIGNAL: A detectable signal; audible or visual, generated by an alarm
system, to which law enforcement is requested to respond.
ALARM SYSTEM: Any single device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the
occurrence of an illegal or unauthorized entry or other illegal activity
requiring immediate attention and to which law enforcement is requested to
respond, but does not include motor vehicle or boat alarms, fire alarms,
domestic violence alarms, or alarms designed to elicit a medical response.
ALARM USER: Any person, corporation, partnership, proprietorship, governmental
or educational entity or any other entity owning, leasing or operating an alarm
system, or on whose premises an alarm system is maintained for the protection
of such premises.

message or code signal indicating a need for law enforcement response.
CANCELLATION: The process where a deputy response is terminated to an alarm
site before a deputy arrives at the scene.
COUNTY: The county of Lyon or its agent.
DUAL ACTIVATION PANIC DEVICE: A device installed by alarm companies for

activate a signal of a robbery or holdup in progress.
FALSE ALARM: The activation of an alarm system through mechanical or electronic
failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the alarm
user, his/her employees or agents, and signals activated to summon law
enforcement personnel unless law enforcement response was canceled by the
user's alarm company before law enforcement personnel arrive at the alarm
location. An alarm is false within the meaning of this chapter when, upon
inspection by the Lyon County sheriff office, evidence indicates that no
unauthorized entry, robbery, or other such crime was committed or attempted in
or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm
system. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a false alarm shall not include an alarm
which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated by
unusually violent conditions of nature nor does it include other extraordinary

appear to be caused by separate human action. The Lyon County sheriff office
may in its discretion discontinue deputy responses to alarm signals from what
appears to be a runaway alarm.
SIA CONTROL PANEL STANDARD CP-01: The American National Standard Institute
approved Security Industry Association (SIA) CP-01 control panel standard, as
may be updated from time to time, that details recommended design features for
security system control panels and their associated arming and disarming
devices to reduce false alarms. Control panels built and tested to this
standard by a nationally recognized testing organization, will be marked to
state: "Design evaluated in accordance with SIA CP-01 Control Panel Standard
Features for False Alarm Reduction".
VERIFY: An attempt by the monitoring company, or its representative, to contact
the alarm site and/or alarm user by telephone and/or other electronic means,
whether or not actual contact with a person is made, to attempt to determine
whether an alarm signal is valid, before requesting law enforcement dispatch,
in an attempt to avoid an unnecessary alarm dispatch request. (Ord. 589, 9-1-

require, at a minimum that a second call be made to a different number, if the
first attempt fails to reach a responsible party. Enhanced call verification
shall not be used in the cases of: a panic alarm; a robbery/holdup alarm; or a
crime in progress which has been verified by video and/or audible means. The
telephone number(s) and responsible party name(s) attempted shall be provided
to the sheriff dispatch operator.

9-1-2016)
7.08.05: ENFORCEMENT OF PROVISIONS:
   A.   False Alarm Penalties: Civil penalties for false alarms in a twelve

alleged as shown by chemical analyses of the defendant's blood, urine, breath
or other bodily substances shall give rise to the following presumptions:

percent (0.05%) but less than ten one-hundredths percent (0.10%) by weight of
alcohol in the defendant's blood, such fact shall not give rise to any

evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
            (3)   If there was, at that time, ten one-hundredths percent
(0.10%) or more by weight of alcohol in the defendant's blood, it shall be
presumed that the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

The failure or inability to obtain such a test or tests by such person shall
not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the refusal to submit to a
test or relating to a test taken upon the request of a Sheriff's deputy.

street, road or highway in the County is deemed to have given his consent to a
chemical test of his blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance for the
purpose of determining the alcoholic content of his blood when such test is
administered at the direction of a Sheriff's deputy having reasonable grounds
to believe that such person was driving a vehicle while under the influence of
intoxicating liquor and after such person was arrested for any offense
allegedly committed while such person was driving a vehicle under the influence
of intoxicating liquor.

such test will result in the suspension of his privilege to drive a vehicle for
a period of six (6) months, as provided in NRS 484.383.

condition rendering him incapable of refusal shall be deemed not to have

such person is informed, as required in paragraph (2) above.

not be honored unless payment in full has been made for water and other
services previously rendered to the applicant or owner by LCUD, and unless all
special assessments on the parcel of land to be served are paid current.
   D.   Installation Charges: Where a regular charge has been fixed for the
type of service connection desired, such regular charge shall be paid in
advance by the applicant. Where there is no regular charge, LCUD reserves the
right to require the applicant to deposit an amount equal to the estimated cost
of such service connection. Only duly authorized employees, or agents of LCUD
or LCUD approved contractors will be authorized to install service connections.
   E.   Installation Of Services: Service installations will be made only to
property abutting distribution mains as have been constructed in public
streets, alleys or easements. Services installed in new subdivisions prior to

unlawful to maintain a connection that does not conform to the following rules:
      1.   Separate Building: Each house or building under separate ownership
must be provided with a separate service connection. Two (2) or more houses
under one ownership and on the same lot or parcel of land may be supplied
through the same service connection, if sufficient water rights have been
provided. LCUD must approve all installations and may require modifications to
the existing system.
      2.   Single Connection: Not more than one service connection for domestic
or commercial supply shall be installed for one building, except as approved by
LCUD.
      3.   Different Owners: A service connection shall not be used to supply
an adjoining property of a different owner or to supply property of the same
owner across a property line, street or alley.
      4.   Divided Property: Each service connection shall be considered as
belonging to the lot or parcel of land which it directly enters prior to any
lot line adjustments. Additional service connections may be required.
   J.   Service Connections: The service connections extending from the water
main to the property line and including the meter, meter box and meter valve,
shall be maintained by LCUD except as otherwise stated. All pipes and fixtures
extending or lying beyond the meter pit shall be installed and maintained by
the owner of the property. Where the meter is located other than at the

be owned and maintained by the owner of the property.
   K.   Individual Liability For Joint Service: Two (2) or more parties who
join in one application for service shall be jointly and severally liable for
payment of bills and shall be billed by means of single periodic bill. The
owner is ultimately responsible in any case.
   L.   Special Cases: LCUD will require a written contract with special
guarantee from applicants whose unusual characteristics of load would require
excessive investment in facilities or whose requirements for service are of a
special nature. Applicants may be required to either construct or fund
improvements required to serve their project.
   M.   Water Used Without Application Being Made: An owner taking possession
of premises and using water from an active service connection without having
made application to LCUD for water service shall be held liable for the water
delivered from the date of such use or possession or the earliest date of
occupancy which can be reasonably established. Where services are not metered,
the quantity consumed will be estimated. If proper application for water
service is not made within seven (7) days of notification to do so by LCUD and
if accumulated bills for service are not paid immediately, the service may be
discontinued by LCUD without further notice.
   N.   Connection To System Required Within Three Hundred Sixty Five Days Of
Application: Any application that has been accepted by LCUD shall be considered
vacated if the applicant fails to commence construction and connection to
LCUD’s water system within three hundred sixty five (365) calendar days of such
acceptance. Any fees collected for such application that are unused, shall be
returned to the applicant, upon written request, and a new application and
payment of fees will be required before service will be provided. Connection
fees shall be charged at the rate in effect on the day of application.
Connection(s) not made within three hundred sixty five (365) days will be
subject to the current rates in effect at the time of connection. Previously
paid connection fees shall be credited to the new connection fee rate. Payment
of connection fees constitutes acceptance of a new service connection
application by LCUD. No fees will be refunded after connection.
   O.   Changes In Use Or Uses Of Served Property: Any changes in the use or
uses of properties served by regular water service which may affect the service
classification under which it is served or the number of fixture units served
must have the prior approval of LCUD. Examples of such changes would be adding
plumbing fixtures not previously approved in applying for service; modifying a
residence to accommodate more single-family units than were approved, changes
to irrigation systems, or such other changes that would similarly change the
character of the building and/or grounds. Such changes in use shall be subject
to an additional connection charge and may require additional water rights. If
such changes are made without application they shall be considered to have been
made in violation and be subject to discontinuance of service as provided in
section
9.03.10 of this chapter.
   P.   General: All costs and expenses related to the installation and
connection of any water service or other work for which a permit has been
issued shall be borne by the applicant, and shall be in addition to all fees,
service and connection charges. The owner shall indemnify LCUD for any loss or
damage that may directly or indirectly be related to the work. All work shall
be made by or be authorized by LCUD for any new construction, addition,
remodel, or demolition that may result in a change of water use or will require
a building permit. Written approval and final acceptance by LCUD is required.
   Q.   Connection Charge: The following charges are established by the board
and shall be collected at the time of issuing the permit for a water
connection. Connection fees shall be charged at the rate in effect on the day
of application to LCUD. Connections not made within three hundred sixty five
(365) days will be subject to the current rates in effect at the time of
connection. Previously paid connection fees shall be credited to the new
connection fee rate. No fees will be refunded after connection.
      1.   Units Within The Service Area: Water connection fees shall be
established by the board. Each dwelling or multiple dwellings on a single
parcel shall constitute a separate unit.
      2.   Fire Protection: Connection fees for fire protection shall be
established by the board.
      3.   Units Outside Of The Service Area: Reserved for future use.
      4.   Remodeling Connection Charges: If remodeling necessitates upgrade of
the water meter, connection fees shall be charged equal to the fee for that
meter size as described in subsection Q.1. of this section minus: a) the total
in connection fees paid to LCUD previously or b) water connection fee for the
existing meter size, whichever results in the lower net additional connection
charges. Additional water rights may also be required based on a fixture unit
count of the entire property including existing uses plus proposed additions.
      5.   Plan Check Fee: In accordance with LCUD’s most recently adopted fee
schedule, a plan check fee shall be required for all plans requiring LCUD’s
approval. Each plan revision requiring rechecking shall be assessed an
additional fee. Plan recheck fees shall be invoiced at a rate to reimburse
direct costs on a time and materials basis as determined by the utilities
director. Plan checking is performed for both water and sewer concurrently.

connections to premises within the subdivision.
      6.   Plan Checking Fee: Any person requiring approval of plans by LCUD,
or desiring plan checking shall pay to LCUD the plan check fee or fees
established by the board.
   S.   Will-Serve Letters/Water Rights Required:
      1.   Standards For Granting Or Denial Of Requests: No “will-serve”
letters shall be issued by LCUD for any project if in the director’s judgment,
it is likely that LCUD will be unable to serve the project to be connected to
LCUD’s water system, if the project does not meet the requirements of NAC 445A
or if sufficient water rights to support the project have not been provided. In
making this determination, LCUD shall take into account the estimated amount of
water that will be required to serve the entire project at full development,
and the amount of water LCUD is likely to have available at that time.
      2.   Effect Of “Will-Serve” Letter: The issuance of a “will-serve” letter
by LCUD shall obligate LCUD to reserve a connection for the project for which
the letter has been issued for the time period stated in the letter. This
section is declarative of LCUD’s existing policy and practice with respect to
“will-serve” letters.
      3.   Procedure For Consideration Of Requests For “Will-Serve” Letters:

9.03.06: MAIN EXTENSIONS AND/OR CAPACITY ENHANCEMENTS:
   A.   Application For Main Extension And/Or Capacity Enhancement: The
following rules are established for making main extensions and/or capacity
enhancement:
      1.   Application: Any owner of one or more lots or parcels, or subdivider
of a tract of land, desiring the extension of one or more water mains to serve
such property, shall make a written application to LCUD on a form provided by
LCUD.
      2.   Investigation: Upon receipt of the application, LCUD shall make an
investigation of the proposed extension and/or enhancement.
      3.   Reimbursements: The board of commissioners may consider
reimbursement agreements as presented by the director or county manager.
      4.   LCUD Lines: All extensions must be approved and accepted by LCUD and
be offered for dedication to the county by the applicant. There may be a
situation where the main extension may be privately owned.
      5.   Dead End Lines: No dead end lines shall be permitted, except at the
discretion of the utilities director.
   B.   Costs: All costs and expenses incident to the installation and
connection of any water service or other work for which a permit has been
issued shall be borne by the applicant, and shall be in addition to all fees
established by the board. The owner shall indemnify LCUD for any loss or damage
that may be directly or indirectly related to the work. All work shall be made
by or be authorized by LCUD.
   C.   Reserved.
   D.   Reimbursement Agreement: If the applicant must extend the water main
through another's property or along the frontages of another's property or
along the frontages of various intermediate property owners, and if said
properties are not currently served by the county's water system, then said
intermediate and benefiting property owners shall be responsible when
development commences or connection is made for a pro rata share of the costs
of the water line extension.
   When the applicant is required to extend a water line, he shall "front end"
the entire cost of the water line design and construction and shall be
responsible for the actual construction of said water line. Any owners of
properties to be served by the extended water line will thereafter be
responsible for reimbursing the first property owner through LCUD for a pro
rata share of the costs of the water line at the time said subsequent owners
begin to plat, parcel, develop or build upon their parcels. LCUD may reimburse
the applicant for materials associated with oversizing at LCUD's request. Only
the difference in cost between the two (2) different sizes will be considered.
   The pro rata shares for the applicant and all subsequent owners benefited by
the extended water line shall be determined prior to the county entering into
the reimbursement agreement. Extensions and/or capacity upgrades financed by
the applicant shall be prorated to the linear footage along the extension. Flag
lots and large parcels with narrow frontage may be calculated by a percentage
of the parcel square footage in relation to the main line installation cost
percentage.
   The county shall collect a fifteen percent (15%) administrative fee from the
applicant who front ended the water line construction upon reimbursement by
deducting the fifteen percent (15%) administrative fee from the subsequent
owners' pro rata share prior to reimbursement to the applicant by the county.
The reimbursement agreement shall become null and void ten (10) years from the
date of board of county commissioners' approval.
   The applicant shall submit three (3) bids prior to construction from
qualified contractors attached to the application for reimbursement, unless due
to extraordinary circumstances three (3) bids are not available due to
specialized construction. The bids shall be itemized and include costs for all
items to be installed. Failure to provide the itemized bids will exempt the
installation from reimbursement. Construction costs eligible for reimbursement
are limited to engineering, contractor's bid, construction staking by an
engineer or surveyor, permit, inspection and testing fees. Final costs must be
approved by LCUD and may require certification from a Nevada licensed civil
engineer. The applicant's administration costs are not eligible for
reimbursement.
   Single-family homes on property zoned single-family existing at the time of
application for a reimbursement agreement shall be exempt from the provisions
of the agreement. When an existing single-family home is on a parcel which has
adequate area to be divided per the current zoning or master plan designation
of the parcel, the area which could be divided for new development will be
required to be included in the reimbursement agreement. In no event shall any
owners of the property to be served by such extended water lines be permitted
to connect thereto without first paying to the county the pro rata share of the
costs described above as well as all other fees required by the county.
   Any facilities installed pursuant to this section are the property of the
LCUD upon inspection and acceptance by the county and LCUD. A one year warranty
agreement period is in effect for the contractor to be responsible for repairs.

9.03.07: GENERAL USE REGULATIONS:
   A.   Number Of Services Per Premises: The applicant may apply for as many
services as may be reasonably required for the premises provided that the
pipeline system for each service is independent of the others and that they not
be interconnected. LCUD must approve all service connections.
   B.   Water Waste: It is unlawful for anyone connected to the public water
system to waste water. For the purpose of this section, "waste" means any
excessive usage which causes water to run into or along any street, alley,
storm drainage system, or into or upon another's property; provided nothing in
this section shall be construed as to apply to the accidental breaking of any
hose, water pipe, or other irrigation. If such breaks are not repaired or the
water turned off within the specified time once notice is given, LCUD may
discontinue water service, and it is unlawful for any person to again turn on
such water until proper repairs have been made.
   If personal notice is unable to be given, the water may be immediately shut
off by the LCUD and a notice shall be placed on the most accessible door
stating the reason for shutoff. If service is disconnected due to failure to
stop the waste that may cause damage or during moderate or strict conservation,
a service fee will be charged for every occurrence after the first shutoff.
Other penalties may apply as prescribed in subsection 9.03.16E of this chapter.

installed by LCUD on private property for the purpose of rendering water
service shall remain the property of LCUD and may be maintained, repaired or
replaced by the LCUD without consent or interference of the owner or occupant
of the property. The property owner shall use reasonable care in the protection
of the facilities. No payment shall be made for placing or maintaining said
facilities on private property. Easements and rights of way are to be kept free
of encroachment of any kind, and LCUD shall have access to such areas, and any
obstructions or encroachments in these areas shall be removed at the expense of

customer's bill. LCUD has no responsibility to return the site to anything but
its natural, unlandscaped condition.
   D.   Damage To Water System Facilities: The customer shall be liable for any
damage to the service facilities when such damage is from causes originating on
the premises by an act of the customer or his tenants, agents, employees,
contractors, licensees or permittees, including the breaking or destruction of
locks or tags by the customer or others on or near a meter, and any damage to a
meter that may result from hot water or steam from a boiler or heater on the
customer's premises. LCUD shall be reimbursed by the customer for any such
damage promptly on presentation of a bill. Damage to water system would also
include, but not be limited to, damage to meter boxes, fire hydrants, water
valves and boxes, removal of meter location stakes, service lines and
distribution system.
   E.   Ground Wire Attachments: All individuals or business organizations are

   G.   Relief Valves And Regulating Valves: As a protection to the customer's
or owner's plumbing system, a suitable pressure relief valve and pressure
regulating valve must be installed and maintained at the customer's or owner's
expense. When check valves or other protective devices are used, the relief
valve and an expansion tank shall be installed between the check valves and the
water heater.
   H.   Service Size: Where increased meter and service sizes are required, the
owner is responsible for the installation and associated cost of any needed
infrastructure. Only contractors approved by LCUD are allowed to install
waterworks infrastructure. Any costs incurred by LCUD will be charged to the
owner on a time and materials basis.
   I.   Discontinued Service: The service of water to any premises may be
immediately discontinued by LCUD if any defect is found in the check valve or
other protective devices, or if it is found that dangerous unprotected cross
connections, or jumper connections exist. Services will not be restored until
such defects have been corrected and inspected by LCUD. LCUD shall not be
responsible for damages or losses as a result of the water being disconnected.
   J.   Interruptions In Service: LCUD shall not be liable for damage or losses
which may result from an interruption in service from a cause beyond the
control of LCUD or during emergency shutdowns.

ingress and egress to the customer's premises at reasonable hours for any
purpose reasonably connected with the furnishing of water service.
   L.   Nonexistent Services: Where service lines do not exist from the main to
the property line, the applicant is responsible for service line installation
and costs under the ordinances, rules and regulations of LCUD.
   M.   Pools And Tanks: When an abnormally large quantity of water is desired
for filling a swimming pool or for other purposes, arrangements must be made
with LCUD prior to taking such water. Permission to take water in unusual
quantities will be given only if it can be safely delivered through LCUD's
facilities and if other consumers are not inconvenienced thereby.
   N.   Responsibility For Equipment: The customer shall, at his own risk and
expense, furnish, install and keep in good and safe condition all equipment
that may be required for receiving, controlling, applying and utilizing water,
and LCUD shall not be responsible for any loss or damage caused by the improper
installation of such equipment, or the negligence or wrongful act of the
customer or of any of his tenants, agents, employees, contractors, licensees or
permittees in installing, maintaining, operating or interfering with such
equipment. LCUD shall not be responsible for damage or losses to property
caused by faucets, pipes, valves and other equipment that are open or leaking
when water is turned on at the meter, either originally or when turned on after
a temporary discontinuance of service. Costs of repairs, replacements or
disruption of services shall be borne by the customer.
   O.   Use Of Siphons: No siphon of any nature shall be operated from any
service connected to LCUD's system.
   P.   Uniform Plumbing Code And Standard Details: The following uniform
plumbing code provisions are made a part of this chapter. Deviations from the
UPC must be approved by LCUD.
      1.   This chapter hereby adopts the 2003 uniform plumbing code and its
appendices including: A, B, C, E, H, I (omitting the standards contained within
"I" of 8-95, 11-87), K, (omit K-7 and K-8), and L, (omit L4.0 to L6.3).

(Ord. 504, 1-18-2007)
9.03.08: METERS:
   A.   Meter Installation: Meters will be installed on all services. This
chapter establishes the minimum meter size to be three-fourths inch (3/4").
Flat rate services will not be allowed.
   All meter installation charges are based upon materials and labor costs.
Only duly authorized LCUD employees or contractors preapproved by the LCUD will
be authorized to install service connections and/or meters. Meters will be
installed at the property line and shall be owned by LCUD. The seal or lock of
any meter sealed by LCUD shall not be altered or broken except by one of its
authorized employees or agents.
   B.   Change In Location Of Meters: Meters moved or raised for the
convenience of the customer will be relocated at the customer's expense and
must be approved by LCUD. Meters moved to protect LCUD's property will be moved
at LCUD's expense.
   C.   Meter Tests; Deposit: If a customer desires to have the meter serving
his premises tested, he shall first make a deposit in the amount established by
the board. Should the meter register faster than AWWA standards, latest
revision, the deposit will be refunded, but should the meter register less than
AWWA meter test standards, latest revision, LCUD will retain the deposit.
   D.   Adjustment For Meter Errors; Fast Meters: If a meter tested at the
request of a customer is found to be faster than AWWA standards, the charges in
excess of AWWA standards for a period not to exceed six (6) months shall be
refunded to the customer.
   E.   Adjustment For Meter Errors; Slow Meters: If a meter tested is found to
be slower than AWWA standards, LCUD may bill the customer for the amount of the
undercharge based upon corrected meter readings for the period, not exceeding
six (6) months that the meter was in use.
   F.   Nonregistering Meters: If a meter is found to be not registering, the
charges for service shall be at the minimum monthly rate or based on the
estimated consumption, whichever is greater. Such estimates shall be made from
previous consumption for a comparable period or by such other method as is
determined by LCUD. (Ord. 504, 1-18-2007)
9.03.09: BILLING:
   A.   Billing Period: The regular billing period will be at the discretion of
LCUD.
   B.   Meter Reading: Meters shall be read as nearly as possible on the same
day of each billing period. (Ord. 504, 1-18-2007)
   C.   Opening And Closing Bills: Opening and closing bills for less than the
normal billing period will be prorated for the number of days in the month for
which service is provided based on the meter size plus any water used in excess
of five thousand (5,000) gallons' base use amount. (Ord. 568, 7-3-2014)
   D.   Billing Time: Bills for the base rate and for consumption over the
minimum are billed in arrears.
   E.   Penalties: All charges shall become due and payable upon presentation.
Payments not received by the due date listed on the bill shall become
delinquent on the next business day after the due date. All charges which
become delinquent shall be subject to a penalty of ten percent (10%) for the
first month delinquent. Customers' payments shall be applied to their oldest
balances due, including penalties, first.
   F.   Delinquent Charges Collected On Tax Rolls:
      1.   The purpose of this subsection is to adopt an ordinance authorized
by Nevada Revised Statutes 244.36605 to have delinquent charges for water and/
or sewer service placed on the tax roll in the same manner, by the same
persons, and at the same time as, together with and not separately from, Lyon
County's general taxes.
      2.   The utilities department shall cause a description of each parcel of
real property with respect to which a water service charge is delinquent on May
1 and the amount of the delinquent charge to be prepared and submitted to the
county clerk/treasurer no later than June 1. The description of each parcel and
the amount of the delinquent charge must be submitted in a form approved by the
county clerk/treasurer.
      3.   The amount of the charge which is delinquent constitutes a lien
against the lot or parcel of land against which the charge has been imposed as
of the time when the lien of taxes attaches.
      4.   The county clerk/treasurer shall include the amount of the charges
on bills for taxes levied against the respective lots and parcels of land.
      5.   Thereafter the amount of the charges must be collected at the same
time and in the same manner and by the same persons as, together with and not
separately from, the general taxes for the county.
      6.   All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of
general taxes of the county, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to
the matters of delinquency, correction, cancellation, refund, redemption and
sale, are applicable to delinquent charges for water and/or sewer.
      7.   The county clerk/treasurer may issue separate bills for those
charges and separate receipts for collection on account of those charges.
   G.   Protests To Rates And Charges: If any owner shall be dissatisfied with
any water charge imposed, he may file a written protest with the utilities
director setting forth his/her objections provided such protest is filed within
fifteen (15) working days of receipt of the bill being protested.
   Upon receipt of any such protest, the director shall, within fifteen (15)
working days, make a determination in writing as to the correctness of the
bill. Should the director determine that the bill was incorrect, he/she may
cause the corrections to be made.
   If the owner is not satisfied with the utilities director's decision, the
owner may appeal that decision to the county manager in writing within five (5)
working days. The county manager shall, within fifteen (15) working days, make
a determination in writing.
   If the protester is dissatisfied with the county manager's decision, he/she
may appeal to the board, provided such written appeal is filed within ten (10)
days of receipt of the county manager's decision.
   The board, upon receipt of a protest, shall fix a time and place for a
hearing of said protest which shall not be later than thirty (30) calendar days
after receipt of same and cause the protesters to be notified thereof.
   Upon the hearing, the board may adjust the water charge if it is satisfied
with the reasons and basis of the protest. Action taken on any protest shall be
entered in the minutes of the board.
   The protester shall have fifteen (15) calendar days after determination of
the protest by the board within which to pay his/her water charge before any
penalty or interest shall be attached or imposed, notwithstanding any other
provision of this chapter concerning the imposition of penalty and interest
charges.
   H.   Represents Lien On Property: Until paid, all rates, tolls and charges
provided in this chapter constitute a perpetual lien on and against the
property served and may be foreclosed upon as provided by law.
   I.   Billing Of Separate Meters Not Combined: Separate bills will be
rendered for each meter installation except where LCUD has, for its own
convenience, installed two (2) or more meters in place of one meter. Where such
installations are made, the meter readings may be combined for billing
purposes.
   J.   Owner's Guarantee: Before water is turned on by LCUD for any purpose,
the property owner must sign the application form as provided by LCUD in which
he guarantees payment of future water bills for the service required. The
property owner signing the owner application for utility service form will be
held liable for the appropriate fee for water service until LCUD is notified in
writing to remove the meter or transfer the account to another property owner.
The owner may assign an agent that the bill will be mailed to, however the
owner will ultimately be responsible for all payments.
   At LCUD's discretion, service may be established verbally, but must be
followed up with an application form completed by the owner or agent within
ninety (90) days of request for service.
   K.   Water Used Without Application Being Made: An owner taking possession
of premises and using water from an active service connection without having
made application to LCUD for water service shall be held liable for the water
delivered from the date of the last recorded meter reading, and if the meter is
found inoperative, the quantity consumed will be estimated. If proper
application for water service is not made within a period of time specified by
LCUD, and if accumulated bills for service are not paid immediately, the
service may be discontinued by LCUD without further notice.
   L.   Damages Through Leaking Pipes And Fixtures: Owner or owner's agent must
be present at the property at the time scheduled for LCUD to turn on the water
service. LCUD will in no case be liable for damages caused by water leaking or
running from open or faulty fixtures, or from broken or damaged pipes or any
other appurtenances within or outside of the building structure. (Ord. 504, 1-
18-2007)
   M.   Policy For Appeal For Relief From Excessive Water Charges: When
customers, through no fault of their own, have incurred excessively high water
bills due to freezing or breaking of water lines or other unavoidable
circumstances, and the detection and correction of such a break could not have
reasonably been accomplished in time to avoid the excessive water usage, the
following policy shall apply. Leaving water running unattended does not qualify
for relief.
   An LCUD water customer who has an uncontrollable loss of water that results
in an excess of one hundred twenty five dollars ($125.00) above the previous
year's bill for the same period, may apply to LCUD for relief under this
policy. The utilities director will review the matter and determine if the high
overage was a result of an undetectable condition and was not a result of
negligence or inattention of the property owner. Upon such a determination,
LCUD will credit the overage charge in excess of one hundred twenty five
dollars ($125.00). This adjustment will only be allowed one time per parcel
within a twenty four (24) month period. The owner may be required to replace
plumbing in order to qualify for future relief. The utilities director may use
other means necessary in determining average water usage. Relief will only be
considered for one billing period. (Ord. 568, 7-3-2014)
   N.   Checks And Electronic Funds Transfers Not Honored By Bank: Checks and
electronic funds transfers presented in payment of bills that are returned by a
bank shall be treated as though no payment had been made, and an administrative
charge will be levied by LCUD, plus any additional charges received from the
bank. The customer must reimburse LCUD for any returned check/electronic funds
transfer fees charged by a bank to LCUD.
   O.   Collection By Suit:
      1.   Suit: As an alternative to any of the other procedures herein
provided, all unpaid rates and charges and penalties herein provided may be
collected by suit. As an additional procedure, LCUD shall have all rights as
provided by law.
      2.   Costs: Defendant shall pay all costs of suit in any judgment
rendered in favor of LCUD, including a reasonable attorney fee.
   P.   Collection With Other Utility Charges:
      1.   With Utility Charges Of LCUD: Where the person charged is a user of
another utility owned and operated by LCUD, the charges may be collected
together with and not separately from the charges for the other utility service
rendered by it. They may be billed upon the same bill and collected as one item
at the discretion of LCUD.
      2.   Discontinuance Of Service Upon Delinquency: Upon delinquency, the
other utility service may be discontinued until full payment of the dual
charges and penalties and associated fees are paid in full. At the discretion
of LCUD the delinquent charges may be added to the property tax rolls.
   Q.   Service Rates:
      1.   Rates: For all users within LCUD, rates established by the board
shall apply.
         a. Monthly Charges: For all monthly water consumption of five thousand
(5,000) gallons or less, the minimum charge as established by the board shall
apply. For all consumption in excess of five thousand (5,000) gallons in any
month, a charge according to the unit cost established by the board shall
apply.
         b. Fire Protection: Public and private fire protection systems shall
be charged the following monthly rates:
            (1) Public fire protection rates shall be billed to the responsible
fire protection agencies at the rate determined in the contract between LCUD
and the fire protection agency.
            (2) Private fire protection systems shall be billed monthly to the
property owner or association of property owners at the rate established by the
board.
      2.   Multi-Unit Residential Accounts: The base charge for multi-unit
residential accounts using common meters shall be determined by the base charge
based on meter size. The excess charge for multi-unit residential accounts
using common meters shall apply to usage exceeding five thousand (5,000)
gallons per month.
      3.   Bulk Water For Construction: Where water is used for construction
and obtained from a fire hydrant or other location approved by LCUD, the volume
used will be billed on a per one thousand (1,000) gallon rate established by
the board plus a rental fee and any additional time or material costs
associated with the hydrant meter setup.
      4.   Call Out Service Charges: A customer requesting LCUD assistance with
customer related water issues, i.e., interior water leak, problem with
irrigation system, water shutoff at meter (because customer cannot locate their
own shutoff valve, etc.), may be billed a service call charge, at the
discretion of the utilities director. (Ord. 504, 1-18-2007)
      5.   Source Water Impact Fee: A service charge may be imposed for
stormwater planning, capital improvements, maintenance and repair of stormwater
collection and detention systems in order to protect groundwater quality within
the LCUD water service area. (Ord. 568, 7-3-2014)

the account becomes delinquent, provided LCUD has given the customer at least
two (2) days' prior written notice of such intention.
   B.   Liability For Bills: Failure to receive a water bill does not relieve
consumer or owner of liability. Any amount due shall be deemed a debt to LCUD,
and any person, firm, or corporation failing, neglecting or refusing to pay
said indebtedness shall be liable to an action in the name of LCUD in any court
of competent jurisdiction for the amount thereof.
   C.   Resumption Of Service Charge: Where service has been discontinued for
violation of these rules or for nonpayment of bills, the cost of discontinuing
and resuming service shall be at the expense of the customer or owner.
      1.   Made During Regular Business Hours: LCUD will endeavor to resume
service during regular business hours on the day of the request, if conditions
permit; otherwise, LCUD will endeavor to resume service on the next regular
business day following the day the request is made.
      2.   Made At Other Than Regular Business Hours: When a customer has
requested that the service be resumed at a time outside of regular business
hours, LCUD will reasonably endeavor to resume service if practicable under the
circumstances but will be under no obligation to do so, unless an emergency
exists. A charge based on costs, including overtime rates, shall be billed to
the customer for services rendered outside of regular business hours.
      3.   Presence Of Owner Or Authorized Representative: During requested
resumption of service, the owner or their authorized representative is required
to be on site. (Ord. 504, 1-18-2007)
   D.   Unsafe Apparatus: Water service may be refused or immediately
discontinued to any premises where apparatus or appliances are in use which
might endanger or disrupt the service to other customers in any way. Where
service has been disconnected due to an unsafe apparatus, all costs associated
with investigating, discontinuing and resuming service shall be at the expense
of the customer. (Ord. 568, 7-3-2014)

   G.   For Noncompliance With Rules: LCUD may discontinue service to any
customer for violation of these rules after it has given the customer at least
five (5) days' written notice of such intention. In case of emergency,
unauthorized use, water waste, or where safety of water supply is endangered,
service may be discontinued or curtailed immediately without notice, in
addition to any other penalties provided by law and these regulations.
   H.   Abatement: During the period of discontinuance of service, habitation
of such premises by human beings shall constitute a public nuisance, whereupon
the county manager shall cause proceedings to be brought for the abatement of
the occupancy of said premises by human beings. In such event, a reasonable
attorney fee shall become due as a penalty for nonpayment.
   I.   Customer's Request For Discontinuance Of Service: A customer may have
service discontinued by giving not less than two (2) working days' advance
notice, in writing, to LCUD. Water base rates shall only be ceased for
"seasonal offs" lasting more than one billing period. Base fees for partial
months in seasonal off status will not be prorated. When the water is turned
back on, either the owner or agent must be present or the owner must provide
LCUD with written authorization to resume service without an owner
representative being present. LCUD will not be responsible for damage caused
from leaking or damaged plumbing.
   J.   Charges For Discontinuing And Resuming Service: Charges shall be made
for discontinuing and resuming service, as determined by the board.
      1.   When a discontinuance or resumption of service is made at other than
regular business hours, the charge for that service shall be actual cost to
LCUD, or at the rate established by the board.
      2.   If the use of equipment is necessary in discontinuing or resuming a
service, the customer shall be billed at an hourly rate on a time and materials
basis, in addition to the charge for the discontinuance or resumption of
service.
      3.   Service shall be considered to be disconnected when an employee of
LCUD has been dispatched for that purpose, and the rates, as established by the
board, will apply.
      4.   If an unauthorized connection is made to a public water system, the
owner or applicant will be charged a fee on a time and materials basis
associated with disconnection. Jumpers will be confiscated by LCUD and the
owner or person making the connection may be prosecuted under Nevada Revised
Statutes 704.800.

Works Association manual M14 with AWWA C506-84 Standards for Reduced Pressure
Principle and Double Check Valve Backflow Prevention Devices, including any
existing or future amendments.
      2.   Responsibility: The utilities director, or his designee, shall be
responsible for the protection of the public potable water system from
contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants
through the water service connection. If, in the judgment of said utilities
director, an approved backflow prevention assembly is required at the
customer's water service connection, or within the customer's private water
system, the utilities director or his designated agent shall give notice in
writing to said customer to install such an approved assembly(ies) at specific
locations on the customer's premises. Immediately upon receipt of the notice,
the customer shall install such assembly at the customer's sole expense.
Failure or refusal on the part of the consumer to make such installation and to
have such tested yearly or as required by LCUD by a certified CA/NV section
American Water Works Association (AWWA) tester and/or tester/agent approved by
LCUD's backflow administrator and maintained in good working order shall
constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such
requirements have been satisfactorily met.
      3.   Nonliability Of LCUD: LCUD shall not be responsible for any loss or
damage directly or indirectly resulting from or caused by the proper, improper,
or negligent installation, operation, use, repair, or maintenance of, or
interfering with, any protective device by any customer of LCUD or any other
person.
      4.   Shared Responsibility: Customers must share in the responsibility
for the protection of the potable water system. Customers must maintain their
water piping system so that pollutants do not backflow into LCUD's water mains.
It is also the customer's responsibility to report any possible hazard that may
affect LCUD's water mains. Reports should be made to the utilities director as
soon as a hazard is detected.
   B.   Backflow Definitions:
   APPROVED: Accepted by LCUD utilities director as meeting an applicable
specification contained in this chapter, or as suitable for the proposed use.
   AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY: Any water supply on or available to the premises
other than LCUD's approved public water supply and which is within LCUD's water
service area shall constitute an auxiliary water supply.
   APPROVED BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES: An assembly or means to prevent
backflow that has been manufactured, tested and approved in conformance with
the foundation.
   BACKFLOW: The reversal of normal flow of water caused by either back
pressure or back siphoning.
   CONTAMINATION: An impairment of the quality of the potable water by
materials to a degree which creates an actual or potential hazard to the public
health.
   CROSS CONNECTION: Any physical connection or arrangement of piping or
fixtures between two (2) otherwise separate piping systems, one of which
contains potable water and the other nonpotable water or industrial fluids of
questionable safety, through which, or because of which backflow may occur into
the potable water system.
   HAZARD, DEGREE OF: The term is derived from an evaluation of the potential
risk to public health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable
water system.
    Hazard, Health: Any condition, device, or practice in the water supply
system and its operation which could create or may create a danger to the
health and well being of the water consumer.
    Hazard, Pollution: An actual or potential threat to the physical properties
of the water system or the consumer's potable water system, which constitutes a
nuisance or is aesthetically objectionable or could cause damage to the system
or its appurtenances, but which is not dangerous to human health. (Ord. 504, 1-
18-2007) !DEFEND!
   C.   Requirements:

maintained by LCUD unless the water supply is protected as required by state
laws and regulations and section 9.07.04 of this title. Service of water to any
premises shall be discontinued by LCUD if a backflow prevention assembly has
been removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the
premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are
corrected. (Ord. 568, 7-3-2014)
         b.   The customer's system shall be open for inspection at all
reasonable times to authorized representatives of LCUD to determine whether
cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards exist. When such a
hazard becomes known, the utilities director may deny or discontinue service to
the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the
customer has corrected the condition(s) in conformance with state law and local
ordinances relating to plumbing and water supplies and any regulations adopted
pursuant thereto.
         c.   An approved backflow preventer shall be installed on each service
line to a customer's water system at or near the property line or immediately
inside the building being served; but, in all cases, before the first branch
line leading off the service line, wherever the following conditions exist:
            (1) In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply that
is not acceptable as an additional source, the public water system shall be
protected by installing an approved backflow preventer in the service line
appropriate to the degree of hazard.
            (2) In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any
other objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an
actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall
be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved
backflow preventer in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard.
            (3) In the case of premises having: a) an internal cross connection
that cannot be permanently corrected or controlled, or b) intricate plumbing
and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not
readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or
impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist, the
public water system shall be protected by installing an approved backflow
preventer in the service line at the owner's expense.
            (4) Any customer wishing to fill water trucks or other equipment
shall fill out an LCUD application for service and have that equipment
inspected and approved by a representative of LCUD. An approved air gap must be
installed before filling from the potable water supply. Violation of this
section shall result in discontinuance of service and a charge on a time and
materials basis for any corrective action needed.
      2.   Type Of Backflow Preventer: The type of backflow preventer required
shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists as follows:
         a.   Where there is an auxiliary water system, a minimum of a reduced
pressure principle assembly will be required.
         b.   Where there is any pollution hazard, the public water system
shall be protected with a minimum of an approved double check valve assembly.
         c.   Where there is any health hazard, the public water system shall
be protected by an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle
assembly. Hospitals, sewage treatment plants and structures with chemical
additives in fire sprinkler systems are examples of these type premises.
         d.   Where access is denied or is impossible or impractical to make a
cross connection survey, the public water supply shall be protected with an
approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle assembly.
      3.   Approval Required: Any backflow preventer required herein shall be a
model and size approved by the utilities director. Any below grade applications
must be approved by LCUD prior to installation.
      4.   Inspections:
         a.   It shall be the joint duty of LCUD and the customer at any
premises where backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have certified
inspections and operational tests made upon installation and at least once a
year thereafter, or as determined necessary by the LCUD. In those instances
where utilities director deems the hazard to be great enough, more frequent
tests may be required. All cross connection surveys and tests shall be
performed by CA/NV AWWA certified technicians preapproved by LCUD. The customer
shall bear the cost of the inspection, repairs and testing. Records of testing
and repairs shall be kept by LCUD when said work is completed.
         b.   All industrial, commercial, residential, multi-residential and
all other properties with backflow devices installed and requiring testing
according to this chapter shall provide access upon request to any authorized
representative of LCUD to perform such testing or provide acceptable test
results to LCUD from a CA/NV AWWA certified backflow tester, preapproved by
LCUD's utilities director, of the customer's choice.
      5.   Charges For Backflow Testing: Charges for backflow testing/repairs
performed by LCUD shall be a minimum rate, or actual cost, labor and materials,
as established by the board.
      6.   Exclusions: All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies
which do not meet the requirements of this section, but which were approved
devices for the purposes described herein at the time of installation and which
have been properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance
requirements, be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the
utilities director is satisfied that they will protect the public water system.
Whenever such device is moved, removed, or requires more than minimum
maintenance or when LCUD finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to
health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow prevention assembly
meeting the requirements of this section. Any plumbing improvements requiring a
building permit will require that the rules of this chapter be observed. (Ord.

Details For The Lyon County Utilities Water And Sewer System", and the current
"Lyon County Ordinance And Development Standards".
         b.   Every building or industrial facility must be separately
connected to the public sewer main with a private building sewer line. One or
more existing buildings located on a single lot or parcel belonging to the same
owner may be served with the same private sewer line during the period of said
ownership. Upon the subsequent subdivision, parceling or dividing of said
parcel or ownership thereof, the portion not directly connected to a public
sewer shall sever and properly cap the connection to the jointly used private
sewer line, install a private building sewer line and lateral and connect
directly to the public sewer. Any proposed new buildings to be used as "mother-

Private pumping systems and related infrastructure are to be privately
maintained.
         d.   Building private sewer lines with the lateral connection below
the manhole rim of the immediate upstream manhole of the public sewer shall
provide at the owner's expense such protective devices in the private sewer
building line as may be necessary to protect owner against flooding. The LCUD
shall not be responsible for any damages from flood or damages caused by flow
to owner's buildings or property regardless of whether such facilities are
located below the hydraulic grade line of the public sewer.
      2.   Protection Of Excavation: All excavations for sewer installations
shall be adequately guarded with barricades or lights to protect the public

disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory
to the LCUD and the county or other person or agency having jurisdiction.
      3.   Approval Of Private Building Sewer Line And Lateral: Prior to any
service, a representative of the LCUD shall inspect and approve the connection
to the public sewer system. Prior to covering the private sewer building line
or lateral, the inspector shall determine compliance with approved plans and
LCUD specifications before approval and authorizing any service. Noncompliance
with plans or specifications shall be corrected prior to issuance of
certification of occupancy or service by the LCUD.
      4.   Permit Required: No unauthorized person shall excavate, make any
connection with or opening into, use, or disturb any public sewer or
appurtenance or perform any work on any building sewer without first obtaining
authorization from LCUD or the local purveyor, and when required a Lyon County

permit. (Ord. 507, 1-18-2007)
9.05.06: APPLICATION AND BILLING FOR REGULAR SEWER SERVICE:
   A.   Application: A property owner or his agent shall make application for
regular water service on a form provided by LCUD:
      1.   Purpose: The application is merely a written request for service on
a form provided by LCUD and does not bind the applicant to take service;
neither does it bind LCUD to serve.
Sewer service will not be provided until all provisions related to state,
federal and local regulations and standards have been met.
   B.   Forms Of Application: A property owner or his agent shall make an
application for regular sewer service on the form provided.
   C.   Undertaking Of Applicant: Such application will signify the customer's
willingness and intention to comply with this chapter and other ordinances or
regulations relating to the regular sewer service and to make payment for sewer
service required.
   D.   Individual Liability For Joint Service: Two (2) or more persons who
join in one application for service shall be jointly and severally liable for
payment of bills and shall be billed by means of a single periodic bill.
   E.   Change In Customer's Equipment Or Operations: Before a customer makes
any material change in size, or operation resulting in significant increase in
volumes or wastewater characteristics, or extent of the equipment or operations
for which the LCUD's service is utilized, customer shall immediately file with
the LCUD a new application for additional service.
   F.   Special Cases: The LCUD will require a written contract or permit with
special guarantee from applicants whose unusual characteristics of load would
require excessive or special investment in facilities or whose requirements for
service are of a special nature. Pretreatment may be required and must be
approved by LCUD and NDEP and may require a separate industrial discharge
permit.
   G.   Payment For Previous Service: An application will not be honored unless
payment in full has been made for sewer and other services previously rendered
to the applicant by the LCUD.
   H.   Connection To System Required Within Three Hundred Sixty Five Days Of
Application: Any application that has been accepted by the LCUD may be
considered vacated if the applicant fails to commence construction and
connection to the LCUD's sewer system within three hundred sixty five (365)
days of such acceptance. The fees collected for such application shall be
returned to the applicant upon written request, and a new application and
payment of fees in effect at time of approval of application will be required
before service will be provided. No fees will be refunded after connection.
   I.   Changes In Use Or Uses Of Served Property: Any changes in the use or
uses of properties served by regular sewer service which may affect the service
classification under which it is served or the number of fixture units served
must have the prior approval of the LCUD. Examples of such changes would be
adding plumbing fixtures not previously approved in applying for service,
modifying a residence to accommodate more single-family units than were
approved or such other changes that would similarly change the character of the
building. Such changes in use shall be subject to then current standards and
the fee resolution in effect at time of application approval. Payment of such
fees shall be made upon application. If such change is made without
application, it shall be subject to the corrective measures and current fees.
   J.   Connection Charges: Connection fees shall be collected at the time of
issuing the permit for a sewer connection. Connection fees shall be charged at
the rate in effect on the day of application. Connections not made or
construction not started within three hundred sixty five (365) days will be
subject to reapplication and the current rates in effect at the time of
reapplication. Previously paid connection fees shall be credited to the new
connection fee rate.
      1.   Unit Charges: Sewer connection fees are based on fixture unit counts
for commercial use and one EDU for residential use. Each unit of multi- family
or multiple dwellings on a single parcel shall constitute a separate unit.
      2.   Remodeling Connection Charges: If remodeling necessitates upsizing
of the water meter, sewer connection fees shall be charged equal to the fee for
the upgraded meter size as described in subsection J.1. of this section minus:
a) the total in sewer connection fees paid to the LCUD previously or b) sewer
connection fees for the difference between the old fixture unit count and the
new fixture unit count on commercial service, whichever results in the lower
net additional connection charges.
      3.   Plan Check Fee: Any person requiring approval of plans by the LCUD,
or desiring plan checking, shall pay to the LCUD a plan checking fee as
established by the LCUD and board accepted by resolution. Each plan revision
requiring rechecking shall necessitate the charge of an additional plan check
fee per the Lyon County fee resolution. Plan checking is performed for water
and sewer concurrently.
   K.   Subdivisions:
      1.   Plan Check Fee: Any person requiring approval of plans by the LCUD,
or desiring plan checking shall pay to the LCUD the following fee or fees. Plan
checking fees shall be invoiced at a rate to reimburse direct costs, labor and
materials as determined by LCUD as contained in the current fee resolution.
If any portion of the plans after being checked, are required to be redrawn or
rechecked, the applicant shall pay the additional cost of checking based upon
the actual expense of the rechecking labor and materials, as determined by the
LCUD. Plans will not be released until all fees have been paid.
Encroachment permit applications are available in the office of the LCUD and
are to be filled out by the engineer submitting the plan. Plan checking is
performed for water and sewer concurrently.
      2.   Plan Checking Application: A record owner or his agent may make
application for plan checking service on the form established by the LCUD for
the purpose intended.
      3.   County Or Other Permits: The applicant is responsible to apply for
and obtain any required county road cut, NDOT encroachment or other required
permits.
      4.   Notice To Customer: Notice to a customer will normally be in writing
and will be delivered or mailed to the customer's last known address. In
emergencies, or when circumstances warrant, the LCUD where feasible, will
endeavor to promptly notify the customer affected and may make such
notification orally, either in person or by telephone.
      5.   Notice From Customers: A customer may make notification in writing
to the LCUD at its utilities office or through e-mail. If a customer uses e-
mail for notification, the customer must keep a printed copy showing LCUD
received the notice. (Ord. 507, 1-18-2007; amd. Ord. 622, 12-16-2021)
9.05.07: APPLICATION FOR SERVICE WHEN MAIN EXTENSION OR CAPACITY ENHANCEMENT IS
REQUIRED:
   A.   Application: Any owner of one or more lots or parcels, or subdivider of
a tract of land, desiring the extension of one or more mains to serve such
property, and/or for any capacity enhancement of existing facilities shall
submit an application with six (6) complete sets of plans to the Lyon County
planning department, two (2) sets of plans to the LCUD, a copy of the
application, and any needed studies will be sent to LCUD, such application to
contain the legal description of the property to be served and tract number,
flow models, location of the proposed connection and any additional information
which may be required by LCUD, or Lyon County. Costs shall be borne by the
applicant for surveys or engineering services, including engineering or
potholing to determine location of existing utilities, or the costs of
extensions and/or capacity enhancement. Refer to Lyon County development
standards, "Standard Details And Specifications For Public Works Construction".
Design with plan and profile by a civil engineer registered in Nevada are
required for all main line development. Installation must be by a Nevada and
Lyon County licensed contractor.
   B.   Investigation: Upon receipt of an application for a main extension, the
LCUD engineer shall make an investigation and review of the proposed extension
and/or capacity enhancement.
   C.   Ruling: The director shall thereupon consider the application for main
extension and the report thereon and after such consideration reject or approve
it.
   D.   LCUD Lines: All sewer main extensions and/or capacity enhancement shall
be in accordance with the Lyon County utilities sewer ordinance, "Standard
Specifications For Public Works Construction" and "Lyon County Standard
Details". Main lines shall be and remain the property of the LCUD or the local
purveyor for the area.
   E.   LCUD Extension: The LCUD will inspect all main extensions and/or
capacity enhancement installations.
   F.   Determination: The cost of such extension shall be borne by the
applicant, subject to the reimbursement agreement provided in subsection G of
this section, unless the board determines it is in the best interest of the
LCUD to advance such costs.
   G.   Reimbursement Agreement: If the applicant must extend the sewer line
system through another's property or along the frontages of another's property
or along the frontages of various intermediate property owners, and if said
properties are not currently served by the county's sewer system, then said
intermediate and benefiting property owners shall be responsible when
development commences or connection is made for a pro rata share of the costs
of the sewer line extension.
When the applicant is required to extend a sewer line, he shall "front end" the
entire cost of the sewer line construction and shall be responsible for the
actual construction of said sewer line. Any owners of properties to be served
by the extended sewer line will thereafter be responsible for reimbursing the
first property owner for a pro rata share of the costs of the sewer line system
at the time said subsequent owners begin to plat, parcel, develop or build upon
their parcels.
The pro rata shares for the applicant and all subsequent owners benefited by
the extended sewer line shall be determined prior to the county entering into
the reimbursement agreement. Extensions and/or capacity upgrade financed by the
applicant shall be prorated to the linear footage along the extension. Flag
lots and large parcels with narrow frontage may be calculated by a percentage
of the parcel square footage in relation to the main line installation cost
percentage.
The county shall collect a fifteen percent (15%) administrative fee from the
applicant who front ended the sewer line construction upon reimbursement by
deducting the fifteen percent (15%) administrative fee from the subsequent
owners' pro rata share prior to reimbursement to the applicant by the county.
The reimbursement agreement shall become null and void ten (10) years from the
date of board of county commissioners' approval.
The applicant shall submit three (3) bids prior to construction from qualified
contractors attached to the application for reimbursement, unless due to
extraordinary circumstances three (3) bids are not available due to specialized
construction. The bids shall be itemized and include costs for all items to be
installed (i.e., pipe, manholes, etc.). Failure to provide the itemized bids
will exempt the installation from reimbursement. Construction costs eligible
for reimbursement are limited to engineering, contractor's bid, construction
staking by an engineer or surveyor, permit, inspection and testing fees. The
applicant's administration costs are not eligible for reimbursement.
Single-family homes on property zoned single-family existing at the time of
application for a reimbursement agreement shall be exempt from the provisions
of the agreement. When an existing single-family home is on a parcel which has
adequate area to be divided per the current zoning or master plan designation
of the parcel, the area which could be divided for new development will be
required to be included in the reimbursement agreement. In no event shall any
owners of the property to be served by such extended sewer lines be permitted
to connect thereto without first paying to the applicant or the county the pro
rata share of the costs described above as well as all other fees required by
the county.
Any facilities installed pursuant to this section are the property of the LCUD
upon inspection and acceptance of the county and LCUD. A one year warranty
agreement period is in effect for the contractor to be responsible for repairs.
      1.   Participation By LCUD: Should LCUD require an oversized sewer line,
LCUD will reimburse the applicant for the costs for materials only of the
additional sewer line size as long as said line is greater than ten inches
(10") in diameter. The applicant shall be responsible for the cost of the size
of mains up to and including ten inches (10") or larger if needed for the
project, whichever is greater.
When the LCUD agrees to pay for an increase in sewer line size, at least three
(3) bids, signed and prepared by a contractor, shall be required which show the
comparable cost of the incremental increase. LCUD shall select the proposal
most beneficial to it. The LCUD reserves the right to reject the bids if the
cost differentials exceed prices paid by the LCUD on similar installations. In
no event shall LCUD pay more than the lowest proposal presented. Prior to
construction, the applicant shall submit three (3) bids from qualified
contractors attached to the application for participation, unless due to
extraordinary circumstances three (3) bids are not available due to specialized
construction.
For LCUD to reimburse an applicant for any utility upgrades, approval must be
obtained, an agreement signed and the lowest of three (3) bids approved. LCUD
is not obligated or required to participate in any costs, any reimbursement is
at the discretion of LCUD, and is for out of the ordinary situations only. In
no event shall LCUD pay more than the lowest proposal presented. Bids shall be
itemized and include cost differentials for all items to be included in the
reimbursement. Failure to provide the itemized bids will exempt the
installation from reimbursement.
   H.   Extension By Customer: In special cases where extension of the LCUD's
mains to a point adjacent to customer's premises is not feasible, in the
opinion of the LCUD, customer may obtain necessary easements and upon approval
of LCUD, lay service pipe, at his own expense, from point of use to point where
tap can be made directly to the LCUD's then existing main. This method of
installation will require encroachment permit approval and a possible annual
fee for private lines within the right of way. Easements from adjacent property
owners may be required. This method will be used only in emergencies or as a
last result. This method will only be used on a temporary basis if private
lines are running parallel to the road, or within the public rights of way or
public utility easement. Any damage because of the private line shall be the
responsibility of the line owner, Lyon County shall be held harmless, with no
costs incurred to the county.
   I.   Point Of Connection: LCUD shall be obligated to provide service at the
point of connection to its collection main lines only, and customer shall
assume all responsibility and cost for maintenance, operation and replacement
of his private sewer line and the flow therein.
   J.   Additional Facilities Required: If additional facilities, including,
but not limited to, a sewer pump, should be required in customer's private
sewer line to provide adequate customer service, beyond that normally provided
by the LCUD at point of connection of customer's private sewer line to the

connection with or opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer,
building drain or building sewer; and appurtenances thereto or perform any work
on any lateral or building sewer without first obtaining a written permit from
the LCUD. Any new construction, addition, remodel or demolition requiring
issuance of a Lyon County building permit shall require written approval and
final acceptance by an LCUD inspector.
   B.   Construction Requirements: Construction of building sewers and private
sewer lines shall be in accordance with the requirements hereof and other
current Lyon County standards. Conflicts in current codes will be resolved by
using the most stringent code, or at the discretion of LCUD.
   C.   Minimum Size And Slope: The minimum size of a building sewer shall be
four inches (4") in diameter unless discharging from a pressure system. The
building sewer, private sewer delivery system or all other portions of the
sewerage shall be four inches (4"), six inches (6"), or eight inches (8") in
diameter, as determined by the engineer of record, and approved by LCUD.
   D.   Separate Sewers: No two (2) adjacent buildings fronting on the same
street shall be permitted to join in the use of the same private building sewer
line or lateral. Every building or industrial facility must be separately
connected to a public sewer if such public sewer exists in the street upon
which the property abuts or in an easement which will serve said property.
However, upon approval of LCUD, one or more buildings located on a lot or
parcel of land belonging to the same record owner may be served with the same
private sewer main line during the period of said ownership. Upon the
subsequent subdivision of said lot and sale of a portion thereof, the portion
not directly connected to public sewer shall have a new private lateral and
building line installed and connect directly to the public sewer main. It shall
be unlawful for the record owner thereof to continue to use or maintain such
indirect connection. Joint use sewers shall only be approved in the case of a
multi-family complex, or commercial complex that has a private main line for
collection. Any private main lines are privately maintained. Ownership shall be
as stated above, unless easements and agreements are created between commercial
or multi-family owners, approved by LCUD. Customer must record the agreement
with the county recorder's office. A main line is classified as six inches (6")
and above, and shall connect with the county main with a manhole.
   E.   Old Building Sewers: Old building sewers may be used in connection with
new buildings only when they have been video inspected and tested and are found
to meet all requirements of the LCUD and engineer of record. The inspector must
approve their use. Any sewer not used shall be properly capped at the
connection to the main. The capping must be inspected by LCUD or the local
purveyor. If street work is required for the capping, the owner will be
required to get an encroachment permit.
   F.   Cleanouts: Cleanouts shall be provided and privately maintained in the
private building sewer at a location three feet (3') outside the foundation
wall of the building. Cleanouts shall be constructed as per Lyon County
standard details, the adopted uniform plumbing code and where the building
sewer crosses a property line. All cleanouts shall be maintained watertight,
with plug enclosure and covered with a concrete box with a steel lid marked
"sewer" and set to finished surface grade.
   G.   Sewer Too Low, Individual Sewage Pump Stations (ISPS): In all buildings
or properties in which the plumbing systems are too low to permit gravity flow
to the public sewer, domestic wastewater carried by the building sewer shall be
lifted by artificial means and discharged to the public sewer at the expense of
the owner. Design of the system shall be by the owner's project engineer and
approved by LCUD. Installation shall be approved by the inspector. Location of
the pump and related equipment is to be on private property, not in the right
of way, or public utility easement. A backwater device shall be installed and
maintained by the customer in building sewers serving fixtures at a lower
elevation than the overflow rim of the upstream manhole of the sewer to which
it discharges. The LCUD reserves the right to have sewer pump stations
inspected and tested when deemed by the utilities director to be a potential
hazard to public health or the environment. The LCUD shall determine the
inspection and testing frequency. Maintenance will be done at the owner's
expense. All ISPSs must be approved by LCUD and all backwater devices must be
accessible for maintenance and repair.
   H.   Abandonment Of Private Sewer Disposal (Septic) System: The LCUD will
not authorize a customer to extend and connect customer's private sewer
disposal system (septic system) to the LCUD's main.
Abandonment of any failed or unused septic system shall be done in accordance
with the uniform plumbing code, state health and Lyon County requirements.
Under no circumstance will an abandoned private sewer disposal system be
allowed to stay in service with any connection to the county sewer system. Any
parcel connecting to the county sewer shall properly abandon the existing
septic system.
The costs incurred for the abandonment and connection to the sewer shall be the
responsibility of the record owner and the connection shall be at the location
specified or approved by the LCUD.
All water and sewer testing is required to comply with federal, state and local
regulations, laws or ordinances and shall be at the expense of the applicant.
   I.   Backflow Prevention Devices: The LCUD may refuse or discontinue service
to any premises where a cross connection to a source of water supply exists.
   J.   Maintenance: The LCUD will not be responsible for the installation and
maintenance of the sewer or waste lines beyond the point of connection of the
private sewer lateral to the public sewer (see subsection K of this section).
It shall be the owner's and/or customer's responsibility to verify that
fixtures and piping conform to the requirements of all state, county or
municipal ordinances, laws, codes and regulations and be properly maintained.
   K.   Connection To Public Sewer:
      1.   Connection Point Provided: The connection of the building sewer and
private sewer delivery system into the public sewer shall be made at a point
where the lateral and building sewer meets the county sewer main line. The wye
branch, lateral and building line are the customer's responsibility for
maintenance and repair.

approved by the LCUD.
      3.   Installation Standards: The connection to public sewer shall be
installed in accordance with all rules, regulations and standards of LCUD.
      4.   Connection Point: All building sewers, laterals and private mains
are the responsibility of the property owner to the connection at the main
sewer including the wye, tee or saddle.
      5.   Backwater Valve Required: Where any fixture in a structure is lower
than the overflow rim of the upstream manhole or end of line cleanout, an
approved backwater valve must be installed on the building sewer service line.
   L.   Protection Of Excavation: All excavations for sewer installations shall
be adequately guarded with barricades and/or lights so as to protect the public
from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other property disturbed in the
course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the LCUD and
the county or any other entity or person having jurisdiction.
   M.   Maintenance Of Building Sewer: Building sewers to point of connection
to public sewer (wye connection on main) shall be maintained by the record
owner served by that building sewer per subsection K of this section.
      1.   It is unlawful for any record owner of a house, building or property
connected to a public sewer to maintain the private sewer delivery system or
building sewer in a condition that is incapable of passing a test as specified
in subsection M3 of this section.
      2.   All private sewer delivery systems and building sewers, including
lines serving residential, multiple residential and commercial properties
connected to a public sewer shall be cleaned and tested as specified in
subsection M3 of this section prior to completion of the following events:

      3.   Air testing of existing private sewer delivery systems and building
sewers shall be completed as follows:
         a.   Install cleanouts to grade within three feet (3') outside of the
foundation wall and at property line, including box with metal lid marked
"sewer".
         b.   Testing from LCUD manholes is permissible if the sewer line ties
directly into the manhole. If the sewer line exceeds seventy five feet (75') in
length, use of the property line cleanout for testing is required. When testing
from an LCUD manhole, conformance with the approved safety methods is required.
         c.   Insert air test plug at foundation cleanout.
         d.   Insert an inflatable plug at the property line cleanout.
         e.   Pressurize the line to 3.5 pounds per square inch (psi). The line
shall be allowed a maximum loss in pressure of 0.5 psi in five (5) minutes. If
the loss exceeds 0.5 psi, the test may be attempted one additional time. A
second loss of pressure constitutes failure of the line.
         f.   Lines which fail the air pressure test shall be repaired or
replaced at the record owner's expense. The line shall be air pressure tested
following the repair or replacement.
         g.   Private sewer delivery systems and building sewers shall be left
operationally clean after air testing.
         h.   If access to private sewer delivery systems or building sewers at
the LCUD main is not available, testing will be between property line and
foundation cleanouts. Cleaning and video inspection must be performed on the
entire line from foundation cleanout to public sewer.
         i.   LCUD must witness all pressure tests.
      4.   The record owner of any house, building or property shall conduct
all cleaning and testing required at his sole expense and shall notify the LCUD
for inspection. Testing conducted without such notice shall not satisfy the
requirements of this section.
      5.   The utilities director shall have the authority to waive the
cleaning and testing requirements.
      6.   In the event that cleaning, testing, repair or replacement is
required at a time when weather conditions or excavation restrictions prohibit
such repairs, the utilities director may defer completion of the requirements
until such date as agreed upon between the record owner and the LCUD. If the
test is deferred, the record owner shall post a performance bond or cash
deposit with the LCUD in an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of
the engineer's estimate of the cost of replacing the building sewer or private
sewer delivery system. In such an event, the testing requirements shall be
completed within a six (6) month period.
      7.   If any items in subsection M2 of this section applies, if the
property is being sold and weather conditions or excavation restrictions
prohibit testing, the record owner shall deposit escrow funds in the amount
equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the engineer's estimate of the
cost of replacing the private sewer delivery system. Funds held in escrow will
not be released without written notice by the LCUD to the title company holding
such funds. If the testing requirements are not completed by the time set by
this section, the funds held in escrow shall be released to the LCUD. The funds
shall be used by the LCUD for physical disconnection, testing, repair or
replacement of the private sewer delivery system. Should such costs exceed the
amount held in escrow, the difference shall be billed to the new owner of
record.
      8.   In the event a private sewer delivery system or building sewer does
not meet the standards set forth in subsections M3 and N of this section, the
record owner shall complete corrective work and testing shall be performed
within thirty (30) days from the date of the original test.
      9.   A state of Nevada licensed contractor shall be responsible for the
performance of all work connected with the cleaning and testing of private
sewer delivery systems. If the record owner chooses to perform the cleaning and
testing, he may do so by obtaining authorization from the LCUD. Contractors and
owners must post a certificate of insurance with the LCUD showing property
damage and public liability in an amount satisfactory to the LCUD.
      10.   Testing of private sewer delivery systems for common interest
developments shall be completed as follows:
         a.   All homeowners' and property owners' associations for common
interest developments are responsible for the cleaning and maintenance for the
building lines and laterals.
         b.   Each parcel or development applying for a permit shall include on
the site and utility plan the location of all existing and proposed private
sewer lines and appurtenant facilities, designating those sewer facilities
belonging to the association, sizes and lengths of pipes, location of cleanouts
and types of pipe. Said plans shall also show the location of proposed new
cleanouts, where necessary, in order to gain access to the private sewer
delivery systems and facilities. Prior to final approval of inspections a three
(3) mil Mylar drawing showing the above items shall be provided to LCUD.
         c.   Homeowners' and property owners' associations for common interest
developments may undertake a six (6) year program of testing and cleaning
private delivery systems, and may coordinate with LCUD for assistance in
keeping records and plans showing pertinent locations of on site facilities.
Each homeowners' or property owners' association choosing to undertake and
participate in the six (6) year maintenance program shall submit to the LCUD a
schedule of that year's proposed testing and cleaning program with a timetable
as to when actual work will take place. LCUD reserves the right to vary the
testing schedule in order to coordinate with the availability of LCUD
inspectors.

models and specifications, shall be examined by the LCUD who shall approve them
as filed or require them to be modified as necessary to meet all regulations
for proper installation. Refer to Lyon County development standards.
   C.   Easements Or Rights Of Way: In the event that an easement is required
for the extension of the public sewer or the making of connections, the
applicant shall procure, have recorded and have accepted by LCUD a proper
easement or grant of right of way sufficient in law to allow the laying and
maintenance of such extension or connection. Easements or rights of way are
reserved for the servicing of utilities, and no structure or building shall be
placed within or over easements or rights of way, nor shall these areas be
occupied or used in any manner as to restrict or deny access for repairs to
maintenance, and all costs of removing or replacing land surfaces, landscaping
or other occupancies shall be charged to the property record owner.
In order to preserve the health, safety and welfare of the residents within the
LCUD service area, and in order to comply with the environmental protection
agency's safe drinking water act/surface water treatment rule and the clean

separation that shall be maintained between water lines and sewer, storm drain
and reclaimed water lines. Measurement shall be from outside edge of pipes.
Minimum horizontal separation from all other utilities shall be five feet (5').
All natural and constructed obstructions in aforementioned rights of way shall
be subject to the provisions set forth herein.
All new construction, remodeling, restoration and further development on any
parcel shall incorporate the provisions as set forth herein.
   D.   Mitigation Of Encroachments Onto Easements And Rights Of Way: Lyon
County and the LCUD may accommodate, by means of direct negotiations leading to
the execution of an encroachment agreement (that may include a yearly fee for
county owned right of way encroachment), extenuating circumstances where
conditions of clear necessity or historical occupation or use are present.
Encroachment agreements approved and executed shall be recorded. Absent
explicit language to the contrary, by entering into any encroachment agreement,
the LCUD does not surrender a claim to title nor control of operations;
furthermore, absent explicit language in the encroachment agreement to the
contrary, the LCUD shall not incur any additional cost by reason of existing or
constructed privately owned improvements. The county, LCUD, county retained
contractors or other professionals on a bid contract shall be held harmless,
with no cost to the county or LCUD for any damage to encroachments during
maintenance on utility lines and infrastructure within the easement. The above
hold harmless clause does not include any blatant acts of carelessness or
activities outside normal legal parameters.
   E.   Persons Authorized To Perform Work: Only properly licensed contractors
shall be authorized to perform the work of public sewer construction within
Lyon County. The LCUD will not accept dedication of any public sewer
construction, or portions thereof, unless the construction has been performed
by the holder of a class A contractor's license issued by the Nevada state
contractors board and a current Lyon County business license. The licensed
contractor shall sign for and pick up the permit, or authorization issued by
the county or LCUD. All terms and conditions of the permit issued by the county
and/or LCUD to the applicant shall be binding on the contractor. The
requirements of this section shall apply to building sewers and private sewer
lines, laterals and mains installed concurrently with public sewer
construction. Owners, developers or others without proper licensing may not be
issued the permit for right of way, or public utility construction.
No person, other than employees of the LCUD, persons contracting to do work for
the LCUD, or maintenance workers of the LCUD, shall construct or cause to be
constructed, or alter or cause to be altered, any public sewer, lateral sewer,
house connection or industrial connection sewer over six inches (6") in
diameter, sewage pumping plant, pollution control plant, or other sewerage
facility within the LCUD service area where existing or proposed wastewater
flows will discharge directly or indirectly to facilities of the county without
first obtaining approval of sewerage construction plans from LCUD and obtaining
a construction permit.

electronic funds transfers presented in payment of bills which are returned by
a bank shall be treated as though no payment had been made, and an
administrative charge as established by the board will be levied by the LCUD,
plus any additional charges levied by the bank. Redemption of returned checks
may be required to be by cash or equivalent. The customer must reimburse the
LCUD for any returned check/electronic funds transfer fees charged by a bank to
the LCUD.

of said protest which shall not be later than thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt of same and cause the protesters to be notified thereof.
Upon the hearing, the board may adjust the sewer charge if it is satisfied with
the reasons and basis of the protest. Action taken on any protest shall be
entered in the minutes of the board.
The protester shall have fifteen (15) calendar days after determination of the
protest by the board within which to pay his/her sewer charge before any

the sewer is dangerous to public health and safety or may cause damage to the
POTW, service may be discontinued or curtailed immediately without notice.
      3.   For Infiltration Or Illegal Connections: Where negligence,
infiltration, illegal connection or discharge of harmful wastes into the
collection system, on or from a customer's premises occurs, LCUD may make such

without payment of connection fees, going through the permit process, or has
altered the sewer service for unauthorized use, the service to that customer
may be discontinued without notice and charges may be filed under Nevada
Revised Statutes 704.800. The LCUD will not restore service to such customer
until that customer has complied with the requirements of the LCUD and the LCUD
has been reimbursed for the full amount of the service rendered and the actual
cost of the LCUD incurred by reason of the fraudulent use. If the customer
fails to reimburse LCUD for all costs for services provided by fraudulent use

permit; otherwise, the LCUD will endeavor to make the reconnection on the next
business day following the day the request is made.
      2.   Other Than Regular Business Hours: When a customer has requested the
reconnection at a time outside of regular business hours, the LCUD will
reasonably endeavor to so make the reconnection if practicable under the
circumstances, but will be under no obligation to do so, unless an emergency
exists. A charge based on costs, including overtime rates, shall be billed to
the customer for services rendered outside of regular business hours.

will not serve an applicant until it has determined that all conditions of
fraudulent use or practice have been corrected.
         f.   When the collection system or treatment facilities do not have
capacity or the capability to receive and treat liquid waste as required by
federal, state and/or local government requirements.
      2.   Notification To Customers: When an applicant is refused service
under the provisions of this subsection D, the LCUD will notify the applicant

creating cost in excess of the value of their sewer service charges when the
concentration of BOD5 and TSS exceed the following:
      BOD5   - 275 mg/l
      TSS   - 200 mg/l
   The treatment surcharge is based on the appropriate county sewerage system's
total maintenance, operation, and capital expenditures for providing industrial
wastewater collection, treatment and disposal services as described in section
9.06.33 of this chapter. The annual industrial wastewater treatment surcharge
is computed by the following formula:
   Rate (in $/1,000 gallons of water consumption) =
   {'{'}(R1 + [(R2)(C2)(8.34)]/1000 + [(R3)(C3)(8.34)]/1000{'}'}/1000(Z)
   Where:
      R1   =   Unit costs associated with wastewater flow in $/MG per year.
      R2   =   Unit costs associated with BOD5 in $/1,000 lb. per year.
      R3   =   Unit costs associated with TSS in $/1,000 lb. per year.
      C2   =   BOD5 concentration in mg/l.
      C3   =   TSS concentration in mg/l.
      Z   =   The estimated ratio between wastewater flow and water
consumption.
   B.   The quantity for total flow is the quantity of water measured at the
water meter. Where no meter exists, the surcharge will be calculated based on
nine hundred fifty (950) gallons per month per fixture unit.
   The quantities for BOD5 and TSS for certain classes of users shall be based
on typical strengths as listed herein:
 
                            BOD5 (mg/l)   Total Suspended
                                           Solids (mg/l)
                                         
Commercial laundry              450          240
Hotel with dining facilities    500          300
Mortuaries                      800          800
Restaurants                     1,000        300
Wholesale bakery                1,000        600
 
   The quantities of BOD5 and TSS for other industrial discharges are
established by sampling and analysis as specified by the ECA in the permit
issued pursuant to sections 9.06.02 through 9.06.20 of this chapter. (Ord. 505,

Notes
  1. Private systems, general improvement districts, special districts and
  cities may recognize codes, design standards and details that are different
1 from what is cited in this chapter. Developers must contact those local
  service providers to determine what development standards will apply to
  developments within the boundaries of the specific service area.
9.07.01: GENERAL INFORMATION:
   A.   Water And Sewer: Water and sewer mains shall be extended for the
following:
      1.   Parcel map development with a property line within four hundred feet
(400') of an existing water or sewer main or as otherwise required in these
standards. Prior to recording a parcel map, the owner/developer shall submit
improvement plans to the service provider and the Lyon County engineer. The
owner/developer shall be responsible for the construction of the water and/or
sewer mains. A licensed class A contractor must be used for water/sewer
infrastructure installation.
      2.   Water and sewer mains shall be extended the entire frontage(s) of
the parcel unless engineering analysis determines it is physically impossible
to do so or it is determined by the service provider that further extension of
the main beyond the parcel can never occur or it is not necessary for
continuity of the system. In such cases, the length of extension shall be
determined by the service provider or designee. Construction of a single-family
residence on a parcel not associated with a subdivision, planned unit
development (PUD) or parcel map development and currently served by an existing
main shall not require extension of the main(s). Construction of a single-
family residence on a corner lot not associated with a subdivision, PUD or
parcel map development shall require extension along one street frontage only.
      3.   The owner or developer will supply a water model that will identify
possible locations of insufficient capacity. Any shortfalls will be addressed
by the developer's engineer. The developer shall be responsible for main
extensions when the design capacity of existing mains is less than that
required to serve a development. Mains shall be extended when existing mains
are physically inaccessible to maintenance crews and equipment, as determined
by the service provider.
      4.   For the purposes of administering these standards for main
extensions and replacements, "developments" are defined as follows:
         a.   Subdivisions, PUDs, parcel map developments;
         b.   New building construction;
         c.   Multi-family, commercial and industrial additions or remodels,
which may result in an increase in the historical water usage or sewer
contribution for the parcel.
      5.   Reclaimed water mains shall not be required to be extended if the
parcel does not receive connection. Connection to reclaimed water mains
requires the developer to obtain approval from local, state agencies and the
service provider.
   B.   Reimbursement Agreements: The owner/developer may apply to the service
provider for future reimbursement from adjacent property owners, which connect
to the main extension per the provisions established by the service provider.
The service provider shall process the developer's application and, upon
approval of a reimbursement agreement by the respective board, the agreement
shall be administered by the respective board.
   C.   Participation In Oversizing Mains: When the oversizing of mains has
been requested by the service provider, the development shall participate in
the installation of oversized water and sewer mains as per the provisions of
this code. (Ord. 506, 1-18-2007)

manhole. Dry sewers which shall be extended at a future date and installed
without a manhole shall be certified as built for line and grade by a Nevada
professional engineer or land surveyor prior to backfill. A cleanout may be
required by the service provider.
         f.   Prior to any extension or connection to the existing system, a
mechanical type pipe plug must be installed in a manhole to prevent flows from
entering existing system from new system until new system has been tested and
accepted. Service provider will inspect all plug installations.

9.07.05: GREASE INTERCEPTION AND TRASH CONTAINMENT:
   A.   Policy and procedure for approval of grease interceptors and trash
containment drain systems related to food service establishments is presented
in this section.
   B.   All new food service establishments or those being remodeled are
required to:
      1.   Install a grease interceptor sized in accordance with the uniform
plumbing code, appendix H, but must be a minimum of seven hundred fifty (750)
gallons;
      2.   Submit plumbing plans depicting all sewer lines discharging to or
bypassing the grease interceptor; and
      3.   Submit, in writing, to the service provider, all calculations
required by the uniform plumbing code, appendix H, for sizing of the
interceptor as prepared by a Nevada licensed civil engineer.
   C.   Grease interceptors must be easily accessible at all times. If the
interceptor is placed in a drive-through lane, it is the owner's responsibility
to stop the flow of traffic during the inspection. This will be a condition of
the owner's industrial wastewater discharge permit.
   Note: Garbage disposals are prohibited in food establishments.
   D.   All new food establishments are required to install a floor drain in
the outside trash containment pad for cleanup purposes and must comply as
follows:
      1.   This drain must discharge to an approved grease interceptor.
      2.   Plans must reflect proper design and grading to ensure that only the
containment pad area water is captured by this floor drain.
      3.   The design must ensure that surface drainage (i.e., storm water or
irrigation runoff) from other areas does not discharge to this floor drain.
      4.   The pad cannot exceed six hundred (600) square feet unless it is
covered.
      5.   Design of this drainage system must be reviewed and approved by the
service provider.
      6.   During abnormally high precipitation or flooding, it is the owner's
responsibility to temporarily block this drain. This will be a condition of the
owner's industrial wastewater discharge permit.
      7.   It is the applicant's responsibility to ensure grading is completed
per the approved plans. Corrections due to construction errors are the
responsibility of the applicant and must be completed as a condition of the
industrial wastewater discharge permit.
   E.   The applicant shall submit plans to the building department and the
local service provider. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, the
applicant shall comply with the conditions of this policy. (Ord. 506, 1-18-
2007)
9.07.06: SAND/OIL INTERCEPTION AND CONTAINMENT:
   A.   Policy and procedure for approval of sand/oil interceptors and

applicants requesting building permits regarding any business utilizing wash
pads or having the potential to discharge petroleum products or excessive
suspended solids to the public sewer system.
      1.   It is the applicant's responsibility to ensure grading is completed
per the approved plans. Corrections due to construction errors are the
responsibility of the applicant and must be completed as a condition of the
industrial wastewater discharge permit.
   B.   The applicant shall submit plans to the building department and the
local service provider. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, the
applicant shall comply with the conditions of this policy. (Ord. 506, 1-18-
2007)
9.07.07: INDUSTRIAL PRETREATMENT PROGRAM1:
An industrial wastewater discharge permit is issued to each business which
prohibits the discharge of pollutants in excess of federally approved,
technically based local limits. The service provider samples wastewater from
these businesses to determine if they are in compliance with the permit
conditions. Enforcement actions are taken when necessary in accordance with the
federally approved emergency response plan and emergency response guide.
Authority for these actions are provided in this code, through NDEP and 40 CFR.
In addition to this program, is the requirement for, and enforcement of,
secondary containment. Any business that stores a product, new or used, that
has the potential to contaminate soil or ground water must provide a secondary
containment system that will prevent any leak or spill from adversely impacting
the environment. (Ord. 506, 1-18-2007)
9.07.08: WELLHEAD PROTECTION:
All new construction shall comply with the requirements of the Lyon County
wellhead protection ordinance. Examples of certain uses not permitted within
one hundred fifty feet (150') of a public wellhead supplying potable water to

The two appraisers at the top of the list will be chosen by the county manager
to appraise the property the county is intending to sell or lease. The one
appraiser at the top of the list will be chosen by the county manager to
appraise the property the county is intending to purchase. The appraisers
chosen must submit a proposal with a time frame of less than three months, a
fee quote, their qualification for the particular assignment and a statement
that they do not have a conflict in appraising the property.
A conflict is created when the appraiser or a person related to the appraiser
within the third degree of consanguinity or affinity has an interest in the
property or property adjoining the property to be appraised. If an appraiser
cannot meet these requirements the appraiser is considered not qualified for
the appraisal and the county manager may pick the next appraiser on the list.

RIGHT TO FARM
SECTION:
15.20.01: Purpose
15.20.02: Intent
15.20.03: Nuisance
15.20.04: Disclosure Statement
15.20.01: PURPOSE:
   A.   The right to farm all land is recognized to exist as a natural right
and is also ordained to exist as a permitted use everywhere in the County
except where expressly prohibited under this title, subject only to State
Health and Sanitary Codes.
   B.   It is the declared policy of Lyon County to conserve and protect
agricultural land, agricultural irrigation water rights and agricultural
operations, and to encourage sustainable agricultural operations within the
County. It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to reduce the loss to the
County of its viable agricultural land by limiting circumstances under which
agricultural operations may be considered a nuisance, consistent with Nevada
Revised Statutes 40.140. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.20.02: INTENT:
   A.   This chapter defines and limits cases in which agricultural operations
may be perceived a nuisance. It includes a disclosure notice to prospective
property buyers, notifying them that if the property they are purchasing is
adjacent to agricultural land, they may be subjected to certain inconveniences
associated with normal agricultural operations and that special setbacks may be
required on the property.
   B.   The right to farm includes, but is not limited to, the right to engage
in all of the "agricultural operations" defined in this chapter. This right to
farm shall also include the right to use land for agricultural production and
grazing by animals, in addition to agricultural products processing
transportation sales and distribution and distribution. The foregoing uses and
activities included in the right to farm, when necessary for the particular
farming, livestock, fowl or crop production, and when conducted in accordance
with generally accepted agricultural practices, may occur on holidays,
Saturdays, Sundays and weekdays, twenty four (24) hours a day, and the traffic,
noise, odors, dust, fumes and other disturbances that are caused by such
activities are also specifically permitted as part of the exercise of this
right. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.20.03: NUISANCE:
   A.   No present or future agricultural operation or any of its appurtenances
conducted or maintained for commercial purposes and in a manner consistent with
proper and accepted customs and standards of the agricultural industry on
agricultural land or commercial land shall be deemed a nuisance, due to any
changed condition of the use of adjacent land and water rights appropriated for
that land in or about the locality thereof; provided, that the provisions of
this section shall not apply whenever a nuisance results from the negligent or
improper operation of any such agricultural operation and its appurtenances or
if the agricultural activity or appurtenances obstruct the free passage or use
in the customary manner of any navigable lake, stream, river, canal or basin or
any public park, square, street or highway. Consistent with Nevada Revised
Statutes 40.140(2), it is presumed that an agricultural activity which does not
violate a Federal, State or local law, ordinance or regulation constitutes good
agricultural practice consistent with proper and accepted customs and standards
of the agricultural industry.
   B.   It is expressly found that whatever nuisance may be caused to others by
such uses and activities so conducted is more than offset by the economic and
social benefits from farming to the local and State economy, community
aesthetics, and to society in general, by the preservation of open space, the
beauty of the countryside and clean air, the provision for continual local
economic growth and by the preservation and continuance of farming operations
in this County and the State as a source of agricultural products for this and
future generations.
   C.   As a condition of approval of any subdivision or parcel map of any land
in Lyon County, the owners or developers of such land and their heirs, assigns
and successors, shall agree to provide notice to any and all subsequent
purchasers of the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes 40.140 and this
chapter. Such notice shall include a signed acknowledgment on all land
development maps.
   D.   If a landowner or resident believes that an agricultural operation is
not being conducted or maintained in a manner consistent with proper or
accepted customs and standards of the agricultural industry, the landowner or
resident may submit a complaint to the department using the procedures
described in chapter 15 of this title. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.20.04: DISCLOSURE STATEMENT:
   A.   Every seller of any real property in Lyon County, either directly or
through his/her authorized agent shall provide to any prospective buyer a
written disclosure statement advising the buyer of the existence of a right to
farm ordinance enacted by Lyon County. Such disclosure statement shall contain
or be accompanied by a copy of the ordinance codified herein or successor, and
statement that intensive agricultural operations may be conducted on
agricultural and other land within the County. The disclosure statement shall
be substantially in the form promulgated by the Board, or their designee. The
written disclosure statement shall include any agricultural setback
requirements and water rights use restrictions applicable to the property. The
buyer shall sign a copy of the written disclosure statement acknowledging
receipt of the disclosure and accompanying documents and deliver the signed
copy to the seller or his/her authorized agent. The seller or his/her
authorized agent shall retain the copy of the disclosure statement executed by
buyer in the escrow process.
   B.   The disclosure statement shall contain substantially the following
language:
Lyon County has determined that the highest and best use for agricultural land
as defined below is to develop or preserve said lands for the purposes of
agricultural operations and it will not consider the inconveniences or
discomforts arising from or related to agricultural operations to be a
perceived nuisance if such operations are legal, consistent with accepted
customs and standards and operated in a non-negligent manner.
If property you own or may purchase in the future is located adjacent, near, or
close to agricultural lands or within agricultural lands, including agriculture
land easements, irrigation ditch easements, drain ditch easements, or
agricultural products processing facilities, you may be subject to
inconveniences or discomfort arising from agricultural operations. These may
include but are not limited to the spraying, cleaning, and maintenance of
irrigation water delivery systems as well as traffic, noise, odors, dust,
chemicals, smoke, insects, operation of machinery (during any 24-hour period),
aircraft operation, and storage and disposal of agriculture by-products,
including manure. One or more of the inconveniences described above may occur
even in the case of an agricultural operation, which is in conformance with
existing laws and regulations and locally accepted customs and standards. If
you live near an agricultural production area and/or agriculture products
facility, you should be prepared to accept such inconveniences or discomfort as
a normal and necessary aspect of living in a County with a strong rural
character and a healthy agricultural sector. You are prohibited from
interfering with or in any way obstructing agricultural operations, including,
for example, tampering with irrigation delivery facilities, obstructing
irrigation ditches, and obstructing agricultural land easements.
For purposes of this notification:
Land surrounding your property may or may not be presently zoned or designated
on the General Plan for primary or substantial agricultural use, the land
contains an existing agricultural operation of a type that would be obvious to
an uninformed observer after a physical inspection of the property, and that
operation began at a time when such use was permissible.
"Agricultural Operation" means all activities relating to agricultural
production and use as defined in chapter 1200, "Appendix A - Glossary And
Definitions" of the Lyon County Code, as such may be amended from time to time
and shall include, but not be limited to, the cultivation and tillage of the
soil, lawful use of appropriated water rights for agricultural irrigation
purposes, including groundwater, as well as any agriculture irrigation water
delivery system maintenance and improvements, the burning of agricultural
waste, weeds and other debris or other agricultural burning, including ditches
and fields, lawful use of housing and transportation of labor for the purpose
of crop production, lawful use of temporary and permanent facilities for the
health, safety and welfare of agricultural workers, protection of crops and
livestock from pests (i.e., insects, diseases, weeds, predators) damaging or
which could potentially damage crops or livestock, the proper and lawful use of
agricultural inputs and chemicals, whether organic or conventional, including
but not limited to the ground and aerial (i.e., via aircraft) application of
crop protection products and fertilizers, fumigation, or the raising,
production, irrigation, pruning, harvesting, or processing of any living
organism, organically or conventionally, having value as an agricultural
commodity or product, and any commercial practices performed incident to or in
conjunction with such operations where the agricultural product is being
produced, including preparation for market, delivery to storage, processing and
packaging, and distribution to market, or to carriers for transportation to
market or processing of an agricultural commodity, and those buildings or
related facilities (no matter their zoning) that process, store, package and
distribute agriculture products.

This chapter provides procedures and requirements for the consideration of
density bonus and affordable housing agreements for the purposes specified in
and as authorized by Nevada Revised Statutes. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.115.02: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
All density bonus and affordable/attainable housing agreements filed with the
County shall be in compliance with the following:
   A.   Only a qualified applicant may file an application. A qualified
applicant is a person who has a legal or equitable interest in the real
property which is the subject of the agreement, or an authorized agent of a
person who has a legal or equitable interest. Where a density bonus agreement
is sought for affordable/attainable housing, the applicant must submit as part
of the density bonus agreement application documentation of participation in,
at a minimum, one of the Federal and/or State affordable/attainable housing
financial assistance program(s) as well as documentation of how the program(s)
will assist in providing affordable/attainable housing. The Director may
require an applicant to submit a title report or other evidence satisfactory to
the department to verify the applicant's interest in the real property and of
the authority of the agent to act for the applicant.
   B.   Where a density bonus or affordable/attainable housing request does not
involve an existing development, the application shall be filed concurrently
with all other development applications for the property.
   C.   The density bonus or affordable/attainable housing agreement may only
be requested for development projects consisting of ten (10) or more dwelling
units, prior to any density bonus being applied.
   D.   For the purposes of this chapter, a density bonus shall mean an
increase in residential density from that otherwise allowable under the zoning
(the base density) in return for provision of housing at affordable/attainable
levels or development carried out in accordance with the provisions of chapters
340 through 350 of this title, where an increase in density is authorized in
exchange for provision of a specific public benefit, such as limitations on
floodplain development or provision of public open space or creation of an
affordable housing development.
   E.   When determining the number of units which are affordable/attainable,
the density bonus shall not be included.
   F.   When calculating base density or density bonus numbers, any fractional
portion of a unit shall be rounded down.
   G.   For any density bonus or affordable/attainable housing agreement
approved under the provisions of this chapter, the developer shall agree to
ensure continued affordability of all restricted income density bonus units in
compliance with the Federal or State program providing financial assistance.
(Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.115.03: APPLICATION PROCEDURES:
   A.   An application for a density bonus or affordable/attainable housing
agreement shall be made on a form provided for that purpose by the department,
along with the required fee or deposit.
   B.   The application shall be accompanied by the original draft density
bonus or affordable/attainable housing agreement and any other submittal
materials listed on the application. The agreement shall be in the County
approved form (e.g., restricted covenant or other similar form acceptable to
the County) and may include the following provisions as well as any other
deemed necessary by the County during review of specific proposals:
      1.   The terms and conditions of the agreement shall run with the land,
which assures that the public benefit provided or certain of the units to be
developed on the land will be used solely by qualified occupants as affordable/
attainable housing, shall be binding upon all successors in interest of the
developer unless released and terminated by the County, and shall be recorded
in the Office of the County Recorder, prior to issuance of any building or
grading permits for the project;
      2.   The developer shall give the County or State the continuing right-
of-first-refusal to purchase or lease any or all of the designated affordable/
attainable housing units at the fair market value;
      3.   The deeds to the designated units shall contain a covenant stating
that the developer and his or her successors in interest shall not sell, rent,
lease, sublet, assign, or otherwise transfer any interest in the same without
the written approval of the County confirming that the sales price of the units
is consistent with the limits established for very low, low or moderate income
households, which shall be related to the annual medium income ("AMI") for a
family of four (4) in Lyon County, Nevada as determined by the United States
Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD");
      4.   The County shall have the authority to enter into other agreements
with the developer or purchasers of the dwelling units, as may be necessary to
assure that the required dwelling units are continuously occupied by eligible
households.
   C.   The department may require that the developer provide additional
information necessary for the Board to determine whether the density bonus
agreement is consistent with the objectives of the adopted master plan and any
applicable specific plan. This may include, but is not limited to, market
feasibility or absorption studies for the proposed project, evaluation of
conservation benefits or resource protections to be obtained. (Ord. 603, 11-1-
2018)
15.115.04: ACTION BY BOARD:
   A.   Upon receiving a recommendation from the department on a proposed
density bonus agreement, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The hearing
shall be set and notice given as prescribed in chapters 9 and 10 of this title.
The hearing may be continued from time to time.
   B.   Following the closing of a public hearing, the Board shall determine if
the density bonus agreement is consistent with the findings contained within
section
15.115.05 of this chapter. If determined to be consistent, the Board shall
introduce an ordinance adopting the density bonus agreement.
   C.   Following introduction, a second reading of the ordinance adopting the
agreement shall be held and based on the testimony provided at the hearing, the
ordinance shall be adopted, denied or continued. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.115.05: REQUIRED FINDINGS FOR APPROVAL:
Prior to taking an action to approve or recommend approval of a density bonus
or affordable housing agreement, the Board shall find as follows:
   A.   The proposed agreement is consistent with the maps and policies of the
master plan and any applicable specific plan;
   B.   The proposed agreement complies with the requirements of Nevada Revised
Statutes;
   C.   The granting of the proposed agreement will result in provision of
housing for persons with special needs, as identified in the County's
affordable housing element, or the permanent protection of natural resources or
lands of significant environmental value;
   D.   Where a density bonus is proposed, that the granting of the proposed
density bonus will not have an adverse impact on adjacent properties or on the
general public. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.115.06: ONGOING REVIEW:
The Board shall review all approved density bonus or affordable/attainable
housing agreements at least once every twenty four (24) months to determine
whether the applicant, or successor in interest thereto, is demonstrating good
faith compliance with the terms of the agreement. Review by the Board shall
occur until the project is complete. After the project is complete, the
department shall continue the ongoing review with the allowance to refer any
biennial review to the Board if deemed necessary by the Director. This review
process may require the submittal of an application form and materials as
established by the department. Ongoing review shall cease consistent with the
timeframes identified in subsection
15.115.02G of this chapter. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)

15.120.05: Findings For Approval
15.120.06: Enforcement
15.120.01: PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY:
The purpose of this chapter is to provide for agreements for reimbursement of
the costs of constructing capital improvements or public facilities which
result in a benefit to the community and subsequent development. (Ord. 603, 11-
1-2018)
15.120.02: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
When the owner or developer of property funds construction of capital
improvements or public facilities likely to be served by future or other
development, it may request, as part of its approval, that the County enter a
reimbursement agreement. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.120.03: APPLICATION PROCEDURE:
   A.   The request for reimbursement agreement shall be made and filed
together with the application for tentative subdivision, planned development or
specific plan approval. The Board or commission may permit a request for
reimbursement agreement to be filed following public hearings on the tentative
subdivision, planned development or specific plan if the hearings result in
imposition of conditions for approval that require the construction of
qualifying capital improvements or public facilities.
   B.   The request for reimbursement agreement shall include a definition of
the capital improvement or public facility, the cost, with support materials, a
reimbursement plan, a description of the benefit area and the parcels included
therein, and a method for determining the proportionate cost to be assessed
against such parcels, when developed. The appropriateness of the benefit area
boundary will be reviewed and approved by the department and other involved
County departments and changes or modifications to the suggested benefit area
may occur.
   C.   An application for a reimbursement agreement shall be made on a form
provided for that purpose by the department, along with any required fee or
deposit established by resolution.
   D.   The term of the reimbursement agreement shall not exceed ten (10) years
unless an alternative term is mutually agreed by the County and the owner or
developer. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.120.04: ACTION BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND BOARD:
   A.   The commission shall consider the request for reimbursement agreement
and the extent of the benefit area boundary in connection with its hearing on
the application for tentative approval of the subdivision, planned development
or specific plan, and determine if the capital improvement or public facility
is consistent with the master plan. If the commission makes such a finding and
recommends approval of the reimbursement agreement, then its recommendation
will be forwarded to the Board for action.
   B.   At the Board level, the public hearing on the request for reimbursement
agreement and the extent of the benefit area boundary may be held on the same
date as the application for tentative approval, but will be posted as a
separate item on the agenda, and separately noticed. In addition to the notice
otherwise required by section
15.09.01 of this title, notice and copies of the reimbursement plan shall be
served on the owners of the affected parcels, at least ten (10) days before the
hearing. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.120.05: FINDINGS FOR APPROVAL:
The decision whether to enter a reimbursement agreement is discretionary, and
nothing contained in this chapter is intended to vest enforceable rights to a
reimbursement agreement in any person. In determining whether to enter a
reimbursement agreement, the Board shall make affirmative findings as follows:
   A.   The cost of the capital improvement or public facility and the extent
of the benefit area boundary is reasonable and the reimbursement plan is fair
and equitable to the parcels to be charged thereunder.
   B.   Construction of the capital improvement or public facility is
consistent with the master plan and represents a substantial and measurable
benefit to the community.
   C.   There are adequate existing or appropriately planned resources for the
annual operation and maintenance of the facility.
   D.   The costs of administering the reimbursement agreement have been
advanced by the applicant and will not create an unreasonable burden of the
County disproportionate to the size of the project and the benefit to the
community. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.120.06: ENFORCEMENT:
Copies of the reimbursement agreement and plan shall be recorded against each
of the parcels within the approved benefit area in the Office of the Lyon
County Recorder and filed in the office of the department. When the owner of a
parcel included in the benefit area of the reimbursement plan applies for a
development permit for the parcel, he or she shall comply with the terms of the
reimbursement agreement as a condition of the issuance of a permit. (Ord. 603,
11-1-2018)

The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and limit the continued existence of
uses and structures lawfully established prior to the enactment of this title,
or any amendments, that do not conform ("nonconforming") to the provisions of
this title. Nonconforming uses may continue, but the provisions of this chapter
are designed to curtail substantial investment in nonconforming uses and
structures and, when necessary in order to preserve the integrity of this
title, to bring about their eventual elimination. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)

district in which is it located may be continued in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.
   B.   Normal maintenance and repair of nonconforming structures may be
performed.

land use district in which it is relocated. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.202.04: TERMINATION OF NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES:
   A.   When the active operation of a nonconforming use is discontinued or
abandoned for period of twelve (12) consecutive months, the use shall not be
reestablished or resumed. The active operation of a use is considered to be the
typical or normal activities associated with the use. A determination of
discontinuance or abandonment may be made where one or more of the following
conditions is documented for the twelve (12) months preceding the
determination:
      1.   Failure to maintain regular business hours, typical or normal for
the use; or
      2.   Failure to maintain required local, State or Federal licenses or
other approvals that would be required for the active operation of the use; or
      3.   Failure to maintain utilities which would be used for the active
operation of the use; or
      4.   Failure to pay taxes and fees required for the active operation of
the use.
   B.   A determination of discontinuance may not be made where the active
operation of a nonconforming use has been curtailed by:
      1.   Extensive rehabilitation of the property; or
      2.   Unique circumstances associated with repairs and alterations on
structures of historic value; or
      3.   Transfer of title delays caused by estate or probate issues; or
      4.   Delay caused by serious illness or injury of any owner that may
warrant special consideration on the basis of personal hardship; or
      5.   Market conditions that have impacted the ability to reoccupy or
reestablish a use within the twelve (12) month period.
      6.   In the case of a residential nonconforming use, the documented non-
use results from extended travel or temporary relocation of the owner or tenant
of the residence.
   C.   Nonconforming buildings which have been damaged or destroyed by natural
calamity may be repaired or reconstructed within one year from the date of
damage; provided, the repaired building is appropriate to the previous use.
(Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.202.05: NONCONFORMING ACCESSORY USES AND ACCESSORY STRUCTURES:
A nonconforming accessory use or accessory structure shall not continue after
the principal structure or use is terminated unless the structure or use
conforms to the provisions of the zoning district in which it is located. (Ord.
603, 11-1-2018)
15.202.06: NONCONFORMING LOTS:
   A.   When an existing nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all
of the regulations applicable to the intended use, except that the lot is
smaller than the required minimum lot area applicable to the zoning district,
the lot may be used as proposed.
   B.   When a use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming
in all other respects with the exception of applicable setback requirements,
the property owner may apply for a variance pursuant to chapter 203 of this
title.
   C.   If an undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins one or more other
undeveloped nonconforming lots in common ownership, a variance shall not be
granted if re-subdivision or lot merger to make both lots conforming can be
reasonably accomplished. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.202.07: AMORTIZATION OF NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES:
   A.   Upon a recommendation by the Director that a type of nonconforming
structure or use, or any specific nonconforming structure or use is detrimental
to the public health, safety or general welfare, the Board may adopt an
amortization schedule under which a nonconforming use or structure, or type of
nonconforming use or structure, may be gradually eliminated. The schedule shall
establish a timetable by which the nonconforming uses or structures shall be
eliminated or made conforming and be consistent with the following:
      1.   Following adoption of an amortization schedule covering a type of
nonconforming use or structure, or a particular nonconforming use or structure,
the Director may initiate amortization proceedings with respect to specific
uses or structures in the manner provided in this section. Any nonconforming
use or structure found to be detrimental to the public health, safety or
general welfare, may be ordered to be removed or the use discontinued in
accordance with the time frames established in the adopted amortization
schedule.
      2.   Upon failure of the property owner to carry out the order, the
County may take any steps necessary to remove such structure or discontinue the
use and assess the cost thereof against the property owner. (Ord. 603, 11-1-

accordance with chapter 7 of this title. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018; amd. Ord. 618,
9-2-2021)
15.203.06: FINDINGS FOR VARIANCES:
   A.   Minor Variance Findings: The Director must not approve a minor variance
unless undue hardship is self-evident and the following findings are made:
      1.   The granting of the variance will not substantially impair the
intent and purpose of this title or the goals, policies and objectives embodied
in the master plan;
      2.   The variance is not requested exclusively on the basis of economic
hardship to the applicant; and
      3.   The variance does not result in the establishment of a use not
permitted within the specific zoning district.
   B.   Major Variance Findings: The Board must not approve a major variance
unless it finds that:
      1.   By reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of the
property in question, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or
other extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of the property in
question, the strict application of the provisions of this title would result
in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to, or exceptional and undue
hardships upon, the applicant;
      2.   The circumstances or conditions do not apply generally to other
properties in the same land use district; and
      3.   The granting of the variance will not result in material damage or
prejudice to other properties in the vicinity, substantial impairment of
natural resources or be detrimental to the public health, safety and general
welfare. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018; amd. Ord. 618, 9-2-2021)
15.203.07: DECISION ON VARIANCE:
The Board must approve, conditionally approve or deny the application for major
variance. The Board may impose conditions in accordance with chapter 8 of this
title and section
15.203.08 of this chapter. Appeal of the Board's decision must be in accordance
with chapter 12 of this title. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018; amd. Ord. 618, 9-2-2021)
15.203.08: LIMITATIONS ON VARIANCE:
   A.   No minor or major variance shall be granted that allows a land use
prohibited in the zoning district in which it is located or that changes any
boundary of the district, nor shall any variance be granted that changes the
density of residential use or that changes the intensity of non-residential

specific plan land use designation in the master plan is required to establish
a statement of purpose or vision, and a set of goals, policies and development
guidelines designed to implement a coherent land development process that
complement and focus the more general goals and policies of the master plan by
addressing planning issues and objectives specific to the area identified as
specific plan. Where multiple specific plans may be necessary to implement
planned development of land designated specific plan, or subareas within an
area designated specific plan, the first specific plan in the series of plans
shall serve as the governing specific plan for the development of subsequent

15.221.01: DETERMINATION ON UNLISTED USES:
Lyon County may determine whether or not a use not specifically listed as
allowed in a particular zoning district (by right or a conditionally permitted)
may be deemed sufficiently similar to be allowed in a particular zoning
district, either by right or conditionally permitted. Such determination can
either be made administratively or through commission review of similarity of
the use to uses already listed in accordance with the following:

mentioned within any zone district, it shall be deemed to mean other uses
which, in the judgment of the Director as evidenced by a written decision, are
similar to and not more objectionable to the general welfare than those uses
specifically listed in the same district.
   B.   The determination on the acceptance of the proposed use will be issued
in the form of an administrative decision and the text of the Zoning Code will
not be changed through this determination. If approved, the administrative
decision would become the allowance for the proposed use to be included within
the requested zoning designation.
   C.   The Director may provide the administrative determination or may refer
the request for determination on an unlisted use to the commission. If the
administrative determination is referred to the commission, the Director shall
provide a recommendation for consideration in the referral.

15.230.07: Imposition Of Conditions
15.230.08: Maintenance Of Permit, Expiration And Revocation
15.230.01: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   Conditionally permitted uses are those uses which are generally
compatible with the land uses permitted by right in a given zoning district,
but which require individual review of their location, design and configuration
and the imposition of conditions to mitigate potential impacts of the use at a
particular location within a given zoning district.
   B.   Only those uses that are enumerated as conditionally permitted uses in
a particular zoning district shall be authorized unless a similar unlisted use
determination has been made per chapter 221 of this title. A conditional use
permit shall not be required for a use allowed as a permitted use in a given
zoning district. No conditionally permitted use may be established until a
conditional use permit is issued in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
   C.   Special use permits (SUP) approved prior to the effective date of this
title may continue as a conditional use without modification of the SUP
provided the following conditions are met:
      1.   The special use is/was in active use upon the effective date of this
title, and;
      2.   The special use has continued in active use in conformance with the
original conditions of approval.
Upon discontinuance of a use permitted as a special use for a period of one
year, the SUP shall be null and void, and the use shall not be reinstated or
expanded without approval of a conditional use permit in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.
   D.   Expansion or modification of a use previously permitted as a special
use will require approval of a new conditional use permit. Expansion or
extension of a lawfully created nonconforming use will require approval of a
conditional use permit. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018; Ord. 607, 9-19-2019)
15.230.02: LIMITS ON AUTHORITY:
   A.   A conditional use permit cannot be used in lieu of a variance to modify
or waive any of the regulations or standards prescribed for any use for which a
conditional use permit is required.
   B.   This provision does not prevent the property owner from concurrently
applying for a variance pursuant to chapter 203 of this title. (Ord. 603, 11-1-
2018)
15.230.03: STATUS OF CONDITIONALLY PERMITTED USES:
   A.   The designation of a use in a land use district as a conditionally
permitted use does not constitute an authorization or assurance that such use
will be approved.
   B.   Approval of a conditional use permit must authorize only the particular
use for which the permit is requested and issued.
   C.   No use authorized by a conditional use permit shall be enlarged,
extended, increased in intensity or relocated beyond the limit of the
conditional use permit unless an application is made to modify the conditional
use permit in accordance with the procedures set forth in this title.
   D.   Development of the use may not be carried out until the applicant has
secured all the permits and approvals required by this title, this Code, or
regional, State and Federal agencies. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.230.04: APPLICATION FOR CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT:

provided by the department. The department shall provide the applicant with
detailed information about specific submission requirements.
   B.   An application for a conditional use permit may be submitted by the
property owner or by an agent on the owner's behalf.
   C.   The application must be processed as provided in chapter 3 of this
title.
   D.   If the proposed use requires a division of land as provided in this
title, an application for a land division permit shall be submitted in
conjunction with the application for a conditional use permit. Approval of the
conditional use permit shall not become effective until final approval of the
land division permit; provided, that if the land division is proposed in
phases, the approval of the conditional use permit shall take effect upon final
approval of the phase of the land division containing the property on which the
conditionally permitted use is to be located. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.230.05: PROCEDURES FOR CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS:
   A.   The Director must submit a report to the commission containing the
required findings and recommendations for the conditional use permit request.
   B.   The commission must hold a public hearing not later than sixty five
(65) days after the application has been deemed complete unless a longer time
or a different process of review is provided in an agreement entered into
pursuant to chapter 110 of this title and Nevada Revised Statutes 278.0201.
Published and personal notice of the public hearing must be given in the manner
provided in chapter 9 of this title. The public hearing must be conducted in
accordance with chapter 10 of this title.
   C.   When a conditional use permit is associated with an application that
requires a hearing by the Board or on appeal, the application shall be
processed in accordance with chapter 7 of this title. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.230.06: FINDINGS:
When considering applications for a conditional use permit, the commission or
Board, where applicable, must evaluate the impact of the conditional use on and
its compatibility with surrounding properties and neighborhoods to mitigate
potential impacts of the use at a particular location and make the following
findings:
   A.   The proposed use at the specified location is consistent with the
policies embodied in the adopted master plan and the general purpose and intent
of the applicable district regulations;
   B.   The proposed use is compatible with the character and integrity of
adjacent development and neighborhoods and includes improvements or
modifications either on-site or within the public rights-of-way to mitigate
development related adverse impacts, such as traffic, noise, odors, visual
nuisances, or other similar adverse effects to adjacent development and
neighborhoods;
   C.   The proposed use will not generate vehicular traffic which cannot be
accommodated by the existing, planned or conditioned roadway infrastructure;
   D.   The proposed use incorporates roadway improvements, traffic control
devices or mechanisms, or access restrictions to control traffic flow or divert
traffic as needed to mitigate the development impacts;
   E.   The proposed use incorporates features to address adverse effects,
including visual impacts and noise, of the proposed conditional use on adjacent
properties;
   F.   The proposed conditional use complies with all additional standards
imposed on it by the particular provisions of this chapter and all other
requirements of this title applicable to the proposed conditional use and uses
within the applicable base zoning district, including but not limited to, the
adequate public facility policies of this title; and
   G.   The proposed conditional use will not be materially detrimental to the
public health, safety and welfare, and will not result in material damage or
prejudice to other properties in the vicinity. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.230.07: IMPOSITION OF CONDITIONS:
In approving a conditional use permit, the commission or Board may impose
conditions deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the approval would be
in compliance with the findings required by section
15.230.06, "Findings", of this chapter, and to preserve the public health,
safety, and general welfare. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.230.08: MAINTENANCE OF PERMIT, EXPIRATION AND REVOCATION:
   A.   The approval timeframe of a conditional use permit shall be consistent
with the timeframes allowed within chapter 13 of this title, unless additional
time is granted based upon consideration of the specific circumstances of the
project. If the conditional use has not been established within the allowed
timeframes, the conditional use permit shall be null and void and such use
shall not be made of the property except upon the granting of a new conditional
use permit.
   B.   A conditional use permit is void one year after the activity granted by
such conditional use permit is discontinued.
   C.   If a conditional use permit is determined to be in violation, the
approval may be subject to revocation, per chapter 14 of this title or
amendment by the final decision making body.
   D.   A conditional use permit may be modified or amended in accordance with
the provisions of section
15.12.04 of this title. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)

15.231.04: REVIEW BY DIRECTOR:
The Director may periodically review any HO/HBB to ensure that it is being
operated in a manner consistent with the conditions of operation and in a
manner which is not detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or
materially injurious to properties in the vicinity. If, after review, the
Director deems that there is sufficient evidence to warrant a full examination,
then a public hearing date shall be set. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.231.05: MODIFICATION OR REVOCATION BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION:

on the operator's compliance with this chapter. Such notice shall be sent by
certified mail and shall state that the commission will be reviewing the HO/HBB
for possible modification or revocation. It shall also state the date, time and
place of the hearing. The public hearing shall be conducted and notice given in
accordance with chapters 9 and 10 of this title.
   B.   The Director shall investigate the evidence and prepare a report to the
commission regarding the reported violation of the HO/HBB requirements. A copy
of the report shall be sent to the operator of the home occupation or business.
Upon conclusion of the hearing per chapter 6 of this title, the commission
shall make one of the following determinations and take such accompanying
action:
      1.   Find that the home occupation or home based business is being
conducted in an appropriate manner and that no action to modify or revoke the
permit is necessary; or
      2.   Find that the home occupation or home based business is not being
conducted in an appropriate manner and impose modifications or conditions as
are necessary to mitigate previously unforeseen impacts upon the surrounding
neighborhood; or,
      3.   Find that the HO or HBB is not being conducted in an appropriate

15.234.06: Expiration Of Permits
15.234.07: Fees
15.234.01: SITE IMPROVEMENT PERMITS DEFINED:
A site improvement permit authorizes on-site construction over private property
for single family detached residential subdivisions and multifamily (more than
3 dwelling units) developments prior to the issuance of a permit to construct a
building, and may include improvements within a public roadway associated with
the on-site construction such as site grading, installation of public
utilities, drainage improvements, road improvements including curbs, sidewalks
and related features, up to and including building pad certification. The site
improvement permit is a separate permit which expedites the construction
process for larger developments. A building permit may be issued instead of a
site improvement permit when the building permit submittal includes all on-site
construction work described above in this paragraph. Any work within abutting
rights-of-way requires separate encroachment permits. For detached single
family residential developments, a final subdivision map must be processed
concurrent with an application of a site improvement permit for the detached
single family residential development. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018; amd. Ord. 607, 9-
19-2019; Ord. 633, 1-3-2023)
15.234.02: PERMITS REQUIRED:
A site improvement permit is required for work, including grading, trenching,
or construction of public or private utilities, drainage structures or roads
unless the work is allowed under an existing building permit. (Ord. 603, 11-1-
2018)

      5.   Exploration, extraction and processing of minerals and construction
materials;
      6.   Work specifically approved under a building permit or encroachment
permit issued under this chapter.
   B.   Exemption from the permit requirements of this title does not grant
authorization for any work to be done in any manner in violation of the
provisions of this title or any other laws or ordinances of this jurisdiction.
(Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.234.04: SITE IMPROVEMENT PERMIT PROCEDURES:
   A.   The property owner or his authorized representative must tender a
completed site improvement permit application to the department on a form
furnished by the department. The application must contain the following
information:
      1.   A description of the work to be covered by the permit.
      2.   A legal description of the land on which the proposed work is to be
done, street address or similar description that identifies and definitely
locates the proposed work.
      3.   The application must be accompanied by grading plans, improvement
plans, diagrams, studies, computations and specifications and other data drawn
to scale and clarity to indicate the location, nature and extent of the work
proposed and show in detail that it will conform to the provisions of this
title and all relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.
      4.   An itemized engineer's estimated value of work, signed, stamped and
dated by a Nevada professional engineer where plans, studies or computations
are required to be prepared by a Nevada professional engineer, or an itemized
contractor's executed contract with estimated value of work, signed and dated
with the contractor's license number and limit. A site improvements surety
approved by the District Attorney or a cash deposit to cover one hundred fifty
percent (150%) of the engineer's estimated value of work based on the full
required improvements ("bond") shall be submitted with the application and be
reviewed and approved by the County Engineer prior to commencement of work.
      5.   The signature of the property owner and the applicant or applicant's
authorized representative.
   B.   A site improvement permit may include all site improvements including,
but not limited to grading, utility installation, drainage improvements, and
road construction. The application, plans, specifications, computations and
other data filed by an applicant for a permit must be reviewed by the Director,
the County Engineer, the Utilities Director, the Road Superintendent, and the
Fire Chief of the appropriate Fire District or their respective designees. The
plans shall be reviewed by other departments of this jurisdiction and agencies
to verify compliance with any applicable laws under their jurisdiction. If the
Director finds that the work described in an application for a permit and the
plans, specifications and other data filed with the application conform to the
requirements of this title, other pertinent laws and ordinances, that the plans
have been signed by all responsible agencies where applicable, that security
has been posted, and that all required fees have been paid, the Director shall

   F.   The site improvements surety bond will be held for one year from the
date of issuance of the Certificate of Completion for the site improvements to
guarantee the quality of the site improvements before being scheduled before
the Board of Commissioners for release. At the end of one year, the site
improvements surety bond will be replaced by a maintenance bond in the amount
of ten percent (10%) of the cost of construction estimate. The maintenance bond
will be held by the County for one year after the date of conversion from the
site improvements bond to the maintenance bond. After the County Engineer has
inspected and deemed the improvements to have been maintained properly, then
the ten percent (10%) maintenance bond may be scheduled before the Board of
Commissioners for release.
   G.   If site improvements are completed, inspected and verified as installed
to the satisfaction of the Road Superintendent, Utilities Department Director,
Community Development Director and County Engineer prior to recording of a
Record of Survey for commercial or industrial subdivisions), then a maintenance
bond in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the cost of construction estimate is
required with a Certificate of Completion signed by the County Engineer. Once
the final Record of Survey for commercial or industrial subdivisions has
recorded and after the County Engineer has inspected and deemed the
improvements to have been maintained properly, then the ten percent (10%)
maintenance bond may be scheduled before the Board of Commissioners for
release. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018; amd. Ord. 607, 9-19-2019)

the project engineer of record shall provide the County with a digital copy of
all required "as- builts" plans with PDF and DWG (or shape) files containing
the line work for all constructed public utilities and road construction that
are rectified (geo-registered, tied to a grid based coordinate system) drawings
with cross-referenced drawings attached to the AutoCAD file and provide the
scale factor used to coordinate the ground coordinates to grid coordinates.
(Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.234.06: EXPIRATION OF PERMITS:
   A.   Every site improvement permit issued by the department under the
provisions of this title will expire and become void if the work authorized by
the permit is not commenced within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date
of the permit, or if the work authorized by the permit is suspended or
abandoned at any time after the work is commenced for a period of one hundred
eighty (180) days. Before any work can be recommenced, a new permit must be
first obtained and a fee in the amount of one-half (1/2) that required for a
new permit for the work, provided no changes have been made or will be made in
the original plans and specifications for the work, the plans were approved
under the prevailing Development Code provisions, and that any suspension or
abandonment has not exceeded one year. In order to renew action on a permit
after expiration, the permittee must obtain a new permit for the work and pay a
new full permit fee.
   B.   Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an extension of
the time within which work may commence under that permit when the permittee is
unable to commence work within the time required by this section for good and
satisfactory reason. The Director may extend the time for action by the
permittee for a period not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days on written
request by the permittee showing that circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee have prevented action from being taken. No permit may be extended
more than once.

of adjacent development and neighborhoods and includes improvements or
modifications either on-site or within the public rights-of-way to mitigate
development related adverse impacts, such as traffic, noise, odors, visual
nuisances, or other similar adverse effects to adjacent development and
neighborhoods;
   C.   The proposed development will not generate vehicular traffic which
cannot be accommodated by the existing, planned or conditioned roadway
infrastructure;
   D.   The proposed development incorporates roadway improvements, traffic
control devices, mechanisms or access restrictions to control traffic flow or
divert traffic as needed to mitigate the development impacts;
   E.   The proposed development incorporates features to address adverse
effects, including visual impacts, of the proposed development on adjacent
properties;
   F.   The proposed development complies with all additional standards imposed
on it by the particular provisions of this title, the Lyon County Design
Criteria and Improvement Standards and all other requirements of this title
applicable to the proposed development and uses within the applicable base
zoning district, including but not limited to, the adequate public facility
policies of chapter 110 of this title; and
   G.   The proposed development will not be materially detrimental to the
public health, safety, and welfare, or result in material damage or prejudice
to other properties in the vicinity. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.235.05: DECISION ON DESIGN REVIEW AND APPEAL:
   A.   The Director shall approve, deny or conditionally approve the design
review within thirty (30) working days of the design review application being
deemed complete in accordance with chapter 3 of this title. Appeal of the
Director's decision shall be to the Planning Commission.
   B.   The Director, in his sole discretion may refer a design review
application for review and decision by the commission in lieu of rendering a
decision. In such event, the commission shall consider the design review at a
public hearing and render its decision in accordance with chapter 6 of this
title. Appeal shall be to the Board in accordance with section

evaluated using the following standards:
      1.   Aesthetic:
         a.   New towers and attached equipment shall have and maintain a non-
reflective surface, be a neutral color that blends in with the surrounding
background or that is the same or similar color as the supporting structure to
make the tower, antennas and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as
possible, or if required by the FAA, be painted pursuant to the FAA's
requirements;
         b.   If collocation on an existing tower is requested, the design of
any antenna(s), accessory structures or equipment shall, to the extent
possible, use materials, colors and textures that will match the existing tower
or non-tower structure to which the equipment of the collocating provider is
being attached;
         c.   If collocation on an existing non-tower structure is requested,
the antenna(s) and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment shall be a
neutral color that is the same as the color as the supporting structure so as
to make the antenna(s) and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as
possible.
      2.   Setbacks: Setbacks shall conform to the requirements of section
15.236.04, table 15.236-1 of this chapter.
      3.   Tower Spacing: Towers shall be required to be spaced, at a minimum
the distance equivalent to the height of the tallest tower, plus the radial
distance from the center of the nearest tower to its furthest guywire.
      4.   Tower Height: No tower shall exceed the maximum height listed in
section
15.236.04, table 15.236-1 of this chapter - however, that an additional fifty
feet (50') may be approved as part of the design review upon a finding by the
decision making body that the additional height is necessary and substantiated
by technical documentation showing that the additional height is necessary to
provide the proposed level of service and coverage, or to accomplish
collocation as provided in section
15.236.09 of this chapter.
      5.   Lighting: No lighting shall be permitted on a tower except as
required by the FAA.
      6.   Fencing And Security: For security purposes, towers and ancillary
facilities shall be enclosed by a minimum six foot (6') fence.

of baffling, barriers or other suitable means to reduce the sound level
measured at the property line to fifty (50) dBA (day)/forty (40) dBA (night)
when adjacent to residential and commercial land uses and seventy five (75) dBA
(day)/sixty (60) dBA (night) when adjacent to other uses. This requirement is
waived for joint-use telecommunication facilities sharing a common site
surrounded by public lands with jurisdictional administration and review by the
Federal or State government.
   C.   Other Requirements: At the time a provider requests a building permit,
it must demonstrate compliance to all applicable State and Federal regulations.

   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this requirement is to create a process that
will allow providers to equitably share publicly- available, non-proprietary
information among themselves, with interested persons and agencies, and with
the County, at the time the provider schedules a pre-application conference
with the approval authority. This collocation protocol is designed to increase
the likelihood that all reasonable opportunities for collocation have been
investigated and the appropriate information has been shared among providers.
The County recognizes that collocation is preferable, where technologically
feasible and visually desirable, as a matter of public policy, but that
collocation of antennas by providers is not always feasible for technical or
business reasons. However, if all licensed providers are made aware of any
pending tower or antenna permit requests, such disclosure will allow providers
to have the maximum amount of time to consider possible collocation
opportunities, and will also assure the County that all reasonable
accommodations for collocation have been investigated. This chapter creates
strong incentives for collocation because proposals for collocation qualify for
a less rigorous approval process.
   B.   Applicability: Requirements for the collocation protocol apply only to
new towers subject to site development review or conditional use.
   C.   Pre-Application Requirement: A pre-application review is required for
all proposed freestanding towers.
   D.   Collocation Request Letter Requirement: At the time a pre- application
review is scheduled, the applicant shall demonstrate that the following notice
was mailed to all other wireless communication providers operating wireless
communications facilities within the County's boundaries:
Pursuant to the requirements of 15.236.09, [name of wireless provider] is
hereby providing you with notice of our intent to meet with representatives of
the Lyon County in a pre-application conference to discuss the location a new
free-standing wireless communication facility that would be located at
[location]. In general, we plan to construct a [type of tower] of [number] feet
in height for the purpose of providing [cellular, PCS] service.
Please inform us whether your company has any existing or pending wireless
facilities located within [distance] of the proposed facility, that may be
available for possible collocation opportunities. Please provide us with this
information within 10 business days after the date of this letter. Your
cooperation is appreciated.
Sincerely [Name of pre-application applicant].
   E.   Applicant's Obligation To Analyze Feasibility Of Collocation: If a
response to a collocation request letter is received by an applicant indicating
an opportunity for collocation on an existing tower of another provider, the
applicant shall make a good faith effort to analyze the feasibility of
collocation. This analysis shall be submitted with an application for a
freestanding tower. A good faith effort to investigate the feasibility of
collocation on an existing facility shall be deemed to have occurred if the
applicant submits all of the following information:
      1.   A statement from a qualified engineer indicating whether the
necessary service can or cannot be provided by collocation at the potential
collocation site;
      2.   Evidence that lessor of the potential collocation site either agrees
or disagrees to collocation on his/her property;
      3.   Evidence that adequate site area exists or does not exist at the
potential collocation site to accommodate ancillary equipment for the second
provider and still meet all of the development standards required in the base
zone;
      4.   Evidence that adequate access does or does not exist at the possible
collocation site.
   F.   Result Of Collocation Feasibility Analysis: If the applicant has
provided information addressing each of the criteria in subsection E of this
section, the collocation protocol shall be deemed complete. The applicant's
tower shall then be permitted subject to the applicable standards and
restrictions contained in this chapter. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.236.10: ABANDONED FACILITIES:
   A.   Abandonment Defined: A wireless communication facility which has been
discontinued for a period of one year or longer is hereby declared abandoned.
   B.   Removal Of Abandoned Facilities: Abandoned facilities as defined in
subsection A of this section shall be removed by the property owner within
ninety (90) days from date of abandonment. A demolition permit shall be
obtained from the Lyon County Building Department prior to removal of the
abandoned facility. Failure to remove an abandoned facility is declared a
public nuisance and is subject to penalties per chapter 15 of this title.
   C.   Extension: Upon written application, prior to the expiration of the one
year (discontinued period) period, the Director may, in writing, grant a one
year extension for reuse of the facility. Additional extensions beyond the one
year extension may be granted by the Director or may be referred on to the
commission, subject to any conditions required to bring the project or facility
into compliance with current regulation(s) and make it compatible with
surrounding development. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)

CHARACTER DISTRICTS AND ZONING DISTRICTS
SECTION:
15.300.01: Character Districts; Rural, Suburbanizing, Historic And General
County
15.300.02: Rural Districts
15.300.03: Suburbanizing Districts
15.300.04: Historic Districts
15.300.05: Future Planning Areas
15.300.06: General County
15.300.07: Zoning Districts
15.300.01: CHARACTER DISTRICTS; RURAL, SUBURBANIZING, HISTORIC AND GENERAL
COUNTY:
Character Districts are a product of, and are delineated on maps adopted in the
Lyon County Comprehensive Master Plan. The Character Districts help define,
maintain, or enhance desired character of development or intensity in
particular areas of the County.
They control and modify the land use designations to achieve the type and
character of development desired in communities. A community may have one or
more Character Districts within its boundary. The following Character Districts
are described in the sections that follow:
   Rural Districts,
   Suburbanizing Districts,
   Historic Districts,
   Future plan areas, and
   General County.
For a complete description of Character Districts and land use designations see
the Lyon County Comprehensive Master Plan - Countywide Component, chapter 3,
Land Use, Economy and Growth. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018; amd. Ord. 607, 9-19-2019)
15.300.02: RURAL DISTRICTS:
Rural Districts include those areas that are predominately undeveloped open
space, in agricultural or resource-based use, or very low-density residential
development with limited neighborhood commercial uses. Zoning district
requirements and the Lyon County development standards reflect the "rural"
character of the area. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018; amd. Ord. 607, 9-19-2019)
15.300.03: SUBURBANIZING DISTRICTS:
Suburbanizing Districts include those areas that are predominately medium to
high-density residential development with regional/community commercial,
neighborhood residential and commercial uses, and industrial and employment
uses. Zoning district requirements and the Lyon County development standards
for uses within this Character District reflect the "suburban" character of
these areas and include requirements for Municipal water and sewer, roadway
design appropriate to the planned land uses, landscaping of public areas, and
pedestrian facilities (sidewalks and paths). (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018; amd. Ord.
607, 9-19-2019)
15.300.04: HISTORIC DISTRICTS:
Historic Districts include those areas in and around lands included in the
Comstock Historic District, including Silver City and portions of the Dayton
area, or other future historic designations to preserve existing historic
character or to promote "historic" architectural design elements. Future
Historic Districts may also be designated where the intent is to promote new
compatible development that is in keeping with the "historic" development
patterns and architectural design elements to create more vitality. Tools might
include mixed-use, design guidelines and conservation easements. (Ord. 603, 11-
1-2018; amd. Ord. 607, 9-19-2019)
15.300.05: FUTURE PLANNING AREAS:
Lands in locations where future development may occur, but where additional
planning is necessary because of factors such as large common ownership,
topography, current lack of infrastructure, joint planning areas or other
factors are present which require additional and/or more focused planning
efforts. (Ord. 607, 9-19-2019)
15.300.06: GENERAL COUNTY:
Lands outside the boundaries of defined community boundaries are classified as
General County. These lands are rural, resource or public lands, and are
intended to remain largely undeveloped or with very low intensity development
within the Master Plan's planning horizon. The development standards applicable
to General County lands are the same as those for Rural Character Districts.
(Ord. 603, 11-1-2018; amd. Ord. 607, 9-19-2019)
15.300.07: ZONING DISTRICTS:
Lyon County is divided into zoning districts in order to classify, regulate and
restrict the location of trade and industry, the location of buildings
designated for specific uses, to protect residential uses, to regulate and
limit the height and bulk of buildings hereafter erected or altered, to
regulate and limit the intensity of the use of lot areas, and to regulate and
determine the areas of yards and open space within and surrounding such
buildings.
The zones, listed in
table 15.300-1 of this section, are intended to guide development and
redevelopment within Lyon County's seven (7) unincorporated communities. The
zoning regulations are intended to preserve and enhance the existing character
of these communities while allowing the opportunity for residents to grow- in-
place.

15.312.08: RESIDENTIAL MIXED-USE (RMU):
   A.   Purpose: This zone is intended for the development of higher- density
residential areas with a variety of housing options, including small lot
subdivisions when part of a planned development or attached or detached multi-
family units, condominiums, townhouses, apartments, or live-work units in a
traditional town or suburban setting located near major transportation
facilities, supporting commercial and commercial mixed-uses, civic uses, and
parks. This district has a minimum net parcel size of four thousand five
hundred (4,500) square feet with six thousand (6,000) square foot minimum
average, and a maximum density of eighteen (18) units per acre. Secondary uses
within this zone are open space, parks, pathways, schools, and other public
uses. The RMU Zone implements the suburban residential land use designation of
the Master Plan in Suburban Character Districts.
RMU development provides a mix of complementary designed and located
residential uses, including single-family and multifamily uses, attached and
detached, condominiums and special living facilities, with the opportunity for
retail and services as subservient uses on a project and district level (less
than 20 percent of total development). The RMU development should strive to
achieve project sites designed for pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle access and
circulation and connections to the adjacent land uses. It should also create
public focal points and activity centers and provide a sense of community for
the occupants and the neighborhood.

   F.   Miscellaneous Requirements:
      1.   The intent of the Mixed Use Residential District is to provide a mix
of residential and commercial uses within one project and throughout the
district. To accomplish this while providing flexibility of design, two (2)
development options are offered:
         a.   Residential development (100 percent) - commercial provision. The
proposed development shall provide for both residential uses and commercial use
(s). The commercial portion of the development may occupy up to a maximum of
twenty percent (20%) of the project site or floor area. When twenty percent
(20%) of the site is dedicated for commercial use, the residential component of
the project is allowed to be built out at a density equivalent to one hundred
percent (100%) of the gross site.
         b.   Mix and location of uses.
            (1)   All RMU development, except those meeting the criteria below
for infill development, shall provide a mix of residential unit types. A
maximum of thirty percent (30%) of any one type of residential units is
allowed. Residential units incorporating home occupations shall not count as a
separate unit type.
            (2)   Up to twenty percent (20%) of the acreage of the RMU
development may be devoted to commercial uses (not including home occupations).
            (3)   Except for home occupations, commercial uses that are
included shall be located along collectors, at corners, or adjacent/across from
common open spaces.
            (4)   Infill development within the RMU District. Where an existing
parcel within the RMU District is one acre or less, development projects may
consist of a single residential unit type or a combination residential and
commercial mix consistent with the development standards contained in this
title.
         c.   Pedestrian connections shall be made from residential uses along
all major streets and from homes to all common open spaces and to all civic and
public uses and landmarks. Pedestrian connections that cannot be made as
sidewalks along vehicle lanes shall be made as alternative access easements
such as trails.
         d.   A hierarchy of interconnected streets that form a grid pattern
shall be provided in any RMU development, including major collectors
(boulevards), local streets, and alleys. In local street patterns, walkable
blocks of five hundred (500) linear feet or less are required.
         e.   New RMU developments must connect to existing neighboring
developments where connections are provided and must provide new connections to
future neighboring developments.
         f.   Street standards shall be consistent with Lyon County Development
Standards.
         g.   The Public Works Director may allow for a reduction of local
street width to forty one feet (41'), based on a cross-section of two (2) 10-
foot vehicle lanes, two (2) 6-inch curbs, two (2) 5- foot planting/utility
strips, and two (2) 5-foot sidewalks.
         h.   Parallel parking may be provided on one or both sides of local
and major streets.
         i.   All RMU developments shall meet parking standards of chapter 401
of this title. Shared parking is encouraged where participating users have
differing peak parking hours. The Director may reduce parking requirements,
when a parking study prepared by a professional transportation engineer
indicates that a reduction in parking will cause no negative impacts to streets
or neighbors.
         j.   All parking, including parking lots, improved or unimproved
parking stalls/spaces, and/or parking garages/structures shall occur in the
rear or side of the lot and shall be located a minimum of ten feet (10') behind
the front building wall of the primary structure, except for parking located
within a mixed use building.
      2.   Mixed use - design standards.
         a.   The design standards of chapters 340, 342, 343, 344, 345, 346,
347, and 348 of this title, residential standards, shall apply to all proposed
residential development within RMU Districts, unless otherwise specified by
this chapter.
         b.   The design standards of the Commercial Zoning District, chapter
360 of this title, design standards, shall apply to all proposed commercial
development within the Mixed Use Zoning Districts, unless otherwise specified
by this chapter.
         c.   The following design standards supplement those found in
subsections F2a and F2b of this section, and shall apply to all development
proposed within the RMU District.
            (1)   Commercial areas should be placed within walking distance (1/
4 mile) of residences;
            (2)   Commercial buildings and uses should be located at the corner
of the intersection of two (2) public streets;

building overhangs and arcades, and outdoor seating are required along
pedestrian-oriented streets;
            (4)   All primary building pedestrian entrances and storefront
windows shall face onto the primary street serving the site. If the site has
multiple street frontages, the more pedestrian- oriented street shall take
precedence;
            (5)   The design character of an individual building should be
compatible (share similar features such as color, scale, massing and height)
with its neighbors but may also include other features or characteristics that
are different;
            (6)   The requirements of chapter 402, "Landscape Standards", of
this title, shall apply to all proposed development within the Mixed Use
Districts;
            (7)   Drive-through facilities are not permitted.
      3.   Cottage housing development in conformance to the provisions of
chapter 344 of this title is permitted.

15.320.01: PURPOSE:
This chapter lists the land uses that may be allowed within the zoning
districts established by chapters 300 through 319 of this title (zoning
districts), and determines the type of permit/approval required for each use.
All land uses conducted within Lyon County must be carried out in a manner that
promotes the public interest, health, safety, convenience and general welfare;
reduces traffic congestion and hazards in the streets; preserves recognized
values of historic and community appearance, charm and character; provides
light and air for all buildings; safeguards and enhances property values;
avoids undesirable concentrations of population; prevents overcrowding of land;
facilitates adequate provision of transportation, water, sewage, schools, park
and other facilities and services; and provides the economic and social
advantages gained from a comprehensively planned use of land resources. (Ord.

15.330.01: PURPOSE:
The standards contained in this title are adopted to achieve the following:
   A.   Encourage greater variety of housing types, development styles, site
planning and density mixes in order to provide more diversity and visual
interest in the County's residential development, while preserving the
character of each community.
   B.   Encourage the development of neighborhoods that provide a high quality
living environment and generate civic pride.
   C.   Encourage residential development that reinforces a strong community-
oriented identity.
   D.   Encourage building design that complements surrounding development.
   E.   Encourage building design that respects the predominant characteristics
of neighborhood development in areas that possess strong existing development
character, such as height, massing, setbacks, materials and architectural
style.
   F.   Encourage designs that minimize views of garages and utilize side and
rear entry garages, as well as detached garages.
   G.   Encourage facades to be designed so as to include entries, porches and
other architectural elements that relate to the human scale.
   H.   Encourage residential entries to be located on the front facade with
direct access to the sidewalk or street. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)

(Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.330.03: STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO ALL DISTRICTS:
In addition to the development standards listed below, the property owner/
developer/operator shall be responsible for knowledge of and compliance with
any and all Federal and/or State regulations in association with their business
operation.
   A.   Calculation Of Average Lot Width And Depth:
      1.   Average lot width: The distance between the side lot lines measured
at right angles to the lot depth at a point midway between the front and rear
line.
      2.   Average lot depth: Measured as the distance between the front and
rear lot lines measured in the mean direction of the side lines.
   B.   Density:
      1.   Acre, gross means a measure of land area (43,560 square feet).
      2.   Density means the number of dwelling units allowed for each gross
acre of land, and is determined by dividing the number of dwelling units on a
site by the gross acreage of the site, including dedicated rights-of-way,
private streets, and open space set asides and any other portions of the
originally undivided parcel.
In the determination of the number of residential units to be allowed on a
specific parcel of land, a fractional unit equal to or greater than one-half
(1/2) of a unit shall be rounded up to equal a full unit.
      3.   The number of dwelling units allowed on a site is based on the
presumption that all other applicable standards of this title shall be met. The
maximum density established for a zoning district is not a guarantee that such
densities may be obtained, nor a valid justification for varying or modifying
other dimensional or development standards.
   C.   Lot Size:
      1.   Minimum Lot Dimensions: Any lot that is created, developed, used, or
occupied shall meet the minimum lot size and frontage requirements for the
zoning district in which it is located, except as otherwise established in this
title for particular uses.
      2.   Number Of Principal Buildings Or Uses Per Lot:
         a.   Only one principal building that functions as the primary
residence for single-family or duplex use, with permitted accessory buildings,
may be located upon a lot or unplatted tract. Every dwelling shall face or
front upon and have legal means of access to a street or officially approved
place.
         b.   Where a lot or tract of land is used for multiple-family, mixed
use, commercial, or industrial purposes, more than one principal building
containing the residential, residential/commercial, commercial or industrial
use may be located upon the lot but only when such principal buildings conform
to all requirements of this title applicable to the uses and district, and when
all principal buildings face upon and have legal means of access to a street or
officially approved place.
   D.   Setbacks:
      1.   Required Setbacks:
         a.   A building, structure, or lot shall not be developed, used, or
occupied unless it meets the minimum setback requirements set forth in
subsections B of sections
15.310.01 through
15.316.02 of this title for the zoning district in which it is located, except
as otherwise established in this title or unless a variance or minor
modification has been granted. Setbacks shall be measured from the property
lines (as shown in the diagram below).

IMAGES/0-0-0-2337.jpg]
 
         b.   Setbacks shall be unoccupied and unobstructed by any permanent
structure or portion of a permanent structure from thirty inches (30") above
grade.
         c.   As used in this section, the term "building" includes any
structure that by nature of its size, scale, bulk, dimension, or use
constitutes a visual obstruction or generates activity similar to that usually
associated with a building. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the following structures shall be deemed to fall within this description:
            (1)   Gas pumps and overhead canopies or roofs.
            (2)   Fences running along lot boundaries adjacent to public
rights-of-way that exceed six feet (6') in height and are substantially opaque.
      2.   Projections Into Required Setbacks, General: The following
structures may project into required front, side, or rear setbacks as specified
in this subsection:
         a.   Paved Terraces: Paved terraces may project into any required
setback, provided that no structures placed there shall violate other
requirements of this title and are at least five feet (5') from the lot line.
         b.   Unroofed Landings, Decks, Stairs And Balconies: Unroofed landing,
decks, and stairs may project into required setbacks, provided that no portion
other than a handrail shall extend higher than thirty inches (30") above the
finished grade level. Unroofed balconies may project into a required side or
rear yard provided these projections are at least five feet (5') from the
property line.
         c.   Incidental Architectural Features: Cornices, eaves, canopies,
sunshades, gutters, chimneys, flues, belt courses, headers, sills, pilasters,
lintels, ornamental features, and other similar architectural features may
project not more than two feet (2') into any required setback provided these
projections are at least 7.5 feet from the lot line.
         d.   Roofs Over Porches And Other Exterior Approaches: Roofs over
porches, stairways, landings, terraces, or other exterior approaches to
pedestrian doorways may encroach up to five feet (5') into a front setback. The
covered porch or entrance area encroaching into the setback shall remain
exterior to the building and enclosed by no more than a railing.
         e.   Projections Into Easements And Rights-Of-Ways Prohibited:
Projections shall not extend or encroach into any public or private easement(s)
or right(s)-of-way.
         f.   Handicap Ramps: Handicap access ramps may be located within the
required front, side, and rear setbacks.
      3.   Contextual Front Setbacks: The following exceptions to the front
setback requirements for dwellings abutting local streets, not collector or
arterial streets, are authorized for a lot in any district.
         a.   If there are dwellings on both abutting lots with front setbacks
of less than the required depth for the district, the front setback of the lot
need not exceed the average front setback of the abutting dwellings.
         b.   If there is a dwelling on one abutting lot with a front setback
of less than the required depth for the district, the front setback for the lot
need not exceed a depth one-half (1/2) way between the depth of the abutting
lot and the required front setback depth.
      4.   Double-Frontage Lots: In the case of double-frontage lots, front
setbacks shall be provided on both frontages.
   E.   Building Height:
      1.   Height Requirements Generally: No building shall be erected or
altered that will exceed the height limit for the respective zoning district,
unless otherwise provided in this chapter or elsewhere in this title.
      2.   Height Exceptions For Appurtenances: Except as specifically provided
elsewhere in this title, the height limitations contained in this title do not
apply to cupolas, flagpoles, chimneys, parapets, antennas, heating and
ventilation equipment, stairwell towers or similar appurtenances and religious
symbols such as crosses; provided, however, the following:
         a.   The appurtenance does not interfere with Federal Aviation
Regulations;
         b.   The appurtenance does not extend more than five feet (5') above
the maximum permitted building height, except for flagpoles, church belfries,
and antennas that must be of greater height in order to function;
         c.   The appurtenance is not constructed for the purpose of providing
additional floor area in the building; and
         d.   The appurtenance is functional.
      3.   Exceptions To Height Limits: The height limits of buildings and
structures contained in this title may be modified as follows:
         a.   In a Residential Zoning District with a height limit of less than
forty five feet (45'), public and quasi-public buildings, schools, houses of
worship, hospitals and other institutions permitted in the zone, may be erected
to a maximum height of forty five feet (45'); provided, that all required
setbacks shall be increased by two feet (2') for each additional one foot (1')
of height that the building exceeds the maximum height of the zone and the
appropriate fire protection district verifies that the building has complied
with the adopted fire codes and sufficient access to allow for emergency
vehicles to maneuver around the building.
         b.   In an Agriculture, Non-Irrigated Agriculture, Resource, Public
Land or the larger lot Rural Residential Zoning Districts (RR-20, RR-10 and RR-
5) with a height limit of less than forty five feet (45'), structures may be
erected to a maximum of forty five feet (45'); provided, that all required
setbacks shall be increased by two feet (2') for each additional one foot (1')
of height that the structure exceeds the maximum height of the zone. The
following typical non- residential structures, such as (including, but limited
to) barns, silos, mine head frames, hay sheds are allowed up to seventy five
feet (75') in height. Any such typical non-residential structures that exceed
seventy five feet (75') would be subject to the review of a conditional use
permit, following the application requirements and procedures contained in
chapter 230 of this title and the appropriate fire protection district verifies
that the building has complied with the adopted fire codes and sufficient
access to allow for emergency vehicles to maneuver around the building.
         c.   In Suburban Commercial/Mixed-Use Zoning Districts with a height
limit of less than forty five feet (45'), structures may be erected to a
maximum of forty five feet (45'); provided, that the exterior vertical wall of
each floor above the second story or twenty feet (20'), whichever is greater,
shall be set back from the ground floor exterior wall a minimum distance of two
feet (2') for each additional one foot (1') of height that the structure
exceeds the maximum height of the zone.
      4.   Measurement: The height of buildings and structures shall be the
distance measured vertically from any point on a proposed or existing top of
structure, roof or eaves to the natural or finished grade (whichever is more
restrictive) located directly below said point of the top of structure, roof or
eaves. Within any building footprint, height shall be measured vertically from
any point on a proposed or existing top of structure, roof or eaves (including
but not limited to the roofing material) to the natural grade directly below
said point on a proposed or existing top of structure, roof or eave (refer to
example below).

   F.   Sidewalks:
      1.   The owner of residential and nonresidential property is responsible
for:
         a.   The repair and reconstruction of a sidewalk in the public right-
of-way that abuts their property if the owner has caused the need for such
repair or reconstruction; and
         b.   The general maintenance of the sidewalk including without
limitation, sweeping, removal of snow, ice and weeds and maintenance of any
grass, shrubs or trees that encroach on the sidewalk. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018;
amd. Ord. 607, 9-19-2019)
15.330.04: ALTERNATIVE EQUIVALENT COMPLIANCE:
   A.   Purpose And Scope: To encourage creative and unique design,
"alternative equivalent compliance" allows development to occur in a manner
that meets or exceeds the intent of this title, yet would do so through an
alternative design that does not strictly adhere to this title's standards.
This is not a general waiver of regulations. Rather, this authorizes a site-
specific plan that can be quantified as equal to or better than the strict
application of the standard listed in this title.
   B.   Applicability: The alternative equivalent compliance procedure is
available only for the following chapters of this title:
      1.   Chapter 236: "Wireless Communications Facilities";
      2.   Chapter 335: "Performance Based Standards";
      3.   Chapter 336: "Performance Standards For Conditional Uses";
      4.   Chapter 337: "Performance Requirements For Industrial Uses";
      5.   Chapter 340: "Residential Design Standards";
      6.   Chapter 348: "Multi-Family Residential Design Standards";
      7.   Chapter 360: "Commercial And Mixed-Use Design Standards";
      8.   Chapter 401: "Off-Street Parking And Loading";
      9.   Chapter 402: "Landscape Standards";
      10.   Chapter 404: Exterior Lighting;
      11.   Chapter 405: Access and circulation.
   C.   Pre-Application Conference Required: An applicant proposing alternative
equivalent compliance shall request and attend a pre- application conference
(per chapter 201 of this title) prior to submitting application materials for
the applicable permit(s) to discuss the project, the applicable code standards,
and the proposed method of alternative equivalent compliance. The application
should include sufficient explanation and justification, in both written and
graphic form, for the requested alternative equivalent compliance.
   D.   Decision-Making Responsibility: Final approval of any alternative
equivalent compliance proposed under this section shall be the responsibility
of the decision-making body responsible for the final decision upon the type of
application for which the alternative equivalent compliance is being proposed.
Administratively approved projects/projects containing uses identified as
"permitted" in the land use tables contained in chapter 320 of this title which
proposed alternative equivalent compliance methods shall receive written
approval of the alternative equivalent compliance from the Director.
   E.   Criteria: Alternative equivalent compliance may be approved if the
applicant demonstrates that the following criteria have been met by the
proposed alternative and would:
      1.   Achieve the intent of the subject standard to the same or higher
degree than the subject standard;
      2.   Advance the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Master Plan and
this title to the same or higher degree than the subject standard;
      3.   Result in benefits to the community that are equivalent to or
greater than benefits associated with the subject standard; and
      4.   Impose no greater impacts on adjacent properties than would occur
through compliance with the specific requirements of this title.
   F.   Effect Of Approval: Alternative compliance shall apply only to the
specific site for which it is requested and shall not establish a precedent for
approval of any other development requests for alternative equivalent
compliance. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)

PERFORMANCE BASED STANDARDS
SECTION:
15.335.01: Introduction
15.335.02: How To Use This Chapter
15.335.03: Uses Permitted Based On Standards
15.335.04: Temporary Uses Permitted Based On Standards
15.335.01: INTRODUCTION:
The purpose of this chapter is to describe those uses, which may be approved
administratively by the Director, known as performance based standards ("PBS")
uses. Performance based uses are those which can be made compatible within a
given zoning district as long as pre-established standards are met which will
mitigate for identified potential negative effects of the use. PBS uses provide
landowners with more flexibility and certainty in using their property yet
afford protection from anticipated impacts to neighboring landowners. (Ord.
603, 11-1-2018)
15.335.02: HOW TO USE THIS CHAPTER:
The uses based on performance standards are listed in section
15.335.03, table 15.335-1 of this chapter. At the beginning of each section is
a statement showing which zoning districts allow the performance based use. The
standards that must be met to permit the use are then listed. It should be
emphasized that the performance standards are in addition to the regular
development standards that all development is obligated to comply with under
the terms of this title, such as off-street parking requirements (chapter 401
of this title) and landscaping requirements (chapter 402 of this title).
Uses that do not meet the performance based standards contained in this chapter
may be considered as a conditional use under the requirements of chapter 230 of
this title unless specifically prohibited on the Table of Allowed Uses.
Prior to establishment of any use permitted by this chapter subject to design
review as specified in section
15.320.03, "Land Use Tables By District", of this title, the user shall submit
and receive approval of a design review application pursuant to chapter 235 of
this title. The applicant must acknowledge the requirements of this chapter and
agree to discontinue or modify any use not in compliance with the requirements
contained herein. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)

   A.   Accessory Dwelling Units And Accessory Buildings:
      1.   Accessory Dwelling Unit:
         a.   Accessory dwelling units in Agricultural, Resource, Residential,
Commercial/Mixed-Use, and Employment Districts shall not exceed fifty percent
(50%) of the square footage of the livable area of the primary structure or one
thousand one hundred (1,100) square foot of gross floor area, whichever is
less. Only one (1) accessory dwelling unit is permitted per individual parcel.
One property owner of several parcels cannot aggregate all of the accessory
dwelling units permitted for each individual parcel onto one or more parcel
under the same ownership.
         b.   “Tiny houses”, as defined by the 2018 International Residential
Code (IRC), are “a dwelling that is 400 square feet or less in floor area
excluding lofts” and as “a single unit providing complete independent living
facilities for one or more persons, including permanent provisions for living,
sleeping, eating, cooking and sanitation”. Tiny Houses, as defined in this
provision, are permitted in zoning districts that permit accessory dwelling
units provided the units are constructed in accordance with IRC standards and
are placed upon a foundation design stamped by a NV-licensed professional
engineer.
         c.   In Residential Districts, the accessory dwelling unit shall be

CHAPTER 337
PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES
SECTION:
15.337.01: Purpose
15.337.02: Applicability
15.337.03: Standards
15.337.01: PURPOSE:
Performance standards are intended to ensure that all industrial uses will
provide necessary operational procedures and control methods to protect the
County and its residents from hazards and nuisances; to set objective and
quantifiable standards for the maximum tolerated levels of frequently hazardous
or annoying emissions; and to protect any industry from arbitrary exclusion or
persecution based solely on the characteristics of that type of industry's past
uncontrolled operation. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.337.02: APPLICABILITY:
Development of any land or structure that will contain an industrial use, or a
mix of industrial and other uses shall comply with appendix B, Lyon County
Design Criteria and Improvement Standards on file in the County, other
applicable health and safety regulations, title 6, chapter 2 of this Code and
the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.337.03: STANDARDS:
All uses that are identified to adhere to the standards of this chapter require
a conditional use permit. The following standards are provided as base general
standards for consideration of necessary conditions of approval for each
applicable use. The approving authority may consider additional appropriate
standards and establish additional specific conditions of approval where
warranted by the specific use and its locality.
   A.   Off-Street Parking And Loading: Off-street parking and loading
provisions shall be administered pursuant to chapter 401 of this title. In
addition, for new development loading areas must be located in such a manner
that no loading, unloading and/or maneuvering of trucks associated therewith
takes place on public rights-of-way.
   B.   Maintenance: The owner, lessee or user shall be responsible for
maintaining an orderly appearance of all properties, and shall be responsible
for assuring the care and maintenance of any natural growth where appropriate.
All required yards, parking areas, storage areas, operation yards and other
open uses on the site which are adjacent to a public right-of-way shall be
maintained in a neat and orderly manner appropriate for the district at all
times.
   C.   Enclosure: All manufacturing or fabrication processes which produce
physical off-site impacts of a detrimental nature shall be sufficiently
enclosed to mitigate the impact.
   D.   Pollution Control And Nuisance Abatement: Each industry is required to
continuously employ the best pollution control and nuisance abatement
technology when reasonable and practicably available for each particular
industry; provided, that where Federal or State laws or regulations provide for
the level of technology to be employed, the appropriate State or Federal
standards shall apply. Hazardous waste shall be managed in accordance with the
requirements of title 6, chapter 2 of this Code.
   E.   Heat, Light And Glare: All operations and facilities producing heat,

beyond the boundaries of the district.
   F.   Ground Vibrations: No ground vibration other than that caused by
highway vehicles, trains or construction activity shall be permitted which is
discernible, without instruments, at or beyond the property line for the use
concerned.
   G.   Odor, Dust, Dirt, And Smoke: Odor, dust, dirt, or smoke shall not be
emitted that is detectable at or beyond the property line, for the use
concerned, in such a concentration or of such duration as to cause a public
nuisance, or threaten health or safety, or to unreasonably infringe upon the
use and enjoyment of property beyond the boundaries of the district.
   H.   Noise: No use in this district shall exceed the maximum environmental
noise level at the property line:
      1.   When adjacent to a commercial or industrial use or zone: Daytime

CHAPTER 340
RESIDENTIAL DESIGN STANDARDS
SECTION:
15.340.01: Residential Design Standards; Benefits
15.340.02: Residential Development Design Standards
15.340.03: Housing Types
15.340.04: Conventional Subdivision
15.340.05: Cluster Subdivision
15.340.06: Mixed Residential Subdivision
15.340.07: Planned Unit Development
15.340.08: Special Standards For Cluster, Mixed Residential Subdivisions, And
Planned Unit Developments
15.340.01: RESIDENTIAL DESIGN STANDARDS; BENEFITS:
The design standards of this chapter establish certain restrictions for
residential development. These standards allow for variety in housing types
while maintaining the overall character of neighborhoods throughout County.
Design standards are based on the County's suburban and rural character areas.
Separate standards are established to regulate development in each zone. This
approach to Character Districts and zone specific design standards has several
public benefits:
   A.   It allows for development that is more sensitive to the environment and
allows for the preservation of open and natural areas.
   B.   It promotes quality site layout and energy-efficient development.
   C.   It promotes affordable and life-cycle housing.
   D.   It promotes development intensities that match existing and proposed
infrastructure investments. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.340.02: RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   Conventional Subdivision: Conventional subdivision is a pattern of
residential development that provides a majority of property owners with
substantial yards on their own property. Lots are typically at the minimum size
for a specific zoning district, and uniform in dimension and net area.
Structures are sited uniformly to front and side setback limits.
   B.   Cluster Subdivision: Cluster subdivisions trade smaller lot sizes (with
smaller yards) for additional common open space. A cluster subdivision shall be
a minimum size to ensure sufficient common open space can be incorporated into
the subdivision design.
   C.   Mixed Residential Subdivision: Mixed residential subdivisions allow for
a diversity of single family housing types and styles within a single
subdivision development while maintaining the underlying density and character
of the zoning district in which it is located. The following housing types may
be incorporated into a mixed residential subdivision subject to the limitations
of the specific zoning district: single family detached, zero lot line, alley
loaded, semi-attached, cottage housing, and townhouse.
   D.   Planned Unit Development: Planned unit development (PUD) allows maximum
flexibility and creativity in the design and execution of large scale
development projects through the use of project specific design standards, a
mix of land uses, and an extended development schedule. Planned unit
development is intended to create a mix of residential and non-residential
development on parcels in excess of five (5) acres. While typically used in
suburban character areas with access to public water and sewer and the arterial
transportation network, planned unit development is also available for use in
rural character areas to cluster the residential use while maintaining the
remaining area as open space that can remain in agricultural use, preserve
significant topographic features or historical structures/features. (Ord. 603,
11-1-2018)
15.340.03: HOUSING TYPES:
The following housing types are established to provide a common terminology for
housing in the County. All drawings are for illustrative purposes only.
   A.   Single Family Detached: A dwelling unit located on a single lot with
private yards on all four (4) sides.

   B.   Zero Lot Line House: A dwelling unit located on a single lot with
private yards on three (3) sides with the fourth side abutting the adjoining
property line. The house has only a single side yard comprising the equivalent
of the two (2) side yards of a single-family detached house. An access easement
for maintenance of the structure's exterior is provided on the adjoining lot.

   C.   Alley-Loaded House: A dwelling unit located on a single lot with
private yards on all four (4) sides. The house is set much closer to the street
than a single-family detached house, and alley access to a garage (either
attached or detached) is required.

   D.   Semi-Attached House: Two (2) attached single-family units located on
two (2) adjoining lots that share a common wall along the lot line, providing
for fee-simple ownership.
This duplex building type consists of structures that contain two (2) side-by-
side dwelling units, both facing the street, and sharing one common party wall.
This building type has the appearance of a medium to large single-family home.
This type is typically integrated sparingly into single-family neighborhoods or
more consistently into neighborhoods with other medium density types such as
courtyard cottages, fourplexes, or courtyard apartments. This building type
enables the incorporation of high- quality, well-designed density within a
walkable neighborhood.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2395.jpg]
 
   E.   Courtyard Cottage: The courtyard cottage building type consists of a
series of small detached or attached houses on a single lot, arranged to define
a shared court that is perpendicular to the street. All units are oriented to
and are accessed from this shared court. This type is typically integrated
sparingly into single-family neighborhoods or more consistently into
neighborhoods with other medium density types such as duplexes, four-plexes, or
courtyard apartments. This building type provides an option for living in a
smaller, high- quality house in a more community-driven environment due to the
shared outdoor space.
   F.   Townhouse: Three (3) or more attached units where the units are lined
up in a row and share side walls. Access to garages is generally from the rear.
A small side or rear yard is provided for each unit as private open space. This
building type provides a higher density, fee-simple unit in a more urban form.
This townhouse building type shall comply with the regulations in Nevada
Revised Statutes 116 (Common Interest Communities) as this type of residential
development requires the owners of units within the development shall pay for a
share of the Real Estate Taxes, insurance premiums, maintenance or improvement
of, or services or other expenses related to common elements, other units or
other real estate associated with the townhouse development.

SINGLE-FAMILY DETACHED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT IN SUBURBAN CHARACTER DISTRICTS
SECTION:
15.341.01: Applicability
15.341.02: Siting
15.341.03: Architecture
15.341.04: Colors And Materials
15.341.05: Fencing
15.341.06: Roofing
15.341.07: Performance Standards
15.341.01: APPLICABILITY:
This chapter applies to single-family residential structures in new residential
development projects in the following Suburban Residential Districts: SR-12000,
SR-9000, NR, RMU, CMU, EMU and HMU-S. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.341.02: SITING:
Houses should be designed and sited to conform to the natural terrain as much
as possible and to take advantage of views. In tracts, houses should be located
on their lots so as to create interest and varying vistas as a person moves
along the street. In order to prevent a tract from exhibiting a row-house
effect, no more than two (2) adjacent residences should have the same setback;
and the minimum setback variation should be three feet (3'). Care should be
exercised that no house is located in such a manner to create an objectionable
overview which invades the privacy of an adjoining unit. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.341.03: ARCHITECTURE:
The County encourages variations of architectural theme. However, it shall be
the responsibility of the designer to coordinate the design with adjacent
developments so that the design does not conflict with the character of the
neighborhood as a whole. Within a tract, architectural styles should remain
uniform.
Material changes within a building shall be offset in plane or an entirely
different design element. Detailing of construction elements is another
important consideration. For example, exterior metal portions of the structure
(i.e., vent pipes and flashings) should be painted to blend with the adjacent
roof or wall material. In addition, the vent pipes should be consolidated where
possible by design. Also, thought should be given to locating mechanical units
in some area other than the roof. Where units are located on the roof, then the
units shall be screened in manner that is architecturally integrated with the
design of the house. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.341.04: COLORS AND MATERIALS:
Houses should vary in color and character within the development. However, no
one structure should be at such variance with its neighbors that it detracts
from the character of the street as a whole. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.341.05: FENCING:
   A.   In new subdivisions or developments and infill developments a solid
block wall or wooden fence a minimum of six feet (6') in height shall be
provided along side and rear lot lines of parcels twelve thousand (12,000)
square feet or less to provide privacy and screening.
   B.   When there is an existing well-maintained fence, new fencing
requirements may be waived.
   C.   Adjacent to a collector and arterial streets rights-of-way required
fences shall be constructed of decorative block, brick, or stucco, or similar
decorative masonry material.
   D.   Wrought iron fencing or combination block and wrought iron fencing may
be utilized in place of the fences required above to preserve views or provide
greater openness.
   E.   The Planning Commission may waive fencing requirements in hillside
areas where side and/or rear lot line slope is extremely severe and it can be
shown that fencing will serve no purpose. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.341.06: ROOFING:
All new dwelling units shall utilize non-combustible roofing materials. (Ord.
603, 11-1-2018)
15.341.07: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
The following special requirements and performance standards shall apply to
properties located in Residential Zoning Districts, except as otherwise
authorized through approval of a planned development:
   A.   Required Landscaping: Required front and street side yards shall be
landscaped in conformance with chapter 402 of this title.
   B.   Building Height Exceptions: Chimneys, vents and church steeples may
exceed the maximum height requirement of the zoning district.
   C.   Sight Distance Requirements: At all street, alley and driveway
intersections there shall be triangular yard area within which no tree, sight-
obscuring fence, shrub, wall or other visual obstruction shall be permitted
higher than thirty inches (30") above the adjacent street, alley or driveway
grade. This triangular area shall measure as follows:
      1.   At any intersection of two (2) street rights-of-way, two (2) sides
of the triangular area shall extend twenty feet (20') along both right-of-way
lines, measured from their point of intersection. For the purpose of this
subsection, an alley shall be considered as a street.
      2.   At any intersection of a driveway with a street or alley, the sides
of the triangle shall extend ten feet (10') along the street or alley right-of-
way and fifteen feet (15') along the edge of the driveway, measured from their
point of intersection.
      3.   The provisions of this subsection shall be in addition to any other
site distance protection requirements of the County, and in the event of
conflict between requirements, the more restrictive shall apply.
   D.   Mechanical Equipment: Air conditioners, heating, cooling, ventilating
equipment, swimming pool pumps and heaters, and other similar mechanical
equipment shall be screened from surrounding properties and streets.
   E.   Driveway Setback: A driveway located in front of a garage accessed
through the front yard shall not be less than twenty feet (20') in length as
measured from the garage to the right-of- way line.
   F.   Wireless Communication Facilities: Wireless communication facilities
located in the Residential Zones when allowed by this chapter shall be subject
to the provisions of chapter 236 of this title and all other applicable
requirements.
   G.   Shipping Containers: No shipping container may be placed on any
Residentially zoned property in a suburban character area. (Ord. 603, 11-1-
2018)

15.343.01: PURPOSE:
   A.   Residential cluster development is intended to:
      1.   Encourage creative and flexible site design that is sensitive to the
land's natural features and adapts to the natural topography;
      2.   Protect environmentally sensitive areas of a development site and
preserve on a permanent basis open space, natural features, and prime
agricultural lands;
      3.   Decrease or minimize nonpoint source pollution impacts by reducing
the amount of impervious surfaces in site development;
      4.   Promote cost savings in infrastructure installation and maintenance
by such techniques as reducing the distance over which utilities, such as water
and sewer lines, need to be extended or by reducing the width or length of
streets; and
      5.   Provide opportunities for preservation of open space that can be
used for passive recreation, or retain agricultural/ranching in open space
areas while congregating residential development and reducing both sprawl and
the loss of open space and active agricultural/ranching uses. (Ord. 603, 11-1-
2018)
15.343.02: APPLICABILITY; GENERAL PROVISIONS:

15.343.04: CALCULATION OF PERMITTED NUMBER OF DWELLING UNITS; DENSITY BONUSES:
   A.   Except as provided in subsection C of this section, the maximum numbers
of dwelling units proposed for a residential cluster development shall not
exceed the number of dwelling units otherwise permitted for the Residential
Zoning District in which the parcel is located.
   B.   Except as provided in subsection C of this section, the number of
permitted dwelling units on a site shall be calculated in the following manner.
      1.   Measure the gross area of the proposed cluster development site in
acres and tenths of an acre;
      2.   Subtract from the gross area determined in subsection B1 of this
section the area of public and private streets and other publicly dedicated
improvements, measured in acres and tenths of an acre, excluding common open
space. The remainder shall be the net buildable area;
      3.   Convert the net buildable area from acres to square feet (SF), using
the equivalency of 43,560 SF = 1 acre; and
      4.   Divide the net buildable area by the smallest minimum lot size (in
square feet) per unit for a dwelling unit permitted in the zoning district.
This figure shall be rounded to the nearest lower number to establish the
maximum number of dwelling units to be permitted in the cluster development.
   C.   An increase of up to a minimum of one unit or ten percent (10%),
whichever is greater, of the maximum number of dwelling units in the cluster
development, as calculated in subsection B of this section, may be approved if
the percent of density bonus is no greater than the percent of the gross area
of the cluster development that is set aside and conveyed as common open space
pursuant to section
15.340.08 of this title.
   D.   Additional density may be approved when the requirements of chapter
115, "Density Bonus Agreements", of this title, are met. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)

15.344.20: Ownership And Residential Use Of Cottages
15.344.21: Alternative Site Design
15.344.01: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The general purposes of the cottage housing development design standards are as
follows:
   A.   A cottage housing development is an alternative type of detached
housing providing small residences for households of typically one to two (2)
individuals. Cottage housing is provided as part of the County's overall
housing strategy which intends to encourage affordability, innovation and
variety in housing design and site development while ensuring compatibility
with existing neighborhoods, and to promote a variety of housing choices to
meet the needs of a population diverse in age, income, household composition
and individual needs.
   B.   The cottage housing development design standards contained in this
section are intended to create a small community of cottages oriented around
open space that is pedestrian-oriented and minimizes the visibility of off-
street parking. These design standards are intended to ensure that cottage
housing developments include pedestrian amenities and take advantage of
existing natural features on the site including topography and vegetation. The
cottage housing development design standards are intended to maintain
traditional cottage amenities and proportions and ensure that cottage housing
developments contribute to the overall community character.
   C.   Cottage housing may allow higher residential density than is normally
allowed in the underlying zone district. This increased density is possible
through the use of smaller than average home sizes, clustered parking, and site
design standards.
   D.   All cottage housing developments are subject to stormwater standards
and shall incorporate low impact development stormwater techniques whenever
possible. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.344.02: APPLICABILITY:
Cottage housing development is permitted in the SR-1/2, SR-12000, SR-9000, NR,
RMU and CMU Zoning Districts subject to the limitations of the zoning district.
(Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.344.03: DENSITY, NUMBER OF COTTAGE HOUSING UNITS AND MINIMUM LOT AREA:
   A.   In cottage housing developments the permitted densities shall be as
follows:
 
                     Zoning District
                     SR-1/2 Low Density SR-12000 And SR-9000 NR, RMU, CMU-H And

Note: Densities are subject to availability of water and sewer services. (Ord.
603, 11-1-2018)
15.344.04: EXISTING NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS:
   A.   On a lot to be used for a cottage housing development, an existing
detached single-family residential structure, which may be nonconforming with
respect to the standards of this chapter, shall be permitted to remain, but the
extent of the nonconformity may not be increased. Such nonconforming dwelling
units shall be included in the maximum permitted cottage density.
      1.   Nonconforming dwelling units may be modified to be more consistent
with this chapter. For example, roof pitches may be increased, but the building
ground floor or total floor area may not be increased beyond allowed density of
the zoning district.
   B.   New accessory dwelling units are not permitted in cottage housing
developments. All residential units in a cottage housing development count
towards the maximum permitted density. An existing attached or detached
accessory dwelling unit that is accessory to an existing nonconforming single-
family structure may be counted as a cottage unit if the property is developed
subject to the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.344.05: BUILDING HEIGHT:
   A.   Objective: Structures in cottage housing developments shall be designed
to be single story or single story plus a loft. Because the base density is
higher and building separation less than on typical residential lots, it is
important to maintain a feeling of adequate light and open space by providing
more restrictive maximum roof heights and roof proportion standards.
      1.   The maximum building height permitted for structures in cottage
housing developments shall be eighteen feet (18').
      2.   The highest point of a pitched roof may extend up to twenty three
feet (23'). (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.344.06: EXTERIOR TRIM AND ROOF EAVES:
   A.   Objective: Cottage housing development structures shall be provided
with substantial exterior trim elements consistent with traditional mining and
ranching community cottage design and small home craftsmanship. Roofs in
cottage housing developments shall have eaves to recognize traditional cottage
design traits to efficiently shade walls, shed rain, and provide rain
protection for exterior walls. Departures from these standards (exterior trim
and eave requirements) shall be reviewed through the alternative design review
process. Alternative exterior trim and eave designs shall demonstrate a
coherent cottage housing design based upon traditional design principles
including weather protection.
      1.   Window and door trim with a minimum width of three and one- half
inches (31/2") shall be provided on all cottage housing developments
structures.
      2.   Eaves of at least twelve inches (12") shall be provided on all
cottage structures on at least two (2) sides of each building. Where buildings
are not square (1 set of exterior parallel walls are longer than the other),
the eaves shall be provided on the parallel walls that are the longest. (Ord.
603, 11-1-2018)
15.344.07: COVERED MAIN ENTRY PORCHES:
   A.   Objective: All residences in cottage housing developments shall be
provided with a covered main entry porch to create a private outdoor space
protected from the weather and provide a transition from the interior private
residential space to the semi-private outdoor space. Covered porches shall be
usable both in design and dimension.
      1.   Cottage homes shall have a covered main entry porch with a floor
area measuring at least sixty (60) square feet in size.
      2.   The floor of the covered main entry porch shall have minimum
dimensions of not less than five feet (5') in any direction (length or width).
(Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.344.08: STREET FACING FACADES:
   A.   Objective: The street facing facades of cottages in a cottage housing
development will contribute to the neighborhood by including attractive design
details such as windows, changes in materials, and views of front doors or
porches. The main entries of some cottages will be visible from the adjacent
streets to provide a visual pedestrian connection with the surrounding
neighborhood.
      1.   All cottages shall have street facing facades that avoid blank walls
or appear to "turn their backs" to the street. All cottages shall include one
or more of the following on-street facing facades:
         a.   Changes in exterior siding material and paint color;
         b.   Windows which may include bay windows; and/or
         c.   Building modulation with a depth measuring at least one foot
(1').
      2.   At least one cottage shall have its front main entry door and/or
front porches visible from each street frontage. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.344.09: LOT COVERAGE AREA:
Cottage housing developments shall not exceed underlying lot coverage standards
for the respective zoning district to maintain residential neighborhood
character and the balance of built structures to open spaces. (Ord. 603, 11-1-
2018)
15.344.10: COTTAGE FLOOR AREA:
   A.   Objective: Structures in cottage housing developments shall be designed
to be single story or single story plus a loft. Residences in cottage housing
developments are primarily intended for one- and two-person households and
their occasional guests. Maintaining the maximum square footage of residences
in cottage housing developments is necessary to prevent overbuilding of the
site and to not exceed available off-street parking.
      1.   The maximum ground floor area for an individual principal structure
in a cottage housing development shall be as follows:
         a.   For at least fifty percent (50%) of the units, the ground floor
area may not exceed six hundred fifty (650) square feet.
         b.   For no more than fifty percent (50%) of the units, the ground
floor area may be up to eight hundred (800) square feet.
         c.   The net total floor area of each cottage shall not exceed one and
one-half (11/2) times the area of the main level. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.344.11: YARDS - BUILDING SETBACKS FROM EXTERIOR LOT LINES:
   A.   Objective: Exterior lot line building setbacks in cottage housing
developments are based upon setbacks of the zoning district. These yard
setbacks are appropriate based upon the allowed density of cottage housing as
well as the small size of the structures. Flexible setbacks are allowed at the
discretion of the Planning and Public Works Directors to obtain improved site
design and to avoid impacting existing physical features on the site such as
trees. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.344.12: COTTAGE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT BUILDING SEPARATION:
   A.   Objective: Structures within cottage housing developments shall observe
minimum setbacks from other cottage housing development structures to avoid
overcrowding the site and to maintain a sense of privacy within the cottages
themselves.
      1.   All buildings within a cottage housing development shall maintain a
minimum separation of ten feet (10') from cottages within a cottage housing
development measured from the nearest point of the exterior walls. Accessory
buildings shall comply with Building Code requirements for separation. (Ord.
603, 11-1-2018)
15.344.13: COMMON OPEN SPACE:
   A.   Objective: Open space that is commonly owned by all members of a
cottage housing development is an important feature of any site design. It is
intended that the open space be adequately sized and centrally located with
individual cottage entrances oriented towards the open space.
      1.   Common Open Space: A minimum of four hundred (400) square feet per
cottage unit of common open space is required. Parking areas, yard setbacks,
spaces between buildings of ten feet (10') or less in width, private open
space, and driveways do not qualify as common open space.
      2.   Proximity To Common Open Space:
         a.   At least fifty percent (50%) of the cottage units shall abut a
common open space, all of the cottage units shall be within sixty feet (60')
walking distance measured from the nearest entrance of the cottage along the
shortest safe walking route to the nearest point of the common open space. The
common open space shall have cottages abutting at least two (2) sides.
         b.   For the purposes of cottage housing, "common open space" shall be
the central space that may be used by all occupants of the cottage complex.
(Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.344.14: PRIVATE OPEN SPACE:
   A.   Objective: Each residential unit in a cottage housing development shall
be provided an area of private open space. The private open space shall
separate the main entrance to the cottage from the common open space to create
a sense of privacy and shall be oriented to take advantage of solar orientation
and other natural features to create a small but pleasant private yard area.
The private open space may be separated from the common open space with a small
hedge, picket fence, or other similar visual separation to create a sense of
separate ownership.
      1.   Each cottage unit shall be provided with a minimum of two hundred
(200) square feet of usable private open space separated from the common open
space by a hedge or fence not to exceed thirty six inches (36") in height.
      2.   No dimension of the private open space shall be less than eight feet
(8'). (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.344.15: TREE CONSERVATION:
   A.   Objective: Cottage housing developments should be designed to
incorporate existing trees to the extent possible. New trees should be located
to create amenities in the common open space, private open space, provide shade
where appropriate, to create separation between buildings when desired, and to
screen and soften the perimeter of parking areas and street facing sides of
cottage housing developments.
      1.   Preservation of existing trees, and/or new trees, shall be provided
consistent with chapter 402, "Landscape Standards", of this title. Native trees
and other vegetation should be preserved to the extent possible and the overall
site design should take advantage of the location of existing trees and
topographic features. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.344.16: STORMWATER LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUES:
   A.   Objective: Cottage housing developments shall be designed to take
advantage of open space and landscaped features to utilize low impact
development techniques including natural filtration and on-site infiltration of
stormwater.
      1.   Low impact development techniques for stormwater management shall be
used wherever possible. Such techniques may include the use of pervious pavers
in parking areas and for walkways, directing roof drains and parking lot runoff
to landscape beds, living roofs, and the use of rain barrels. (Ord. 603, 11-1-
2018)
15.344.17: OFF-STREET PARKING:
   A.   Objective: Off-street parking space requirements for cottage housing
developments shall be less than normally required for detached single-family
residences. These reduced standards are based upon the cottages being smaller
than average detached single-family homes and on average containing fewer
occupants. Off-street parking shall be located and designed to be less visible
from frontage streets than the cottages themselves. Off- street parking shall
be designed to maintain a pedestrian character for the overall cottage housing
development. Clustering parking to the side or rear of a cottage project will
most often best accomplish these goals. However, on a site-specific basis,
design solutions other than clustering may be found to meet this objective
through the alternative design process. Parking areas shall be attractively
landscaped to screen parking from adjacent properties and street rights-of-way
and shall meet parking lot landscape standards.
      1.   Parking Ratios:
 
Total Net Floor Area Of Cottage Or   Ratio Of Off-Street Parking Spaces
Nonconforming Dwelling Unit          Required Per Cottage Or Nonconforming
                                     Dwelling Unit
Up to 1,000 square feet                 1.25 parking spaces
1,001 to 1,200 square feet              1.5 parking spaces
Existing nonconforming single-family 2 parking spaces
residence
 
      2.   Off-Street Parking Location: Parking shall be located on the cottage
housing development property. Off-street parking lots shall be located to the
side or rear of the cottage housing development (see illustrations below).
Parking lots shall not be located between the cottage housing development and
the primary street frontage.
         a.   Off-Street Parking Screening: Off-street parking may be located
in or under a non-cottage parking structure (such as a single or multi-auto
carport or garage), but such structures shall not be attached to individual
cottages. Uncovered parking is also permitted; provided, that off-street
parking shall be screened from direct street view from one or more street
facades by garage doors, or by a fence and landscaping.
         b.   Preferred Parking Locations: Preferred locations for parking, in
descending order of preference, are as follows:
            (1)   To the rear of cottage housing units accessed by an alley.

         c.   Parking Lot Landscaping: Parking lot landscaping shall comply
with the requirements of chapter 402, "Landscape Standards", of this title.
(Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.344.18: EXTERIOR LIGHTING AND HEATING/COOLING EQUIPMENT NOISE:
   A.   Objective: Cottage housing developments should be designed to minimize
light and noise impacts both within the development and to adjacent properties.
      1.   Where provided, exterior lighting shall be mounted as low as
possible, pointed downward, and the light source shall be shielded from direct
observation from above, adjacent properties, and public rights-of-way. Lighting
"spillover" to adjacent properties shall be avoided.
      2.   Heating (and cooling, if applicable) equipment for cottage housing
developments shall be designed to cause little or no noise impacts within the
development and to adjacent properties. To help prevent noise problems,
exterior heating and cooling units shall not be used for cottage housing
developments. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.344.19: REQUIRED SEPARATION OF COTTAGE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SR-1/2,
SR-12000, SR-9000, AND NR ZONING DISTRICTS:
   A.   Objective: Cottage housing developments in Single-Family Zoning
Districts shall be separated from each other by a minimum distance to promote
housing-type diversity, to reduce potential cumulative impacts of cottage
housing development, and to help protect neighborhood character.
      1.   Each cottage housing development in the SR-1/2, SR-12000, SR-9000,
and NR Zoning Districts shall be separated from any other cottage housing
development in these districts by a distance of at least one thousand feet
(1,000') or one block, whichever is greater. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.344.20: OWNERSHIP AND RESIDENTIAL USE OF COTTAGES:
   A.   All cottage housing developments shall be developed utilizing common
ownership provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes chapter 116 including with
regard to ownership in which portions of the real estate are designated for
separate individual ownership and the remainder of the real estate is
designated for common ownership solely by the owners of those portions (similar
to condominiums or townhomes). An exception that an association, cooperative or
other similar ownership technique may be substituted for the requirement of
residential condominiums. Appropriate documentation of formal legal ownership
of the development shall be recorded with the County Recorder.
   B.   Cottages are for residential use only and may not be operated as
transient accommodations. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.344.21: ALTERNATIVE SITE DESIGN:
It is possible that an alternative design may fulfill the intent of this
chapter while not complying with the provisions herein. Requests for
alternative designs shall be processed pursuant to section
15.330.04, "Alternative Equivalent Compliance", of this title. (Ord. 603, 11-1-

15.345.01: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
Townhouse development is intended to:
   A.   To accommodate various types of unique and innovative housing forms
which are usually based upon a concept of reducing the area of individually
owned lots, and grouping such lots together to more efficiently utilize the
total space within the subdivision by creating common open spaces, scenic and
recreational areas, and other spaces which would compensate for the reduction
of land area contained within the individually owned lot.
   B.   To allow the grouping of separately owned one-family dwelling units
into a group of townhouses in such a manner as to make efficient, economical
and aesthetically pleasing use of land so restricted that the same will be
continually well maintained in order to preserve the health, welfare, safety
and convenience of the surrounding neighborhood and insure a reasonable amount
of open space and architectural variety. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)

   A.   Right-Of-Way Setback: No townhouse unit shall be located closer than
fifteen feet (15') from any public right-of-way or within fifteen feet (15') of
a private drive, access road, or common open parking area, to the front or rear
of such dwelling.
   B.   Yard Requirements: Each individual townhouse lot shall have a minimum
front yard of fifteen feet (15') and a rear yard of twenty feet (20'). The
minimum side yard requirements of the zoning district shall be maintained from
side property lines of the townhouse project site.
   C.   Setback Variation: No more than two (2) abutting townhouses or
townhouse groupings within the townhouse project site shall have a common front
building setback. Variations in the setback of front building faces shall be at

not be allowed for the front yard on a corner lot or for the side yard adjacent
to lots developed with other housing types.
   E.   Zero setbacks may be applied to a side or rear property line; provided,
that the setback on the lot abutting a zero setback lot line shall be at least
ten feet (10').
   F.   Structures less than three feet (3') to a property line must meet fire
resistive provisions of the Residential Building Code.
   G.   If the sidewall of the house is on the property line, or within three
feet (3') of the property line, windows or other openings that allow for
visibility into the side yard of the adjacent lot shall not be allowed. Windows
that do not allow visibility into the side yard of the adjacent lot, such as
clerestory windows, translucent windows, or glass block, are permitted.
   H.   A note shall be placed on the final plat, and covenants running with
the land shall be approved by the District Attorney and recorded with the
County Recorder to guarantee that the required setbacks are kept perpetually
free of structures.
   I.   Easements for such purposes as maintenance, or for building projection
encroachments beyond a zero setback line, shall be shown on the final map.

one hundred feet (100') (measured from end wall to end wall).
      2.   A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the front facade (area
measurement) shall contain windows or doors. All windows and doors shall be
trimmed or be recessed (i.e., into the front facade) to provide shadowing.
      3.   Garages attached to living units and accessed from the street (front
setback) shall be recessed at least four feet (4') behind the front facade of a
dwelling structure; and
      4.   Exterior building elevations shall incorporate design features
including offsets, balconies, projections, window reveals, or similar elements
to preclude large expansions of uninterrupted building surfaces. Along the
vertical face of a structure, the features shall occur at a minimum of every
thirty feet (30'), and on each floor shall contain a minimum of two (2) of the

   A.   When a single-family residence is within twenty five feet (25') of a
proposed multi-family residential development site and the residence is on the
same side of the street and same block, a setback similar to that of the
nearest single-family residence shall be used for the front yard. "Similar"
means the multifamily development setback is within five feet (5') of the
setback provided by the nearest single-family residence. For example, if the
single-family residence setback is twenty feet (20'), then the multi-family
building shall be set back by fifteen feet (15') to twenty five feet (25'). The
minimum front yard setback shall be twenty feet (20'), as specified in chapter
312 of this title.
   B.   Site obscuring buffers shall be required. The County may require
retention of existing vegetation; installation of a six foot (6') minimum
height, site- obscuring fence with shade trees planted a maximum of thirty feet
(30') on center (2-inch caliper diameter at breast height ("dbh")) at planting;
other landscaping to provide visual buffering; and/or other sight obscuring
barriers to provide visual buffering. In addition, the County may require
acoustical barriers when parking is proposed to be located adjacent to the
shared property line.
   C.   Buildings, or portions of buildings adjacent to single family
residential property shall not exceed a building height greater than one foot
(1') for each foot distance from the property line. For example, a building or
portion of a building thirty feet (30') in height shall be thirty feet (30')
from the single-family residential property line. This standard applies up to a
distance of fifty feet (50') from the property line.
   D.   Light standards shall be twelve feet (12') or less in height and
shielded so that light does not allow direct illumination onto adjacent single
family residential property or into dwelling units.
   E.   Mechanical equipment shall be screened from view (i.e., as viewed from
adjacent properties and street), and shall be buffered so that noise does not
exceed sixty five (65) dBA as measured at the property line. The County may
require a noise study certified by a licensed acoustical engineer.
   F.   All rooftop equipment other than solar installations shall be hidden
behind parapets or other structures designed into the building. (Ord. 603, 11-
1-2018; amd. Ord. 607, 9-19-2019)

of the wall or fence, unless breaks are provided for gates.
   C.   No trash receptacles shall be located in any front yard setback, or
within twenty five feet (25') of property lines abutting Residentially zoned
property; and
   D.   Ground-mounted equipment, including exterior transformers, utility
pads, cable television and telephone boxes and similar utility services, shall
be placed underground, where practicable. When placed above ground, equipment
shall be placed to minimize visual impact; or screened with a wall or
landscaping. When walls are used they shall be tall enough to completely screen
the equipment at the time of the equipment installation. Landscaping shall be
planted tall enough to attain fifty percent (50%) coverage after two (2) years

15.349.01: PURPOSE:
   A.   Planned unit development (PUD) is a land use designation designed to
provide an overall planning and design approach for a single use development or
a development incorporating a mix of uses. PUD allows for deviation from a
strict application of dimensional and use limitations of the zoning district or
districts in order to provide flexibility for landowners to creatively plan for
the overall development of their land to achieve a more desirable environment
than would be possible through strict application of the standard requirements
of the zoning district.
While not to be considered as the explicit standards to be applied when
evaluating a PUD, the general purpose or purposes for establishing a PUD may
include one or more of the following:
      1.   Permit the integration rather than separation of uses so that
necessary commercial, recreation, and educational facilities are conveniently
located to housing;
      2.   Establish land use patterns that promote and expand opportunities
for public transportation and for efficient, compact, networks of streets and
utilities that lower development and maintenance costs and conserve energy;
      3.   Help preserve valued environmental resource lands and avoid
development of natural hazard areas;
      4.   Help maintain and enhance surface and ground water quality and
quantity, and to maintain air quality;
      5.   Help improve and enhance the County's trail and park system and
maintain access to public lands;
      6.   Help protect and maintain critical wildlife habitat and migration
corridors;
      7.   Establish incentives for applicants to assure that long term
affordable housing will be developed;
      8.   Help provide for well-located, clean, safe, and pleasant industrial
sites involving a minimum of strain on transportation facilities;
      9.   Encourage innovations in residential, commercial and industrial
development and renewal so that the growing demands of the population may be
met by greater variety in type, design, and layout of buildings, and by the
conservation and more efficient use of open space ancillary to the built
environment;
      10.   Minimize the burden of traffic on roads and highways;
      11.   Help ensure that the purposes, goals, objectives and policies of
applicable Lyon County Comprehensive Master Plans and maps are achieved. (Ord.
603, 11-1-2018)
15.349.02: APPLICABILITY:
PUDs shall be permitted in Suburban and Rural Character Areas of Lyon County as
identified in the Lyon County Comprehensive Master Plan and maps. PUDs may be
permitted in all Suburban Character Area Zoning Districts provided the project,
and its component elements and uses, is planned in a manner compatible with
each and to the surrounding environment. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.349.03: STANDARDS AND CRITERIA:
The following standards and criteria shall govern PUD proposals within Lyon
County:
   A.   Proposed Uses: The use (or uses) proposed is (are) consistent with the
goals and policies of the Lyon County Comprehensive Master Plan.
   B.   Site Area: The minimum site area required for a proposed PUD is five
(5) acres. The tract or tracts of land included in a proposed PUD must be in a
single ownership or under the development control of a joint application of
owners or authorized agents of the property involved.
   C.   Design: The PUD will comply with the Lyon County Design Criteria and
Improvement Standards and specifications contained in appendix B on file in the
County.
   D.   Density: The allowable residential density shall be established for the
subject property, using the net density acreage as defined in chapter 1200 of
this title, appendix A. An increase in residential density above the maximum
residential density allowed in the existing underlying zoning district may be
proposed and can be permitted. The applicant must mitigate increased density,
and the level of mitigation shall increase as the proposed density increases.
At a minimum, the applicant must explain how the increase can be offset through
provision of usable open space and amenities, innovative site design,
architectural variety, and quality of construction or promulgates a master plan
goal/policy/strategy and demonstrate that any adverse impacts can be mitigated.
If the PUD is to be developed in phases, the County may allow for a greater
concentration of density or intensity of land use within a section of the
development as long as the increase is offset by a reciprocal decrease in
density or intensity of land use in any completed prior section of development
or by an appropriate reservation of common open space on the remaining land by
a grant of permanent protective easement as proscribed in subsection
15.340.08A4 of this title or by covenant in favor of the County.
   E.   Bulk Requirements: Building and parking area setbacks, minimum lot
area, lot coverage and building height must conform to the requirements of the
equivalent zoning district or the existing underlying zoning for a majority of
the PUD unless deviations from those underlying zoning development standards
are proposed, considered and approved as a part of the review process. Any such
deviation(s) must be justified by the applicant by addressing the allowable
modifications contained in chapters 340 through 349 of this title where
appropriate, and the exceptions criteria of subsection M of this section.
   F.   Commercial Design: Commercial building placement and architectural
design shall conform to the intent of chapter 360 of this title, commercial
design standards.
   G.   Residential Design: Multi-family housing placement and design shall
conform to the intent of chapter 348, "Multi-Family Residential Design
Standards", of this title.
   H.   Parking: Parking shall be provided as required by chapter 401 of this
title, parking and loading. Further reductions in the amount of parking to be
provided may be proposed by the applicant but shall be approved only if they
meet the exceptions criteria of subsection M3 of this section.
   I.   Open Space: The minimum amount of area to be designated and preserved
as common open space in any planned unit development shall be twenty percent
(20%). Each planned unit development proposal shall identify all areas proposed
as common open space meeting the requirements contained in section
15.340.08 of this title. Where a decrease in the required common open space is
proposed the applicant shall provide a detailed justification addressing the
criteria for exception to the common open space requirement outlined in
subsection M of this section. For nonresidential development the common open
space requirement can be met by providing a minimum of twenty percent (20%) of
the development as landscaped area, which exceeds the minimum standards
imposed.
      1.   Usable common open space in residential PUDs shall be sited and
improved to provide active recreational amenities intended to provide
appropriate opportunities for physical activity and interaction among residents
within the development. Except where inventoried significant natural resources
or Flood Hazard Zone are present on site, one hundred percent (100%) of the
required usable common open space area shall be improved for active or passive
recreational use. Usable common open space in Rural Character Areas of Lyon
County may retain agricultural/ranching uses, operations and related support
structures to continue the agricultural/ranching uses subject to a restrictive
covenant recorded on the common open space areas outlining the remaining
agricultural/ranching uses and activities to continue on the open space areas
while extinguishing any residual development rights from the designated open
space areas.
      2.   Development within Historic Character Areas shall provide usable
common open space improvements which enhance the pedestrian environment and are
appropriate to these higher density areas. Such improvements may include, but
are not limited to, the following: hardscaped courtyards; weather canopies;
water features and drinking fountains; benches or low walls with seating areas;
free-standing planters; play structures; public art or other pedestrian space
or design features integrated into the overall design of the development.
      3.   Open space deemed unusable shall be placed under permanent
protective easement as proscribed in section
15.340.08 of this title, with evidence provided at the time of application that
the proposed easement holder has or will accept the easement and perpetual
management and maintenance as required by section
15.340.08 of this title.
   J.   Connectivity: Planned unit developments shall provide vehicular,
bicycle, pedestrian or equestrian connections to adjacent and nearby
residential areas, transit stops, neighborhood activity centers and other
neighborhood facilities in the following manner:
      1.   In PUDs that are five (5) acres or more in size, full street
connections with spacing of no more than six hundred feet (600') between these
connections shall be provided except where barriers such as topography,
railroads, or pre-existing development prevent their construction.
      2.   Within PUDs in which full street connections are not possible,
bicycle and pedestrian connection on public easements or rights- of-way shall
be provided with spacing of no more than four hundred feet (400') between
connections except where barriers such as topography, railroads, or pre-
existing development prevent their construction.
      3.   In PUDs, opportunities to incrementally extend and connect proposed
new streets with existing streets in adjacent or nearby areas shall be
considered in addition to addressing street connectivity recommendations shown
on the County-Wide Integrated Roadway Network Maps contained within appendix B
of the Lyon County Comprehensive Master Plan on file in the County.
      4.   The use of cul-de-sac designs and closed street systems shall be
limited to circumstances in which barriers such as topography, railroads,
arterial highways, or pre-existing development prevent full street extensions.
When permitted, cul-de-sacs shall have a maximum length of two hundred feet
(200') and shall serve no more than twenty five (25) dwelling units.
      5.   Narrow street designs for local streets may be permitted with
approval of the County Engineer, Road Superintendent and Fire Chief of the
local Fire Protection District, provided that other minimum dimensional
requirements are met for travel lanes, bike lanes, parking lanes and sidewalk
widths or other suitable alternative facilities (such as grade-separated bike
lanes and sidewalks, designated parking areas, etc.) are provided.
      6.   Where site conditions are favorable to stormwater infiltration
"green streets" designs may be utilized. Permissible design elements and
facilities include, but are not limited to, minimizing paving and/or using
pervious paving materials, maximizing street tree coverage, using multi-
functional open drainage systems in lieu of more conventional curb-and-gutter
systems, reducing cul-de-sac radii and using vegetated islands in the center,
and minimizing the negative effects of stream crossings.
   K.   Employment Or Commercial Designations: Planned unit development in
areas designated employment or commercial on the Lyon County Comprehensive
Master Plan Map may allow mixed industrial, commercial, and residential uses
subject to the following:
      1.   The site proposed for the PUD is not less than twenty (20) gross
acres in size.
      2.   The PUD preliminary development plan shall indicate the approximate
size, general location, and character of use of all areas of the site which the
applicant designates for uses other than those allowed by the Lyon County
Comprehensive Master Plan Map and this title.
   L.   Buffers: Planned unit developments shall establish adequate buffer
zones between dissimilar uses within the development and between dissimilar
uses and/or densities exterior to the planned unit development. Special design
considerations such as height controls, density controls, architectural
modifications, and landscaping buffers shall be incorporated in any portion of
the development which adjoins a previously approved land use or division of
land.
   M.   Exceptions:
      1.   Building Setback Or Yard Requirements: The commission may grant an
exception to the dimensional building setback or yard requirements of the
applicable standards based on findings that the approval will result in the
following:
         a.   No adverse effect to adjoining properties in terms of light, air
circulation, noise levels, privacy, and fire hazard.
         b.   At least one of the following:
            (1)   A more efficient use of the site;
            (2)   The preservation of natural features which have been
incorporated into the overall design of the project;
            (3)   Safe vehicular and pedestrian access to the site and safe on-
site vehicular and pedestrian circulation.
In the instance where adjoining properties to the planned unit development are
zoned Residential, all structures within the PUD shall be set back from
adjoining properties to the minimum setback or yard required in the underlying
zone.
      2.   Building Height: The commission may grant an exception to the
applicable height requirements for a specified and defined area within the PUD,
based on findings that:
         a.   The applicant provides a compelling land use reason that would
necessitate additional building height; and
         b.   Solar access is maintained to existing solar energy devices on
adjacent property.
      3.   Parking: The commission may grant an exception to the off- street
parking dimensional and minimum number of space requirements of the applicable
standard based on findings that the approval will result in one of the
following:
         a.   An exception which is not greater than ten percent (10%) of the
required parking.
         b.   At least one of the following:
            (1)   A proposed use which is designed for a specific purpose, is
intended to be permanent in nature (for example, a nursing home), and has a low
demand for off-street parking;
            (2)   An opportunity for sharing of parking including written
evidence that the property owners will enter into a binding legal agreement
(e.g., a joint non-concurrent parking agreement);
            (3)   Public transportation is available to the site.
      4.   Open Space: The commission may grant a reduction to the minimum open
space requirements of this section upon a finding that:
         a.   The development is within one-fourth (1/4) mile (measured in
actual walking distance) of a publicly accessible active open space area such
as a regional open space area or a regional public park; or
         b.   Additional amenities are provided in perpetuity to the residents
that are determined to sufficiently compensate for the loss of open space are
included in the PUD and available to all lots and users of the PUD.
      5.   Density: The commission may grant an exception to allow an increase
from the maximum density of the underlying zone, up to a maximum of one hundred
twenty percent (120%) of the underlying density, upon finding that:
         a.   Existing and proposed streets and pedestrian/bicycle systems
within and connecting to the development are adequate to support the proposed
density;
         b.   Existing and proposed water, sanitary sewer and storm drainage
facilities within and connecting to the development are adequate to support the
proposed density;
         c.   The increase does not necessitate unnecessary topographic
alterations or impact significant natural resource areas;
         d.   The development will provide usable common open space and other
amenities of exceptional quality or quantity, especially active recreational
areas; and
         e.   The additional density will be located internal to the project in
a manner which decreases the visual impact on adjacent properties.
In addition to findings in subsections M5a through M5e of this section, the
commission also finds that:
         f.   The development demonstrates innovative site design, outstanding
architectural variety, and quality of construction;
         g.   The development demonstrates a high level of compliance with
habitat friendly, low impact development practices;
         h.   The development demonstrates a high level of compliance with
recognized practices for sustainable development, such as (but not limited to)
the following: lot and structure orientation for passive and/or active solar
energy use; covenants ensuring maintenance of future solar access; use of wind
turbines or wind collectors for power generation or passive ventilation;
provision of community greenhouses, gardens, or orchards; use of water
conserving landscaping; use of stormwater harvesting or diversion for
irrigation; enhanced tree plantings; and use of green roofs; or
         i.   The development would provide for the implementation of a master
plan goal in a significant manner (e.g., provides that a quarter of the
proposed residential units are to be reserved to address the County's need for
affordable workforce housing).
   N.   Existing Projects: Existing projects may be considered for planned unit
development if, in the opinion of the Director, they do not pose any health,
safety or welfare problems and can comply with the minimum acreage, open space
and amenities requirements of a new planned unit development proposal.
   O.   Land Dedication: Any land or interest therein within a planned unit
development may be dedicated to the County or school district for public use
and maintenance, although the County or school district is under no obligation
to accept such dedication. In no event does land dedicated to and accepted by
the County or school district constitute common open space for the purposes of
this chapter. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.349.04: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL PROCESS:
A tentative and/or final subdivision map implementing a planned unit
development may not be approved until a land use plan has been approved for the

15.349.08: REVIEW OF APPLICATION FOR TENTATIVE APPROVAL:
   A.   An application for tentative approval of a PUD shall be filed by or on
behalf of the landowner. The application shall be filed with the department on
forms approved by the department and accompanied by the payment of all
applicable fees. Neither the Board, commission, nor any County department shall
undertake a review of the proposed development until all fees have been paid in
full and a complete application submittal has been received to the satisfaction
of the Director.
      1.   The complete application submittal must contain the fee payment, the
application form, the appropriate number of prints, and all information
required by section
15.349.07 of this chapter as well as additional information deemed necessary to
fully determine the potential impacts of the PUD by the Director. The term
"print" shall mean plans drawn in conformance with the requirements of the Lyon
County Design Criteria and Improvement Standards contained in appendix B on
file in the County.
   B.   The department, after submittal of the complete application, shall
circulate for review and comment the proposed design standards and development
plans. These design standards and plans will be reviewed by County, State, and
Federal agencies for compliance with applicable regulations and laws. The
agencies shall then respond, in written form, as to the changes and/or
conditions to be imposed upon the proposed development. These changes and/or
conditions will be incorporated into the staff report and relayed to the
landowner prior to the public hearing before the commission.
   C.   Tentative maps submitted together with the application for a PUD shall
be reviewed in accordance with the requirements of chapters 600 and 607 of this
title concurrent with the review and approval of the PUD. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.349.09: HEARING ON APPLICATION:
   A.   The commission shall hold a public hearing in conformance with the
development review and decision making requirements of chapters 6 and 10 of
this title.
   B.   The commission may continue a hearing to a specific time and may refer
the matter to the department staff for further study. In any event, however,
the public hearings shall be concluded within sixty (60) days after the date of
the first public hearing unless the landowner consents in writing to an
extension of time within which such hearings shall be concluded.
   C.   The commission shall consider all such evidence as presented by staff,
the applicant, and the public and shall make findings of fact relative to the
tentative map. Findings of fact shall not be inconsistent with the laws of the
State or the provisions of this title. The commission shall recommend
disapproval or conditional approval on every tentative map if the map does not
demonstrate full compliance with this title or Nevada Revised Statutes.
   D.   Recommendation of approval by the commission of the proposed planned
unit development plan and implementing tentative map(s) shall impose no
obligation on the part of the Board to approve either the plan or tentative map
(s) or to accept any public dedication shown thereon.
   E.   The Board shall consider the commission's report and any new evidence
as presented by the staff, the applicant, or the public. The Board may continue
a hearing to a specific time and may refer the matter back to staff or the
commission for further study. In any event, however, the public hearings shall
be concluded within sixty (60) days after receipt of the commission report
unless the applicant agrees in writing to extend the 60-day period.
   F.   The Board shall, after the conclusion of public hearings by minute
action, grant tentative approval, tentative approval subject to specific
conditions, or denial of a tentative plan, and all maps necessary to implement
the approved plan. When tentative approval is granted, the Board shall specify
the maps, drawings, specifications, and form of performance bond that shall
accompany the application for final approval. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.349.10: APPROVAL OR DENIAL OF APPLICATION:
The approval or denial of a tentative planned unit development plan shall be by
minute action and shall set forth the reasons for the approval or for the
denial, and in the case of approval, shall set a specific date for the filing
of an application for final approval of the planned unit development, or in the
case of phased development over a period of years, shall set the specific
periods within which applications for final approvals of each part thereof must
be filed. The minutes shall also set forth with particularity in what respects
the plan would or would not be in the public interest, including but not
limited to, the following findings:
   A.   In what respects the plan is or is not consistent with the statement of
objectives of this chapter;
   B.   The extent to which the plan departs from zoning and planned unit
development regulations otherwise applicable to the property, including but not
limited to density, size and use, and the reasons such departures are or are
not deemed to be in the public interest;
   C.   The purpose, location and amount of the open space in the planned unit
development, the reliability of the proposals for maintenance and conservation
of the open space and the adequacy or inadequacy of the amount and purpose of
the open space as related to the proposed density and type of residential
development;
   D.   A physical design of the plan and in the manner in which such design
does or does not make adequate provision for public services, provide adequate
control over vehicular traffic, parking requirements, and further the amenities
of light and air, recreation and visual enjoyment;
   E.   The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed planned unit
development to the neighborhood in which it is proposed;
   F.   In the case of a plan which proposes a development over a period of
years, the sufficiency of the terms and conditions intended to protect the
interest of the public and the residents of the planned unit development in the
integrity of the plan. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.349.11: EFFECT OF TENTATIVE APPROVAL:
Tentative approval of a plan does not qualify a map or plat of the planned unit
development for recording or authorize development or the issuance of any
building permits. A plan which has been given tentative approval as submitted,
or which has been given tentative approval with conditions which have been
accepted by the applicant, may not be modified, revoked, or otherwise impaired
by action of the County pending an application for final approval, without the
consent of the applicant. Impairment by the County is not stayed if an
application for final approval has not been filed, or in the case of
development over a period of years applications for approval of the several
parts have not been filed, within the time specified in the minutes granting
tentative approval.
The tentative approval must be revoked and the portion of the area included in
the plan for which final approval has not been given shall revert to the master
plan designations and zoning classifications in effect on the date of initial
application for a planned unit development and shall be subject to this title
if:
   A.   The applicant/landowner elects to abandon the plan or any part thereof,
and so notifies the County in writing, or
   B.   The applicant/landowner fails to file application for final approval
within the required time. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.349.12: TIME LIMITS FOR FILING APPLICATION FOR FINAL APPROVAL:
Unless the time is specified in an agreement entered into pursuant to Nevada
Revised Statutes 278.0201, when the applicant has been granted tentative
approval of a PUD, the applicant shall file an application for final approval
of the plan, and a map or maps for the first phase or unit of the PUD, within
one year from the date of tentative approval as granted by the Board. Specific
Final Map filing dates for all phases may be extended, upon application to the
Board, but in no event shall the dates exceed two (2) years from the previously
established final filing date. Tentative approval of a plan does not qualify a
plat of the PUD for recording or authorize development or the issuance of any
building permits. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.349.13: FINAL APPROVAL:
   A.   Application: An application for final approval of a planned unit
development shall be made for all the land included in a plan or to the extent
set forth in the tentative approval for a section thereof. Such application
shall be made to the department within the time specified by the minutes
granting tentative approval. The County Engineer and the department shall
review, within thirty (30) days, the final approval plan for compliance with
the approved tentative approval plan.
      1.   If the plan, as submitted for final approval, is not in substantial
compliance with the plan as given tentative approval, the Director shall,
within thirty (30) days of the date of the filing of the application for final
approval, notify the applicant in writing, setting forth the particular ways in
which the final approval plan is not in substantial compliance. Thereupon, the
applicant may:
         a.   Treat such notification as a denial of final approval;
         b.   Refile his plan in a form which is in substantial compliance with
the plan as tentatively approved; or
         c.   File a written request with the department that the Board hold a
public hearing on the application for final approval.
      2.   If the applicant elects the alternatives set out in subsection A1b
or A1c of this section, he must refile his plan or file a request for a public
hearing on or before the last day of the time within which he was authorized to
file for final approval, or thirty (30) days from the date he receives notice
that his plan is not in substantial compliance, whichever is later. Failure to
refile a request for public hearing within such time period shall constitute an
abandonment of the plan by the applicant.
         a.   The burden shall be upon the applicant to show the Board good
cause for any variation between the plan as tentatively approved and the plan
as submitted for final approval.
         b.   Any such public hearing shall be held by the Board within thirty
(30) days after the request for the hearing is made by the applicant. The Board
shall, by minute action, either grant final approval to the plan or deny final
approval to the plan. The grant or denial of final approval of the plan shall,
in cases arising under this section, contain the matters required with respect
to an application for tentative approval by section
15.349.08 of this chapter. The Board may continue the hearing, but in no case
shall action on the map exceed sixty (60) days from the first hearing date.
      3.   If any errors or omissions are found on the prints of the final plan
submitted to the County for checking, the final plan shall be returned to the
subdivider or his engineer for correction. When the corrected plans has been
received and approved, the County Engineer and Director shall then notify, by
certified mail, the land owner if the final plan is in compliance. The thirty
(30) day review period shall be extended by the number of days it takes to get
the final approval plan corrected. The applicant shall then have ninety (90)
days, upon receipt of the County's letter, to record the final plan, if the
final approval plan is in substantial compliance with the plan that had been
granted tentative approval.
   B.   Contents Of Application: The application shall include such maps,
drawings, design and development standards, architectural building elevations,
use specification, covenants, easements, conditions and form of performance
bond as were set forth in the public record and Board minutes at the time of
tentative approval of the planned unit development.
   C.   Hearing: A public hearing on an application for final approval for a
planned unit development and zoning map amendment approval of the final planned
unit development plan or any part thereof, shall not be required if the plan,
or any part thereof, submitted for final approval is in substantial compliance
with the plan that had been granted tentative approval. The plan submitted for
final approval shall be in substantial compliance with plans previously
approved if modifications by the applicant do not:
      1.   Vary the proposed gross residential density or the number of units
proposed;
      2.   Involve a reduction of the area set aside for common or private open
space or modify the maintenance agreements;
      3.   Increase the total ground coverage of buildings or involve a
substantial change in the height of buildings;
      4.   Vary circulation, drainage, or utility patterns;
      5.   Vary the substance of the covenants, conditions, and restrictions.
   D.   Expiration: Only when final approval has been granted and the final
approval plan recorded shall the notation of this fact be placed on the zoning
map. If construction of the approved planned unit development has not begun
within one year of the recording of the final approval plan, the final approval
plan shall expire and the zoning of the site shall revert to the zoning
classification in place at the time of initial application for a planned unit
development and the zoning map amended to reflect the reversion unless an
alternative time is specified in the tentative PUD approval or in a development
agreement entered into pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 278.0201. (Ord. 603,
11-1-2018)
15.349.14: CERTIFICATION OF THE FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN:
Approval of a plan, or any part thereof, which has been given final approval,
shall be certified without delay by the proper authorities and shall be filed
within ninety (90) days of final approval in the Office of the County Recorder
before the approval of a final subdivision map for the development and the
issuance of any building permits for the development. The Recorder shall
collect a fee pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.349.15: ABANDONMENT OF FINAL PLAN:
   A.   No further development shall take place on the property included in the
final approval plan until the property is resubdivided and is reclassified by
an enactment of an amendment to the zoning if:
      1.   The landowner abandons the final approval plan or any sections of
the final approval plan and gives written notification thereof to the Director;
or
      2.   The applicant fails to begin the planned unit development within the
prescribed period of time after the final approval has been granted.
   B.   Upon abandonment of a final plan, all property not previously developed
as part of the planned unit development shall revert to the zoning
classification in place at the time of initial application for a planned unit
development. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.349.16: JUDICIAL REVIEW:
Any decision of the Board under this chapter granting or denying tentative or
final approval of the plan or authorizing or refusing to authorize a
modification in a plan is a final administrative decision and is subject to
judicial review in a properly presented case. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)

15.351.05: HARDSHIP EXCEPTION FOR MANUFACTURED HOME USED AS AN ACCESSORY
DWELLING:
The Director may by special exception allow the installation of an MH in
addition to the primary residence on a residential lot. The lot must be not
less than one acre (gross) in size.
   A.   In approving a special exception, the Director must find:
      1.   That the additional MH conforms to the requirements for an accessory
dwelling contained in section
15.335.03 of this title.
      2.   That the authorization of the additional MH is for the sole and
express purpose of facilitating the care of an immediate relative.
      3.   That the authorization of the additional MH is intended to mitigate
a special hardship resulting from handicap, age or infirmity as evidenced by a
physician's certification. (Financial hardship alone shall not be sufficient
grounds.)
      4.   That the authorization of the additional MH will not substantially
impact the surrounding property owners.
      5.   That sufficient sewer, electrical power and water facilities and
water rights are available to serve the additional MH.
   B.   An MH approved under this section shall not be permanently affixed to
the residential lot, and shall be maintained in a condition to permit removal
of the unit upon termination of the hardship exception.
   C.   The authorization of an additional MH may be upon such additional terms
and conditions as the Director deems appropriate for the approval of the
special exception.
   D.   Any MH authorized under this section may remain on the property only as
long as the person for whom it was issued shall continue to reside in said MH
and the special hardship shall continue to exist.
   E.   A notice of continuing use must be filed with the Director by the
special exception grantee annually certifying that the special exception
continues to be necessary under the same terms and conditions as the original
approval.
   F.   At the time the applicant submits request for a special exception, the
Director shall notify all property owners located within three hundred feet
(300') of the parcel upon which the MH will be placed that the application has
been received. The notification letter shall advise the property owners that
this chapter contains language directing the Director to permit these hardship
exceptions administratively, provided they comply with this chapter's
provisions. The notification letter shall call to the property owners'
attention that the Director will be reviewing the land use request and
providing a determination on a date certain. The notification letter shall
encourage property owners to contact the Director with their concerns and
issues prior to that date. The notification letter shall advise these property
owners that they may appeal the Director's determination in writing to the Lyon
County Manager's Office within ten (10) days of the Director's determination.
The notification letter shall further advise that the Board is the Appeal
Authority and clarify that their review is limited to a determination that the
Director failed to take in account some provision of this chapter that would
serve as a basis for its denial or modification. The Board shall convene a
public hearing for purpose of reviewing the Director's decision within thirty
(30) days of receiving the written appeal. The County Manager's Office shall
provide for the public notification according to the County's land use
notification process. Absent some finding that the Director erred in the
assessment, the Board shall uphold the Director's decision and direct approval
of the hardship exception. If the Board determines that the Director erred in
the assessment, they may conduct their own public hearing, relying upon this
chapter for review and guidance, or they may remand the matter back to the
Director with guidance.
   G.   The sale of the lot upon which an additional manufactured home has been
authorized or the discontinuance of the specific hardship shall result in the
automatic cancellation of the special exception approval for the additional
manufactured home. Upon cancellation, the additional MH must be removed within
thirty (30) calendar days. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.351.06: PERMIT REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Permits are required for manufactured homes in the following instances:
      1.   Prior to moving a manufactured home on any lot or parcel for the
purpose of establishing a single-family residence, an installation permit must

person to do any construction, erection, alteration, installation, addition,
reconstruction or moving of any manufactured home unless the appropriate permit
has first been obtained from the Building Department.
      2.   If the electric or fuel gas has been disconnected from a
manufactured home for greater than six (6) months, the owner must obtain a
permit from the County Building Department prior to occupancy or connection of
the electric or fuel gas service.
      3.   The fee for issuance of said permits shall be set by resolution of
the Board.
   B.   Permit applications shall contain all documents and information as
required by the Building Department. Such applications may be reviewed by other
departments of State or local government for compliance with the laws and
ordinances under their jurisdiction. If the Building Department is satisfied
that the work described in an application for permit and plans filed therewith
conform to the requirements of this title and other pertinent laws and
ordinances, it may issue the appropriate permit(s). All work done under the
permit(s) shall be done in accordance with the approved plans. Plans and
specifications shall not be changed, modified or altered without authorization
from the building official.
   C.   The following limitations and requirements shall apply to manufactured
home permits:
      1.   Prior to moving an MH onto the lot or parcel, an installation permit
and appropriate utility service permit must be obtained from the Building
Department.
      2.   An application to place an MH on a residential lot pursuant to this
chapter constitutes an attestation by the owner of the lot that the placement
complies with all covenants, conditions and restrictions placed on the lot and
that the lot is not within a Historic District.
      3.   An MH installation permit will expire one hundred eighty (180) days
after the date of issuance unless a time extension is granted by the Building
Department. The building official may grant a onetime thirty (30) day extension
upon request and payment of an administrative fee as set by resolution of the
Board.
      4.   The applicant must obtain all inspections required by the State,
utility purveyor and County departments in order to receive a final approval
for occupancy from the building official. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.351.07: CONVERTING MANUFACTURED HOME TO REAL PROPERTY:
   A.   All manufactured homes and factory built housing installed on or after
July 1, 1998, that are eligible for conversion under Nevada law, shall be
converted to real property pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes section 361.244.
   B.   All persons or entities seeking a manufactured home installation permit
shall complete an agreement to convert to real property prior to Lyon County
issuing the installation permit. The agreement will require that the applicant

15.360.03: EXEMPT COMMERCIAL USES:
Commercial uses conducted as a home occupation or home based business shall not
be subject to the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.360.04: GENERAL STANDARDS:
   A.   Site Layout:
      1.   Siting: The siting of the building should:
         a.   Reflect, rather than obscure natural topography.
         b.   Encourage preservation of significant or important trees.
         c.   Be compatible with the original structure, when the structure is
an addition to an existing structure.
      2.   Building Orientation: Local climatic conditions shall be considered
when orienting buildings. For example, north-facing facades are especially
susceptible to winter snow and ice accumulation, and entries may require
special treatment. Snow shed from roofs and snow piling zones along streets
shall be considered in arranging building elements on the site. Adequate solar
access shall be considered when planning outdoor spaces, with shade and relief
from glare provided by landscaping and overhead structures.
      3.   Development Responsive To Site Conditions: Development shall respond
to specific site conditions and opportunities such as odd-shaped lots, location
on prominent intersections, unusual topography, protection of view corridors,
significant vegetation, and/or other natural features to the maximum extent
feasible.
      4.   Street Corners: Buildings located on street corners should recognize
the importance of their location by:
         a.   Concentrating tallest portions of the building at the
intersection where they may "frame" the corner;
         b.   Employing architectural features, such as angled facades,
prominent entrances, a stepped parapet wall, or other unique building features
at the corner; or
         c.   Employing a similar technique as approved by the Director.
      5.   Pedestrian Environment:
         a.   Site design shall locate pedestrian routes connecting
residential, recreational, and commercial uses to minimize contact with normal
vehicular traffic. This can be achieved by designing crossings at traffic stop
points, and/or by announcing crossings with signage, pavement changes, and
landscape features.
Open spaces of adjoining properties are located to join together and link
properties, while walkways link properties and add connection to other
pedestrian facilities.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2361.jpg]
 
         b.   Pedestrian use can be increased by the addition of amenities such
as benches, drinking fountains, planters, trash receptacles, path lighting, and
bicycle racks in quantities and locations appropriate for the development.
         c.   When existing sidewalks, curbs, gutters, or other public
improvements have deteriorated, the development shall be required to replace
and/or repair the public amenities.
         d.   New development required to install sidewalks may be assessed an
in lieu fee for pedestrian improvements, as determined appropriate by the
Director and County Engineer, to mitigate the construction of certain
pedestrian improvements.
         e.   When sidewalks exist or are proposed, new development should be
sited and designed to encourage human activity on the street.
         f.   Construction of and/or land dedication for pedestrian
improvements may be required pursuant to the land division regulations and/or
development improvement agreement.
         g.   Pedestrian facilities shall be designed and constructed to meet
or exceed the development standards contained in appendix B on file in the
County.
   B.   Building Design:
      1.   Building Massing And Form: Unless otherwise provided in this title,
building form may vary widely, as long as certain features of building form are
considered:
         a.   Within the development, variability in size and shape of
buildings shall occur.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2363.jpg]
 
         b.   Incorporating human-scaled features at the ground level, referred
to as "differentiation of ground level", will help to encourage pedestrian use.
Examples are: articulated entries and windows, canopies, arcades, recessed
entries, changes in color, material, or texture.
         c.   Facade modulation shall be utilized to reduce the apparent bulk
of a large building, where applicable.

architectural or cultural context of the application.
         c.   Plastic may be considered for sign letters only.
      3.   Architectural Style: The architectural character of new buildings or
additions shall complement the architectural character of adjacent existing
buildings.
      4.   Four-Sided Design: All building facades shall be designed with a
similar level of design detail. Blank walls void of architectural detailing
shall not be permitted. Exceptions may be granted for those areas of the
building envelope that the applicant can demonstrate are not visible from
adjacent development, public rights-of-way, or trails.
      5.   Entrance Visibility: Entrances shall be clearly delineated and
visible from the street.
         a.   Buildings should be designed with delineated and unobstructed
entries accessible from adjacent streets, as opposed to entries accessible only
from parking lots.

15.360.05: ADDITIONAL STANDARDS; PROPERTIES WITH HIGHWAY 50 OR HIGHWAY 95A
FRONTAGE:
   A.   Applicability: Development of any site or structure that will contain a
commercial use, or a mix of commercial and other uses adjacent to the rights-
of-way of Highway 50 or Highway 95A, with the exception of those properties
located within a Historic Character District, shall comply with the general
site layout and building design standards of section
15.360.04 of this chapter, plus the standards of this section.
   B.   Setbacks:
      1.   Highway Landscape Buffer: All development shall be buffered from
Highway 50 or Highway 95A by a landscaped area. Commercial development within
Regional Commercial Districts the minimum buffer shall be ten feet (10') deep
with drought tolerant trees, shrubbery and rock mulch. Commercial development
within Community Commercial, Highway Mixed-Use, Commercial Mixed-Use and
Neighborhood Commercial Districts the buffer shall be ten feet (10') measured
from the property line. Buildings and parking areas shall not be located in
this buffer area. On sites with severe topographic/physical constraints, this
landscaped buffer may be reduced at the discretion of the Director.
   C.   Building Orientation:
      1.   Uses with highway frontage shall have a strong internal focus,
rather than a highway orientation. Entryways shall face towards the internal
road system. A highway orientation will be permitted where lot depths make it
difficult to achieve an internal focus.
      2.   Developers shall carefully consider building orientation to achieve
effective overall site planning. Although legibility of signs identifying
businesses from the highway is important, buildings shall be oriented towards
focal points within the development itself. These focal points may include
unique natural features, a building of central importance, internal streets, or
planned open space.
      3.   Adjacent residential land uses shall be considered when orienting
buildings on properties with highway frontage. Service and utility entrances,
mechanical support facilities, and unimproved building "back sides" shall not
be located within view of neighboring residences or visible from highway right-
of-way. Service and utility courts or alleys may contain these necessary
support functions.
Landscaped areas buffer the edges of this development.
Pedestrian ways connect to adjoining properties.
Pedestrian ways link parking areas with buildings and open space in a
coordinated system for this development.

   D.   Access: Coordinated access points along Highway 50 and Highway 95A will
be required in accordance with NDOT requirements. Location and design of these
highway accesses will be based on projected traffic flows and NDOT standards,
policies and guidelines. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.360.06: ADDITIONAL STANDARDS; COMMERCIAL MIXED-USE ZONING DISTRICTS:
   A.   Purpose: These standards are intended to preserve and enhance the
unique character and identity of current and planned commercial mixed-use
areas, Historic Districts and rural community centers, and ensure that future
infill and redevelopment is consistent with the County's Comprehensive Master
Plan. A high-quality appearance will be achieved through requirements for
context-sensitive site layouts, architectural detailing, facade articulation,
and other features designed to provide a more distinct character and pedestrian
scale. Unique characteristics and distinctions in scale and use between the
Suburban and Rural Character Districts will be achieved through tailored
standards as necessary. The alternative equivalent compliance process in
section
15.330.04 of this title is available to help tailor standards for specific
sites as necessary.
   B.   Applicability: Development of any site or structure that will contain a
commercial use, or a mix of commercial and other uses, or that is located
within a Commercial Mixed-Use Zoning District, shall comply with the general
site layout and building design standards of section
15.360.04 of this chapter, plus the standards of this section.
   C.   Site Planning:
      1.   Primary Entrances: Primary entrances shall be oriented towards and
visible from the primary street frontage.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2379.jpg]
 
      2.   Outdoor Gathering Spaces: Developments consisting of at least twenty
five thousand (25,000) square feet in size shall incorporate outdoor gathering
spaces. Outdoor gathering spaces may include, but are not limited to, plazas,
mini-parks, or courtyards that are open to and accessible to the public.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/dd62f16ea91c6fb0d01da5553d0f3c050135725a/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2425.jpg]
 
         a.   Minimum Size: All outdoor gathering spaces shall have a minimum
depth and width of twenty feet (20') and a minimum total area of one thousand
(1,000) square feet.
         b.   Pedestrian Amenities: Outdoor gathering spaces shall include
amenities that encourage pedestrian activity, such as benches, water features,
drinking fountains, planters, public art, trash receptacles and bicycle racks.
      3.   Parking Location: Surface parking shall be located behind buildings.
Surface parking will not be permitted between the building and the primary
street frontage or to the side of the building where it may be viewed from the
primary street frontage.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/dd62f16ea91c6fb0d01da5553d0f3c050135725a/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2427.jpg]
 
      4.   Ground-Floor Uses: The incorporation of retail shops and/or
restaurants is encouraged at the street level to promote a more active
environment for pedestrians and to support residential and office uses located
within the same building (on upper floors) or nearby. This configuration of
uses is particularly encouraged along Main Street, Pike Street, Ziller Way, and
Highway 50 in the Dayton Historic District, Highway 342 in Silver City and
other downtown street frontages, as well as new developments in Commercial
Mixed-Use Zones, and adjacent to major public spaces, where a high level of
activity and visibility is desirable. If a limited portion of a structure's
ground level will be devoted to retail or restaurant space, such space should
be located along those facades adjacent to or most visible from primary street
frontages or major pedestrian walkways.
      5.   Build-To Line: First floors of all commercial buildings within CMU-
S and CMU-H Districts shall "build to" the back of the sidewalk or edge of
property. Exceptions to the build-to line may be permitted if:
         a.   The space set back from the build-to line is used for an outdoor
gathering space, as defined in subsection C2 of this section;
         b.   The space set back from the build-to line is designed as a
protected walkway for pedestrians, with the second floor placed at the build-to
line; or
         c.   The space set back from the build-to line is used to provide a
mid-block pedestrian connection to an outdoor gathering space or additional
commercial uses at the rear of the building or to an adjacent trail corridor.
Mid-block pedestrian connections shall be a minimum of fifteen feet (15') in
width.
      6.   Build-To Zone:
         a.   A variable setback is typical of rural community centers;
therefore, placement of the front building facade is guided by a flexible
build-to zone as set forth below.
            (1)   First floors of all buildings within a Commercial Mixed-Use
Zone in a Rural Character District shall build to the "build-to- zone", which
shall be the area located from fifteen feet (15') to twenty feet (20') from the
back of sidewalk or property line.
         b.   The front building facade may only be located outside of the
build-to-zone to:
            (1)   Reflect existing, adjacent development (in which case
buildings shall be built to the average setback of the adjacent existing
structures);
            (2)   Accommodate an outdoor gathering space, as defined in
subsection C2 of this section;
            (3)   Reflect the regular rhythm of residential homes interrupted
by side yards traditionally found in Historic Districts and rural community
centers;
            (4)   Reflect distinctions in use within the building; or
            (5)   Accomplish a similar objective, as approved by the Director.
         c.   Portions of the front facade of the building built that are not
located within the build-to zone shall:
            (1)   Not extend further than five feet (5') from the build-to
zone; and
            (2)   Be limited to twenty feet (20') in length or twenty percent
(20%) of the length of the front facade, whichever is less.
   D.   Building Considerations:
      1.   Building Articulation: The perceived mass and scale of development
shall be reduced to achieve a human scale. This shall be accomplished by
incorporating a series of smaller design elements that are consistent with the
development's architectural character. Appropriate design elements for every
development shall incorporate, but are not limited to, at least four (4) of the
following:
         a.   Variations in roof form and parapet heights;
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/dd62f16ea91c6fb0d01da5553d0f3c050135725a/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2429.jpg]
 
         b.   Pronounced recesses and projections;
         c.   Wall plane off-sets;
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/dd62f16ea91c6fb0d01da5553d0f3c050135725a/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2431.jpg]
 
         d.   Off-sets to accommodate outdoor gathering spaces;
         e.   Distinct changes in texture and color of wall surfaces;
         f.   Ground-level arcades and second or third-floor galleries/
balconies;
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/dd62f16ea91c6fb0d01da5553d0f3c050135725a/

         g.   Protected and recessed entries; and
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/dd62f16ea91c6fb0d01da5553d0f3c050135725a/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2435.jpg]
 
         h.   Vertical accents or focal points.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/dd62f16ea91c6fb0d01da5553d0f3c050135725a/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2437.jpg]
 
      2.   Building Height/Mass: A single, large, dominant building mass shall
be prohibited.
      3.   Lot Consolidation: The consolidation of existing lots is permitted
to enhance infill and redevelopment opportunities. However, the following
standards shall apply for developments occupying two (2) or more combined lots.
         a.   Historic Districts: Facade modulation shall be provided to
reflect traditional storefront widths within the downtown core, which range
from twenty five feet (25') to fifty feet (50') in width.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/dd62f16ea91c6fb0d01da5553d0f3c050135725a/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2439.jpg]
 
         b.   CMU-R Districts: Facade modulation shall be provided to reflect
the traditional character and design of structures.
      4.   Building Design And Character:
         a.   Roof Form:
            (1)   Flat roof forms with parapet walls are traditionally found in
Historic Districts. Large, unbroken expanses and long, continuous rooflines
shall be prohibited.
            (2)   Box-like structures and flat roofs are incompatible with the
traditionally residential character of rural community centers. A variety of
roof forms and surfaces (pitched, shed, and dormers) shall be incorporated into
structures to break up large roof planes, provide visual interest, and manage
snow loads.
            (3)   Flat roof sections shall be limited to a maximum of one-third
(1/3) of the total roof area and shall be located where they are not visible
from the primary street frontage or public right-of- way.
         b.   Materials: Primary building materials shall be durable and
project an image of permanence typical of traditional masonry storefronts and
many of historic residences.
         c.   Color: The use of historic color schemes in Historic Districts is
encouraged. Historic color palettes are provided in Design Guidelines for the
Comstock Historic District. Bright colors shall be limited to use for accents
and decorative details such as window details, storefronts and entrances.
         d.   Awnings: Awnings, when used, shall be designed as integral
elements of the building facade. Material, configuration, dimension, and
location of awnings shall be appropriate for the building.
      5.   Street Level Transparency: A minimum percentage of the total area of
each ground-floor building facade that faces a street, plaza, park, or other
public space, shall be comprised of transparent window openings to allow views
of interior spaces and merchandise, to enhance the safety of public spaces by
providing direct visibility to the street, and to create a more inviting
environment for pedestrians. Such openings shall be taller than they are wide.
Minimum percentages vary by location and use as follows:
         a.   Historic Districts: Non-residential uses: Fifty percent (50%)
minimum.
         b.   CMU-R: Non-residential uses: Forty percent (40%) minimum. (Ord.
603, 11-1-2018)
15.360.07: ADDITIONAL STANDARDS; BUILDINGS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET IN
SIZE AND GREATER:
   A.   Applicability: Development of any structure that will be twenty five
thousand (25,000) square feet in size or greater shall comply with the general
site layout and building design standards of section
15.360.04 of this chapter, plus the standards of this section.
   B.   Setbacks: The required setbacks shall comply with the setbacks in
chapter 313 of this title. Reduced setbacks may be approved by the commission
if the overall design of the building reflects an "urban" style building form
and site design (e.g., connected sidewalks, on-street parking, benches, display
windows, awnings, etc.).
   C.   Building Height, Bulk, Scale: Buildings should be visually harmonious
with their surroundings, by considering the scale, proportions and character of
adjacent structures and landforms. The design of a new building or addition
should incorporate architectural features, elements and details to achieve
human scale, if appropriate. Building elements that should be enlisted to
achieve a better human scale include:
      1.   Pedestrian-oriented open space, such as courtyards or other unified
landscaped areas, upper story setbacks, a porch or cover entry, awnings,
limited signage, and street furniture.
      2.   Buildings greater than one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet
should be multi-story.
      3.   If a large retail building is part of a development, variability in
size and shape of buildings is encouraged.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2441.jpg]
 
   D.   Architectural Elements, Materials And Color:
      1.   Architectural Elements:
         a.   Buildings should be unique and appropriate to the community and
should not be recognizable by its architecture as a standard trademark design.
Generic franchise architecture shall not be acceptable unless modified to meet
these standards.
         b.   Box-like structures and flat roofs are discouraged.
         c.   Roof forms will be highly visible at a distance, and projects
shall avoid large, unbroken expanses and long, continuous rooflines by
variation in rooflines and height. The addition of dormers, balconies, deep
eaves and overhangs may create visual interest.

      2.   Materials: The use of neon is prohibited for any architectural
application, such as building trim. See chapter 403 of this title for the
standards relating to the use of neon in signs.
      3.   Color: Attention must be paid to the use of color on buildings as it
affects the visual aesthetics of the community.
         a.   Bright colors should be used minimally and may be considered only
for accents and decorative details such as window details and entrances.
         b.   Colors should be used to coordinate the entire building facade as
a composition. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)

15.401.02: APPLICABILITY:
   A.   Generally:
      1.   The off-street parking and loading standards of this section shall
apply to all parking lots and parking structures accessory to any building
constructed and to any use established in every district.
      2.   The requirements of this section shall apply to all temporary
parking lots and parking lots that are the principal use on a site.
      3.   The Director may approve the use of alternative parking space
requirements based on Urban Land Institute, American Planning Association,
Institute of Transportation Engineers or other similar professional analytical
studies approved by the Director, that take into account monthly, hourly and
weekly variation; peaking characteristics, ride-share programs, proximity to
transit stops and shared uses. The applicant shall provide justification of the
use of and appropriateness of alternative parking number calculations instead
of the current Lyon County Code parking requirements.
   B.   Expansions And Enlargements And Changes In Use: The off-street parking
and loading standards of this chapter shall apply when an existing structure or
use is expanded or enlarged, or when there is a change in use. Additional off-
street parking and loading spaces shall be required to serve the enlarged or
expanded area or the new use, provided that in all cases the number of off-
street parking and loading spaces provided for the entire use (pre-existing
plus expansion) equal one hundred percent (100%) of the minimum ratio
established in this chapter. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)

Schedule B", of this subsection, as indicated in subsection A, table 15.401-
1 of this section shall provide the minimum number of off-street parking spaces
listed in table 15.401-2 of this subsection. Unless otherwise approved, lots
containing more than one activity shall provide parking and loading in an
amount equal to the total of the requirements for all activities.

   C.   Schedule C: Uses that reference "schedule C" in subsection A, table
15.401-1 of this section have widely varying parking and loading demand
characteristics, making it impossible to specify a single off-street parking or
loading standard. Upon receiving a development application for a use subject to
schedule C standards, the building official and the Director shall apply the
off-street parking and loading standard specified for the listed use that is
deemed most similar to the proposed use or establish minimum off-street parking
requirements on the basis of a parking and loading study prepared by the
applicant. Such a study shall include estimates of parking demand based on
recommendations of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), Urban Land
Institute, American Planning Association or other acceptable professional
analytical estimates as approved by the Director, and should include other
reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as
or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by
density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study shall
document the source of data used to develop the recommendations.
   D.   Maximum Number Of Spaces Permitted:
      1.   General Maximum Requirement: For any use categorized as a
"commercial" or "industrial" use in chapter 320, "Land Use Tables", of this
title, off-street vehicle parking spaces shall not be provided in an amount
that is more than one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the minimum
requirements established in subsection A, table 15.401-1, "Off-Street Parking
Schedule A", of this section.
      2.   Exceptions:
         a.   If application of the maximum parking standard would result in
less than six (6) parking spaces, the development shall be allowed six (6)
parking spaces.
         b.   For the purpose of calculating parking requirements, the
following types of parking spaces shall not count against the maximum parking
requirement, but shall count toward the minimum requirement:
            (1)   Accessible parking;
            (2)   Vanpool and carpool parking;
            (3)   Structured parking, underground parking, and parking within,
above, or beneath the building(s) it serves.
For the purpose of calculating parking requirements, fleet vehicle parking
spaces shall not count against either the minimum or maximum requirements.
         c.   Exceptions to the maximum parking requirement may be allowed in
situations that meet all of the following criteria as determined by the
Director:
            (1)   The proposed development has unique or unusual
characteristics such as high sales volume per floor area or low parking
turnover, which create a parking demand that exceeds the maximum ratio and
which typically does not apply to comparable uses; and,
            (2)   The parking demand cannot be accommodated by on-street
parking, shared parking with nearby uses, or by increasing the supply of spaces
that are exempt from the maximum ratio; and,
            (3)   The request is the minimum necessary variation from the
standards; and,
            (4)   If located in a Mixed-Use District, the uses in the proposed
development and the site design are highly supportive of the mixed-use concept
and support high levels of existing or planned transit and pedestrian activity.
   E.   Computation Of Parking And Loading Requirements:
      1.   Fractions: When measurements of the number of required spaces result
in a fractional number, any fraction shall be rounded up to the next higher
whole number.
      2.   Multiple Uses: Lots containing more than one use shall provide
parking and loading in an amount equal to the total of the requirements for all
uses.
      3.   Area Measurements: Unless otherwise specified, all square footage-
based parking and loading standards shall be computed on the basis of floor
area of the use in question. Bathrooms, utility rooms, hallways/corridors and
other similar areas that are accessory and do not generate a demand for parking
are not included in the computations of the floor area to determine parking
requirements. Structured parking within a building shall not be counted in such
measurement.
      4.   Computation Of Off-Street Parking: Required off-street loading space
shall not be included as off-street parking space in computation of required
off-street parking space.
      5.   Parking For Unlisted Uses: Parking requirements for uses not
specifically listed in subsection A, table 15.401-1 of this section shall be
determined by the Director based on the requirements for the closest comparable
use, as well as on the particular parking demand and trip generation
characteristics of the proposed use. The Director may alternately require the
submittal of a parking demand study that justifies estimates of parking demand
based on the recommendations of the Institute of Transportation Engineers,
Urban Land Institute, American Planning Association, or other acceptable
similar professional analytical body, and includes relevant data collected from
uses or combinations of uses that are the same or comparable to the proposed
use in terms of density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location.

15.401.04: PARKING AREA LAYOUT AND DESIGN:
   A.   Stall Dimensions:
      1.   Parking stall and aisle dimensions shall be measured from the middle
of the stall stripe of a parking stall to the middle of the adjacent stall
stripe. Aisles for two-way flows shall be a minimum of twenty four feet (24'),
except when no spaces are backing onto the aisle, in which case width shall be
twenty feet (20').
      2.   One universally accessible, ADA-compatible, space shall be provided
in each parking lot in compliance with the adopted Building Code, and as set
forth in the following table:
      TABLE 15.401-3
      ACCESSIBLE PARKING REQUIREMENTS
Total Parking   Minimum Number Of
Spaces Provided Accessible Spaces
Total Parking    Minimum Number Of
Spaces Provided  Accessible Spaces
   1 to 25    1
   26 to 50   2
   51 to 75   3

   151 to 200 6
   201 to 300 7
   301 to 400 8
   401 to 500 9
   More than 52 percent of total
 
      3.   In parking lots of twenty (20) spaces or more, special
considerations will be made for compact car spatial dimensions.
      4.   The following standards may be used as guidelines for the design of
indoor and outdoor parking stalls:

   B.   Parking Area Layout:
      1.   Surface: All parking and driveway areas and primary access to
parking facilities shall be surfaced with asphalt, concrete or other similar
materials, unless otherwise approved by the County Engineer. Accent paving is
recommended to indicate pedestrian linkages.
      2.   Integrate Parking Lots With Surroundings: Parking lots shall not
dominate the frontage of pedestrian-oriented streets, interfere with designated
pedestrian routes, or negatively impact surrounding neighborhoods. The
pedestrian character of streets and building shall be maximized through
continuity of building and landscape frontage.
      3.   Design Standards: All parking lot placement and design shall comply
with the applicable standards in chapters 360, "Commercial And Mixed-Use Design
Standards", and 348, "Multi-Family Residential Design Standards", of this
title.
      4.   Lot Size: Required parking shall be broken into component parking
lots, avoiding large, unrelieved expanses of paving.
   C.   Landscaping: A landscaped buffer zone of five feet (5') to ten feet
(10') may be required between the actual parking area, major arterial, or major
pedestrian route. Additionally, in areas that provide parking for more than ten
(10) vehicles, at least ten percent (10%) of the total area of the parking lot
shall be used for landscaping and/or aesthetic treatment. The following
landscaping standards shall be met:
      1.   A minimum of one tree planted in landscaped tree islands for every
eight (8) parking spaces shall be located within the parking area/lot.
      2.   Tree islands shall be installed intermittently and have a length
equal to the adjacent parking stalls, contain sufficient area to protect
plantings from vehicles and foot traffic and accommodate a tree root system
with a clear area of earth not less than three feet (3') in width.
      3.   Tree islands and other landscaping features on a site should be
utilized where practical as low impact development (LID) features to assist in
managing storm drainage.
      4.   All unimproved earth areas shall be planted, restored, or otherwise
protected from erosion.
      5.   Ongoing maintenance, including the replacement of dead or unhealthy
plants, shall be provided by the parking area owner/leaseholder.
   D.   Parking For Single-Family Residential Dwelling Units: For single family
residential units on streets designated local streets, an on-street parking
lane at each lot's street frontage may fulfill the requirement for one parking
space, with driveway and garage meeting the additional requirement. Driveways
and garage entrances from interior block alleys are preferred.
   E.   Shared Access: Wherever feasible, parking lots shall share access
lanes.
   F.   Circulation Area Design: Circulation for parking areas intended to
accommodate twenty (20) vehicles or more shall be designed to facilitate the
safe movement of vehicles without posing a danger to pedestrians or impeding
the function of the parking area. Parking lots that accommodate twenty (20) or
more vehicles must maintain continuous circulation patterns, with no dead-ends,
and safe access to public streets.
   G.   Lighting And Maintenance: All parking area lighting shall comply with
the lighting requirements of this title and the Lyon County Design Criteria and
Improvement Standards, and provide adequate lighting for safety if night use is
intended. Parking lots should provide adequate security and should limit visual
clutter, parking lot signs, and equipment.
   H.   Drainage: All parking areas shall have adequate drainage as determined
by a drainage report, and utilize low impact development techniques where
practical.
   I.   Loading/Unloading Areas: All new and substantially remodeled commercial
and industrial developments shall provide adequate loading and unloading zones.
The loading/unloading zones must be illustrated on the parking plan submitted
for approval. Loading and unloading areas shall not impede major roads,
highways, intersections, or other paths of travel. Also, these zones must be
located away from areas where there is heavy pedestrian travel unless such
areas cannot be avoided, as in the Commercial Mixed- Use (CMU) District.
Loading/unloading areas will include block walls, opaque fences, earthen mounds
and/or vegetative screening to reduce noise and visual impacts. (Ord. 603, 11-
1-2018)
15.401.05: PARKING ALTERNATIVES:
The Director may approve alternatives to providing the number of off-street
parking spaces required by subsection
15.401.03A, table 15.401-1 of this chapter in accordance with the following
standards.
   A.   Shared Parking: The Director may approve shared parking facilities for
developments or uses with different operating hours or different peak business
periods (i.e., non-concurrent joint use parking) if the shared parking complies
with all of the following standards:
      1.   Location: Every shared parking space shall be located no farther
than six hundred feet (600') from the entrance to each building for which the
shared parking is provided (measured along the shortest legal pedestrian
route).
      2.   Shared Parking Study: Those proposing to use shared parking as a
means of satisfying off-street parking requirements shall submit a shared
parking analysis to the County that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of
shared parking. The study shall be provided in a form established by the
Director. It shall address, at a minimum, the size and type of the proposed
development, location of required parking, the composition of tenants, the
anticipated rate of parking turnover, and the anticipated peak parking and
traffic loads for all uses that will be sharing off-street parking spaces. The
applicant shall also demonstrate that any parking reduction requested as part
of the shared parking study will not result in the spillover of parking onto
other properties. The study shall utilize the Urban Land Institute, American
Planning Association, or other acceptable similar professional analytical body
shared parking methodology to calculate temporal and locational parking
reductions.
      3.   Agreement For Shared Parking: The parties involved in the joint use
of off-street parking facilities shall submit a written agreement in a form to
be recorded for such joint use, approved by the Director as to form and
content. The agreement shall provide for the maintenance of jointly used
facilities. The Director may impose such conditions of approval as may be
necessary to ensure the adequacy of parking in areas affected by such an
agreement. Recordation of the agreement shall take place before issuance of a
building permit for any use to be served by the shared parking area. A shared
parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces
will be provided in accordance with the requirements of this title.
   B.   Off-Site Parking: The Director may approve the location of required
off-site parking spaces on a separate lot from the lot on which the principal
use is located if the off-site parking complies with all of the following
standards:
      1.   Location: No off-site parking space may be located more than six
hundred feet (600') from an entrance to the use being served (measured along
the shortest legal pedestrian route). Off-site parking spaces shall be
connected to the use by acceptable pedestrian facilities. Off-site parking
spaces may not be separated from the use served by a street right-of-way with a
width of more than eighty feet (80'), unless a grade-separated pedestrian
walkway, a traffic signal, a shuttle bus, or other traffic control device or
remote parking shuttle bus service is provided.
      2.   Control Of Site: Required parking spaces for residential uses must
be located on the site of the use or within a tract owned in common by all the
owners of the properties that will use the tract.
      3.   Ineligible Activities: Required parking spaces for persons with
disabilities may not be located offsite.
      4.   Agreement For Off-Site Parking: In the event that an off-site
parking area is not under the same ownership as the principal use served, a
written agreement between the record owners shall be required, approved by the
Director as to form and content. The agreement shall guarantee the use of the
off-site parking area for a minimum period of at least twenty (20) years. The
Director may impose such conditions of approval as may be necessary to ensure
the adequacy of parking in areas affected by such an agreement, including a
requirement that the Director be notified if the off-site parking agreement is
being revoked. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record
shall be submitted to the County prior to recordation in a form acceptable by
the District Attorney. Recordation of the agreement shall take place before
issuance of a building permit for any use to be served by the off-site parking
area. An off-site parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off-
street parking spaces will be provided in accordance with the requirements of
this title.
   C.   On-Street Parking: On-street parking spaces in the right-of- way along
the property line, between the two (2) side lot lines of the site, may be
counted to satisfy the minimum off-street parking requirements, if approved by
the Director.
   D.   District Parking: Minimum required off-street parking spaces may be
waived or reduced for properties within the boundaries of a public parking,
Local Improvement District or Historic District that provides district-wide
parking facilities, based on the projected parking demand to be addressed by
the district-wide facility. All off-street parking waivers by the Director
shall be documented in writing and included in the business license and/or
building permit applications for the uses located within the district.
   E.   Stacked, Tandem, And Valet Parking: Stacked, tandem, or valet parking
for nonresidential uses is allowed if an attendant is present to move vehicles.
In addition, a guarantee acceptable to the County shall be filed with the
County ensuring that a valet parking attendant shall always be on duty when the
parking lot is in operation. For residential uses, tandem or stacked vehicle
parking is not allowed to comply with the minimum residential parking
requirement, but may be allowed for additional parking exceeding the minimum
residential parking requirement.
   F.   Structured Parking:
      1.   Maximum Parking Waiver: Where seventy five percent (75%) or more of
the parking accessory to a use is in structured parking, there shall be no
maximum cap on the number of parking spaces.
      2.   Credit For Nearby Public Structured Parking: Spaces available in
public parking structures located within one thousand feet (1,000') of the
subject use may be counted toward the total amount of required off-street
parking.
      3.   Density Bonus For Underground Parking In The Commercial And Mixed-
Use Districts: A density bonus shall be granted for underground parking
structures in the Commercial and Mixed-Use Districts. The bonus shall be
granted at a ratio of 0.01 du/gross acre of additional bonus density for each
one hundred (100) square feet of structured parking that is underground.
   G.   Sites In Mixed-Use Districts: In the Mixed-Use Districts, the total
requirement for off-street parking facilities shall be the sum of the
requirements for the various uses computed separately, subject to the
modifications set forth below.
      1.   All uses within MU Districts shall be eligible for a twenty percent
(20%) parking reduction to reflect the reduced automobile use associated with
mixed-use developments.
      2.   A ten percent (10%) parking reduction for multifamily residential
dwellings may be allowed if the proposed use is located within three hundred
feet (300') of a transit stop with midday service headways of thirty (30)
minutes or less in each direction.
      3.   For non-residential uses, the minimum parking requirement may be
reduced ten percent (10%) if the use incorporates a transit stop that meets
minimum design standards established by the County to ensure ready access to
users and is compatible with the design and materials of the non-residential
use of which it is associated.
      4.   A ten percent (10%) parking reduction for developments that include
bicycle parking at a minimum ratio of five (5) bicycle rack spaces to one
parking space. (Up to a maximum of 2 parking spaces.)
      5.   The total number of parking spaces required of a use or uses in an
MU District may be further reduced by the Director if the applicant prepares a
parking evaluation that demonstrates a reduction is appropriate based on the
expected parking needs of the development, availability of mass transit, and
similar factors and the County Engineer accepts such study as an accurate
reflection of parking demand. The parking evaluation shall be prepared in a
form and manner prescribed by the Director.
   H.   Other Eligible Alternatives: Modification of requirements of this
chapter may be approved in conformance with the provisions of section
15.330.04 of this title when substantiated by a report based on the Institute
of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Manual, American Planning Association (APA),
Urban Land Institute (ULI) or other nationally accepted authority, and where it
is demonstrated that the modification will protect surrounding neighborhoods,
maintain traffic circulation patterns, and promote quality urban design to at
least the same extent as would strict compliance with the standards set forth
in this chapter. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)

native plants, on-site stormwater retention, drip-irrigation, and use of
pervious paving material is strongly encouraged to meet the requirements of
this title.
   B.   Protection Of Existing Vegetation: The appeal and character of the site
shall be preserved and enhanced by retaining and protecting existing vegetation
and trees whenever possible.
      1.   Designation, Protection, And Replacement: The owner must indicate on
the landscaping plan trees and vegetation intended to be preserved. Designated
trees and vegetation must be protected during construction through use of
fencing and other protective measures.
   C.   Maintenance: Landscaping shall be watered and maintained by the
property owner/leaseholder as necessary to preserve the intent of any approved
landscape plan. Ongoing maintenance shall include the replacement of dead or
unhealthy plants. Violations of this section shall be subject to penalties
pursuant to chapter 15 of this title.
   D.   Plant Materials: Plant materials shall be adaptable to local
conditions. Naturalized planting schemes using native or low water-consumptive
drought-tolerant plant materials with a high desert character theme are
strongly encouraged. Lawn areas shall be kept to a minimum.
   E.   Street Trees: Street trees shall be organized in a formal architectural
fashion to reinforce, define, and connect the spaces and corridors created by
buildings and other features along a street.

      4.   Additional Landscaping: Additional landscaping within the area
between the curb and sidewalk may consist of shrubs, annuals, perennials,
ground cover and turf, and shall be planted and maintained by the adjacent
property owners at the approval of the appropriate jurisdiction (homeowners'
association, landscape maintenance association, improvement district, GID,
etc.).
   F.   Visibility And Security:
      1.   Intersections shall be landscaped with plant materials of a shape
and size that will not impede visibility of motorists, cyclists, or
pedestrians.
      2.   At no time may the security of a building, specifically the entryway
and parking area, be compromised by creating visual barriers or hiding places.
   G.   Landscape Plan Required: A landscape plan including plant materials,
plant sizes, numbers of plants and plant and landscape material locations as
well as an irrigation plan with details shall be submitted for developments as
required by the Director. Plant materials and the irrigation system shall be
installed prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy. (Ord. 603, 11-1-
2018; amd. Ord. 607, 9-19-2019)
15.402.04: BUFFERING AND SCREENING:

transitions from one use to another through the use of building orientation and
access, landscaping, and appropriate architectural elements.
   B.   General Provisions:
      1.   It is the responsibility of any new proposed use (whether more or
less intense) to demonstrate compatibility with any surrounding, existing,
adjacent uses. This can be accomplished through appropriate building
orientation and setbacks, landscaping, architectural treatment and effective
use of fencing and screening walls. Special consideration shall be given to the
impact of aesthetics, noise, lighting, and traffic.
      2.   Buffering may be required between any development and adjacent
natural or environmentally sensitive areas. This will be determined on a case-
by-case basis.
   C.   Loading And Service Areas:
      1.   Location: Loading docks, recycling facilities and other service and
utility areas shall be placed to the rear or side of buildings.
      2.   Screening And Landscaping: Screening and landscaping shall prevent
direct views of the loading areas and shall be concealed from all adjacent
properties and public rights-of-way through installation of walls, opaque
fences, earthen mounds and/or vegetative screening. Screening and landscaping
shall also be provided to help mitigate spill-over glare, noise, or exhaust
fumes.
   D.   Mechanical Equipment: Mechanical equipment, rooftop appurtenances, and
outdoor storage areas should be screened. Rooftop appurtenances, such as
mechanical equipment shall be screened from view from adjacent properties and
public rights-of- way whenever practical.
   E.   Dumpsters And Trash Storage Areas: Every development that is required
to provide one or more dumpsters for solid waste collection shall provide sites
for such dumpsters that are:
      1.   Sited to the rear of the building,
      2.   Compliant with the setbacks required of the building's underlying
zone, and,
      3.   Designed such that they are concealed from all adjacent properties
and public rights-of-way through installation of walls, fencing and/or
vegetative screening.
   F.   Outdoor Storage Areas: In the event that a use which will incorporate
the outdoor storage of equipment, trucks, trailers, materials, etc., will abut
Residentially used or zoned property, such storage areas must either be
screened by a solid fence or wall with a minimum height of six feet (6') or be
set back from the adjacent residential property line the distance of the
minimum setback distance. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)

subdivision map covering a portion of the approved tentative map for not more
than two (2) years after the expiration of the two-year period for presenting
the successive final subdivision map. If the subdivider is presenting in a
timely manner a series of final maps, each covering a portion of the approved
tentative map, no requirements other than those imposed on each of the final
maps in the series may be placed on the map when an extension of time is
granted unless the requirement is directly attributable to a change in
applicable laws which affect the public health, safety or welfare. Extension
applications must be accompanied by the applicable fee and written statement of
justification, and must be filed forty five (45) days prior to the expiration
of the final map.
   C.   At any time after tentative subdivision map approval, and before the
time required for presentation of a final subdivision map, the subdivider may
request amendment to the approval or conditional approval of the tentative
subdivision map. The Director may approve minor tentative subdivision map
amendments in accordance with section
15.601.02 of this title. Major amendments shall be determined in accordance
with the procedures for original approval of the tentative subdivision map
under this chapter. Additional conditions may be attached to approval of the
tentative subdivision map amendment which are reasonably related to the
proposed amendment. A subdivider who is unwilling to accept conditions attached
to the proposed amendment may withdraw the amendment. Action on the application
for amendment of the tentative subdivision map shall not stay the period for
presenting the final subdivision map, unless a request for extension pursuant
to subsection B of this section is approved.
   D.   If the subdivider fails to comply with the provisions of subsections A

15.800.01: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
The Legislature of the State of Nevada has delegated the responsibility to
local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, pursuant to
Nevada Revised Statutes chapters 244, 278 and 543, including the sections
244A.057, 278.020 and 543.020, together with the applicable Code of Federal
Regulations, and as a participating County in the National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP), the County Commissioners of Lyon County ordain and adopt the
floodplain management provisions as set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 603, 11-1-
2018; amd. Ord. 607, 9-19-2019)
15.800.02: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of Lyon County are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are caused by uses that are inappropriately
developed within the flood hazard areas or are inadequately elevated, flood-
proofed, or otherwise not protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards increase flood heights and
velocities and, when inadequately flood proofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage, contribute to the flood loss.
   C.   Protecting the natural resources and functions of floodplains, has
proven to be effective in reducing flood losses. FEMA encourages and provides
incentives to communities to adopt and implement programs that preserve the
integrity of floodplain resources and functions. Lyon County has adopted the
Carson River Watershed Floodplain Management Plan which includes strategies for
floodplain management to reduce flood damage impacts including:
      1.   Protection of natural floodplain function and values;
      2.   Higher regulatory standards;
      3.   Flood data information and maintenance;
      4.   Channel migration and bank erosion monitoring;
      5.   Floodplain and flood hazard outreach and education; and
      6.   Reduction of infrastructure impacts. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018; amd. Ord.
607, 9-19-2019)
15.800.03: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
   A.   To protect human life and health;
   B.   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   C.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   E.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazards;
   F.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard and X (Shaded) flood zones to
minimize property devaluation resulting from flood damage and events, and
future flood blight areas;
   G.   To ensure that property owners and potential buyers are notified when a
property is located in areas of special flood hazard and X (Shaded) flood
zones;
   H.   To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard and X
(Shaded) flood zones assume responsibility for their actions;
   I.   Implement the Carson River Regional Floodplain Management Plan;
   J.   Minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within the
Carson River floodplain by requiring the use of the Carson River Hydraulic
Model and procedures designed to provide a consistent and complete:
      1.   Tool to assess cumulative impacts of land use changes within the 1-
percent chance (100-year) and 0.2-percent chance (500-year) floodplains;
      2.   Tool to assess project specific impacts of land use changes within
the 1-percent chance (100-year) and 0.2-percent chance (500-year) floodplains;
      3.   Tool for mitigating flood hazards to downstream communities, loss of
riparian habitat and floodplain function, and degradation of water quality due
to impacts of land use changes within the 1-percent chance (100-year) and 0.2-
percent chance (500-year) floodplains;
      4.   Set of protocols, procedures and guidance necessary to use the
Carson River Hydraulic Model to evaluate impacts to floodplain extents, peak
flow, peak flow timing, and flood volumes.
   K.   To maintain eligibility for State and Federal disaster relief;
   L.   Maintain qualifying standards for participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP); and
   M.   Comply with applicable Code of Federal Regulations provisions. (Ord.
603, 11-1-2018; amd. Ord. 607, 9-19-2019)
15.800.04: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   A.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   B.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
alluvial fans, and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or
channel floodwaters;
   D.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   E.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas.

15.800.07: BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD; INFORMATION
MAINTAINED:
   A.   Flood Insurance Study And Maps: The areas of special flood hazard and X
(Shaded) flood zones identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a
scientific and engineering report entitled "the Flood Insurance Study for Lyon
County" (FIS), dated January 19, 1982, with accompanying flood insurance rate
maps (FIRMS), and all subsequent revisions and amendments, are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The FIS and
supplemental mappings, as amended and revised, is the minimum area of
applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other
areas that allow implementation of this chapter and that are recommended to the
board by the Floodplain Administrator. The flood insurance study and flood
insurance rate maps (FIRMS) are is on file at the department for public
reference and review.
   B.   Interpretations: Interpretations, where needed, as to location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator. The Floodplain Administrator may
determine the best information available in making the map determinations. When
requested by the Floodplain Administrator, the applicants shall provide
documentation to assist the Floodplain Administrator in making the
determination. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in
section
15.800.14 of this chapter.
   C.   Use Of Other Base Flood Data: When base flood elevations are not
available, the Floodplain Administrator may obtain, review, and use the best
available flood data and information from any other authoritative source, such
as state, federal, or other such as historical data, high water marks, floods
of record, or private engineering reports, to establish base flood elevations
within the special flood hazard areas (SFHAs). Multiple parcels (five (5) or
more) will be required to have all proposals establish the one hundred-year
base flood elevation before consideration of the tentative plan for
development. The Floodplain Administrator may, at their discretion, require
standards exceeding those identified in this chapter. Any higher standards
above those in this chapter This information shall be submitted to the Board
for adoption. When base flood elevations are not available from any other
source, base flood elevations shall be obtained using one of two (2) methods
from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in
Approximate Zone A Areas - A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-Year)
Flood Elevations", dated July 1995.
   D.   Information Obtained And Maintained:
      1.   Where base flood elevation data is provided through the flood
insurance study or acquired as in subsections B and C of this section, the
actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including
basement) of all new or substantially improved structures and whether or not
the structure contains a basement shall be obtained and recorded.
      2.   For all new or substantially improved flood proofed structures:
         a.   The actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) shall be
verified and recorded; and
         b.   The flood proofing certifications required in subsection
15.800.08B of this chapter shall be maintained.
      3.   All records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter shall be
maintained for public inspection.
   E.   Hydrology And Hydraulic Study Requirements: Detailed Base Flood
Elevations (BFEs) are determined by an engineering study consisting of
hydrology and hydraulics. All hydrology and hydraulic studies (also known as
Flood Impact Analysis) referenced in the chapter must be prepared by a
professional engineer licensed in the State of Nevada and meet FEMA standards
for hydrology and hydraulic studies submitted for the approval of CLOMRs and
LOMRs. Except for areas were FEMA allows the use of the approximate method, the
preferred modeling tool to determine changes on the base flood elevations and
the floodplain boundary shall be the current acceptable version of HEC-RAS.
   F.   Carson River Floodplain Hydraulic Modeling:
      1.   The Carson River Floodplain Hydraulic Model (Model) is hereby
adopted as the hydraulic modeling/mapping tool to assess impacts of land use
changes, development, construction, and man-made alterations within the Carson
River floodplain.
      2.   The Carson River Hydraulic Model - Model Management, Distribution,
And Update Guide (Guide), including revisions, amendments and updates, is
hereby adopted as the required procedures and guidance for the use of the
model, including management, distribution, modification, submission and review.
      3.   Lands to which the Carson River Floodplain Hydraulic Modeling
Applies. The Carson River Floodplain Hydraulic Modeling shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazards within the 1-percent chance (100-year) and 0.2-
percent chance (500-year) floodplains of the Carson River within the
jurisdiction of Lyon County.
      4.   The most current version of the model shall be used for the
following:
         a.   Interpretations as set forth in subsection

      6.   When a watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, the applicant must submit a ‘No-Rise’ certificate and the
maps, computations, and other materials required by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) to process a conditional letter of map revision
(CLOMR) or a letter of map revision (LOMR) and pay any fees or other costs
assessed by FEMA for processing the revision.
      7.   A technical analysis, by a professional engineer licensed in the
State of Nevada, showing the proposed development located in the special flood
hazard area will not cause physical damage to any other property.
      8.   When there is no base flood elevation data available for Zone A from
any source, the base flood elevation data will be provided by the permit
applicant for all proposed development of subdivisions, manufactured home and
recreational vehicle parks in the special flood hazard areas, for all
developments of fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is less.
   C.   Permit Review And Approval: The Director or their designee is appointed
Floodplain Administrator to administer and implement this chapter by granting
or denying floodplain development permit applications in accordance with its
provisions.
      Duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall
include, but not be limited to:
      1.   Review all floodplain development permit applications to determine
that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
      2.   Review all floodplain development permits to determine that all
necessary permits have been obtained from those Federal, State or local
governmental agencies from which prior approval is required prior to issuing
the floodplain development permit.
      3.   Review all floodplain development permits to determine that the site
and structure(s) is/are reasonably safe from flooding.
      4.   Review of all floodplain development permit applications to
determine if the proposed development in the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)
may result in physical damage to any other property, to include river and
stream bank erosion and any increase in velocities or that it does not
adversely affect the flood-carrying capacity of the area where base flood
elevations have been determined, but a floodway has not been designated. For
purposes of this chapter, "adversely affected" means that the cumulative effect
of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than 0.5 foot at any point. To assist the local floodplain
administrator in making this determination, the applicant requesting the
floodplain development permit, may be required to submit additional technical
analyses.
      5.   Review of all proposals for the development of five (5) parcels or
more to assure that the flood discharge exiting the development after
construction is equal to or less than the flood discharge at the location prior
to development.
      6.   Review all development applications to determine that all necessary
permits have been obtained from those federal, state, or local governmental
agencies from which prior approval is required.
      7.   May make map interpretations where needed, as to the location of the
boundaries of special flood hazard areas and where there appears to be a
conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The Floodplain
Administrator may determine the best information available in making the map
determinations. Floodplain development permit applicants must provide
documentation to assist the Floodplain Administrator or designee in making the
determination when requested by the Floodplain Administrator.
      8.   Submit new technical data to FEMA when the Floodplain Administrator
has received technical or scientific data that the base flood elevation has
either increased or decreased resulting from physical changes affecting
flooding conditions. The Floodplain Administrator will submit the technical or
scientific data to FEMA, as soon as practical, after the date of technical
information confirming the physical changes becomes available. The technical or
scientific data provided to the Floodplain Administrator shall meet the FEMA
notebook-style format as preferred.
      9.   The Planning Commission and board shall be responsible for reviewing
all proposals for new development and shall weigh all requests for future
floodplain development against the county's master plan and multi-
jurisdictional hazard mitigation plan. Consideration of the following elements
is required before approval:
         a.   Determination of whether a proposed development is in or affects
a known floodplain.
         b.   Inform the public of the proposed activity.
         c.   Determine if there is a practicable alternative or site for the
proposed activity.
         d.   Identify impact of the activity on the floodplain.
         e.   Provide a plan to mitigate the impact of the activity. (Ord. 603,
11-1-2018; amd. Ord. 607, 9-19-2019)
15.800.09: ALTERATION OF WATERCOURSES:

Program Coordinator, and submittal of evidence of such notification to the
Federal Insurance Administration, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   C.   Determine that the potential permit recipient has provided:
      1.   A description of the extent to which the watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of the proposed development;
      2.   Computations by a professional engineer licensed in the State of
Nevada that demonstrate that the altered or relocated segment will provide
equal or more capacity than the original watercourse;
      3.   A legally enforceable assurance instrument for maintenance within
the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying
capacity is not diminished;
      4.   Have received a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
determination from FEMA; and
      5.   Provided funds from the Developer to the County for processing the
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).
   D.   Development Of Substantial Improvement And Substantial Damage
Procedures:
      1.   Using the most recent version of FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers
to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings," develop detailed
procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial
improvement and substantial damage, to include defining "Market Value." (Ord.
603, 11-1-2018; amd. Ord. 607, 9-19-2019)

signed by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Nevada.
      2.   The supporting technical data shall be based on a FEMA approved
model used to develop the 100-year floodway shown on the FIRM and the results
tabulated in the Flood Insurance Study.
      3.   In a special flood hazard area, a no-rise certification must be
submitted for any construction or other development that is permitted to
proceed with a CLOMR on a form approved by the administrator and prepared by a
professional engineer licensed in the State of Nevada.
   G.   Variances issued pursuant to section
15.800.14, "Variances And Appeals", of this chapter.

15.800.11: MAINTENANCE OF FLOOD PROTECTION MEASURES:
The maintenance of any and all flood protection measures (levees, dikes, dams
or reservoirs) and alterations or relocations of watercourses will be required
of the jurisdiction where such measures provide protection. If these measures

maintenance agreement document, including enforcement provisions as recorded
with Lyon County will be required of the owner to be on file with the
department. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018; amd. Ord. 607, 9-19-2019)
15.800.12: GENERAL STANDARDS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
In all areas of special flood hazards, the following standards are required:
   A.   Development Requirements:
      1.   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the special
flood hazard area and X (Shaded) flood zone and the elevation of the base
flood;
      2.   All final subdivision plans will provide the elevation of proposed
structure(s), pads, and adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base
flood, the final pad elevation shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor and provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth
in this chapter;
      3.   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
      4.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage;
      5.   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood damage; certification of compliance shall be required
of the developer; and
      6.   Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not
available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for
subdivisions and other proposed developments which contain at least fifty (50)
lots or five (5) acres (whichever is less).
      7.   All subdivision proposals and other proposed developments shall
assess the cumulative and project specific impacts of land use changes and
development through a detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses and/or
demonstration of the cumulative effect of the proposed land use changes or
development. All subdivision proposals must demonstrate that the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one-
half (0.5) foot at any point within the special flood hazard area;
      8.   Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the
space occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood
elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically specified
volume of excavation taken from below the base flood elevation. All such
excavations shall be constructed to drain freely to the watercourse. All new
development placing fill and structures within special flood hazard areas must
provide compensatory storage at hydraulically equivalent sites at a minimum
ratio of 1.25:1 (i.e., where 1.25 cubic feet of material must be removed from a
hydraulically equivalent location for each 1 cubic foot of fill placed in the
special flood hazard zone); and
      9.   Land may not be divided for residential purposes that requires fill
to raise the elevation of the property to remove the property out of a special
flood hazard area and enable subsequent development.
      10.   Land may not be divided for residential purposes that will result
in the creation of a parcel that is less than twenty (20) net acres, unless the
applicant shows that:
         a.   The portion of the land in the special flood hazard area will be
contained on a single parcel; and
         b.   The land within the special flood hazard areas is retained in a
natural state including, without limitation, no solid fencing that impedes the
flow of floodwaters or other improvements; and
         c.   The land within the special flood hazard area is held in common
or single ownership with any overlying drainage easement; and
         d.   A property owner's association or similar entity is legally
responsible for maintenance of the land in the special flood hazard area in its
natural state.
   B.   Anchoring:
      1.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
      2.   All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement and shall be installed using methods
and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but
are not limited to, use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors (see
FEMA's "Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas" guidebook for
additional techniques).
      3.   Propane and other liquid or gaseous fuel storage tanks shall be
anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement.
   C.   Construction Materials And Methods:
      1.   Materials: All new construction and substantial improvements shall
be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
      2.   Design And Construction Methods And Practices: All new construction
and substantial improvements shall be designed and constructed using methods
and practices that minimize flood damage and comply with FEMA requirements.
      3.   Location Of Service Facilities: Electrical, heating, ventilation,
plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be
designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from
entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
      4.   Drainage Paths: Within Zones AH or AO, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall be constructed so that there are adequate
drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away
from proposed structures.
      5.   Elevation And Flood Proofing:
         a.   New construction and substantial improvement of any structure
shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to create freeboard
above the base flood elevation or constructed with the freeboard requirement or
depth number as follows:
            (1)   In Zone AO: The lowest floor elevated above the highest
adjacent grade to a height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in
feet on the FIRM by at least one and one half feet (1.5’), or elevated at least
three and one-half feet (3.5’) above the highest adjacent grade if no depth
number is specified. A professional surveyor or engineer licensed in the State
of Nevada must complete the elevation certificate.
            (2)   In Zone A: The lowest floor elevated to at least one and one
half feet (1.5’) or above the base flood elevation, as determined by a
professional engineer or surveyor licensed in the State of Nevada and approved
by the Floodplain Administrator.
            (3)   In all other special flood hazard areas where the base flood
elevation has been determined: The lowest floor elevated at least one and one
half feet (1.5’) above the base flood elevation.
            (4)   In all the X-shaded flood zone, one of the following minimum
criteria must be met:
               (A)   The lowest floor must be elevated at least one and one-
half feet (1.5’) above the pre-developed highest adjacent grade; or
               (B)   The applicant must provide a drainage plan designed by a
professional engineer licensed in the State of Nevada for diverting water
around the proposed structure using berms, swales, or other drainage features.
            (5)   In alluvial fan floodplain areas as designated within the
Area Drainage Master Plans, the lowest floor must be a minimum of two feet (2')
above the Base Flood Elevation to account for sedimentation.
         b.   Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved
within a SFHA:
            (1)   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision,
            (2)   In a new manufactured home park or subdivision,
            (3)   In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision,
      On which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the
result of a flood, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the
lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated at least one and one-half
feet (1.5’) above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation collapse and lateral
movement in addition to meeting the above standards.
      Nonresidential structures may meet the standards in subsection C5c of
this section. Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor to verify to the Floodplain Administrator that elevation
requirements have been met. Notification of compliance shall be recorded as set
forth in subsection C5a of this chapter.
         c.   Nonresidential construction shall either be elevated to
conformance with subsection C5a of this section or, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities:
            (1)   Be flood proofed so that below the base flood level the
structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water;
            (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
            (3)   Be certified by a professional engineer or architect licensed
in the State of Nevada that the standards of this subsection are satisfied.
Such certifications shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
         d.   All new construction and substantial improvements to existing
structures within a special flood hazard area with fully enclosed areas below
the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, must
be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces
on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters. Designs
for meeting this requirement shall follow the guidelines in FEMA Technical
Bulletins TB-1 (Openings in Foundation Walls and Walls of Enclosures, 2008) and
TB-7 (Wet Floodproofing Requirements, 1993) and must either be certified by a
professional engineer or architect licensed in the State of Nevada or meet or
exceed the following minimum criteria:
            (1)   Have a minimum of two openings on different sides having a
total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding. Net area may be reduced by manufacturer or
engineer certification if engineered flood openings are used. If a structure
has more than one enclosed area, each area must have openings on different
sides to allow floodwaters to directly enter and exit. Openings must be
equipped with FEMA approved louvers and other designated openings that permit
the automatic entry and exit of flood waters.
            (2)   The bottom of all such openings must be no higher than one
foot above the exterior lowest adjacent finished grade and be installed below
the base flood elevation.
            (3)   Have an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters
from the interior.
            (4)   Areas below the BFE must be constructed with flood resistant
materials.
         e.   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor including basement shall be certified by a professional engineer or land
surveyor licensed in the State of Nevada and verified by the county building
inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification or verification shall be
provided to the floodplain administrator using the current FEMA Elevation
Certificate.
      6.   Requirements For All Crawl Space Construction:
         a.   The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
Hydrostatic loads and the effects of buoyancy can usually be addressed through
the required openings discussed in the next subsection. Because of hydrodynamic
loads, crawl space construction is not recommended in areas with flood
velocities greater than five feet (5') per second unless the design is reviewed
by a qualified design professional, such as an architect or professional
engineer licensed in the State of Nevada.
         b.   The crawl space is an enclosed area below the BFE or depth number
and, as such, must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by
allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. The bottom of each
flood vent opening can be no more than one foot (1') above the highest of
inside or outside adjacent grade.
         c.   Portions of the building below the BFE or depth number must be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only
the foundation walls of the crawl space used to elevate the building, but also
any joists, insulation, or other materials that extend below the BFE or depth
number. The required construction practice is to elevate the bottom of joists
and all insulation two feet (2') above BFE or depth number. Insulation is not a
flood resistant material. When insulation becomes saturated with floodwater,
the additional weight often pulls it away from the joists and flooring.
Ductwork or other utility systems located below the insulation may also pull
away from their supports.
         d.   Any building utility systems within the crawl space must be
elevated above BFE or depth number, or designed so that floodwaters cannot
enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions.
Ductwork, in particular, must either be placed above the BFE or depth number,
or sealed from floodwaters.
         e.   Additional requirements for below grade crawl spaces:
            (1)   The interior grade of a crawl space below the BFE or depth
number must not be more than two feet (2') below the highest adjacent exterior
grade (HAG), shown as "D" in figure 3 of this section.
            (2)   The height of the below grade crawl space, measured from the
interior grade of the crawl space to the top of the crawl space foundation wall
must not exceed four feet (4') (shown as "L" in figure 3 of this section) at
any point. The height limitation is the maximum allowable unsupported wall
height according to the engineering analyses and Building Code requirements for
flood hazard areas. This limitation will also prevent these crawl spaces from
being converted into habitable spaces, in conjunction with the requirement of a
"non-convert to living space" agreement recorded with the County prior to the
final inspection.
            (3)   There must be an adequate drainage system that removes
floodwaters from the interior area of the crawl space. The enclosed area should
be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event. The type of drainage
system will vary because of the site gradient and other drainage
characteristics, such as soil types. Possible options include natural drainage
through porous, well drained soils and drainage systems such as perforated
pipes, drainage tiles, or gravel or crushed stone drainage by gravity or
mechanical means.
            (4)   The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed
five feet (5') per second for any crawl space. For velocities in excess of five
feet (5') per second, other foundation types should be used.

      2.   All new and replacement water supply systems must be designed to
prevent infiltration and intermingling of flood waters.
      3.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration and intermingling of floodwaters or
discharge from the systems into floodwaters. Sanitary sewer and storm drainage
systems for buildings that have openings below the base flood elevation shall
be provided with automatic backflow valves or other automatic backflow devices
that are installed in each discharge line passing through a building's exterior
wall.
      4.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and
      5.   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      6.   All electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning
(HVAC) systems and other service facilities and mechanical equipment (including
ductwork) must be elevated, made of flood-resistant materials, or floodproofed
above the base flood elevation to the elevation (freeboard) required in the
applicable special flood hazard zone and X-shaded flood zone; and be located
and constructed to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
   E.   Standards For Critical Facilities: Critical facilities, as defined in
Appendix A of this title, are not permitted to be constructed within a special
flood hazard area, unless:
      1.   All alternative locations in the X-unshaded flood zone have been
considered and rejected; and
      2.   All alternative locations in X-shaded flood zone have been
considered and rejected.
      If the Floodplain Administrator determines the only practical alternative
location for the development of a new or substantially improved critical
facility is in a special flood hazard area, the Floodplain Administrator must
give public notice of the decision and reasons for the elimination of all
alternative locations. Additionally, a critical facility must be designed to
higher protection standards and have flood evacuation plans if the critical
facility must be located in a floodplain. The more common standards such as
freeboard, elevation above the 500-year floodplain, and elevated ramps will be
required. (NFIP).
   F.   Standards For Alluvial Fans: Areas subject to alluvial-fan flooding
have irregular flow paths that result in erosion of existing channels and the
undermining of fill material. Those areas are identified on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) as AO Zones with velocities.
      1.   All structures must be securely anchored to minimize the impact of
the flood and sediment damage.
      2.   All new construction and substantial improvements must be elevated
on pilings, columns, or armored fill so that the lowest floor is elevated two
feet (2’) above the depth number.
      3.   Use of all fill materials must be armored to protect the material
from the velocity of the flood flow.
      4.   All proposals for subdivision development must provide a mitigation
plan that identifies the engineering methods used to:
         a.   Protect structures from erosion and scour caused by the velocity
of the flood flow;
         b.   Capture or transport flood and sediment flow through the
subdivision to a safe point of disposition.
      5.   All manufactured homes shall be prohibited within the identified
hazard area except within existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions.
      6.   Approval by the Floodplain Administrator and County Engineer is
required.
   G.   Review Of Building Permits: Applications for building permits shall be
reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from
flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of
historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where
available. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018; amd. Ord. 607, 9-19-2019; Ord. 613, 12-3-2020)
15.800.13: SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been
provided as set forth in subsection
15.800.07A or C of this chapter, the following provisions are required:
   A.   Residential Construction:
      1.   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one and one
half feet (1.5’) above base flood elevation.
      2.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor other than a crawl space
constructed in conformance with subsection
15.800.12C6 of this chapter subject to flooding are prohibited or shall be
designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls
by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
         a.   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided on opposite walls.
         b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1')
above the highest inside or outside adjacent grade.
         c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers or other coverings
or devices; provided, that they may permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
   B.   Manufactured Homes:
      1.   All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within
Zones A, AH and AE shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the
bottom of the structural frame or the lowest point of any attached appliances,
whichever is lowest, of the manufactured home is at least one and one half feet
(1.5’) above the base flood elevation or at least three and one half feet
(3.5’) above the highest adjacent grade when no base flood elevation data is
available and shall be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement in accordance with
the provisions of subsection
15.800.12B2 of this chapter. This requirement is in addition to the applicable
state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
      2.   All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on
sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A, AH,
and AE as shown on the community's FIRM are subject to the provisions of
subparagraph 1, above.

structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water;
      2.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
      3.   Be certified by a Nevada licensed professional engineer or architect
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their
development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans.
Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in
subsection
15.800.08B5 of this chapter.
      4.   Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not flood proofed, must

subsection A2 of this section.
      5.   Applicants flood proofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified
that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot (1')
below the flood proofed level (e.g., a building constructed to the base flood
level will be rated as 1 foot below that level).
   D.   Floodways: Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
subsection
15.800.07A of this chapter or based on the best information available, are
areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous
area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential
projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
      1.   Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other development are prohibited unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, performed in accordance
with standard engineering practice, supported by technical data and signed by a
professional engineer licensed in the State of Nevada, that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge, and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency has issued a conditional letter of map revision
(CLOMR).
      2.   If a floodway has not been designated within the special flood
hazard areas established in Basis for Establishing Areas of Special Flood
Hazard, no new construction, substantial improvement, or other development
(including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE, unless it has
been demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one half foot (0.5’) at
any point within the county.
      3.   If subsection D1 of this section is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this section and section
15.800.12 of this chapter.
      4.   A No-Rise Certificate prepared by a professional engineer licensed
in the State of Nevada must be submitted with the floodplain development
application to the County.
      5.   No manufactured homes shall be placed in a floodway except in
existing manufactured home parks or existing manufactured home subdivisions in
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
      6.   The above exceptions in paragraphs D(1) and (2) do not apply, and
the Administrator may not issue a floodplain development review/permit for any
encroachment in the adopted regulatory floodway, including without limitation,
fill, new construction, substantial improvements, storage of equipment or
supplies, and any other development where the encroachment involves the
division of land or increases in the permitted density.
   E.   Recreational Vehicles: All recreational vehicles placed on sites within
the floodplain on the FIRM will be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking
system, is attached to a site only by quick disconnect type utilities and
security devices, and has no permanently attached additions).
   F.   Breakaway Walls: A breakaway wall must have a safe design loading
resistance of not less than ten (10) and no more than twenty (20) pounds per
square foot. Use of breakaway wall must be certified by a professional engineer
or architect licensed in the State of Nevada and must meet the following
conditions:
      1.   Breakaway wall collapse must result from a water load less than that
which would occur during the base flood; and
      2.   The elevated portion of the building must not incur any structural
damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the
event of the base flood.
   G.   All new buildings constructed on fill in the regulatory floodplain:
      1.   Must be constructed on properly designed and compacted fill (e.g.,
fill that meets the criteria of (1) Section 1803.5.8, Section 1804.4 and
Section 1804.5.1 of the International Building Code, (2) Section 2.4 of ASCE
24, or (3) their equivalent);
      2.   Must be on fill that has appropriate protection from erosion and
scour; and
      3.   Must meet a compensatory storage requirement (for the building and
fill) that meets the criteria of
15.800.12A6.
   H.   Prohibition Of Outdoor Storage Of Materials:
      1.   Hazardous materials are prohibited from being stored indoors or
outdoors within an area designated as special flood hazard area except as
follows:
         a.   Hazardous materials for agricultural use stored indoors or
outdoors within an area designated as agricultural in a special flood hazard
area.
         b.   Hazardous materials may be stored indoors within structures
legally existing and conforming to all building and zoning requirements as of
the effective date of ________ within an area designated as a special flood
hazard area if the hazardous materials are stored elevated above the base flood
elevation in accordance with the lowest floor elevation requirements.
   I.   Landscaping And Landscaping Berms: The planting of landscaping in
special flood hazard areas shall consider the least resistance to stormwater
flow. The construction of landscaping berms within the special flood hazard
area shall be designed in consideration of the direction of stormwater flow and
will not be allowed to divert the direction of flow. Grading plans for any new
construction where landscaping or landscape berms are proposed must show no
adverse impact to the floodplain and must be included in the building permit
submittal.
   J.   Multiple Flood Zones: Proposed construction, including without
limitation, substantial improvement, and other development, of a parcel within
multiple flood zones must be constructed to the standards of the most
restrictive flood zone.
   K.   Maintenance Of Flood Protection Measures: The maintenance of any and
all flood protection measures (levees, dikes, dams, or reservoirs) and
alterations or relocations of watercourses will be required of the jurisdiction
where such measures provide protection. If these measures are privately owned,
an operation or maintenance plan and a recorded operation or maintenance
agreement with the county, including enforcement provisions, will be required
of the owner. The operation or maintenance plan and recorded operation or
maintenance agreement must be on file with the community development
department.
   L.   Disclosure Requirements: Before the purchaser of a property which is
located partially or completely within a special flood hazard area, X (shaded)
flood zone, or dam inundation area signs a sales agreement, opens escrow or at
least ten (10) days prior to any conveyance of the property, whichever occurs
earlier, the seller shall, by separate written document, disclose to the
purchaser the applicable special flood hazard area and X (shaded) flood zone
designation(s).
      1.   The seller shall retain a copy of the disclosure document which has
been signed by the purchaser acknowledging the date of receipt by the purchaser
of the original document.
      2.   The information contained in the disclosure document must:
         a.   Be updated not less than once every six (6) months;
         b.   Advise the purchaser that the property may be subject to periodic
flooding;
         c.   Advise the purchaser that the property is in an area having been
identified as having special flood, mudslide, or flood-related erosion hazards
and/or a moderate flood hazard; and
         d.   Provide the purchaser with instructions on how to obtain more
information from the community development department regarding special flood

available flood related resources. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018; amd. Ord. 607, 9-19-
2019)
15.800.14: VARIANCES AND APPEALS:
   A.   Authority: The Board shall hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter.
   B.   Appeals:
      1.   The Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is
an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the Floodplain
Administrator of this chapter.
      2.   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board may appeal such
decision to the appropriate court as provided in Nevada Revised Statutes.
   C.   Variances:
      1.   Application For Variance: In passing upon such applications, the
Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
         a.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         b.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         c.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         d.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         e.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         f.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         g.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         h.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         i.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         j.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         k.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water system and streets and
bridges.
      2.   Conditions May Be Imposed: Upon consideration of the factors of
subsection C1 of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the Board may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.
      3.   Standards For Granting Variances:
         a.   Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the
elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing items in subsections C1a through C1k of this
section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         b.   Variances may be issued for the rehabilitation or restoration of
historic structures.
         c.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         d.   Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard to afford
relief.
         e.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause such as renovation,
rehabilitation or reconstruction. Variances issued for economic considerations,
aesthetics or because variances have been used in the past are not good and
sufficient cause;
            (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
            (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
         f.   Variances, as interpreted in the national flood insurance
program, are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a
physical piece of property, they are not personal in nature and do not pertain
to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They
primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As
such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare.
         g.   Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very
limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of flood-proofing than
watertight or dry flood-proofing, where it can be determined that such action
will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria
except subsection C3a of this section and otherwise complies with subsections
15.800.12A and B of this chapter.
      4.   Notice When Variance Granted: Any applicant to whom a variance is
granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to
be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that
the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
   D.   Records And Reports: The County Clerk shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency upon request. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018)
15.800.15: LETTERS OF MAP REVISION/AMENDMENT:
National flood insurance program regulations provide procedures to remove
property from the 100-year floodplain or from a special flood hazard area.
Amendments and revisions to community flood insurance rate maps cannot
adversely impact the floodplain or floodway delineations of the level of the
100-year flood.
There are several procedures provided whereby the Federal Insurance
Administrator will review information from the community, an owner, or a lessee
of property where it is believed the property should not be included in a
special flood hazard area.
Submissions to FEMA for revisions to effective flood insurance studies (FISs)
by individual and community requesters will require the signing of application/
certification forms. These forms will provide FEMA with assurance that all
pertinent data relating to the revision is included in the submittal. They will
also assure that: a) the data and methodology are based on current conditions;
b) qualified professionals have assembled data and performed all necessary
computations; and c) all individuals and organizations impacted by proposed
changes are aware of the changes and will have an opportunity to comment on
them. FEMA procedures permit the following types of request:
A request for a revision to the effective FIS information (FIRM, FBFM, and/or
FIS report) is usually a request that FEMA replace the effective floodplain
boundaries, flood profiles, floodway boundaries, etc., with those determined by
the requester. Before FEMA will replace the effective FIS information with the
revised, the requester must: a) provide all of the data used in determining the
revised floodplain boundaries, flood profiles, floodway boundaries, etc.; b)
provide all data necessary to demonstrate that the physical modifications to
the floodplain have been adequately designed to withstand the impacts of the
one percent (1%) annual chance flood event and will be adequately maintained;
c) demonstrate that the revised information (e.g., hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses and the resulting floodplain and floodway boundaries) is consistent
with the effective FIS information.
Requests for amendments or revisions to FEMA maps must be reviewed and
submitted to FEMA by the Board with the applicant for a map amendment or
revision required to prepare all the supporting information and appropriate
FEMA forms.
The scientific or technical information to be submitted with these requests may
include, but is not limited to, the following:
   A.   An actual copy of the recorded plat map bearing the seal of the
appropriate recordation official County Clerk or Recorder of Deeds indicating
the official recordation and proper citation, deed or plat book volume and page
number, or an equivalent identification where annotation of the deed or plat
book is not the practice.
   B.   A topographical map showing:
      1.   Ground elevation contours in relation to the North American Vertical
Datum (NAVD) 1988 or the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) 1927 (MSL).
      2.   The total area of the property in question.
      3.   The location of the structure or structures located on the property
in question.
      4.   The elevation of the lowest adjacent grade to a structure or
structures.
      5.   An indication of the curvilinear line which represents the area
subject to inundation by a base flood. The curvilinear line should be based
upon information provided by an appropriate authoritative source, such as a
Federal agency, Department of Water Resources, a County Water Control District,
a County or city engineer, a Federal Emergency Management Agency flood
insurance study, or a determination by a registered professional engineer.
   C.   A copy of the FHBM or FIRM indicating the location of the property in
question.
   D.   A certification by a Nevada licensed professional engineer or Nevada
licensed land surveyor that the lowest grade adjacent to the structure is above
the base flood elevation.
   E.   The completion of the appropriate forms in the Federal Emergency
Management Agency's packets, amendments and revisions to national flood
insurance program maps (MT-1 FEMA form 81-87 series and MT-2 FEMA form 81-89
series).
   F.   The applicant shall provide the proposed map revision to the Floodplain
Administrator in form and format compatible with the County geographical
information system (GIS). The scale of the plan, improvements, monuments and
other items shall be in model space correctly oriented to coordinate system as
established by the GIS coordinator. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018; amd. Ord. 607, 9-19-
2019)
15.800.16: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purpose and is based on available information derived
from scientific and engineering methods of study. Larger floods can and will
occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural
causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special
flood hazards and X (Shaded) flood zones or uses permitted within such areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of Lyon County or any officer or employee thereof or the
Federal Insurance Administration or the Federal Emergency Management Agency for
any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 603, 11-1-2018; amd.

occupancy of a dwelling unit by a household. Tenancy is arranged on a month-to-
month or longer basis (lodging where tenancy may be arranged for a period of
less than 30 days is classified under the "lodging facilities" category).
Common accessory uses include recreational activities, keeping of pets,
gardens, personal storage buildings, hobbies, and parking of the occupants'
vehicles. Specific use types include, but are not limited to:
      1.   Dwelling, Duplex: A detached house on a single lot designed for and
occupied exclusively as the residence of not more than two (2) families, each
living as an independent housekeeping unit.
      2.   Dwelling, Live/Work: A structure or portion of a structure: a) that
combines a commercial or manufacturing activity that is allowed in the zone
with a residential living space for the owner of the commercial or
manufacturing business, or the owner's employee, and that person's household;
b) where the resident owner or employee of the business is responsible for the
commercial or manufacturing activity performed; and c) where the commercial or
manufacturing activity conducted takes place subject to a valid business
license associated with the premises.
      3.   Dwelling, Single-Family Detached: A detached dwelling unit designed
to be occupied by not more than one family. This use type includes stick-built
homes, modular homes, manufactured homes (HUD) and mobile factory built homes.
      4.   Dwelling, Factory Built: Factory built homes shall include the
following:
         a.   Manufactured (HUD): These are homes built entirely in the factory
under a Federal Building Code administered by the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD). The Federal Manufactured Home Construction and
Safety Standards (commonly known as the HUD Code) went into effect June 15,
1976. Manufactured homes may be single or multi section and are transported on
their own chassis (but not under their own power) to the site and installed on
permanent or temporary foundations. The chassis remains permanently attached to
the home. The Federal standards regulate manufactured housing design and
construction, strength, durability, transportability, fire resistance, energy
efficiency and quality. The HUD Code also sets performance standards for the
heating, plumbing, air conditioning, thermal and electrical systems. On-site
additions, such as garages, decks and porches must be built to local Building
Codes. A building permit must be obtained for all work performed on site to
install this type of home.
         b.   Mobile Homes: This term references manufactured homes produced
prior to June 15, 1976, when the HUD Code went into effect. Mobile homes may be
single or multi section and are transported on their own chassis (but not under
their own power) to the site and installed on permanent or temporary
foundations. The chassis remains permanently attached to the home. On-site
additions, such as garages, decks and porches must be built to local Building
Codes. A building permit must be obtained for all work performed on site to
install this type of home.
         c.   Modular Homes: These factory built homes are constructed to the
State of Nevada and locally adopted Building Codes. Modules are transported to
the site and installed on a permanent foundation. On-site additions, such as
garages, decks and porches must be built to local Building Codes. A building
permit must be obtained for all work performed on site to install this type of
dwelling.
      5.   Dwelling, Multi-Family: A dwelling or group of dwellings on one lot
containing separate living units for three (3) or more families, but which may
have joint services or facilities. Each dwelling unit is designed for occupancy
by one family within each unit and is attached by a common wall. The use
includes condominiums and apartments.
      6.   Dwelling, Townhouse: A building that has two (2) or more single-
family dwelling units erected on top of each other or in a row as a single
building, each unit being separated from the adjoining unit(s) by a fire wall
(to be constructed in accordance with code) along the dividing lot line, and
each such building being separated from any other building by space on all
sides. Each individual townhouse unit has individual front and rear access to
the outside. Townhouse units are typically surrounded by common areas owned and
maintained by a property owners' association. Each unit is identified by
specific title and ownership that includes the structure as well as the ground
immediately below the unit. The use includes patio homes and row homes.
      7.   Mobile Home Park: A residential development that consists of mobile
homes that are transported to the park site for use as permanent dwelling
units.
      8.   Courtyard Cottage: The courtyard cottage building type consists of a
series of small detached or attached houses on a single lot, arranged to define
a shared court that is perpendicular to the street. All units address and are
accessed from this shared court. This building type provides an option for
living in a smaller, high-quality house in a more community- driven environment
due to the shared outdoor space.
   B.   Group Living: This category is characterized by residential occupancy
of a structure by a group of people who do not meet the definition of
"household living". Tenancy is arranged on a monthly or longer basis, and the
size of the group may be larger than a family.
Generally, group living structures have a common eating area for residents. The
residents may receive care, training, or treatment, and caregivers may or may
not also reside at the site. Accessory uses commonly include recreational

typically situated at or below the frost line depth.
FOUNDATION WALLS: A support structure that connects the foundation to the main
portion of the building or superstructure.
FRAUD/VICTIMIZATION: Related to variances of the floodplain management
regulations of this title, the variance granted must not cause fraud on or
victimization to the public. In examining this requirement, Lyon County will
consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government
responsibilities, and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one
hundred (100) years. Buildings permitted to be constructed below the base flood
elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from
floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are
subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those
increased flood damages bring. Additionally future owners may be unaware of the
risk potential to the property due to flood damage and the extremely high rates
for flood insurance.
FREEBOARD: A margin of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for
purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many
unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated for selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the
watershed.
FRONTAGE: Any boundary line of a lot or parcel of land that coincides with the
right-of-way of a street.

      1.   16 or more slot machines;
      2.   Any number of slot machines together with any other game, gaming
device, race book, sports book at one (1) establishment;
      3.   A slot machine route;
      4.   An inter-casino linked system; or
      5.   A license for or the operation of a mobile gaming system.
   B.   Restricted gaming license is a state license that limits the gaming

HARDSHIP: The exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant
the requested variance. The Board of County Commissioners requires that the
variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere
economic or financial hardship alone is not considered exceptional.
Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal
preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule,
qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved
through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is
more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the
parcel to a different use than originally intended.

Acceptable estimates of market value can be obtained from the following
sources:
   A.   Independent appraisals by a professional appraiser.
   B.   Detailed estimates of the structure's actual cash value (used as a
substitute for market value based on the preference of the community).

tool).
   E.   "Qualified estimates" based on sound professional judgment made by
staff of the local Building Department or local or State Tax Assessor's Office.
As indicated above, some market value estimates should only be used as
screening tools to identify those structures where the substantial improvement
ratios are obviously less than or greater than fifty percent (50%) (e.g., less
than 40 percent or greater than 60 percent). For structures that fall between
the forty percent (40%) and sixty percent (60%) range, more precise market
value estimates should be used.
