CHAPTER 1.08
TAKING OF PROPERTY
SECTION:
1.08.010: Findings
1.08.020: Purposes
1.08.030: Definitions
1.08.040: Compensation For Taken Property
1.08.050: Jurisdiction And Judicial Review
1.08.060: Statute Of Limitations
1.08.070: Attorney Fees And Costs
1.08.010: FINDINGS:
The board of White Pine County commissioners finds that:
   A.   The several and various estates in property situated within White Pine
County, Nevada, have value;
   B.   All affected segments of the American public, whether acting through
federal, state or local governments, have an obligation and a legal right to
acquire and pay compensation, through eminent domain, for all or portions of
estates in property situated in White Pine County, Nevada, which are
necessarily taken for public purposes;
   C.   Government taking of property without compensation unjustly infringes
constitutionally protected property rights, restricts the reasonable use of
property, and causes a few property owners to bear a burden rightfully and
legally the responsibility of all;
   D.   Property rights in White Pine County, Nevada, are being subtly
diminished through gradual application of laws, regulations and other legal
actions of government at all levels which, in the aggregate, adversely affect
their value and their owners' ability to make legal and reasonable use of
private property and substantially diminishes the county's tax and economic
bases;
   E.   Protection of wilderness, natural, riparian, pristine, and wetlands
areas, as well as of endangered species, clean air corridors, clean water
sources, view sheds, and other like values, are noble actions, but result in
many property rights being taken from their owners and from the county's
economic and tax bases for the benefit of the American public at large;
   F.   Owners or trustees of property situated in White Pine County, Nevada,
should be able to fully recover compensation for government taking of their
property;
   G.   Governments' administrative appeal processes provide means for
contesting government administrative actions, but do not provide a means for
just resolution of taking claims; and
   H.   Owners of property situated in White Pine County, Nevada, should be
able to commence court action immediately following actual and concrete injury,
to recover just compensation for government taking of their property. (Ord. 339
§1, 1999)
1.08.020: PURPOSES:
The purposes of this chapter are to:
   A.   Declare that takings of private property within White Pine County,
Nevada, for public uses are legal government actions that serve interests of
the public at large;
   B.   Establish a clear and uniform process whereby owners of taken property
in White Pine County, Nevada, can obtain vindication of all property rights
guaranteed by this chapter, the Nevada state constitution, and the fifth and
fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution; and
   C.   Require federal, state and local governments to compensate owners of
property in White Pine County, Nevada, for deprivation of their property rights
due to enforcement of federal, state or locally mandated programs. (Ord. 339
§2, 1999)
1.08.030: DEFINITIONS:

TAKING OF PRIVATE PROPERTY, TAKING, TAKEN, OR TAKE: Any agency action whereby
restricting the ownership, alienability, possession, use or lawful enjoyment of
private property is an object of that action and is taken so as to require

including by physical invasion, regulation, exaction, condition or other means.
(Ord. 339 §3, 1999)
1.08.040: COMPENSATION FOR TAKEN PROPERTY:
   A.   In General: No agency shall take private property within White Pine
County, Nevada, except for public use and with just compensation to the
property owner. A property owner shall receive just compensation:
      1.   If, as a consequence of an agency action, property, whether all or
in part, has been physically invaded or otherwise taken without the consent of
the owner; and
         a.   Such action results in the property owner being deprived, either
temporarily or permanently, by twenty percent (20%) or more, in the aggregate
over time, of the economically beneficial or productive use of the property or
of that part of the property, affected by the action, without a showing that
such deprivation inheres in the title itself; or
         b.   Such action results in the property owner being deprived, either
temporarily or permanently, by less than twenty percent (20%), in the aggregate
over time, of the economically beneficial or productive use of the property or
that part of the property affected by the action.
      2.   Under any circumstances other than as described in subsection A1 of
this section which results in or has resulted in a taking within the meaning of
the fifth amendment of the United States constitution.
   B.   No Claim Against Agency Which Is Not Responsible For Action: No action
may be filed under this title against an agency for carrying out the functions
mandated by another agency's law, regulation, policy or order. Claims arising
from the action, inaction or decision of an agency shall be properly filed
against the agency which mandates and administers the relevant program.
   C.   Burden Of Proof:
      1.   Government shall bear the burden of proof in any action described
under subsection A1a of this section, with regard to showing that such
deprivation of value inheres in the title to the property.
      2.   The property owner shall bear the burden of proof in any action
described under subsection A1b of this section, with regard to establishing the
diminution in value of property by any amount less than twenty percent (20%).
   D.   Compensation And Nuisance Exception To Payment Of Compensation:
      1.   No compensation shall be required by this chapter for taking the
owner's use, or proposed use, and only such use, of property which constitutes
a nuisance as commonly understood and defined by the state of Nevada's
principles of nuisance and property law. To bar an award of damages under this
chapter, government shall bear the burden of proof to establish that all the
taken use or proposed use of the property is a nuisance.
   E.   Adjudication:
      1.   Ripeness:
         a.   A party seeking redress shall exhaust all administrative remedies
prior to filing an action under this title unless:
            (1)   No appeal process is available;
            (2)   An appeal cannot provide the relief requested; or
            (3)   The prospects for success are reasonably unlikely and
intervention by the Nevada state 7th judicial district court or the United
States court of federal claims under this title is thus warranted to decide the

in the proceeding before the county, the court may order that the additional
evidence be taken before the county upon conditions determined by the court.
The county may modify its findings and decisions by reason of the additional
evidence and any modifications, new findings or decisions with the reviewing
court.

   A.   This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted in chapter
377A of Nevada Revised Statutes, which was enacted by the 61st session of the
Nevada legislature as chapter 683, statutes of Nevada, 1981, and relevant
portions as amended by the 63rd session of the Nevada legislature in chapter
234, statutes of Nevada, 1985; as amended by the 72nd session of the Nevada
legislature in chapter 377A by assembly bill 208.

the tax shall be used for operating White Pine County and payment of debt
service. (Ord. 394, 2006)
3.22.015: FINDINGS AND DECLARATION:
   A.   The board of county commissioners along with the Nevada department of
taxation having carefully considered that there is no other object of taxation,
except retail sales, which is so generally distributed among the residents and
visitors to the county in proportion to their respective population and wealth
as to be suitable for the imposition of a tax for the support of White Pine
County government through its current financial emergency:
      1.   That it is therefore necessary to impose a separate tax upon
tangible personal property sold at retail in the county to provide operating
revenue and to pay debt service of White Pine County government;
      2.   That in order to avoid imposing unfair competitive hardships upon
merchants within the county, it is necessary that such additional tax be
imposed:
         a.   At the same rate throughout the county; and
         b.   Upon tangible personal property purchased outside the county for
use within the county;
         c.   That the convenience of the public and of retail merchants will
best be served by imposing the tax for operating county government upon exactly
the same transactions, requiring the same reports and making such tax parallel
in all respects to the existing sales and use taxes. (Ord. 394, 2006)
3.22.020: RATE OF TAX:
That an additional sales tax in the amount of one-fourth of one percent
(0.0025%) shall be imposed upon all retail sales concurrent with the sales tax
now imposed under chapter 3.24, "Public Roads Tax", of this title. (Ord. 394,
2006)
3.22.030: EFFECTIVE DATE:
This tax shall be imposed starting July 1, 2006. (Ord. 394, 2006)
3.22.040: INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE:
Application, collection and enforcement of this tax shall be construed and
interpreted in accordance with chapter 3.24 of this title which is hereby
incorporated by this reference as though fully set forth herein. (Ord. 394,
2006)
3.22.050: AMENDMENTS:
All amendments to Nevada Revised Statutes chapter 374 which are enacted after
the date of enactment hereof, which are not inconsistent with the terms of
Nevada Revised Statutes 377A shall be automatically incorporated into this
chapter. (Ord. 394, 2006)
3.22.060: INTERLOCAL CONTRACT:
White Pine County will contract with the Nevada department of taxation to
perform all functions incident to the administration of this tax before the
effective date hereof. (Ord. 394, 2006)

good faith from a person who is engaged in the business of selling tangible

regular course of business is the rental of the property while holding it for

applicable to the transaction is guilty of a misdemeanor. (Ord. 196 §1

BOUGHT FOR RESALE:
If a purchaser who gives a certificate makes any storage or use of the property
in the county other than retention, demonstration or display while holding it
for sale in the regular course of business, the storage or use is taxable as of
the time the property is first so stored or used. If the sole use of the
property, other than retention, demonstration or display in the regular course
of business, is the rental of the property while holding it for sale, the

be a resident of the county was purchased from a retailer for storage, use or
other consumption in the county and stored, used or otherwise consumed in the
county.
   B.   This presumption may be controverted by:

   A.   This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted in chapter
377A of Nevada Revised Statutes, which was enacted by the 61st session of the
Nevada legislature as chapter 683, statutes of Nevada, 1981, as amended by the

1985; as amended by the 72nd session of the Nevada legislature in chapter 377A

3.25.015: FINDINGS AND DECLARATION:
   A.   The board of county commissioners of the county having carefully
considered that there is no other object of taxation, except retail sales,
which is so generally distributed among the residents and visitors to the
county in proportion to their respective population and wealth as to be
suitable for the imposition of a tax for the support of public swimming
facilities:
      1.   It is therefore necessary to impose a separate tax upon tangible
personal property sold at retail in the county to provide for the operation and
maintenance of a public swimming facility within the county;
      2.   In order to avoid imposing unfair competitive hardships upon
merchants within the county, it is necessary that such additional tax be
imposed:
         a.   At the same rate throughout the county; and
         b.   Upon tangible personal property purchased outside the county for
use within the county;
      3.   The convenience of the public and of retail merchants will best be
served by imposing the tax for a swimming pool facility upon exactly the same
transactions, requiring the same reports and making such tax parallel in all
respects to the existing sales and use taxes. (Ord. 385, 2003)
3.25.020: RATE OF TAX:
An additional sales tax in the amount of one-fourth of one percent (0.0025%)
shall be imposed upon all retail sales concurrent with the sales tax now
imposed under chapter 3.24, "Public Roads Tax", of this title. (Ord. 385, 2003)
3.25.030: EFFECTIVE DATE:
This tax shall be reinstated starting March 13, 2012, and shall remain in force
pending further action by the White Pine County commission. (Ord. 443, 2012)
3.25.040: INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE:
Application, collection and enforcement of the swimming pool tax shall be
construed and interpreted in accordance with chapter 3.24 of this title which
is hereby incorporated by this reference as though fully set forth herein.

the date of enactment of this chapter which are not inconsistent with the terms
of Nevada Revised Statutes 377A shall be automatically incorporated into this
chapter. (Ord. 385, 2003)

7.05.030: Appraiser Selection Process
7.05.010: PURPOSE OF APPRAISER PROVISIONS:
Pursuant to the legislative mandate of Nevada Revised Statutes 244.2795(2), the
board of county commissioners of the county of White Pine does hereby adopt
this chapter establishing the procedures for creating and amending a list of
appraisers qualified to conduct appraisals of real property offered for sale or
lease by the board. This chapter applies when the county is offering real
property for sale or lease except as otherwise provided by state law including,
but not limited to, those exceptions contained in Nevada Revised Statutes
244.2795. For the purposes of Nevada Revised Statutes 244.281(3) only, the
board hereby finds and resolves that all county owned parcels are worth more
than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) if offered for sale and authorizes the
county to follow the procedures of section
7.05.030 of this chapter to select appraisers without first having to obtain
another resolution of the board. (Ord. 464, 2016)
7.05.020: LIST OF QUALIFIED APPRAISERS:
   A.   The county shall obtain from the Nevada real estate division a list of
all qualified appraisers in White Pine County. The county shall send a request
for qualification to each appraiser on that list to determine which appraisers
are interested in performing appraisals for sale or lease of county property.
The request for qualifications shall ask the appraiser to designate whether he
or she is willing and qualified to provide an appraisal for the subject
property(ies). The request shall also ask whether the appraiser will and is
qualified to appraise county owned property to be leased. An appraiser who
fails to respond to the request for qualifications for the property(ies) within
the time specified in the request is not eligible to perform appraisals for the
county until requests for qualifications are next released.
   B.   From the responses to the request for qualifications the county shall
prepare a list of appraisers qualified to conduct appraisals of real property
offered for sale or lease by the board. The following standards shall be used
to determine minimum qualifications:
      1.   The appraiser must possess all necessary licenses;
      2.   The appraiser must not have violated professional appraiser
standards or statutory requirements in the performance of appraisals or cannot
have been disciplined or fined by any state or federal agency for conduct that
relates to the ability of the appraiser to perform the work to be required by
the county;
      3.   The appraiser must have the ability to obtain and maintain insurance
coverage as required by the county;
      4.   The appraiser must have the professional qualifications and
experience for the specific appraisal required by the county;
      5.   During the five (5) years immediately preceding the date of the
appointment by the county the appraiser cannot have filed as a debtor in a
business capacity under the provisions of the United States bankruptcy code or
breached any contracts with a public agency or person in this state or any
other state;
      6.   The appraiser's application must be truthful and complete; and
      7.   The appraiser must execute the application form and consent to and
have the ability to satisfy all terms and conditions contained in any proposed
contract for appraisal services presented by the county.
   C.   Appraisers on the list shall keep the county informed of any change in
the status of standards listed in subsections B1 through B6 of this section.
The change in the appraiser's status or failure to maintain the minimum
qualifications is cause for immediate removal from the list by the county. The
county shall provide written notice to any appraiser of his or her removal.
   D.   The names on the list shall be labeled to indicate the appraiser's
willingness and qualification to perform the appraisal(s) on the subject
property(ies). The names on the list must be organized in a random order in a
fashion determined by the county.
   E.   The names of appraisers who are organized in a firm of appraisers may
be placed on the list independently if each is independently qualified. No two
(2) appraisers from the same firm can be selected to appraise the same real
property. An appraiser who cannot be selected because of an appraisal firm
relationship retains his or her place on the list for the next appraisal
required by the county.
   F.   From time to time the county shall obtain a new list from the state
real estate division and follow the procedures in subsections B and C of this
section to assemble a new list. An appraiser whose name is stricken from the
list as required in subsection 7.05.030B of this chapter may be added to the
new list if properly qualified and responsive. (Ord. 464, 2016)
7.05.030: APPRAISER SELECTION PROCESS:
   A.   When an appraisal is required for the sale or lease of county real
property the county shall send a request for proposal to the appraiser whose
name is next on the list for the type of property appraisal required. The
request shall identify the property to be appraised, the desired terms and
conditions of appraisal and the requirements for the response to the request
for proposal. The response from the appraiser must include: a statement of
specific qualifications to do the type of appraisal required; a proposal that
complies with the terms and conditions of the request for proposal; the names
of other appraisers in the appraiser's firm, if any; a disclosure statement
which includes, without limitation, all sources of income of the appraiser that
may constitute a conflict of interest, any prior appraisal by the appraiser of
the subject property and any relationship of the appraiser with the county, the
owner of the subject property or the owners of any adjoining property to the
one being appraised; and a statement that the appraiser is not related within
the first degree of consanguinity or affinity to any person who has an interest
in the real property or an adjoining property.
   B.   If an appraiser responds to the request in terms that are responsive
and satisfactory to the county, the appraiser's proposal shall be presented to
the board of county commissioners which shall verify the qualifications of the
appraiser. The determination of the board as to qualifications is conclusive.
An appraiser's name shall be stricken from the list for the type of appraisal
requested if the appraiser does not satisfactorily respond to the request as
determined by the county or the board declines to verify the appraiser's
qualifications.
   C.   The assessor shall use the list and repeat the selection procedures
until the board approves an appraiser. To expedite the selection process, the
county may send a request for proposal to more than one appraiser on the list.
Those appraisers who respond but are not selected shall retain their places on
the list. The county may also send the name of more than one appraiser to the
board but shall report to the board the order of the appraisers on the list.

Within White Pine County it is unlawful for a dog owner to keep, harbor, or

manner disturbs the peace and quietude of the community or of any person. A
violation of this section is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of no less than
twenty five dollars ($25.00). There is no violation if the dog owner proves the
offending dog was performing a service (e.g., guard dog). (Ord. 521, 2021: Ord.

animal control area after its license has been revoked, and no other license
shall be issued for such dog.
   B.   If such dog is not removed from the animal control area within five (5)
days after its license has been revoked, the animal control officer may impound
the dog. The dog shall not thereafter be released from the animal shelter
without the written permission of the animal control officer. Prior to granting
permission to release the dog, the animal control officer shall first obtain
from the owner or other person receiving the dog a written agreement that the
dog will, if released, be permanently removed from the county. If the owner of
the dog refuses to so agree, the dog shall be destroyed in some humane manner.
The owner, however, may sign an agreement under written protest and thereby
appeal to the board of White Pine County commissioners for reinstatement of the
dog's license. The board of White Pine County commissioners shall set the
appeal for hearing within forty five (45) days after receipt of the appeal.
Pending a decision of the appeal, the dog shall be kept by the owner outside
the animal control area. After completion of the appeal hearing, the board of
White Pine County commissioners may reinstate the license, conditionally
reinstate the license, or permanently revoke the license. The decision of the
board of county commissioners shall be final. (Ord. 521, 2021: Ord. 321 (part),

living together, may be jointly or separately charged as heads of the household
where a dog is kept or harbored if the requirements of this chapter are not
complied with.
   B.   It shall not be a defense to an alleged violation of this chapter that
the true and registered owner of a dog is of such minor age as to prohibit
answer in court, and upon such occurrence, the parent or guardian of such minor
owner shall be required to appear instead and assume full responsibility for
the actions or omissions of their minor. The parent, guardian, or custodian of
any child under eighteen (18) years of age who owns, keeps, harbors or has

written notice provided for in subsection A of this section, or within twenty
(20) days after the date of such notice in the event the same was properly

property designated or described in the statement and that the same is due and

application for change of land use classification and may include such
additional property in the notices of hearing, and consider amendments relating
to such property at the public hearing.
   D.   The county shall consider the application and report of the commission
thereon at its next regular meeting after receipt of such report. If, after
further public hearing is deemed necessary, the county determines that the
public necessity, convenience, general welfare or good zoning practice requires
the change or reclassification of any portion thereof, the county shall by
ordinance effect such amendment or reclassification of any portion thereof.

17.72.240: Complaint
17.72.010: STATEMENT OF INTENT AND PURPOSE:
White Pine County recognizes home occupations can be useful to both the general
community as well as the business owner. It is the intent and purpose of the
minor deviation/home occupation provisions to provide for certain types of
occupational uses within residential districts. Home occupations must have the
following characteristics: a) they are not disruptive to the residential use of
adjacent properties; b) they generate less traffic and noise than typical
commercial or industrial activities; and c) they are compatible in appearance,
operating hours, and other factors with the surrounding neighborhood. Home
occupations may involve service as well as manufacturing, but must be accessory
and subordinate to the residential use of the property. Home occupations are
not intended to create new commercial or industrial areas, but rather to
provide an opportunity to supplement an income, start up a business, or
establish a workplace at home. (Ord. 448, 2013)
17.72.020: ACTIVITY THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE A HOME OCCUPATION PERMIT:
   A.   Activity that would ordinarily be allowed in a residential zone for
personal use and enjoyment and may generate revenue for the resident, that is
occasional, that is not advertised as a business activity, that does not have
the characteristics of a business (contracts for products and services,
business liability insurance, or special permits and licenses), and that has no
impact on the residential neighborhood in excess of normal residential activity
does not require a home occupation permit.
      1.   Examples include: a) periodic baby sitting; b) occasional sale of
animals (based on number and type of animals allowed in residential areas under
provisions of this code); c) periodic sales of products manufactured as a
result of a hobby that is allowed in a residential area (woodworking, sewing,
photography, etc.); d) foster care; e) occasional yard and garage sales; f)
periodic consulting services; g) occasional internet sales and trading
activity; h) in home or off site sales providing delivery and storage of
products does not impair the residential character of the neighborhood; and i)
other activity deemed similar by the commission. (Ord. 448, 2013)
17.72.030: ACTIVITY DEEMED A MINOR DEVIATION AND ALLOWED WITH A HOME OCCUPATION
PERMIT:
   A.   Activity which is carried out on a regular, full time, and year round
basis and has the characteristics of a business (is advertised, involves
contracts for products and services, and may require business liability
insurance or licensing and permits) but falls within the ten percent (10%)
limits of a minor deviation may be conducted with a home occupation permit
authorized without a public hearing. Characteristics of a minor deviation home
occupation include: 1) ongoing business activity that is conducted by the home
owner/renter (with the owner's written permission) and members of the family
residing in the dwelling; 2) activity that does not generate traffic, parking,
or deliveries in excess of normal residential use; 3) activity that is
secondary to the residential use of dwellings, garages, other accessory
buildings, and yard areas; 4) activity that does not require modification of
the property that is inconsistent with the residential character of the
neighborhood; 5) activity that does not generate noise, fumes, vibration,
storage of hazardous or flammable materials, or electrical interference that is
in excess of normal residential use.
      1.   Examples include: sewing and tailoring for clients; photography and
artwork on a contract basis; instrument instruction; tutoring; personal
trainers; housekeeping and janitorial work; landscaping and lawn care services;
childcare which falls under state guidelines for licensed childcare; medical
transcription and billing; secretarial and/or bookkeeping service; home office
facilities for off site business activity including sales, building contractor,
surveying, and over the road trucking; offices for professional services
including attorneys, architects, engineers, accountants, or real estate
brokers, or other home occupation activity deemed similar in nature by the
commission.
      2.   Business activities that are not considered eligible for home
occupation permits include: a) activities that by their nature include
hazardous materials, activity, and outside storage activity that is
incompatible with residential zoning requirements including on site automobile

   A.   Purpose:
      1.   The purpose of this chapter,
Chapter 17.88 : Special Use Permits, is to provide a method of reviewing
proposed land uses which possess characteristics that require special appraisal
in order to determine if the uses have the potential to adversely affect other
land uses, transportation systems, public facilities in the vicinity, and other
social, economic and public interest considerations, including, but not limited
to increased fire risk, impacts on wildlife and livestock, impacts on property
values, impacts on community character, noise impacts, visual impacts, risk of
loss of wetland:? and/or other wildlife habitat, changes to community
character, public health issues, air quality issues, and the impacts on
existing land uses.

Board of County Commissioners may require conditions of approval necessary to
eliminate or minimize to an acceptable level any potentially adverse effects of
the use.
   B.   When Required: A special use permit is required whenever a proposed
land use possesses the characteristics addressed in White Pine County Code
Section
17.88.005 (A), In the event of a conflict between
Chapter 17.88  of the White Pine County Code and any other provision of the
White Pine County Code addressing permissible land use.
Chapter 17.88  shall prevail as the relevant and binding authority. (Ord. 506,
2020)
17.88.010: CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL OF A SPECIAL USE PERMIT:
   A.   The White Pine County commission may approve an application for a
special use permit under the following conditions:
      1.   The proposed use exceeds a ten percent (10%) deviation from the
requirements of the zoning designation.
      2.   The county commission has determined that the proposed use with the
appropriate restrictions or conditions will not be significantly detrimental to
the public health, safety, or general welfare; will not be injurious to the
property or improvements of adjacent properties; will not be detrimental to the
character of the surrounding area;, or will not be inconsistent with the
general purposes and intent of this title or land use plan. When making its
determination, the county commission may consider whether the proposed land use
possesses any of the characteristics addressed in White Pine County Code
Section 17.88.005(A).
      3.   The White Pine County commission has reviewed the application, the
supplemental information and findings of fact, comments from the public
hearing, the zoning map, and the county's land use plan and has determined that
the proposed use is sufficiently similar in nature to the use in the zoning
designation or surrounding designations or that it is in compliance with the
goals and recommendations for the vicinity identified in the county's land use
plan to allow it to occur within its existing zone if it operates in accordance
with specific conditions identified through the application and review process.
      4.   Issuance of a zone change for the proposed use would constitute
"spot zoning" or the county commission determines that it would be unwise to
allow future development that could involve any or all of the permitted uses of
the new zoning designation. (Ord. 506, 2020; Ord. 447, 2013)

restrictions or conditions, would be significantly detrimental to the public
health, safety, or general welfare injurious to the property or improvements of
adjacent properties; be detrimental to the character of the surrounding area:
or be inconsistent with the_ general purposes and intent of this title or land
use plan.    When making its determination, the county commission may consider
whether the proposed land use possesses any of the characteristics addressed in
White Pine County Code Section 17.88.005(A).
   2.   The county commission determines that the proposed use would create
negative and costly impacts on county services and surrounding property owners.
   3.   The county commission determines that it is consistent with the
county's zoning map and land use plan to consider a zone change application for
this and other similar uses in the vicinity.
   4.   If the project is located on federal or state land, and the
environmental review by state or federal or state land management agencies
concludes that the project may result in significant irretrievable loss of
resources or irreversible negative impacts to the environment, the county
commission may deny the permit. (Ord. 506, 2020; Ord. 452, 2014: Ord. 447,

ARTICLE I. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS
17.112.010: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
To protect the citizens of White Pine County, Nevada, and to allow them to
obtain flood insurance where necessary and to obtain maximum federal disaster
relief if necessary, the legislature of the state of Nevada has in Nevada
Revised Statutes 278.020, 244.057 and 543.020 conferred upon local governmental
units the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the White Pine County
board of commissioners of White Pine County, state of Nevada, does hereby adopt
the following floodplain management regulations. (Ord. 408 §1, 2008)
17.112.020: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of White Pine County are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities also contributes to flood losses. (Ord. 408 §1, 2008)
17.112.030: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
   A.   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied
uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land
within flood prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood related erosion areas.
These regulations are designed to:
      1.   Protect human life and health;
      2.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      3.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      4.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      5.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      6.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted
areas caused by flood damage;
      7.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
      8.   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 408 §1, 2008)
17.112.040: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
   A.   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations
to:
      1.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
      2.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      3.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
      4.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
      5.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood bafflers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas. (Ord. 408 §1, 2008)
ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS
17.112.050: TERMS DEFINED:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application.
A ZONE: See definition of Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE: A structure that is either:
   A.   Solely for the parking of no more than two (2) cars; or
   B.   A small, low cost shed for limited storage, less than one hundred fifty
(150) square feet and one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) in value.
ACCESSORY USE: A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use
of the parcel of land on which it is located.
ALLUVIAL FAN: A geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or fan shaped
deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from
mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley
floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris
flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration.
APEX: A point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path
of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan
flooding can occur.
APPEAL: A request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation
of any provision of this chapter.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO or AH zone on the flood insurance
rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet (3'); a
clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable
and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: See definition of Special Flood Hazard Area
(SFHA).
BASE FLOOD: A flood which has a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood"). Base flood is
the term used throughout this chapter.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map
for zones AE, AH, A1-30, VE and V1-V30 that indicates the water surface
elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent (1%) or greater chance
of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (i.e., below
ground level) on all sides.
BUILDING: See definition of Structure.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
ENCROACHMENT: The advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill,
excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain
which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before March 12, 2008.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads).
FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM): The official map on which the federal
emergency management agency or federal insurance administration has delineated
both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.
FLOOD, FLOODING, OR FLOODWATER: A. A general and temporary condition of partial
or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland
or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and
   B.   The condition resulting from flood related erosion.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): The official map on which the federal
emergency management agency or federal insurance administration has delineated
both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable
to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided by the federal insurance
administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, the
flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base
flood.
FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR: The community official designated by title to
administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited
to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of
police power which control development in flood prone areas. This term
describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which
provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.
FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by
water from any source. See definition of Flood, Flooding, Or Floodwater.
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing,
see FEMA technical bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93.
FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot (1').
Also referred to as "regulatory floodway".
FLOODWAY FRINGE: That area of the floodplain on either side of the "regulatory
floodway" where encroachment may be permitted.
FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION: As related to article VI of this chapter, means that
the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In
examining this requirement, White Pine County will consider the fact that every
newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a
part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that
are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject
during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future
owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the
costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages
bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is
subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood
insurance rates.
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. This term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair
facilities, and does not include long term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
GOVERNING BODY: The local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality, that is
empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health,
safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
HARDSHIP: As related to article VI of this chapter means the exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance.
White Pine County requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and
peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is
not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is:
   A.   Listed individually in the national register of historic places (a
listing maintained by the department of the interior) or preliminarily
determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the national register;
   B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district;
   C.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states
with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary
of the interior; or
   D.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either
by an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the interior or
directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved programs.
LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement
(see definition of Basement).
   A.   An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that
is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area
other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor
provided it conforms to applicable nonelevation design requirements, including,
but not limited to:
      1.   The flood openings standard in subsection
17.112.160A3d of this chapter;
      2.   The anchoring standards in subsection
17.112.160A1 of this chapter;
      3.   The construction materials and methods standards in subsection
17.112.160A2 of this chapter; and
      4.   The standards for utilities in section
17.112.170 of this chapter.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MARKET VALUE: Is defined in White Pine County substantial damage/improvement
procedures. See subsection
17.112.130A2a of this chapter.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the
national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American vertical datum
(NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a
community's flood insurance rate map are referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For floodplain management purposes, means structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced on or after March 12, 2008, and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after March 12,
2008.
OBSTRUCTION: Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment,
levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge,
conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure,
vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any
watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
100-YEAR FLOOD: See definition of Base Flood.
PROGRAM DEFICIENCY: A defect in a community's floodplain management regulations
or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of those
floodplain management regulations.
PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE: As related to article VI of this chapter, means
that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious
to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable
number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the
customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or
basin.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: Means a vehicle which is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis;
   B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
   C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck; and
   D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
REGULATORY FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot
(1').
REMEDY A VIOLATION: To bring the structure or other development into compliance
with state or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is not
possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be
reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from
flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or
otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal
financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
RIVERINE: Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
SHEET FLOW AREA: See definition of Area Of Shallow Flooding.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): An area in the floodplain subject to a one
percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an
FHBM or FIRM as zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or AH.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and other proposed new
development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days from
the date of the permit. The "actual start" means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the "actual start of construction" means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this
includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits
construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance
required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic
vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American vertical datum (NAVD) of 1988, or
other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains
of coastal or riverine areas.
WATERCOURSE: A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur. (Ord. 408 §2, 2008)
ARTICLE III. GENERAL PROVISIONS
17.112.060: LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES:
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the
jurisdiction of White Pine County. (Ord. 408 §3, 2008)
17.112.070: BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD:
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the federal emergency
management agency (FEMA) in the flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) dated
September 18, 1987, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS (flood
insurance study) and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of
this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow
implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to White Pine County
by the floodplain administrator. The study and FIRMs are on file at White Pine
County Building And Planning Department, 953 Campton Street, Ely, NV 89301.
(Ord. 408 §3, 2008)
17.112.080: COMPLIANCE:
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards) shall constitute a misdemeanor.
Nothing herein shall prevent White Pine County from taking such lawful action
as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord. 408 §3, 2008)
17.112.090: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 408 §3,
2008)
17.112.100: INTERPRETATION:
   A.   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions
shall be:
      1.   Considered as minimum requirements;
      2.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. (Ord. 408 §3, 2008)
17.112.110: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of White Pine County, any officer or
employee thereof, the state of Nevada, or the federal emergency management
agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 408 §3, 2008)
ARTICLE IV. ADMINISTRATION
17.112.120: DESIGNATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR:
The building official is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce
this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its
provisions. (Ord. 408 §4, 2008)
17.112.130: DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR:
   A.   The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall
include, but not be limited to, the following:
      1.   Permit Review: Review all development permits to determine:
         a.   Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied,
including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of
existing structures;
         b.   All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;
         c.   The site is reasonably safe from flooding;
         d.   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a
floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot (1') at any point within White Pine County; and
         e.   All letters of map revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects
are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must
not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved
CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land
preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition.
      2.   Development Of Substantial Improvement And Substantial Damage
Procedures:
         a.   Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers To Questions About
Substantially Damaged Buildings", develop detailed procedures for identifying
and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial
damage, to include defining "market value".
         b.   Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/
divisions and implemented by community staff.
      3.   Review, Use And Development Of Other Base Flood Data: When base
flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with section
17.112.070 of this chapter, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review,
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available
from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer article
V of this chapter.
Note: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two (2) methods from
the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development In Approximate
Zone A Areas - A Guide For Obtaining And Developing Base (100-Year) Flood
Elevations" dated July 1995.
      4.   Notification Of Other Agencies:
         a.   Alteration or relocation of a watercourse:
            (1)   Notify adjacent communities and the Nevada division of water
resources prior to alteration or relocation;
            (2)   Submit evidence of such notification to the federal emergency
management agency; and
            (3)   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
         b.   Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations:
            (1)   Within six (6) months of information becoming available or
project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall
submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data
to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR).
            (2)   All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to
the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on
conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow
construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as
specified in the "start of construction" definition.
Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical
changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain
management requirements are based on current data.

A zone), elevated to or above the base flood elevation; as determined under
subsection
 17.112.130A3 of this chapter.
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor,
including basement, shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or
licensed land surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be
properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the
floodplain administrator.
         b.   Crawl Space Construction: This subsection applies to buildings
with crawl spaces up to two feet (2') below grade. Below grade crawl space
construction in accordance with the requirements listed below will not be

improvements of nonresidential structures shall either be elevated to conform
with subsection A3a of this section or:
            (1)   Be floodproofed, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the elevation recommended under subsection A3a of this
section, so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water;
            (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
            (3)   Be certified by a registered civil engineer or architect that
the standards of subsections A3a(1) and A3a(2) of this section are satisfied.
Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator.

elevations (BFEs).
      2.   Identify the elevations of lowest floors of all proposed structures
and pads on the final plans.
      3.   If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the following
as built information for each structure shall be certified by a registered
civil engineer or licensed land surveyor and provided as part of an application
for a letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) to the floodplain
administrator:
         a.   Lowest floor elevation.

systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
   D.   All subdivisions and other proposed development shall provide adequate
drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. (Ord. 408 §5, 2008)
17.112.190: STANDARDS FOR MANUFACTURED HOMES:
   A.   All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, on
sites located: 1) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 2) in a
new manufactured home park or subdivision; 3) in an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision; or 4) in an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial

floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential,
the following provisions apply:
      1.   Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction,
substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be
permitted within zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot (1') at any point within White Pine County.
      2.   Within an adopted regulatory floodway, White Pine County shall
prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil
engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not
result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
      3.   If subsections A1 and A2 of this section are satisfied, all new
construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall
comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this
article. (Ord. 408 §5, 2008)
ARTICLE VI. VARIANCE PROCEDURE
17.112.220: NATURE OF VARIANCES:
The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only.
Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk
and will not be modified by the granting of a variance.
The variance criteria set forth in this article are based on the general
principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are
not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with
physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of
this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the
surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property
and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain
to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property
owners.
It is the duty of White Pine County to help protect its citizens from flooding.
This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a
structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood
elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The
long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met
if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided
in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be
met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to
screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are
more appropriate. (Ord. 408 §6, 2008)
17.112.230: CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES:
   A.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-
half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the
procedures of articles IV and V of this chapter have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
   B.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic
structures" (as defined in section
17.112.050 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
   C.   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   D.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
"Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the
requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an
elevation requirement, this means White Pine County need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which White Pine County believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
   E.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
      1.   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars
($100.00) of insurance coverage, and
      2.   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by
the floodplain administrator in the office of the White Pine County recorder
and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of
the affected parcel of land.
   F.   The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management
agency. (Ord. 408 §6, 2008)
17.112.240: APPEAL BOARD:
   A.   In passing upon requests for variances, White Pine County shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      1.   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of
others;
      2.   Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      3.   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      4.   Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
      5.   Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      6.   Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are
not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      7.   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      8.   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      9.   Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      10.   Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and
      11.   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.
   B.   Variances shall only be issued upon a:
      1.   Showing of good and sufficient cause;
      2.   Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional "hardship" to the applicant; and
      3.   Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary
public expense, create a nuisance (see "public safety and nuisance"), cause
"fraud and victimization" of the public, or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
   C.   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement,
and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections A through D of this
section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected
by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not
result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
   D.   Upon consideration of the factors of subsection
17.112.230A of this chapter and the purposes of this chapter, White Pine County
may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary
to further the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 408 §6, 2008)
 
ARTICLE VII. APPENDIX
17.112.250: ALLUVIAL FAN ADVISORY:
   A.   Hazards Of Alluvial Fan Development: Alluvial fans present a unique
flood hazard environment where the combination of sediment, slope, and
topography create an ultra hazardous condition for which elevation on fill will
not provide reliable protection. Active alluvial fan flooding is characterized
by flow path uncertainty combined with abrupt deposition and erosion. As a
result, any area of an alluvial fan may be subject to intense flood hazards.
The technology of mathematically modeling the hydrodynamics of water and debris
flows for alluvial fans is still in the early development stage. The federal
emergency management agency (FEMA) has formulated a mapping procedure for the
purpose of defining the likelihood of flood hazards on inundated alluvial fan
zones to be used for flood insurance purposes and general floodplain
regulation, referred to as the FEMA alluvial fan methodology.
An active alluvial fan flooding hazard is indicated by three (3) related
criteria:
      1.   Flow path uncertainty below the hydrographic apex;
      2.   Abrupt deposition and ensuing erosion of sediment as a stream or
debris flow loses its competence to carry material eroded from a steeper,
upstream source area; and
      3.   An environment where the combination of sediment availability,
slope, and topography creates an ultra hazardous condition for which elevation
on fill will not reliably mitigate the risk.
Inactive alluvial fan flooding is similar to traditional riverine flood
hazards, but occurs only on alluvial fans. It is characterized by flow paths
with a higher degree of certainty in realistic assessments of flood risk or in
the reliable mitigation of the hazard. Counter to active alluvial fan flooding
hazards, an inactive alluvial fan flooding hazard is characterized by
relatively stable flow paths. However, areas of inactive alluvial fan flooding,
as with active alluvial fan flooding, may be subject to sediment deposition and
erosion, but to a degree that does not cause flow path instability and
uncertainty.
An alluvial fan may exhibit both active alluvial fan flooding and inactive
alluvial fan flooding hazards. The hazards may vary spatially or vary at the
same location, contingent on the level of flow discharge. Spatially, for
example, upstream inactive portions of the alluvial fan may distribute flood
flow to active areas at the distal part of the alluvial fan. Hazards may vary
at the same location, for example, with a flow path that may be stable for
lower flows, but become unstable at higher flows.
More detailed information can be found at FEMA's website: "guidelines for
determining flood hazards on alluvial fans" at http://www.fema.gov/fhm/
ft_afgd2.shtm#1.
   B.   Alluvial Fans And LOMRs: The NFIP does not allow for the removal of
land from the floodplain based on the placement of fill (LOMR-F) in alluvial
fan flood hazard areas. The NFIP will credit a major structural flood control
project, through the LOMR process, that will effectively eliminate alluvial fan
flood hazards from the protected area. Details about map revisions for alluvial
fan areas can be found in the code of federal regulations at title 44, part
65.13. (Ord. 408, 2008)
