in the city for the purpose of constructing or repairing sewers or drains,

the same forthwith, then and in that case, and in the case of non-residents,
the same may be repaired by the street commissioner at the expense of the lot
adjoining said defective sidewalk; provided, that the expense to be charged to
any lot for any such repairs shall in no case exceed five dollars, unless such

such repairs.

penalty or forfeiture provided for in this act or in the ordinance, by-law or

accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater”, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at the control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of premise
is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally,
but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour
composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab
samples.

and any modification thereof.
   (L)   New connections. New connections to the municipality’s sanitary sewer
system will be allowed only if there is available capacity.
   (M)   Pretreatment. Persons discharging industrial wastes into any public
sewer may be required to pretreat such wastes, if the Approving Authority
determines pretreatment is necessary to protect the wastewater treatment
facilities or to prevent the discharge of incompatible pollutants. In that
event, such person shall provide at their expense such pretreatment or
processing facilities as may be determined necessary to render wastes
acceptable for admission to the sanitary sewers.

municipality and shall not deposit or drain any gasoline, oil, acid, alkali,
grease, rags, waste, volatile or flammable liquids, or other deleterious
substances into the public sewers, nor allow any earth, sand, or other solid
material to pass into any part of the wastewater treatment facilities.
      (4)   Persons with a permit for disposing of septic tank sludge, holding
tank sewage, and/or grease trap into wastewater treatment facilities shall be
charged as follows:
 
Type                Unit Cost
Septic tank sludge  $89.12/1,000 gallons
Holding tank sewage $15.12/1,000 gallons
Grease trap         $250/1,000 gallons
Hauler contract     $125/year
 
      (5)   Persons disposing wastes agree to indemnify and hold harmless the
municipality from any and all liability and claims for damages arising out of
or resulting from work and labor performed.
   (D)   Charge for toxic pollutants. Any person discharging toxic pollutants
that cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or sludge from the
municipality’s wastewater treatment facility shall pay for such increased
costs, as may be determined by the Approving Authority.
   (E)   Industrial waste pretreatment. Where it is necessary that the utility
provide pretreatment of industrial wastes, the entire cost of such pretreatment
shall be charged to the person producing the industrial wastes. The costs shall
include, but are not limited to, capital expenditures, operation and
maintenance expenses, labor, chemicals, power and heat.
   (F)   Contract basis. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the City from
providing sewage services to persons outside the corporate limits of the City
under mutually agreeable conditions.
   (G)   Control manholes.
      (1)   All persons discharging industrial wastes into a public sewer shall
construct and maintain on public property 1 or more control manholes to
facilitate observation, measurement and sampling of their wastes, including
normal sewage. Control manholes shall be located and built in a manner approved
by the Approving Authority. If measuring devices are to be permanently
installed, they shall be of a type approved by the Approving Authority.
      (2)   Control manholes, and related equipment, shall be installed by the
person discharging the waste, at their expense, and shall be maintained by them
in safe condition, accessible and in proper operating condition at all times.
Plans for the installation of control manholes and related equipment shall be
submitted for approval to the Approving Authority prior to the beginning of
construction. The provisions in regard to control manholes shall apply only to
industrial waste discharges having their initial discharge to the public sewers
after the effective date of this chapter.
   (H)   Exemption meters.
      (1)   In the event that a person discharging industrial wastes into the
public sewers produces evidence satisfactory to the Approving Authority that
significant amounts to the total annual volume of water used for all purposes
does not reach the sanitary sewer, the person may be permitted to have an
exemption water meter installed. The meter shall be furnished by the City water
utility and installed under its supervision. All other costs are at the expense
of the person requiring the meter, including any piping revisions required to
insure that only water not reaching the sanitary sewer is metered by the
exemption meter. To compensate for the cost of furnishing, reading and
servicing each exemption meter, the City water utility will assess the service
charge it has set for a meter of that size.
      (2)   The amount of exemption water metered shall be subtracted from the
total amount of water used by the person, and an adjusted water bill shall be
determined, based on only water reaching the sanitary sewer. This adjusted
water bill will be used to determine the applicable sewage service charge.
   (I)   Waste meters. Devices for metering the volume of waste discharged may
be required by the Approving Authority if these volumes cannot otherwise be
determined by the use of water meters and exemption water meters. Metering
devices for determining the volume of waste shall be purchased, installed,
owned and maintained by the person. The type of meter and metering arrangement
shall be approved by the Approving Authority before installation, and it shall
be installed in accordance with approved methods. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed without the consent of the
Approving Authority. These meters shall be calibrated on an annual basis at the
owner’s expense.
   (J)   Waste sampling. Industrial wastes discharged into the public sewers
shall be subject to periodic inspection and a determination of character and
concentration. The determination shall be made as often as deemed necessary.
Where samples are taken often enough to produce meaningful averages, charges
will be determined based on the average values determined during the billing
period, after due allowance for values not believed to be representative. Any
person may request that the utility make new tests. Such tests shall be at
expense of the person discharging the waste, and for a minimum duration of 24
hours unless otherwise approved. If the Approving Authority is satisfied that
the test was made when the plant was operating under normal conditions, the
results of the test shall be used in computing the subsequent billing in the
manner previously prescribed.
   (K)   Analyses. Laboratory procedures used in the examination of industrial
wastes shall be those set forth in “Standard Methods”. However, alternate
methods for certain analyses may be used, subject to mutual agreement between
the person and the Approving Authority.
   (L)   Sewage service charges. All other charges provided for in this chapter
shall be included as a separate item on the regular bill for water service, and
shall be payable in monthly installments in accordance with the existing rules
and regulations of the City water utility.
   (M)   Payment. Sewage service charges and all other charges provided for as
surcharges in this chapter shall be due and payable at the office of the City
water utility at Medford City Hall, or at any other officially designated
location, at the same time that the water bills become due. Payments for water
service shall not be accepted without full payment of the sewage service
charges and all other charges provided for in this chapter.
   (N)   Biennial review. The Approving Authority shall, at least once every 2
years, report to the Council concerning the adequacy of wastewater charges to
cover actual costs. The charges for sewer and wastewater treatment shall be
adjusted properly by the Council to cover the actual costs of operating the
system, including the cost of operation, maintenance and replacement.
   (O)   Proportionate distribution. It is the intent of the City that all user
classes utilizing the City’s sanitary sewers pay their proportionate share of
the operation, maintenance and replacement costs.
   (P)   Revenue levels. It is the intent of the City to raise sufficient
revenues through the sewer service charges to pay all operation, maintenance
and replacement costs.
   (Q)   Excess class revenue. Any excess revenues collected from a user class
in 1 year shall be attributed to its share of the operation, maintenance and
replacement costs incurred the following year.
   (R)   Annual notification. Users will be notified annually of that portion
of user charges attributable to wastewater treatment services.
   (S)   Preexisting agreements. The user charge system included in this
chapter shall take precedence over preexisting agreements inconsistent with the
governing regulations of this chapter.
   (T)   Replacement fund. All user charges specifically collected for
replacement shall be deposited in a separate and distinct fund to be used
exclusively for replacement.

time to time. Costs incurred for improvements made to a nonconforming use that
facilitate or enhance groundwater protection shall not be considered when
determining whether the total structural repairs or alterations in a non-
conforming building, premises, structure or fixture during its life exceed 50%
of the assessed value of the building, premises, structure or fixture. The
City, in its sole discretion, shall determine which improvements facilitate or
enhance groundwater protection and identify the costs for said improvements. In
addition, the following requirements apply to the owner of the property on
which there is a nonconforming use:
      (1)   The owner shall provide copies of all federal, state, and local
facility operation approvals or certificates to the City Director of Public
Works or his/her designee.

§ 5.5.01 PURPOSE.
   This chapter is intended to be a guideline to establish:
   (A)   Minimum street construction standards to insure an adequate base, good
drainage and durable surfaces.
   (B)   Minimum utility construction standards to provide for adequate
sanitary sewer, water service and storm sewer.
   (C)   Special assessment policies to insure equitable distribution of
project costs between the City and property owners.
(Ord. 428, passed 10-7-80)
§ 5.5.02 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Lot owners desiring public improvements such as watermain, sewer, and
curb and gutter should file a petition with the City Clerk. Sample petitions
are available at the City Clerk's Office. These petitions should be on file
before September 30 in order to be considered in the budget for the following
year. The amount of construction is limited within the budget of the City and
additional work is delayed until funds are available.
   (B)   The Common Council will hold a public hearing prior to levying special
assessments, unless 100% of adjacent property owners have signed the petition.
   (C)   Normally, the Common Council approves petitions which are signed by
property owners who own over 50% of the frontage abutting the proposed
improvement. However, the Common Council has authority to reject any petition
and on its own motion order a public improvement.
   (D)   Special assessment charges are based on the cost of improvement and
the benefits to adjoining property. It is impossible for the City to evaluate
adjacent property, so the maximum benefit to the property is usually considered
equal to the total cost of the improvement. Present use of property by non-
profit organizations does not reduce or eliminate assessments, because the
property itself is benefited directly and the use of property may change.
   (E)   The City may contract for such work to be done by the lowest qualified
bidder if deemed reasonable in cost, or it may have the work done by persons
employed by the City.
(Ord. 428, passed 10-7-80)
§ 5.5.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

   IRREGULAR LOT. A lot within a subdivision abutting a cul-de-sac or curved
street which is approximately equal in area to other lots within the
subdivision; however, having unusually short abutting frontage in comparison to
the other lots.
   LATERAL. Service line connecting a single property or building with a main.
   LONG FRONTAGE. The long side of a corner lot regardless of building
orientation.
   MEDFORD FUNCTIONAL STREET SYSTEM MAP. A map showing streets classified as
arterial, collector, local or rural as determined by the Common Council.

feet from the street line, the number of such building shall be conspicuously
displayed at the street line, near the walk, driveway or common entrance to
such building and upon the gate post, fence, tree, post or other appropriate
place so as to be easily discernable from the street line. The Uniform Building
Numbering Directory as prepared by the Common Council will be on file in the
office of the City Clerk and information relating thereto shall be given by the
City Clerk. Whenever any house, building or structure shall be erected or
located in the City after the entire work of establishing a uniform system of

uniformity of numbers of houses, buildings, and structures, it shall be the
duty of the owners or occupants to procure the correct number or numbers as
designated from the City Building Inspector for the said property and to

reasonably appear to have been abandoned. Except as otherwise provided in this
section, whenever any vehicle has been left unattended without the permission
of the property owner for more than 48 hours, the vehicle is deemed abandoned
and constitutes a public nuisance. A motor vehicle shall not be considered an
abandoned motor vehicle when it is out of ordinary public view, or when
designated as not abandoned by a duly authorized police, municipal, or county
official pursuant to municipal or county ordinance.
   (B)   Any vehicle in violation of this section shall be impounded until
lawfully claimed or disposed of under Wisconsin Statutes § 342.40.

      (1)   Intentionally absconds without paying rent that has been
contractually agreed upon in a written lease with a landlord, or without paying

tenant fails to pay rent or utility service charges due prior to the vacating
of the rental premises by the tenant, and the non-payment of said rent or
utility service charges continues for a period of 5 days after vacation of the
premises; or

defraud will be established if a tenant fails, within 5 days of a written

presented as rent or utility service charges payment plus any bank charges to
the landlord attributable to the unredeemability of the draft.

provides the following:

lease agreement, including proof that the utility service charges were the
responsibility of the tenant in addition to basic rent.

was due, the date the tenant actually vacated the premises, and testimony that
the rent or utility service charges remained unpaid for not less than 5 days
after vacating and that the tenant did not notify or attempt to notify the
complainant of tenant's new address, or that tenant knowingly gave complainant
a false address.
      (3)   As to an unredeemable payment, the document used for attempting
rent or utility service charges payment, the written demand for payment of the
full amount plus bank charges, proof that the tenant received the written
demand, and testimony that at least 5 days have elapsed since the demand was

§ 13.1.12 LOITERING OR PROWLING.
   No person shall loiter or prowl in a place, at a time or in a manner not
usual for law abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant alarm for
the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. Among the circumstances
which may be considered in determining whether such alarm is warranted is the
fact that the person takes flight upon appearance of a police or peace officer,
refuses to identify himself/herself or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself/
herself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances makes
it impracticable, a police or peace officer shall, prior to any arrest for an
offense under this subsection, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any
alarm which would otherwise be warranted by requesting him/her to identify
himself/herself and explain his/her presence and conduct. No person shall be
convicted of an offence under this subsection if the police or peace officer
did not comply with the preceding sentence or if it appears at trial that the
explanation given by the person was true and, if believed by the police or
peace officer at the time, would have dispelled the alarm.

Council decision. On such effective date, the Commission shall issue a
statement of waiver.
   (B)   The 6-month time period, following a denial of a certificate of

for construction, alteration or demolition, the Commission may appeal to the
Council for 1 additional stay of construction, reconstruction, alteration or
demolition. Such Commission appeal shall be filed in writing with the City
Clerk prior to the expiration of the original 6-month delay period and shall be
acted on by the Common Council within 30 days after receipt of the written
appeal. The Common Council may deny such appeal or grant such appeal for an
additional delay period of not more than 6 months. The burden of showing that
the applicant has not attempted to discuss alternatives with the Commission
shall be upon the Commission. Upon expiration of any additional delay period,
the Commission shall issue a statement of waiver and the Building Inspector may

§ 15.3.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wisconsin Statutes,
§§ 61.35 and 62.23, and the requirements in Wisconsin Statutes § 87.30.
(Ord. 904, passed 5-2-06; Am. Ord. 1095, passed 1-16-24)
§ 15.3.002 FINDING OF FACT.
   Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this
municipality would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general
welfare and tax base.
(Ord. 904, passed 5-2-06; Am. Ord. 1095, passed 1-16-24)
§ 15.3.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   This chapter is intended to regulate floodplain development to:
   (A)   Protect life, health and property;
   (B)   Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects;
   (C)   Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the
taxpayers;
   (D)   Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;
   (F)   Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the
floodplain;
   (G)   Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers;
   (H)   Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage
and result in conflicts between property owners; and
   (I)   Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable
alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.
(Ord. 904, passed 5-2-06; Am. Ord. 1095, passed 1-16-24)
§ 15.3.004 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for Medford,
Wisconsin.
(Ord. 904, passed 5-2-06; Am. Ord. 1095, passed 1-16-24)
§ 15.3.005 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Areas to be regulated. This chapter regulates all areas of special
flood hazard identified as zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, or AE on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map. Additional areas identified on maps approved by the Department of
Natural Resources (DNR) and local community may also be regulated under the
provisions of this chapter, where applicable.
   (B)   Official maps and revisions. Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) are
designated as zones A, A1-30, AE, AH, or AO on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRMs) based on flood hazard analyses summarized in the Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) listed in division (1) below. Additional flood hazard areas subject to
regulation under this chapter are identified on maps based on studies approved
by the DNR and listed in division (2) below. These maps and revisions are on
file in the office of the City Planner.
      (1)   Official maps based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS).
         (a)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel numbers 55119C0538D,
55119C0539D, 55119C0540D, 55119C0545D, 55119C0726D, 55119C0727D, and
55119C0735D, dated 3/13/2024.

Frequency Flood delineation, Floodway delineation.
            2.   Floodway data table dated 1993 and titled Table 2: Floodway
Data.
            3.   Flood profiles dated June 1993 and titled Appendix A Flood
Profiles - 100-Year Storm profile.
   (C) Establishment of floodplain zoning districts. The flood hazard areas
regulated by this chapter are divided into districts as follows:
      (1)   The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and
those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the
regional floodwaters, within AE Zones as shown on the FIRM, or within A Zones
shown on the FIRM when determined according to §
15.3.045.
      (2)   The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion of a riverine special
flood hazard area outside the floodway within AE Zones on the FIRM, or, when
floodway limits have been determined according to §
15.3.045, within A Zones shown on the FIRM.
      (3)   The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those riverine areas that
may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood in which a floodway
boundary has not been delineated on the FIRM and also includes shallow flooding
areas identified as AH and AO zones on the FIRM.
   (D)   Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between the exterior
boundaries of zones A1-30, AE, AH, or A on the official floodplain zoning map
and actual field conditions may be resolved using the criteria in divisions (1)
or (2) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended
according to §
15.3.070 Amendments. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived
from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a
map amendment is required. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for
documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which
the district boundary was determined. Disputes between the Zoning Administrator
and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to
§
15.3.063(C) and the criteria in divisions (1) and (2) below. Where the flood
profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must
approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to §
15.3.070 Amendments.
      (1)   If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations
shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations
shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
      (2)   Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, including any
boundary of zone A and AO, the location of the boundary shall be determined by
the map scale.
   (E)   Removal of lands from floodplain.
      (1)   Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be grounds
for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet
above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land
outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to §
15.3.070 Amendments.
      (2)   The delineation of any of the Floodplain Districts may be revised
by the community where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or where
more detailed studies have been conducted. However, prior to any such change,
approval must be obtained from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources
and Federal Emergency Management Agency. A completed Letter of Map Revision is
a record of this approval. The Floodplain Administrator shall not sign a
community acknowledgement form unless all criteria set forth in the following
paragraphs are met:
         (a)   The land and/or land around the structure must be filled at
least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation; and
         (b)   The fill must be contiguous to land outside the floodplain;
Applicant shall obtain floodplain development permit before applying for a LOMR
or LOMR-F.
      (3)   Removal of lands from the floodplain may also occur by operation of
Wisconsin Statutes § 815.3.300(1)(e), if a property owner has obtained a letter
of map amendment from the federal emergency management agency under 44 CFR 70.
   (F)   Compliance.
      (1)   No structure or use within areas regulated by this chapter shall
hereafter be located, erected, constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended,
converted, enlarged, or altered without full compliance with the terms of these
regulations and all other applicable regulations that apply to uses within the
jurisdiction of these regulations.
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with §
15.3.081.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications, or
amendments thereto if approved by the Floodplain Administrator. Use,
arrangement, or construction contrary to that authorized shall be deemed a
violation of these regulations and punishable in accordance with §
15.3.081.
   (G)   Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically
exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to
comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are
required to comply if Wisconsin Statutes § 13.48(13), applies. The
construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and
bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when Wisconsin
Statutes § 30.2022, applies. Although exempt from a local zoning permit and
permit fees, DOT must provide sufficient project documentation and analysis to
ensure that the community is in compliance with Federal, State, and local
floodplain standards. If a local transportation project is located within a
Zone A floodplain and is not a WisDOT project under Wisconsin Statutes §
30.2022, then the road project design documents (including appropriate detailed
plans and profiles) may be sufficient to meet the requirements for issuance of
a local floodplain permit if the following apply: The applicant provides
documentation to the Floodplain Administrator that the proposed project is a
culvert replacement or bridge replacement under 20 feet span at the same
location, the project is exempt from a DNR permit under Wisconsin Statutes §
30.123(6)(d), the capacity is not decreased, the top road grade is not raised,
and no floodway data is available from a federal, state, or other source. If
floodway data is available in the impacted area from a federal, state, or other
source, that existing data must be utilized by the applicant in the analysis of
the project site.
   (H)   Abrogation and greater restrictions.
      (1)   This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under Wisconsin Statutes § 62.23 or § 815.3.300, which relate
to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance shall continue in full force and
effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
      (2)   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing deed restrictions, covenants, or easements. If this chapter imposes
greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
   (I)   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this chapter are the minimum requirements liberally construed in
favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other
powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this chapter,
required by Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be
interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of
this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this
chapter.
   (J)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in
this chapter are based on engineering experience and research. Larger floods
may occur, or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes.
This chapter does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted
floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damage. This chapter does
not create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the
municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may
result from reliance on this chapter.
   (K)   Severability. Should any portion of this chapter be declared
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder
of this chapter shall not be affected.
   (L)   Annexed areas for cities and villages. The Taylor County floodplain
zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect
and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the
municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of
Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and 44 CFR 59-72, National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning
map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the
purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the
Municipal Zoning Administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the
regional flood elevation and the floodway location.

NONCONFORMING USES
§ 15.3.051 GENERAL.
   (A)   Applicability.
      (1)   The standards in this section shall apply to all uses and buildings
that do not conform to the provisions contained within a floodplain zoning
ordinance or with Wisconsin Statutes § 815.3.300, and §§ NR 116.12-14, Wis.
Adm. Code and 44 CFR 59-72. These standards shall apply to all modifications or
additions to any nonconforming use or structure and to the use of any structure
or premises which was lawful before the passage of this chapter or any
amendment thereto. A party asserting the existence of a lawfully established
nonconforming use or structure has the burden of proving that the use or
structure was compliant with the floodplain zoning ordinance in effect at the
time the use or structure was created.
      (2)   As permit applications are received for additions, modifications,
or substantial improvements to nonconforming buildings in the floodplain,
municipalities shall develop a list of those nonconforming buildings, their
present equalized assessed value, and a list of the costs of those activities
associated with changes to those buildings.
   (B)   The existing lawful use of a structure or its accessory use which is
not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter may continue subject to
the following conditions:
      (1)   (a)   No modifications or additions to a nonconforming use or
structure shall be permitted unless they comply with this chapter. The words
“modification” and “addition” include, but are not limited to, any alteration,
addition, modification, structural repair, rebuilding, or replacement of any
such existing use, structure or accessory structure or use. Maintenance is not
considered a modification; this includes painting, decorating, paneling and
other nonstructural components and the maintenance, repair or replacement of
existing private sewage or water supply systems or connections to public
utilities. Any
costs associated with the repair of a damaged structure are not considered
maintenance.
         (b)   The construction of a deck that does not exceed 200 square feet
and that is adjacent to the exterior wall of a principal structure is not an
extension, modification, or addition. The roof of the structure may extend over
a portion of the deck in order to provide safe ingress and egress to the
principal structure.
      (2)   If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming structure is
discontinued for 12 consecutive months, it is no longer permitted and any
future use of the property, and any structure or building thereon, shall
conform to the applicable requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   The municipality shall keep a record which lists all nonconforming
uses and nonconforming structures, their present equalized assessed value, the
cost of all modifications or additions which have been permitted, and the
percentage of the structure's total current value those modifications
represent.
      (4)   No modification or addition to any nonconforming structure or any
structure with a nonconforming use, which over the life of the structure would
equal or exceed 50% of its present equalized assessed value, shall be allowed
unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure
with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this
chapter. Contiguous dry land access must be provided for residential and
commercial uses in compliance with §
15.3.033(A). The costs of elevating the lowest floor of a nonconforming
building or a building with a nonconforming use to the flood protection
elevation are excluded from the 50% provisions of this division (B)(4).
      (5)   No maintenance on a per event basis to any nonconforming structure
or any structure with a nonconforming use, the cost of which would equal or
exceed 50% of its present equalized assessed value, shall be allowed unless the
entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with a
conforming use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this chapter.
Contiguous dry land access must be provided for residential and commercial uses
in compliance with §
15.3.033(A). Maintenance to any nonconforming structure, which does not exceed
50% of its present equalized assessed value on a per event basis, does not
count against the cumulative calculations over the life of the structure for
substantial improvement calculations.
      (6)   If on a per event basis the total value of the work being done
under divisions (B)(4) and (B)(5) above equals or exceeds 50% of the present
equalized assessed value, the work shall not be permitted unless the entire
structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with a conforming
use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this chapter. Contiguous
dry land access must be provided for residential and commercial uses in
compliance with §
15.3.033(A).
      (7)   Except as provided in division (B)(8) below, if any nonconforming
structure or any structure with a nonconforming use is destroyed or is
substantially damaged, it cannot be replaced, reconstructed, or rebuilt unless
the use and the structure meet the current ordinance requirements. A structure
is considered substantially damaged if the total cost to restore the structure
to its pre-damaged condition equals or exceeds 50% of the structure's present
equalized assessed value.
      (8)   For nonconforming buildings that are substantially damaged or
destroyed by a nonflood disaster, the repair or reconstruction of any such
nonconforming building shall be permitted to restore it to the size and use in
effect prior to the damage event, provided that the following minimum
requirements are met, and all required permits have been granted prior to the
start of construction:
         (a)   Residential structures:
            1.   Shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to
or above the base flood elevation using fill, pilings, columns, posts, or
perimeter walls. Perimeter walls must meet the requirements of §
15.3.065(B).
            2.   Shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy, and shall be constructed with methods and
materials resistant to flood damage.
            3.   Shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation,
plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are
designed and/or elevated so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of flooding.
            4.   In A zones, obtain, review, and utilize any flood data
available from a federal, state or other source.
            5.   In AO zones with no elevations specified, shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, meet the standards in §
15.3.044.
            6.   In AO zones, shall have adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from the structure.
         (b)    Nonresidential structures:
            1.   Shall meet the requirements of divisions (B)(8)(a)1. through
6. above.
            2.   Shall either have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above the regional flood elevation; or, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities, shall meet the standards in § 15.33.065(A) or
(B).
            3.   In AO Zones with no elevations specified, shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, meet the standards in §
15.3.044.
   (C)   A nonconforming historic structure may be altered if the alteration
does not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic
structure, the alteration will comply with § 15.3.023(A), flood resistant
materials are used, and construction practices and floodproofing methods that
comply with §
15.3.065 are used. Repair or rehabilitation of historic structures shall be
exempt from the development standards of §
15.3.051(B)(8)(a) if it is determined that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
   (D)   Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary,
modifications, additions, maintenance, and repairs to a nonconforming building
shall not be prohibited based on cost and the building's nonconforming use
shall be permitted to continue if:
      (1)   Any living quarters in the nonconforming building are elevated to
be at or above the flood protection elevation.
      (2)   The lowest floor of the nonconforming building, including the
basement, is elevated to or above the regional flood elevation.
      (3)   The nonconforming building is permanently changed to conform to the
applicable requirements of §§
15.3.010 through
15.3.014.
      (4)   If the nonconforming building is in the floodway, the building is
permanently changed to conform to the applicable requirements of §§
15.3.023(A),
15.3.023(B)(2) through (B)(5),
15.3.023(C),
15.3.023(D), and
15.3.052. Any development that adds additional fill or creates an encroachment
in the floodplain from beyond the original nonconforming structure's 3-
D building envelope must determine the floodway in accordance with §
15.3.045. If the encroachment is in the floodway, it must meet the standards in
§
15.3.023(D).
      (5)   If the nonconforming building is in the floodfringe, the building
is permanently changed to conform to the applicable requirements of §§
15.3.033 and
15.3.053.
      (6)   Repair or reconstruction of nonconforming structures and
substantial improvements of residential buildings in zones Al-30, AE, and AH
must have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base
flood elevation.
      (7)   Repair or reconstruction of nonconforming structures and
substantial improvements of nonresidential buildings in zones A1-30, AE, and AH
must have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base
flood elevation, or (together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities)
be designed so that below the base flood elevation the building is watertight
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with
structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads
and effects of buoyancy:
         (a)   Where a non-residential structure is intended to be made
watertight below the base flood elevation, a registered professional engineer
or architect must develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and
plans for the construction, and must certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting
the provisions of division (D)(7) above.
         (b)   The community must maintain a record of such certification
including the specific elevation to which each such structure is floodproofed.
      (8)   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor of repair or
reconstruction of nonconforming structures and substantial improvements in
zones A1-30, AE, and AH that are usable solely for parking of vehicles,
building access, or storage, must be designed to adequately equalize
hydrostatic forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Subsequent improvements to repaired or reconstructed nonconforming
structures must not increase the degree of their nonconformity. Designs for
meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional
engineer or architect, or meet the following criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of 2 openings into each enclosed area must be located
below the base flood elevation and provide a total net area of not less than
one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area.
         (b)   The bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above
the adjacent grade.
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings if they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
      (9)   Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within
zones A1-30, AE, and AH outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, in
a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as
a result of flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the
lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation,
and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement;
      (10)   Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved
within zones Al-30, AE, and AH on existing sites in an existing manufactured
home park that is not undergoing expansion and on which a manufactured home has
not incurred substantial damage as a result of flood must be elevated so that
either the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood
elevation, or the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than
36 inches in height above grade, and be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement;
      (11)   Recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and
AE must either:
         (a)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or
         (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security
devices, and has no permanently attached additions); or
         (c)   Meet the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured
homes in division (D)(9) above.
      (12)   In a regulatory floodway that has been delineated on the FIRM in
zone A1-30 or AE, encroachments, including repair or reconstruction of
nonconforming structures, substantial improvement, or other development
(including fill) must be prohibited unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed encroachment will not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge. Subsequent improvements to repair or reconstructed
nonconforming structures must not increase the degree of their nonconformity.
      (13)   In zone A, the community must obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
state, or other source as criteria for requiring repair or reconstruction of
nonconforming structures, substantial improvement, and other development to
meet divisions (D)(6) through (12) (inclusive) above. Any development that adds
additional fill or creates an encroachment in the floodplain from beyond the
original nonconforming structure's 3-D building envelope must determine the
floodway in accordance with §
15.3.045. If the encroachment is in the floodway, it must meet the standards in
§
15.3.023(D). Subsequent improvements to repair or reconstructed nonconforming
structures must not increase the degree of their nonconformity.
      (14)   In zones A1-30 or AE where a regulatory floodway has not been
delineated on the FIRM, repair or reconstruction of nonconforming structures,
substantial improvement, or any development that adds additional fill or
creates an encroachment in the floodplain from beyond the original
nonconforming structure’s 3-D building envelope must determine the floodway in
accordance with §
15.3.045. If the encroachment is in the floodway, it must meet the standards in
§
15.3.023(D). Subsequent improvements to repair or reconstructed nonconforming
structures must not increase the degree of their nonconformity.
      (15)   In zone AO, repair or reconstruction of nonconforming structures
and substantial improvements of residential structures must have the lowest
floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least
as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM (at least 2 feet if
no depth number is specified). Subsequent improvements to repair or
reconstructed nonconforming structures must not increase the degree of their
nonconformity; or
      (16)   In zone AO, repair or reconstruction of nonconforming structures
and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures must have the lowest
floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least
as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM (at least 2 feet if
no depth number is specified), or (together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities) be structurally dry-floodproofed to that level according to the
standard specified in division (D)(7) above. Subsequent improvements to repair
or reconstructed nonconforming structures must not increase the degree of their
nonconformity.

standards in Ch. NR 116.07(3), Wis. Admin. Code, Hydrologic Analysis:
Determination of Regional Flood Discharge.
            2.    Hydraulic modeling. The regional flood elevation shall be
based on the standards in Ch. NR 116.07(4), Wis. Admin. Code, Hydraulic
Analysis: Determination of Regional Flood Elevation and the following:
               a.    Determination of the required limits of the hydraulic
model shall be based on detailed study information for downstream structures

               b.    Channel sections must be surveyed.
               c.    Minimum 4-foot contour data in the overbanks shall be used
for the development of cross section overbank and floodplain mapping.
               d.   A maximum distance of 500 feet between cross sections is
allowed in developed areas with additional intermediate cross sections
required at transitions in channel bottom slope including a survey of the
channel at each location.
               e.   The most current version of HEC-RAS shall be used.
               f.   A survey of bridge and culvert openings and the top of road
is required at each structure.
               g.    Additional cross sections are required at the downstream
and upstream limits of the proposed development and any necessary intermediate
locations based on the length of the reach if greater than 500 feet.
               h.    Standard accepted engineering practices shall be used when
assigning parameters for the base model such as flow, Manning's N values,
expansion and contraction coefficients or effective flow limits. The base model
shall be calibrated to past flooding data such as high-water marks to determine
the reasonableness of the model results. If no historical data is available,
adequate justification shall be provided for any parameters outside standard
accepted engineering practices.
               i.   The model must extend past the upstream limit of the
difference in the existing and proposed flood profiles in order to provide a
tie-in to existing studies. The height difference between the proposed flood
profile and the existing study profiles shall be no more than 0.00 feet.
            3.   Mapping. A work map of the reach studied shall be provided,
showing all cross-section locations, floodway/floodplain limits based on best
available topographic data, geographic limits of the proposed development and
whether the proposed development is located in the floodway.
               a.   If the proposed development is located outside of the
floodway, then it is determined to have no impact on the regional flood
elevation.
               b. If any part of the proposed development is in the floodway,
it must be added to the base model to show the difference between existing and
proposed conditions. The study must ensure that all coefficients remain the
same as in the existing model, unless adequate justification based on standard
accepted engineering practices is provided.
         (b)   Zone AE Floodplains.
            1.    Hydrology. If the proposed hydrology will change the existing
study, the appropriate method to be used shall be based on Ch. NR 116.07(3),
Wis. Admin. Code, Hydrologic Analysis: Determination of Regional Flood
Discharge.
            2.    Hydraulic model. The regional flood elevation shall be based
on the standards in Ch. NR 116.07(4), Wis. Admin. Code, Hydraulic Analysis:
Determination of Regional Flood Elevation and the following:
               a.    Duplicate Effective Model. The effective model shall be
reproduced to ensure correct transference of the model data and to allow
integration of the revised data to provide a continuous FIS model upstream and
downstream of the revised reach. If data from the effective model is available,
models shall be generated that duplicate the FIS profiles and the elevations
shown in the Floodway Data Table in the FIS report to within 0.1 foot.
               b.    Corrected Effective Model. The Corrected Effective Model
shall not include any man-made physical changes since the effective model date
but shall import the model into the most current version of HEC-RAS for
Department review.
               c.    Existing (Pre-Project Conditions) Model. The Existing
Model shall be required to support conclusions about the actual impacts of the
project associated with the Revised (Post-Project) Model or to establish more
up-to-date models on which to base the Revised (Post-Project) Model.
               d.    Revised (Post-Project Conditions) Model. The Revised
(Post-Project Conditions) Model shall incorporate the Existing Model and any
proposed changes to the topography caused by the proposed development. This
model shall reflect proposed conditions.
               e.   All changes to the Duplicate Effective Model and subsequent
models must be supported by certified topographic information, bridge plans,
construction plans and survey notes.
               f.    Changes to the hydraulic models shall be limited to the
stream reach for which the revision is being requested. Cross sections upstream
and downstream of the revised reach shall be identical to those in the
effective model and result in water surface elevations and top widths computed
by the revised models matching those in the effective models upstream and
downstream of the revised reach as required. The Effective Model shall not be
truncated.
            3.   Mapping. Maps and associated engineering data shall be
submitted to the Department for review which meet the following conditions:
               a.    Consistency between the revised hydraulic models, the
revised floodplain and floodway delineations, the revised flood profiles,
topographic work map, annotated FIRMs and/or Flood Boundary Floodway Maps
(FBFMs), construction plans, bridge plans.
               b.    Certified topographic map of suitable scale, contour
interval, and a planimetric map showing the applicable items. If a digital
version of the map is available, it may be submitted in order that the FIRM may
be more easily revised.
               c.    Annotated FIRM panel showing the revised 1% and 0.2%
annual chance floodplains and floodway boundaries.
               d.   If an annotated FIRM and/or FBFM and digital mapping data
(GIS or CADD) are used, then all supporting documentation or metadata must be
included with the data submission along with the Universal Transverse Mercator
(U TM) projection and State Plane Coordinate System in accordance with FEMA
mapping specifications.
               e.   The revised floodplain boundaries shall tie into the
effective floodplain boundaries.
               f.   All cross sections from the effective model shall be
labeled in accordance with the effective map and a cross section lookup table
shall be included to relate to the model input numbering scheme.
               g.    Both the current and proposed floodways shall be shown on
the map.
               h.   The stream centerline, or profile baseline used to measure
stream distances in the model shall be visible on the map.
      (4)   Expiration. All permits issued under the authority of this chapter
shall expire no more than 180 days after issuance. The permit may be extended
for a maximum of 180 days for good and sufficient cause. If the permitted work
has not started within 180 days of the permit date, the development must comply
with any regulation, including any revision to the FIRM or FIS, that took
effect after the permit date.
   (C)   Certificate of compliance.  No land shall be occupied or used, and no
building which is hereafter constructed, altered, added to, modified, repaired,
rebuilt or replaced shall be occupied until a certificate of compliance is
issued by the Zoning Administrator, except where no permit is required, subject
to the following provisions:
      (1)   The certificate of compliance shall show that the building or
premises or part thereof, and the proposed use, conform to the provisions of
this chapter;
      (2)   Application for such certificate shall be concurrent with the
application for a permit;
      (3)   If all ordinance provisions are met, the certificate of compliance
shall be issued within 10 days
after written notification that the permitted work is completed; and
      (4)   The applicant shall submit a certification signed by a registered
professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor that the fill, lowest floor
and floodproofmg elevations are in compliance with the permit issued.
Floodproofing measures also require certification by a registered professional
engineer or registered professional engineer or architect that the requirements
of §
15.3.065 are met.
      (5)   Where applicable pursuant to §
15.3.044, the applicant must submit a certification by a registered
professional engineer or surveyor of the elevation of the bottom of the lowest
horizontal structural member supporting the lowest floor (excluding pilings or
columns), and an indication of whether the structure contains a basement.

   (A)   Applicability. Any division of lot, parcel or tract of land into 2 or
more parcels or building sites, other than subdivisions defined and regulated
in this section, shall be subject to the provisions of this section. However,
any such division which creates parcels or building sites greater than 5 acres,
and which does not include any new public streets or other public ways may be
exempted from these provisions by the Plan Commission.
   (B)   Scope. If the Plan Commission finds that the application of the
provisions of this section to a particular subdivision might create an
unreasonable hardship or involve peculiar difficulties, including but not
limited to prohibitive cost due to lack of reference corners, the Plan
Commission may waive the requirements contained herein. However, no such waiver
shall be granted for divisions containing lots which do not comply with the
provisions of this section.
   (C)   Procedures for approval.
      (1)   The divider shall file a certified survey map with the City Planner
who shall within 45 days approve, approve conditionally or reject the certified
survey map. The City Planner may present the certified survey map to the Plan
Commission for their approval should any extraordinary conditions or
conflicting situation(s) with the Code be evident with the certified survey
map. The divider shall be notified in writing of any conditions of approval or
the reasons for rejection.
      (2)   A written application containing information on the reason for the
survey and all pertinent facts thereto shall accompany the map.
   (D)   Requirements.
      (1)   To the extent reasonably practicable, the division of land shall
comply with the provisions of this section governing general requirements,
design standards, and required improvements.
      (2)   The certified survey shall be performed and the map prepared by a
professional land surveyor registered to practice in the State of Wisconsin.

of 5 copies shall be provided to the Clerk's office.
   (F)   Variations and exceptions. Where the Plan Commission finds that
extraordinary hardships or particular difficulties may result from strict
compliance with these regulations, it may recommend to the Common Council
variations or exceptions to the regulations so that substantial justice may be
done and the public interest secured, provided that such variation or exception
shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter,
and further provided the Plan Commission shall not recommend variations or
exceptions to the regulations of this code unless it shall make findings based
upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
      (1)   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located.
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variation is sought and are not
applicable, generally to other property.
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations were carried out.

§ 15.4.15 CONSTRUCTION ALTERNATIVES.
   (A)   Before the final plat is approved by the Common Council the divider
shall submit a public utility construction plan, a construction estimate, a
construction agreement and performance bond or some other similar surety
acceptable to the City equal to 100% of the engineer's estimated cost of the
required improvements or cash escrow agreement or other surety to assure the
following:
      (1)   Completion of the required public improvements within a two year
period.
      (2)   Payment by the subdivider for all costs incurred by the City for
review and inspection. This will include the preparation and review, plans and
specifications by the City Planner and Attorney as well as other costs of
similar nature.
      (3)   If the required improvements are not completed within the two year
period, all amounts held under the escrow agreement or performance bond shall
be turned over and delivered to the City and applied to the cost of the
required improvements. Any balance remaining after such improvements have been
made shall be returned to the owner or the subdivider. At its option, the
Common Council may extend the bond period for an additional period not to
exceed two years.
   (B)   The developer may elect to have these improvements constructed in one
of the two following ways:
      (1)   The developer may construct the improvements through his own
financing and construction. In this case the developer will prepare utility
plans with construction estimates, which shall be submitted to the City for
review and approval prior to construction. The construction shall be inspected
as determined by the City to see that it is in compliance with the City's
construction design requirements. Upon completion of these improvements, they
shall be accepted by the City when found to be in conformity with City
standards as determined by the Director of Public Works.
      (2)   The developer may elect to request the City to construct the
improvements under the City's Capital Improvement Program. In this case the
City will design and construct the improvements under the next Public Works
Program that it can be included in. The City will bill the developer for the
design and the developer's share of these improvements as per §
15.4.16 of this chapter. Should the developer elect to have the City make the
improvements, such request shall be made prior to but in no event later than
October 1 of the year preceding construction.
(Ord. 559, passed 6-8-88)
§ 15.4.16 FINANCING METHODS.
   The subdivider can finance his share of the public improvements defined
above by either of the following 2 methods:
   (A)   By requesting the City to finance these improvements under Wisconsin
Statutes § 66.0703 pertaining to special assessments. This statute shall be
subject to the following restrictions:
      (1)   The assessments shall be applied on an equal basis to all
developable lots.
      (2)   Lots that are not intended for improvement or development shall not
be assessed improvement costs.
      (3)   Should the developer request the City to proceed under Wisconsin
Statutes § 66.0703, the interest rate charged the developer shall be one-half
of one percent (0.5%) above the rate the City pays for funds pertaining to said
project.
   (B)   The developer may proceed to finance this project through his own
private finances. In this case the City will reimburse the developer for its
share of the actual costs of construction of the improvements as they are made
upon presentation of a bill to the City.
(Ord. 559, passed 6-8-88)
§ 15.4.17 OTHER FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS.
   (A)   The City will proceed under the special assessment methods of
Wisconsin Statutes § 66.0703 for financing only for projects involving 1 block
in distance as defined previously in this code. The Council may waive this
requirement upon the presentation of specific circumstances which preclude the
development to proceed in at least 1 block units.
   (B)   Should the developer pursue financing through Wisconsin Statutes §
66.0703 (repayment in 10 equal installments) the remaining special assessment
against any lot plus accrued interest shall be payable upon the sale of such
lot.
(Ord. 559, passed 6-8-88)
§ 15.4.18 ENFORCEMENT.
   The Zoning Administrator shall have primary responsibility for enforcing the
code. No building permit shall be issued for construction on any lot until the
final plat for the subdivision has been duly recorded, or a certified survey
map is recorded.

§ 15.5.15 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose and intent of these requirements is to assemble the minimum
parking area requirements into one publication which is easy to administer. The
requirements include requirements on the minimum number of required spaces,
size and layout of parking areas, handicap parking requirements, and
landscaping. The landscaping requirements have been reduced to a single
worksheet which the Zoning Administrator may use in assisting applicants in
achieving compliance. The worksheet is attached to Ordinance 586 as Appendix

         (b)   At least 2% of all spaces for a facility offering 50 to 1,000
spaces;
         (c)   At least an additional 1% of each 1,000 spaces over the first
1,000.
      (2)   The owner or lessee of a parking facility which is ancillary to a
residential building and restricted wholly or in part to use by tenants of the
building shall, at the request of a physically disabled tenant, reserve a
parking space in the facility for use by a motor vehicle used by the physically
disabled tenant.
   (B)   Stall size and location. Handicapped stalls shall be at least 12 feet
wide and located as close as possible to an entrance which allows a physically
disabled person to enter and leave the principal building or use area.
   (C)   Handicapped parking signs.
      (1)   All required handicapped parking spaces shall be posted with signs
as follows:
         (a)   Handicapped parking signs shall consist of a white rectangle
with longer dimension vertical, having green message, a green arrow, if
required under this section, and a blue and white international symbol for
barrier-free environments. The sign shall be reflective.
         (b)   The sign shall include the words "reserve parking" and the words
"vehicles with VET or DIS plates or state disabled card" or other words with a
similar meaning.
         (c)   The size of the sign shall be not less than 12 inches by 18
inches.
         (d)   A right arrow, left arrow or words "This Space" or similar
wording shall be included near the bottom of the sign.
         (e)   Each sign shall be erected on an adequate support. The vertical
distance from the parking lot surface to the bottom of a sign shall be not less
than 4 feet. A single sign with the message "This Space" or similar wording
shall be used to designate a single reserved space. At least 2 signs are
required for multiple reserved spaces. When 2 signs are used they shall be
located at the outermost limits of the spaces reserved and, by arrow, designate
the location of the reserved spaces. A sign shall be located at the end of an
angled or right-angled space and shall be set to face a motorist entering the
space.
         (f)   Signs which are in place prior to the effective date of these
standards and specifications may remain in place and have the same effect as
the signs described herein for 5 years after the effective date provided that
they include the international symbol for barrier-free environments and the

§ 15.5.24 MINIMUM LANDSCAPING STANDARDS.
   All open off-street parking areas for 4 or more vehicles will require
landscaping. The standards herein are designated to provide flexibility in
meeting the landscape requirement. Applicants can establish a landscape design
which most effectively achieves the desired aesthetic results, and is
consistent with the need of providing readily accessible and visible parking.
   (A)   Landscaping objectives.
      (1)   The objectives of the landscape standards are to recognize both the
functional importance of parking areas and the public benefits associated with
well-designed landscaped areas which enhance the visual environment, promote
public safety, moderate the microclimate and reduce nuisances, such as noise
and glare.
      (2)   The overall intent of the landscape standards is to soften the
visual and other sensory impacts. This can be achieved through the use of large
canopy trees and well-designed clustered plantings; as opposed to the
requirement of screening the entire perimeter with a hedge or fence.
   (B)   Minimum canopy tree and parking space requirements.
      (1)   All off-street vehicular parking areas with more than 6 vehicles
shall provide and maintain 1 canopy-type tree for each 12 parking spaces, or
fraction thereof, over the initial 6 spaces. Canopy trees shall be located in
tree islands, or within 10 feet of the periphery of the parking area surface.
The preservation of desirable existing trees is encouraged. Existing mature
trees which are a minimum of 2"-2½" caliper and are within the distance
requirements may be applied toward the canopy standard. All newly planted
canopy trees must also have a minimum of 2"-2½" caliper.
      (2)   Parking spaces must be broken by a tree island at the rate of 1
tree island for each linear row of 12 parking spaces, for single row
configurations, or for each 24 parking spaces in double row configurations.
      (3)   Schedule for canopy trees standards.

   (C)   Screening standards for parking areas near residential zoned parcels.
      (1)   In the following situations there shall be a screening barrier for
the purpose of obstructing light beams and muffling noise:
         (a)   Where an off-street parking area for 4 or more vehicles abuts
within 25 feet of an adjoining lot line in an "R-Residential" Zoning District
(R-1, R-2 or R-3).
         (b)   Where an off-street parking for 4 or more vehicles is located in
a manner where nearby residentially zoned properties would be affected by
headlight glare (i.e., directly across a public right-of-way).
      (2)   The effective height of the barrier shall be a minimum of 3½' above
the surface of the parking area. Such a barrier may consist of wood or masonry
fencing, walls, berming, or the use of plant material. Where plant materials
are used for screening, they shall be of suitable size and density to
accomplish the screening objective within 3 years from the time of planting.
   (D)   Minimum landscape element standards and point scoring system.
      (1)   In addition to the requirements for canopy trees and residential
screening, all parking areas shall be required to accumulate a minimum number
of points. The number of points required is based on the number of parking
spaces. Parking areas for 4 or more vehicles are required to accumulate 15
points for each space.
      (2)   To qualify for points, the landscape elements must be located in a
manner which primarily meet the objectives of landscaping parking areas. The
criteria used to determine which landscape elements qualify are: (a) perimeters
adjacent to public rights-of-way; (b) interior areas and immediate perimeters
to the parking area; and (c) perimeter of lots adjacent to other property.
Landscaping which primarily serves the aesthetic enhancement of the building
and related open areas will qualify for 50% of the accumulation of points.
Points are tabulated in the following manner:
POINT SCHEDULE FOR LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS
Landscape Element Min. Planted Size Points
POINT SCHEDULE FOR LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS
Landscape Element                    Min. Planted Size                   Points
Canopy trees                         2-2½" or 1-1½" for multi-stem tree50
Canopy trees                         1½-2" or 8-10 ft.                  30
Evergreen trees                      4 ft.                               30

Medium shrubs                        18-36"                              6
Low shrubs                           15-24"                              3
Walls, decorative fences, earth
berms, ground covers and shrubs with                                     0
a mature height of less than 2 ft.
 
      (3)   (a)    Trees used to meet the canopy standard and landscape
materials used to meet the screening of abutting and residentially zoned
property may not be applied toward the minimum landscape element standards.
         (b)   To qualify for the points indicated, trees and shrubs shall be
of good nursery stock and not less than the minimum required planting size.
         (c)   The following publication will be used to determine which plants
are "low-ornamental trees" and "tall/medium/low shrubs": A Guide to Selecting
Landscape Plants for Wisconsin. E.R. Hasselkus, UW-Extension Publication A2865.
         (d)   The planting plan list shall include the size of the material to
be planted. All landscape plants shall be delineated on the landscape plan and
include the crown width the plant will achieve 5 years after plan
implementation.
         (e)   The applicant may request points for decorative fence, earth
berms, ground covers, existing vegetation and shrubs of the mature height of
not less than 2 feet. It must be demonstrated by the applicant that these
landscape elements will contribute to the overall landscape objectives. The
number of points credited will be negotiated with the Zoning Administrator and
subject to review by the Plan Commission.
   (E)   Minimum dimensions for tree islands and planted areas.
      (1)   All tree islands and landscaped areas with trees shall be a minimum
of 4 feet as measured from the inside of any curb or frame.
      (2)   All landscape areas without trees, but planted with shrubs, shall
have a minimum width of 3 feet measured from inside the curb or frame.
   (F)   Unsuitable species. Several shrubs and trees, which are not native to
Wisconsin, have an established history of spreading to nearby parks and
conservancy areas. These non-native plants tend to become overly abundant and
ultimately eliminate many desirable native species. The control and eradication
of these unsuitable plants create a costly management problem. The following
species of plant material are unsuitable for use as landscape plants:
      (1)   Honeysuckle: lonicera x-bella, lonicera marrawi and lonicera
tartarica.
      (2)   Buckthorn (common): rhamnus cathartica and rhamnus frangula (tall
hedge).
      (3)   Norway maple: acer negcindo.

§ 15.5.25 ADJUSTMENTS TO PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Adjustments in the minimum of spaces may be authorized by the Plan
Commission where the applicant can document shared facilities arrangements with
neighboring uses or where there are documented shared-ride or carpooling
programs. The documentation for the joint use of shared parking facilities must
be in the form of an easement or contract between property owners specifying
the number of shared parking spaces and the terms and conditions of the joint
usage of parking areas and access.
   (B)   The Plan Commission may authorize stalls sized for smaller vehicles
(8' x 16') where the number of stalls being provided exceeds the minimum number
required and where all of the minimum required stalls are full sized (9' x
18').
   (C)   The Plan Commission may authorize adjustments to the requirements
where literal compliance with the specifications and standards would make the
parking lot landscaping ineffective or unnecessary. Topographic constraints,
existing vegetation, traffic safety, or compliance with fire or other public
safety requirements may necessitate adjustments. The applicant should be
prepared to respond to the following criteria in requesting an adjustment:
      (1)   The specific conditions which are unique to the applicant's land
and do not exist on other land.
      (2)   The manner in which the strict application of the standards would
deprive the applicant of a reasonable use of the land in the manner equivalent
to the use permitted other landowners.
      (3)   Reasons that an adjustment to the standard would preserve, not
harm, the public safety and welfare and will not alter the essential character
of the area.
   (D)   Landscape standards for industrial areas.
      (1)   Introduction. The adopted City landscape for parking areas are
intended to achieve desired aesthetic and environmental results from both
within the interior and along the perimeter of parking areas. This is
accomplished, in part, by applying the canopy tree, tree island and a minimum
point schedule of 15 points for each parking space. The application of
requirements provides a pleasing landscape transition between structures and
the necessary parking facility. In addition, the landscape standards provide
acceptable levels of community appearance for parking areas which are viewed
from adjacent streets, public recreation areas and residentially-zoned lands.
The intent, however, is to provide landscape parking areas which are planned
and designed to blend with the overall desired community appearance. The
standard requirements do not attempt to fully screen or hide parking areas.
      (2)   Variance for industrial parking. Applicants proposing industrial
parking lots other than for designated visitor parking may propose a landscape
option of effectively screening parking lots from off-site view. This variance
would not require compliance of the canopy tree, tree island and minimum point
schedule requirements. However, the proposed parking lot must conform to the
landscape standard of full screening of the parking lot from public right-of-
ways, public recreation sites and residentially-zoned lands.
      (3)   Minimum industrial screening standard.
         (a)   The proposed plan must satisfy the following conditions:
            1.   Effectively screen the parking area from views from public
right-of-ways, public recreation sites and residentially-zoned lands.
            2.   Comply with the landscape requirements included under standard
application (§
15.5.17), checklist (§
15.5.19), minimum dimensions (§
15.5.24(E)) and species limitations (§
15.5.24(F)).
            3.   Where plant materials are used for barrier screening, they
must be of suitable size and density to accomplish the screening objective in
the leaf-on season and within 5 growing seasons.
            4.   The effective height of the screen shall be not less than 4
feet.
            5.   Designated visitor parking areas and major entry drives are
not included in this variance.
            6.   The screening area plan shall be subject to design review by
City staff to determine the functional conditions of the screen and the
aesthetic appearance of the proposal. Designs should strive for some level of
diversity in utilizing landscape elements. This may include some combination of
trees and shrubs, fence and landscape berms. The design review still includes
an equal expectation of functional screening and a design which provides a
visually-pleasing character to the parking perimeter.
            7.   Plans for parking areas shall include a description of snow
removal methods and indicate snow storage areas. This shall be done in
sufficient detail to demonstrate required plant screening will not be killed or
harmed.
         (b)   Applicants may find it useful to submit a preliminary proposal
to determine the specific areas requiring screening. The specific proposal will
provide the detail of contractual plans.

§ 15.7.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wisconsin Statutes
§§ 62.23, 62.233 and 87.30.
(Ord. 1001, passed 7-21-15)
§ 15.7.002 FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
   Uncontrolled use of shorelands and pollution of the navigable waters of the
municipality would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience, and
general welfare and impair the tax base. The Legislature of Wisconsin has
delegated responsibility to all municipalities to:
   (A)   Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare;
   (B)   Limit certain land use activities detrimental to shorelands;
   (C)   Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by controlling the location of
structures in shoreland areas and restricting the removal of natural shoreland
vegetation;
   (D)   Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life and wildlife
by preserving wetlands and other aquatic habitat;
   (E)   Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; and
   (F)   Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of
natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland wetland excavation, filling
and other earth-moving activities.
(Ord. 1001, passed 7-21-15)
§ 15.7.003 (RESERVED).
§ 15.7.004 COMPLIANCE.
   The use of shorelands within the shoreland area of the municipality shall be
in full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable local,
state or federal regulations. All permitted development shall require the
issuance of a zoning permit unless otherwise expressly excluded by a provision
of this chapter.
(Ord. 1001, passed 7-21-15)
§ 15.7.005 MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE AGENCIES REGULATED.
   Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and
counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary
permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wisconsin Statutes § 13.48
(13) applies.
(Ord. 1001, passed 7-21-15)
§ 15.7.006 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   (A)   This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any other applicable
municipal ordinance except that where another municipal ordinance is more
restrictive than this chapter, that ordinance shall continue in full force and
effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
   (B)   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this chapter
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
(Ord. 1001, passed 7-21-15)
§ 15.7.007 INTERPRETATION.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter
shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in
favor of the municipality, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of
any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes or Wisconsin Constitution.
If a chapter provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light
of the Wisconsin Administrative Code Chapter NR 117 standards in effect on the
date of the adoption of this chapter or the most recent text amendment to this
chapter.
(Ord. 1001, passed 7-21-15)
§ 15.7.008 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any portion of this chapter be declared invalid or unconstitutional
by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not
be affected.
(Ord. 1001, passed 7-21-15)

existing county floodplain zoning maps shall be used to delineate floodplain
areas.
   (C)   Determinations of navigability and ordinary high- water mark location
shall initially be made by the Zoning Administrator. When questions arise, the
Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for a final determination of
navigability or ordinary high- water mark.
   (D)   Pursuant to Wisconsin Statutes §§ 61.353(7) or 62.233, the Shoreland
Zoning District does not include lands adjacent to an artificially constructed
drainage ditch, pond, or retention basin, if the drainage ditch, pond or
retention basin is not hydrologically connected to a natural navigable water
body.
(Ord. 1001, passed 7-21-15)
§ 15.7.012 EFFECT OF EXISTING LAND DIVISION, SANITARY, ZONING AND OTHER
REGULATIONS.
   The lands within the Shoreland Zoning District are subject to all applicable
provisions of the City of Medford Zoning Code. Where the provisions of this
chapter are more restrictive than other regulations in the Zoning Code, the
provisions of this chapter shall apply.
(Ord. 1001, passed 7-21-15)
§ 15.7.013 SETBACKS FROM THE WATER.
   Shoreland setback. Areas within shorelands, as defined by this chapter,
shall be subject to the following:
   (A)   A shoreland that was annexed by the City after May 7, 1982, and prior

additional provisions:
      (1)   A shoreland setback area of at least 50 feet from the ordinary
high-water mark, except as provided in division (A)(2) below.
      (2)   Construction or placement of a principal building within the
shoreland setback area established under division (A)(1) above shall be allowed

parcel of land that is immediately adjacent on each side to a lot or parcel of
land containing a principal building;
         (b)   The principal building is constructed or placed within a
distance equal to the average setback of the principal building on the adjacent
lots, or 35 feet from the ordinary highwater mark, whichever distance is
greater.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, a PRINCIPAL STRUCTURE means the main
building or structure on a single lot or parcel of land, and includes any
attached garage or attached porch. Accessory structures, such as boathouses,
detached garages, patios or decks, do not have to comply with the 50-foot
setback, but shall not be placed within the vegetative buffer zone, unless it
is placed in the viewing and access corridor established under § 17.08(3)(g)(l)
(b).
   (C)   Sections 17.08(3)(g) and 17.08(3)(h) do not apply to lands adjacent to

equipment not meeting or allegedly not meeting acceptable pollution control
standards, or which are to be supplemented or replaced by other pollution
control facilities.
   NAVIGABLE WATERS. Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, all natural inland lakes
within Wisconsin, and all streams, ponds, sloughs, flowages and other waters

or administrative rule  promulgated thereunder, shoreland codes required under
Wisconsin Statutes §§ 61.351 or 62.231 and chapter NR 117, Wis. Adm. Code, do
not apply to lands adjacent to farm drainage ditches if:

support navigation by a recreational craft of the shallowest draft on an
annually recurring basis [Muench v. Public Service Commission, 261 Wis. 492
(1952) and DeGaynor and Co., Inc., v. Department of Natural Resources, 70 Wis.
2d 936 (1975)]. For example, a stream which is navigable by skiff or canoe
during normal spring high water is navigable, in fact, under the laws of this
state though it may be dry during other seasons.
   ORDINARY HIGH-WATER MARK. The point on the bank or shore up to which the
presence and action of surface water is so continuous as to leave a distinctive
mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial vegetation,
predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized characteristic.
   PLANNING AGENCY. The municipal plan commission created under Wisconsin
Statutes § 62.23(1), a board of public land commissioners or a committee of the
municipality’s governing body which acts on matters pertaining to planning and

      (2)   Lands within the following distances from the ordinary high-water
mark of navigable waters: 1,000 feet from a lake, pond or flowage; and 300 feet
from a river or stream, or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever
distance is greater.
   WETLAND ALTERATION. Any filling, flooding, draining, dredging, ditching,
tiling, excavating, temporary water level stabilization measures or dike and
dam construction in a wetland area.
   WETLANDS. Those areas where water is at, near or above the land surface long
enough to support aquatic or hydrophytic vegetation, and which have soils
indicative of wet conditions.

CITY RECORDS
   I.   Costs of Locating Documents.
         Most of the City’s records are readily available or can be located in
a relatively short period of time. There will be no fee imposed for locating a
record upon any person who requests a record if the costs of locating the
record does not exceed $50.00.
         In those cases where a record is not readily available for whatever
reason and where it appears that the costs of locating a record will exceed
$50.00, the official legal custodians will seek the prior written approval of
the requester before proceeding. In addition, the custodians will endeavor, but
will not be required, to provide an estimate of the total anticipated costs for
locating the record.
         The City will determine the cost of locating a record by using the
current hourly rate for employees involved in attempting to locate the record.
   II.   Reproduction Expenses.
      1.   Costs of copying and reproduction of records where equipment is
available.
         A.   $.25 per page for black and white copies.
         B.   Additional charge for colored copies.
         C.   There will be no cost charged for clerical employees’ time in
photocopying fewer than 10 copies.
         D.   If more than 11 pages are to be copied, an hourly charge of
$40.00/hour shall be paid in advance by the person making the request on a 1/
4 hourly basis.
         E.   If a requester requests a record which is not a document subject
to normal copying (e.g., audio tape, video tape, computer disc, G.I.S. maps,
etc.), the requester will be charged an hourly charge of $40.00/hour beyond the
first 15 minutes, to be paid in advance, for time expended by City staff in
duplicating/reproducing the record.
      2.   Costs of reproduction of records where equipment is not available
within the City.
         A.   If equipment necessary for any reproduction is not available
within the City, the City may rent whatever equipment is necessary to perform
the function and will bill the requester for such rental fee. The cost charged
will be the actual costs paid by the City to the third party vendor. Items in
such a situation would include, but would not be limited to, rental charges for
audio or video tape reproduction equipment, microfilm or fiche or ultra fiche
reproduction equipment, assorted computer hardware and software.
         B.   At its option, the City may use an outside vendor to reproduce/
duplicate the record. The requester is then charged the actual cost for this
service, including any incidental charges such as mailing or delivery charges.
   III.   Disputes.
      1.   The official legal custodians of the records of the City shall
report any disputes which arise under this fee schedule to the Common Council
and shall recommend such modifications and revisions as they deem necessary.
   IV.   Payment of Fees.
      1.   The official legal custodians of the records of the City may require
the payment of costs provided herein in advance, if exceeding $5.00.

+ ((N x .00834) x CN) + ((P x .00834) x Cp)
            T = Total Sewer Service Charge
            FQ = Fixed Quarterly Charge
            B = B.O.D. concentration in mg/l in wastewater above 290 m/l
            S = TSS concentration of suspended solids in mg/l in wastewater
above 340 mg/l
            N = Nitrogen concentration in mg/l in wastewater above 35 mg/l
            P = Phosphorus concentration in mg/l in wastewater above 7 mg/l
            V = Wastewater volume in 1,000 gallons
            CV = Cost per 1,000 gallons
            CB = Cost per pound of B.O.D.
            CS = Cost per pound of suspended solids
            CN = Cost per pound of nitrogen
            Cp = Cost per pound of phosphorus
            .00834 = Conversion Factor
         The above formula shall not be construed to give credits for a waste
strength less than domestic concentrations for B.O.D., suspended solids,
nitrogen, or phosphorus.
